The Duck In The Bottle December 18 , 2006
Posted by Kedar in brahma
A group of people went to meet a Zen teacher while he was walking in a park .
“ We want to know about Zen .
Please tells us about it . ”
The most enthusiastic one asked .
The teacher said , “ Let me tell you a story . ”
“ I had a small duckling .
I kept it in a bottle .
I fed it and kept the bottle clean and took good care of it .
The duck grew and grew .
One day I realized that the duck has grown too big and I cannot get it out unless I hurt it seriously or break the bottle .
So now what should I do if I want to get the duck out , but I still want the bottle intact ? ”
People started scratching their heads and talking to each other .
Time went by .
Once in a while somebody would come up with a solution .
Teacher would smile and show his disagreement .
After a while teacher called a small girl playing nearby and asked her the same question .
“ Just break the bottle . ”
The girl replied without hesitation .
The teacher nodded in agreement and patted her on back .
He smiled at the bunch of perplexed faces in front of him and walked away .
I know what you are all thinking .
You are wondering if I am suggesting the girl ’s answer is the correct one .
If I am , then you are ready to pound on me saying “ But the teacher clearly said he does not want to break the bottle . ”
The girl ’s answer is perhaps not correct by definition .
Yet she sees something the group of grown - ups fails to see .
She sees that it is impossible .
It is impossible to save the duck and save the bottle as well .
Yes , people can come up with solutions .
Perhaps a machines can be invented to expand the bottle and get the duck safely out , or to tele - transport the duck the way they show in Star trek , or perhaps surgical procedures can be performed that would cut the duck to pieces inside the bottle and join all the limbs again when out .
Yet , we would do a lot of damage by the time we achieve that .
To invent such a machine and test it , money worth a lot of bottles would be spent .
To come up with perfect surgical procedures , a lot of ducks will have to die in experiments .
Usually that ’s how we tend to solve problems in our daily life .
We isolate the problem from rest of the universe and solve the problem , making a lot of assumptions about the rest of the world .
Can you save both the duck and the bottle by going to extreme means ?
Yes .
Are you really living in better universe after that feat of achievement ?
Most likely not .
The little girl , who was not yet conditioned by civilization , immediately saw futility of this conquest .
She did not convert it in an intellectual challenge .
She felt compassion even for the fictional duck .
She did not mind ignoring the instructions and risking to look foolish .
Her problem is very clear and solution very simple .
If the duck is stuck , break the bottle and get it out .
The truth here is that conflict is inherent to life .
We go on telling ourselves that if there is a conflict , then there is something wrong , something needs to be improved , optimized , changed .
For example , healthy food usually does not taste good .
Tasty food is mostly bad for health .
So there is a conflict .
Food that is healthy as well as tasty will cost you a lot more , thus conflicting somewhere else .
Chase one conflict out , and the other one sneaks in .
We treat these conflicts as aberrations or mistakes .
We believe in existence of a physical and mental state eternally free of all conflicts and we continuously strive for such a state .
The truth is , it is impossible to achieve such a state of mind and body by pursuit of material goals .
This is the lesson 101 of Zen Buddhism and overall oriental philosophy .
Disillusion of material goals .
Rather than shunning these conflicts and trying to impose order on life , ancient Eastern philosophers tend to honor them by calling it the game of Bramha and Maya , or the dance of Yin and Yang .
They tend to view the world as the continuous and endless play between two forces , eternally at conflict with each other .
Sometimes the duck wins , sometimes the bottle .
Sometimes it ’s Bramha , sometimes Maya .
There is no purpose , there is no end .
This Yin vs .
Yang struggle is present in our life as short term goals vs. long term goals , emotions vs. logic , ideology vs. practicality , aggression vs. defense , hate vs. love .
Sometimes we swing this way , sometimes that way .
That swinging is us , not the swing .
The motion is us , not the pendulum .
Initially it might sound depressing .
What ’s the point in such a broken life if we can not fix it ?
But once we let it sink in , we find a huge sense of liberation .
Suddenly it is not necessary to fix things before you enjoy them .
Fix it if you like fixing .
Enjoy it if you like enjoying .
Once we get it , we stop subordinating this present moment for that fictitious moment of fulfillment in future .
We begin honoring the present for what it is .
We stop life as an exercise in managing consequences and we start life as spontaneous expression .
We stop seeing ourselves as a player .
Instead we see ourselves as the game , the motion itself .
We stop living in fiction , we start living in reality .
Because Destination is a fiction , only journey is a reality .
( CNN ) -- President Obama rallied U.S. troops and pledged continued partnership with Afghanistan during a previously unannounced trip to the country Sunday .
Speaking to about 2,000 U.S. and allied troops at the major U.S. base in Afghanistan , Obama said , " Those folks back home are relying on you . "
" I know it 's not easy , " he said .
" You 're far away from home .
You miss your kids , you miss your spouses , your family , your friends . "
But he added , " If I thought for a minute that America 's vital interests were not served , were not at stake here in Afghanistan , I would order all of you home right away . "
Earlier , Obama met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai at the Presidential Palace to discuss progress by the Afghan government in strengthening its ability to run the country and provide security for its people .
After the 30 - minute meeting , Obama said he wanted to send a strong message that the partnership between the nations would continue .
Obama also invited Karzai to Washington , and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the planned date for that visit is May 12 .
Karzai said he wanted to " express the gratitude of our people for the help that America has given us for the last eight years , " and he specifically thanked U.S. taxpayers for their aid in helping rebuild his country .

However , Obama made clear that his main reason for the trip was to visit with some of the roughly 80,000 U.S. troops stationed in the country .
After changing from a suit to an Air Force
One flight jacket , Obama told the troops they were making progress against al Qaeda and its allies in the Taliban , the Islamic fundamentalist militia that ruled most of Afghanistan before the 9/11 attacks .
" All of that makes America safer , and we are going to keep them on the run , " he said .
" Because that is what is going to be required in order to ensure that our families back home have the security that they need . "
To cheers from the combined joint task force that includes troops from all four services , Obama said : " The United States of America does not quit once it starts on something .
...
We keep at it .
We persevere .
And together , with our partners , we will prevail .
I am absolutely confident of that . "
Following his speech to the troops , Obama met with U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry and Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the commander of allied troops in Afghanistan , before his scheduled departure for the flight home .
Obama 's trip began in secrecy , with the president leaving his Camp David retreat .
He flew to Afghanistan on Air Force One , landing at Bagram Air Base at 7:24 p.m. ( around 11 a.m. ET ) .
Obama then flew on a helicopter to the Presidential Palace to meet with Karzai .
The two presidents took part in a 10 - minute arrival ceremony before walking into the palace for their meeting .
U.S. officials said the two leaders planned to first meet along with key aides , and then bring in Karzai 's cabinet .
In a briefing with pool reporters on the trip , National Security Adviser James Jones said Obama would push Karzai to improve efforts to meet benchmarks for better governance in his second term , which began last year .
According to Jones , Obama planned to point out that certain issues such as a merit - based system for appointing key government officials , battling corruption and taking on narcotics trafficking that helps fund insurgents needed more attention .
" We have to have the strategic rapport with President Karzai and his Cabinet to understand how we are going to succeed this year in reversing the momentum the Taliban and the opposition forces have been able to establish since 2006 , " Jones said .
A senior administration official said Obama told Karzai that some progress had been made , particularly involving local governance , establishing more credible national institutions and battling corruption .
The senior official characterized the meeting as very productive and businesslike .

The trip came after what has been perhaps the most successful week of Obama 's presidency , in which he signed comprehensive health care legislation -- his top domestic priority -- into law and announced plans to sign a new nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia on April 8 .
Gibbs said Afghan authorities were notified of Obama 's trip on Thursday .
The president previously postponed a trip to Indonesia and Australia planned for March 21 - 26 in order to see through passage of the health care bill .
Since taking office , Obama ordered the deployment of an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan while also saying he intended for combat forces to start coming home in July 2011 .
U.S. officials said Sunday there were nearly 80,000 U.S. troops now on the ground in Afghanistan , and the surge announced by Obama would increase the total to 98,000 once fully implemented by the end of the year .
Roughly 10,000 of the 30,000 surge troops were in place now , officials said .
In addition , NATO partners have more than 40,000 troops in Afghanistan , according to the officials .
Karzai has said that by the end of 2010 , Afghan security forces will be able to take over some security responsibilities from international forces .
By the end of his second term in 2014 , Karzai has said he would like his government to have full responsibility for security .
Karzai emerged victorious from August presidential elections that were marred by widespread fraud .
Two months after the vote , a U.N. - backed panel of election monitors threw out nearly a third of Karzai 's votes , citing fraud .
Left short of a majority , Karzai agreed to a runoff with challenger Abdullah Abdullah , but Abdullah withdrew just before the runoff vote .
The trip is Obama 's second to Afghanistan .
He first traveled there in 2008 , four months before his victory in the election that made him president .
On that visit , part of a broader trip to the Middle East , Obama traveled to eastern Afghanistan to meet with U.S. forces and also met with Karzai .
Democracy
A Campaign Begins Today [ Mitt Romney ]
America has just witnessed an unconscionable abuse of power .
President Obama has betrayed his oath to the nation — rather than bringing us together , ushering in a new kind of politics , and rising above raw partisanship , he has succumbed to the lowest denominator of incumbent power : justifying the means by extolling the ends .
He promised better ; we deserved better .
He calls his accomplishment “ historic ” — in this he is correct , although not for the reason he intends .
Rather , it is an historic usurpation of the legislative process — he unleashed the nuclear option , enlisted not a single Republican vote in either chamber , bribed reluctant members of his own party , paid - off his union backers , scapegoated insurers , and justified his act with patently fraudulent accounting .
What Barack Obama has ushered into the American political landscape is not good for our country ; in the words of an ancient maxim , “ what starts twisted , ends twisted . ”
usurpation
even though I did n't want them to .

“ I wanted to tell you all again a great big thank you from the bottom of my heart .
You helped me get something back that money cannot buy and I appreciate you all for it .
We still have a lot of building to do , but now can actually build .
Bless you all so much . ”
I ’ve spent several hours today looking at gridded temperature but did n’t finish again .
It was only at a quarter to eleven tonight that something struck me which seemed to need to be said .
All my favorite blogs are overrun by new readers ready to slaughter any climate scientists AGW conclusions at the blink of an eye .
As a result of the new traffic , many people have explained here about what tAV and other blogs should or should not do , should or should not say , how to approach the problem of having an incomplete science and foolish policy forced down our throats .
The problem is that I ’ve known these bloggers for some time now and there is n’t a single one who is not used to being in control of their own decisions and direction .
I ’m owner of my own company as is Anthony Watts .
Just try to get Steve McIntyre to write or do something he ’s not directly interested in and guess what , Lucia , Pielke ’s and the rest are n’t likely any different .
When people write , ‘ hey Jeff this is what you should do ’ , I think — get a free blog and start writing .
Start working the math and data , give some hours .
It ’s not easy to build a blog readership .
Try doing a single post on sea ice and you ’ll find out that it ’s ten times harder to write a post than you think – people do n’t get that .
There were n’t many classes on climate in engineering school .
In climatology , there are always data quality problems , calibration issues and instrument quirks over a 30 year period .
For laypeople , it ’s amazing how bad humanity is at keeping a measurement consistent over even a ten year period .
Instruments are not typically able to last that long .
The problem is far more critical when your audience consists of a couple thousand people who have as much or more technical background than yourself .
Technical blogging is challenging because of a hell of a lot of difficult decisions also .
First , there is no way I can know everything about climate science so when someone writes on a new topic and asks me to post , I need to read carefully , take a risk or say sorry .
There have been tens of posts offered to me which I cannot carry , simply because they are incomplete , beyond my experience or too amateur .
Amateur is more common .
Probably five people have written posts recently which do nothing but ask one question after another , answering none .
At least they have learned that it ’s hard to write anything about climate from a position of knowledge .
The part that struck me tonight though , was the intent by some to try and maximize effect of a skeptic blog by presenting an issue a certain way .
Perhaps , we should ___ .
What if we did ____ .
In my opinion , that is equally as bad as the advocate , leftist , high priests of climate science .
They are leftists too , despite the fact that so many have told me to stop writing it .
It ’s policy , wrapped in advocacy , poorly disguised as science all done for increased money and power .
Who is using whom , politicians or scientists , is a difficult question .
The point is though , that a coordinated direction is absolutely not required to write about science and despite peoples opinions IS highly destructive to whatever cause might exist .
It ’s not that far off topic to mention that I met a gorgeous and very young future eco-hydrologist this weekend in Reno after the trade show .
She was so far gone you would n’t believe it .
No idea who was going to pay her , no idea that people would suffer first from limiting usage of water , just that her eco whatever was going to help the planet , the rock , the wild gerbils , plants , beasts and several other non -self - aware items .
This lack of understanding was implemented by our govt .
mandated ever worse school system .
Poor thinking skills absolutely pervade the minds of the next generation .
You should believe me that even if by some act of magic the failure of public schooling ’s effects are limited , we will still pay dearly for it .
Her generation has no idea what science is comprised of .
Critical thinking requires the ability to consistently force your own wishes to the background .
The problem I see though with the view that we bloggers should _____ , which is probably the single thing here that all you skeptics probably can agree with , is that you ca n’t tell a skeptic , independent thinker what to believe !
You can suggest alternative views of course , but there is simply no method to push a guy like myself to approach the problem in a unified front with someone else .
Scientists are normally the same way .
They know what they do from experimentation and results .
After that it ’s very difficult to change their direction , and rightfully so .
Scientists ARE normally the same way , experiment and result — take a moment to think about that in comparison to hide the decline .
So where does the climate science community ’s stated need to ‘ attack the credibility of bloggers ’ come from ?
Where does the need to label and defeat skeptics come from ?
Why declare consensus ?
How is it that an Aeronautical Engineer with ability to plot data is so immoral and too evil to even post comments at Real Climate ??
Why do so many professional scientists and PhD ’s hang around a blog like this if so much disinformation is spread here ?
It ’s simple to me , it ’s because this blog and several other skeptic blogs will not intentionally present bad information .
There is not a single post here which has n’t suffered the scrutiny of many .
Claims have been repeatedly recanted and corrections made but in the end , understanding is the result .
How is it that Real Climate , Tamino , Climate Progress and many others never make any mistakes ?
The question , is of course , self answering .
These are the biggest problems with climate science .
So when you find yourself wishing that a skeptic blog , or groups of blogs , had a unified opinion on some topic — I hope you ’ll reconsider .
Like government spending to create jobs , this is the opposite of what is required .
It ’s the independence of thought , requirement of evidence and willingness to admit error which makes blog science so powerful .
My view is that any large scale consensus is an unnatural state forced by an outside pressure .
Like the advocates , we must be always vigilant against the wish for a scientific result and realize that it ’s not ever redundant to acknowledge that physics determines the results of global warming , not wish or belief .
When GHCN data shows a huge upslope , I have a choice to make — hide the decline ( so to speak ) or post the result .
tAV posts the result , climate science still hides the decline — more often than any main stream media has figured out .
Dear Mr. Dad :
My wife and I decided that we want one parent at home with our child full time — at least until he starts preschool .
Since she earns more than I do , it looks like I 'll be a stay - at - home dad .
What am I in for ?
A : Deciding to be a stay - at - home dad is a big decision , one that will affect everyone in your family .
There are wonderful benefits to you and your child .
But before you pull the trigger , you and your wife need to consider the following questions :
— Can you take the career hit ?
This is big , since earning power and masculinity are inextricably linked in so many people 's minds .
( If I 'm not making money , I 'm not a good man / father , the thinking goes . )
You may be able to keep a finger in the work world by consulting or starting a home - based business .
But if you return to the workforce later , the gap on your resume could cause problems with potential employers .
— Can you handle the pressure ?
Some people will come right out and tell you that you really should be out there bringing in some money .
After all , that 's what guys are supposed to do , right ?
But even if you do n't hear the actual words , you may feel the need to demonstrate that even though you 've chosen not to earn money , you could if you really wanted to .
Some of that pressure is external , some comes from within .
Traditional sex roles do a real number on us , do n't they ?
— Do you have a job description ?
What are your responsibilities ?
Will you be doing all the laundry , shopping , and cooking ?
Some of it ?
— Can you handle the isolation and the workload ?
Staying home with a child can be a tough , lonely job .
It can also be a little mind - numbing ( I say this from experience ) .
Sometimes , no matter how much fun you 've had with the kids , you 'll crave some adult conversation at the end of the day .
— Are you selfless enough ?
Say goodbye to personal time , and get used to putting your children 's needs above yours .
Always .
— Is your skin thick enough ?
Women — whether they 're moms , nannies , babysitters — tend not to welcome men into their groups wherever it is that people take their kids during the day .
You 'll have to get used to the funny looks and stupid comments from people when you 're out with your .
( " Hey , are you baby - sitting today ? " is one that always bugs me .
" No , bozo , I 'm not baby - sitting , I 'm a dad and I 'm taking care of my children . " )
And you 'll have to deal with people 's criticisms and critiques of your parenting — the kinds of " advice " and comments no one would ever make to a woman .
— How thick is your wife 's skin ?
When you 're the primary parent , your child will run to you when he wants a hug or has a skinned knee .
If mom tries to provide that hug or apply a BandAid , he may push her away .
I 've been on both sides of this , and can tell you that it hurts .
A lot .
— Do you have a reentry plan ?
It 's good to have a plan for how long your at - home stint will last , and what you 'll do afterwards .
In reality , you wo n't be as alone out there as it might seem .
In the United States , at least two million stay - at - home dads are doing it every day , and the number is rising all the time .
You may have to dig , but there are a lot of great resources out there , including athomedad.

A foam bat is endlessly helpful for trimming large pieces , and having a soft surface to work with altered pieces on .
You will need :
* A new clean bat .
I used a 22 ″ Hydra Bat from Continental Clay .
* High density foam ( it wo n’t flatten out when you put a heavy piece on it ) .
* A can of spray adhesive .
* An electric knife .
* A Sharpie or any permanent marker .
Take the bat outside and spray the bottom of it with spray adhesive .
Spray one side of the foam with spray adhesive .
Put the adhesive sides together and press evenly .
Put the bat , bat side up on a banding wheel and cut off excessive foam with the electric knife .
This will give you a nice clean edge .
Place the bat on your wheel using bat pins to ensure it ’s perfectly centered .
Use your marker and ruler to make concentric circles .
Until you get to the outside edge .
A MAN has married the love of his life , a giant - sized pillow , with an image of his favourite TV vixen he has been dating for six years before tying the knot .
South Korean Lee Jin-gyu , 28 , fell in love with his ' dakimakura , ' a gargantuan body pillow he purchased from Japan .
The pillow features the image of television vixen Fate Testarossa , a character from the animated series Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha .
They 've been dating for six years .
Lee 's story first garnered international attention in January , when he appeared in Martian Virus , a Korean TV show that , according to JoongAng Daily , " features regular folks with unique characteristics . "
His friend said : " They go out to the park or the funfair , where it will go on all the rides with him .
Then when he goes out to eat , he takes it with him and it gets its own seat and its own meal . "
His friend also added that Lee is " completely obsessed " with the pillow .
At any rate , Lee recently returned to the spotlight when he traveled to Japan to marry his beloved pillow with the help of an indulgent local priest .
He even outfitted the pillow with its own custom wedding dress .
It turns out , however , that the wedding was more of a publicity stunt , as Lee admitted to the press that he ’s still unsure about going through with it .
" My love for Fate is unchangeable , but I will take more time to think about our marriage . "

( CNN ) --
These days , when everyone seems to have a Facebook friend , is Linked In or can Google themselves , it 's hard to remember the old days , before the dot - com revolution .
It was 25 years ago -- March 15 , 1985 -- that the first dot - com domain name -- Symbolics.com -- appeared on the Internet , ushering in the commercial age of the World Wide Web .
Having a domain name made it simpler for the average person to access a Web site .
Instead of having to remember a long series of numbers and dots , you could type in ATT.com , IBM.com or CNN.com .
Development was slow , at first .
It took more than two years for the first 100 sites to go online and by 1995 , the number had grown to 18,000 .
But from those humble beginnings the Internet has grown to more than 80 million dot - com domain names , according to the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation ( ITIF ) .
Crunching the numbers , 99.9 percent of all Internet growth has occurred over the past 15 years .
" The global diffusion of the commercial Internet has occurred with astounding speed , " says the ITIF report " The Internet Economy 25 Years After . Com . "
" Every country on Earth , developed and developing alike , has adopted the Internet . "
The impact on the U.S. economy of the Internet sector is estimated at $ 300 billion or about 2 percent of the total , according to a report issued by Hamilton Consultants and the Harvard Business school last year .
The expansion of the Internet has n't been without its growing pains .
The dot - com bubble burst in the early 2000s , taking billions of investor dollars with it , and fraud has been growing , tripling over the past five years , according to Internet Crime Complaint Center .
In 2005 , losses attributable to Internet fraud were estimated at $ 183 million based on more than 230,000 complaints .
By 2009 , the number was nearly $ 560 million on 337,000 complaints .
" The figures contained in this report indicate that criminals are continuing to take full advantage of the anonymity afforded them by the Internet , " said Donald Brackman of the National White Collar Crime Center .
" They are also developing increasingly sophisticated means of defrauding unsuspecting consumers .
Internet crime is evolving in ways we could n't have imagined just five years ago . "
The scams range from the ubiquitous e-mail scheme where someone needs help getting money out of countries such as Nigeria to nondelivery of online purchases .
But despite the downside , the ITIF sees a bright future for the Web .
Not only for conducting business , but for the sharing of information , provided online security is maintained and the Internet is expanded throughout the globe .
" So to the commercial Internet , congratulations on hitting your 25th birthday ; you 're just starting to enter the prime of your working years , " the ITIF said .

A secret meeting between the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) Leon Panetta and Israeli officials has reportedly centered on Iran ’s nuclear program .
CIA director Leon Panetta talked with Israeli officials about Iran ’s nuclear program on January 28 .
In a secret flying visit to Israel on Thursday , the head of the CIA reportedly discussed Iran ’s nuclear issue in a sit- down with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Mossad Chief Meir Dagan .
The trip , which was originally scheduled to take place in May , follows a recent wave of developments in the Middle East that strongly imply preparations for a possible new military conflict in the region .
Israel has allegedly increased the scope of its undercover operations in the region , particularly against Lebanon , Iran , Syria and the Palestinian resistance movement , Hamas .
The extent of this could be seen in recent remarks by Israeli cabinet minister Yossi Peled , in which the former army general explicitly said that another confrontation with Lebanon ’s resistance movement Hezbollah was almost inevitable .
Lebanon ’s Prime Minister Saad Hariri responded to the claims on Thursday , saying that Israel ’s threats against Hezbollah are perceived as threats against Lebanon .
“ We consider the Israeli threats on Lebanon to be a threat to the Lebanese government as a whole , rather than to one particular person , ” said Hariri during a joint news conference with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo , Reuters reported .
Meanwhile , Hamas officials say they have concrete evidence that the Israeli intelligence agency , Mossad , staged the recent assassination of a senior Hamas commander , Mahmoud al - Mabhouh , in Dubai on January 20 .
Their claims have been somewhat supported by Dubai Police Chief Dhahi Khalfan .
“ It could be Mossad , ” AFP quoted police Chief Dhahi Khalfan as saying on Sunday .

To add to the controversy , sources in Turkey ’s ruling party told Russia ’s Mignews on Saturday that Israeli spy agents ran an advanced electronic monitoring station from the Ankara military headquarters to keep tabs on communication networks in Iran and Syria .
According to the sources who were speaking on condition of anonymity , the Signals Intelligence station was solely managed by Israeli intelligence personnel and had become off - limits for members of the Turkish government .
For years Israeli politicians have masterminded a wave of undercover operations and terror plots in numerous countries , including Jordan , Syria , Lebanon , Iran , Switzerland , and the US .
However , much of Israel ’s espionage operations have lately been focused on the Tehran government , largely because of Iran ’s uranium enrichment activities , which Tel Aviv has been seeking to portray as a mortal threat .
Tel Aviv , which is reported to have an arsenal of 200 nuclear warheads itself , accuses Iran of developing nuclear weapons and routinely threatens to reduce the country ’s enrichment sites to rubble .
This is while Iran , unlike Israel , is a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has opened its enrichment facilities to UN inspection .
On Saturday , US presidential aid James Jones rejected prospects of an Israeli attack against Iran .
Although US officials normally deny having any plans to stage new war in the region , there have recently been strong hints to the contrary .
The New York Times reported Saturday that Washington will further increase its military presence in the Persian Gulf — allegedly to soup up its defense against possible Iranian missile attacks .
Meanwhile , US President Barack Obama has approved the deployment of new combat equipments , including advanced missile systems and special warships , to the region .

Nigeria 's acting president , Goodluck Jonathan , has dissolved the country 's cabinet .
Mr Jonathan became acting president in February amid the continuing illness of President Umaru Yar 'Adua .
Mr Yar 'Adua went to Saudi Arabia for treatment in November last year and , despite returning to Nigeria recently , has not been seen in public .
One outgoing cabinet minister denied there was any power vacuum , saying civil servants would take over .
The cabinet was picked by Mr Yar 'Adua and correspondents say Mr Jonathan is now trying to stamp his own authority .
Observers see Wednesday 's move as an attempt to consolidate power at the expense of Mr Yar 'Adua .
' No reason ' Information Minister Dora Akunyili said after a cabinet meeting : " Today , the acting president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria , Goodluck Jonathan , dissolved the Federal Executive Council [ cabinet ] .
ANALYSIS Peter Greste , BBC News , Abuja
There has been talk of a cabinet reshuffle for weeks now , ever since the national assembly moved Goodluck Jonathan to acting president .
But few people expected the wholesale dissolution that came on Wednesday .
Not all ministers will lose their jobs - some will be reappointed , but this kind of sweeping change makes it clear the acting president is trying to assert his control over the cabinet made up largely of President Yar 'Adua 's appointees .
The president is still too ill to return to his job , but the prospect that he might has prompted some commentators to argue that Goodluck Jonathan has overstepped his constitutional powers .
But others say it was the only way the acting president could get a grip on the country 's mounting social , economic and political problems .
" He did not give us any reason and so I can not give any reason .
" There is no vacuum in the government as permanent secretaries will take charge . "
Ms Akunyili said that Mr Jonathan would issue a statement soon on the future make - up of the cabinet .
Mr Jonathan will have to submit the list of new ministers to the National Assembly .
It was only on 9 February that the assembly appointed Mr Jonathan as acting president , allowing him to sign legislation , chair cabinet meetings , reshuffle ministers and release oil funds .
Since he assumed power he has been faced with serious communal violence between Muslim and Christian groups near the city of Jos that has left hundreds dead .
On Wednesday , at least 10 people were killed in an attack on a mainly Christian village near Jos .
Armed groups who say they are fighting for a fairer share of oil wealth have also continued their campaign in the Niger Delta .
On Monday two car bombs exploded in the oil city of Warri , where officials were in talks over an amnesty for militants .
Election candidate President Yar 'Adua was treated in Saudi Arabia for what his doctor described as acute pericarditis , an inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart .
There are no details of his current condition .
YAR 'ADUA ILLNESS TIMELINE 23 Nov 2009 : Goes to hospital in Saudi Arabia 26 Nov : Doctors say he has pericarditis , a heart problem 23 Dec : First court case filed urging him to step down 12 Jan : President gives telephone interview from Saudi Arabia 27 Jan : Cabinet declares president fit 9 Feb : Vice - President Goodluck Jonathan made acting president 24 Feb : Yar 'Adua returns
Amid the continuing uncertainty over Mr Yar 'Adua , it was announced on Tuesday that next year 's presidential election could be brought forward by three months .
Mr Yar 'Adua 's term of office expires in May 2011 but he is not expected to stand again .
The ruling People 's Democratic Party , to which both Mr Yar 'Adua and Mr Jonathan belong , has a policy of alternating between presidential candidates from the mainly Muslim north and the largely Christian south , allowing each to serve two four - year terms .
Mr Yar 'Adua , a northern Muslim , was elected in 2007 after Olusegun Obasanjo , a southern Christian , had governed for eight years .
The People 's Democratic Party this month confirmed that a northerner would be the candidate next year to continue this policy , ruling out Mr Jonathan , a southerner .
Nigeria 's Nobel Prize - winning writer , Wole Soyinka , a long - time critic of the state of politics in Nigeria , said Goodluck Jonathan 's decision to dissolve the cabinet was long overdue .
" I think he 's been as delicate as anybody who 's in charge of country like Nigeria can be , " he told BBC World Service .
" In fact , I think he 's erred on the over - cautious side .
This should have happened a very long time ago . "
" He has to compel those who have been behind this macabre charade to come out in the open , " Mr Soyinka added .

Electronic devices are getting smaller , and so are their interfaces .
If you ’ve ever had problems typing on your mobile , or changing a song on your iPod while jogging , Chris Harrison has the answer .
His Skinput prototype is a system that monitors acoustic signals on your arm to translate gestures and taps into input commands .
Just by touching different points on your limb you can tell your portable device to change volume , answer a call , or turn itself off .
Even better , Harrison can couple Skinput with a pico projector so that you can see a graphic interface on your arm and use the acoustic signals to control it .
The project is set to be presented at this year ’s SIGCHI conference in April , but you can check it out now in the video below .
Skip past 1:00 to avoid the intro , but make sure to catch the Tetris game demo at 1:19 , and the cool pico projector interface starting at 2:05 .
Incorporating your body into your mobile systems could be the next big theme in human computer interfaces .
The Skinput system bears a strong resemblance to the I/O for Sixth Sense , Pranav Mistry ’s open source personal augmented reality device .
Whereas Mistry uses a camera to capture video input , Harrison has focused on acoustics .
Researchers at Microsoft have taken a third tactic : using the electric signals on the skin ’s surface that correspond to muscle movement as input commands .
All three are pretty novel approaches to controlling your technology through your body , and any one might make headway in the next few years .
Together , they suggest that the best way to take advantage of miniaturized mobile devices is to make them part of you .
I ’ve been impressed with Harrison ’s work at Carnegie Mellon ’s Human Computer Interaction Institute since I reviewed his Scratch Input device last year .
That system used acoustic signals on hard surfaces to control various electronics .
Skinput is the logical successor to Sratch Input , taking the basic premise of an acoustic interface and upgrading it with projected video and augmenting it by placing it on the body .
As advanced as Skinput may be , however , it ’s hard to know if it will ever make it out of the prototype phase .
Novel I / O systems are amazing to watch , but transitioning them into a marketable product can take years .
Here ’s an idea though : Mistry ’s Sixth Sense device is open source , maybe Harrison should try to combine it with Skinput .
Together , visual and audio input could give the personal AR system a dynamic and sensitive set of complex controls able to take on any task .
Whenever I see this level of engineering and inventiveness I ’m as impressed by the people behind it as I am with the technology itself .
Harrison ’s already on my radar after Sratch Input , even more so now with Skinput .
Prototypes like these help shape the dialogue about the future of human computer interfaces even if they never make it to market .
( Relatively ) young inventors like Harrison , Mistry , and countless others are going to make this century a truly remarkable one to live in .
Maybe in a few years I ’ll be writing these posts on my arm while I ’m out jogging .
Make it happen , Harrison !

• On November 27 , 1993 Calvert was caught by Corona Police Officers with a prostitute in his car .
• Calvert was one of three U.S. Representatives featured on the Fox News Documentary “ Porked : Earmarks for Profit ” in 2008 .
Calvert obtained millions in taxpayer dollars to build roads and a transportation hub near commercial real estate properties he owns .
One such project , the Corona Transit Center is located within 1.75 miles of 7 of Calvert ’s own properties , an earmark that increased Calvert ’s personal net worth .
• Calvert is currently involved in a controversial , high - profile land deal that a Riverside County Grand Jury determined was an illegal real estate transaction .
Calvert was able to personally purchase a 4 acre piece of land from a public agency that is part of his congressional district without competition .
This “ sweetheart deal ” is currently in litigation .
• In 2006 , the FBI combed through five years of Rep. Calvert 's financial records , only eight days after the Los Angeles Times reported that he made a 79 % profit on a land deal after earmarking funds that helped drive up the price of his own property .
• Seventeen years ago , Calvert signed “ The Contract with America ” , promising not to hold his Congressional seat for a day more than twelve years .
• Calvert received zero points for influence within the House of Representatives according to Congress.org ’s 2008 Power Rankings .
In 2008 , progressive Democrat Bill Hedrick came closer to ousting an incumbent than any other candidate of either party in any of California 's heavily gerrymandered ( for incumbent - protection ) districts .
With Obama reversing a 2004 Bush victory of 59 % to a 50 - 49 % win over McCain , Bill 's 49 % of the vote was the best any challenger did in the state .
That was quite an accomplishment , particularly when he was outspent 5 - 1 , had no acknowledgment -- let alone assistance -- from the DCCC and ran a 100 % grassroots campaign .
Ken Calvert spent $ 1,150,432 and Bill Hedrick spent $ 191,461 .
Bill is running against Calvert again but right now he is n't the only problem Calvert has in his hopes for re-election .
Chris Riggs , a local real estate broker , is challenging Calvert from the right .
Although the Republican registration edge in the district has dropped precipitously over the past 2 years -- down to about a 9 % edge from a 14 % edge -- Calvert is not well - liked by plenty of local Republicans , particularly the teabagger variety .
And that 's exactly what Riggs is counting on .
Calvert may be known as a pork - mad big spender with a solid air of corruption about him , but the one thing foremost on teabaggy minds is how he voted not once , but , for the big bank bailout in 2009 .
On September 29 , Bush and Paulsen appealed to Republicans to help him pass the biggest Wall Street bailout in history .
It failed 205 - 228 , stunning Bush and his bankster buddies .
95 Democrats and 133 Republicans voted against it .
Ken Calvert , however , was one of the 65 corrupt corporately oriented Republicans to vote yes .
Bush panicked and came back to the House with all guns blazing 4 days later .
Corporate shills like Paul Ryan , Roy Blunt , John Boehner , Eric Cantor , Adam Putnam , Jerry Lewis , Dave Camp and , of course , Ken Calvert started twisting arms until they persuaded 26 more Republicans to vote for the bailout .
It passed 263 - 171 .
Teabaggers hate Calvert for it and , because Hedrick was actively campaigning the bailout , he racked up some impressive crossover votes from independents and even Republicans , actually winning in the Riverside County portion of the district .
Riggs is hoping to appeal to Republicans angry at Calvert not just for these two votes , but for his entire political posture of robotic acquiescence to the Beltway Establishment .
Calvert is no longer viewed as a member of the community , except as someone who uses it for his own personal gain .
He lives in DC and has no real attachments to Riverside County or even to far redder Orange County .
Like Hedrick , Riggs is all about the Inland Empire -- and he is n't being shy about pointing out Calvert 's shortcomings , especially in the ethics department .

As fans of " Star Trek : The Next Generation " are likely well aware , the much - beloved ( and arguably best ) series in the Star Trek franchise 's history is still in syndication on the Syfy , and we 're still DVRing every episode in hopes that perhaps there 's one that we missed -- an episode that could still be new to us , over 15 years later .
But for comics artist Jess Fink , who has never watched the series before , every episode is new , and she 's been making mini- recap comics as she winds her way through the legendary space exploration show , starting in the middle of the third season with " The Offspring , " and moving on to " Allegiance , " " The Most Toys , " " The Wounded , " " Sins of the Father , " " The Mind 's Eye " and " Redemption . "
Her blog is worth dropping on your RSS feed for the TNG recaps alone , but as a warning / inducement , be aware that Fink is also the creator of some highly sexy comics -- including the erotic steampunk comic " Chester 5000 XYV " soon to be collected by Top Shelf -- so not all parts of the site are safe for work , though they remain safe for hotness .
For example , some claim that health costs would fall dramatically if only insurance companies were allowed to sell policies across state lines .
But California is already a huge market , with much more insurance competition than in other states ; unfortunately , insurers compete mainly by trying to excel in the art of denying coverage to those who need it most .
And competition has n’t averted a death spiral .
So why would creating a national market make things better ?
More broadly , conservatives would have you believe that health insurance suffers from too much government interference .
In fact , the real point of the push to allow interstate sales is that it would set off a race to the bottom , effectively eliminating state regulation .
But California ’s individual insurance market is already notable for its lack of regulation , certainly as compared with states like New York  yet the market is collapsing anyway .
Finally , there have been calls for minimalist health reform that would ban discrimination on the basis of pre-existing conditions and stop there .
It ’s a popular idea , but as every health economist knows , it ’s also nonsense .
For a ban on medical discrimination would lead to higher premiums for the healthy , and would , therefore , cause more and bigger death spirals .
So California ’s woes show that conservative prescriptions for health reform just wo n’t work .
What would work ?
By all means , let ’s ban discrimination on the basis of medical history  but we also have to keep healthy people in the risk pool , which means requiring that people purchase insurance .
This , in turn , requires substantial aid to lower - income Americans so that they can afford coverage .
And if you put all of that together , you end up with something very much like the health reform bills that have already passed both the House and the Senate .
What about claims that these bills would force Americans into the clutches of greedy insurance companies ?
Well , the main answer is stronger regulation ; but it would also be a very good idea , politically as well as substantively , for the Senate to use reconciliation to put the public option back into its bill .
But the main point is this : California ’s death spiral is a reminder that our health care system is unraveling , and that inaction is n’t an option .
Congress and the president need to make reform happen  now .
SPIEGEL Interview with Avigdor Lieberman ' It Is a Clash of Civilizations '
In a SPIEGEL interview , Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman , 51 , discusses his country 's controversial settlement policies , the threat posed by Iran 's nuclear program and the seeming hopelessness of the conflict with the Palestinians .
Global warming has neither stopped nor slowed in the past decade , according to a draft analysis of temperature data by NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies .
The analysis , led by Goddard director Jim Hansen , attempts to debunk popular belief that the planet is cooling .
It finds that global temperatures over the past decade have " continued to rise rapidly , " despite large year - to - year fluctuations associated with the tropical El Niño–La Niña cycles .
The analysis also predicts , assuming current El Niño conditions hold , that 2010 will go down in history as the hottest year on record despite an unusually snowy winter in the Northern Hemisphere .
" Communicating the reality of climate change to the public is hampered by the large natural variability of weather and climate , " the Goddard scientists wrote in the draft , which was circulated by Hansen Friday evening and posted on the ClimateProgress.org blog shortly after .
" We conclude there has been no reduction in the global warming trend of 0.15 ( to ) 0.20 ºC ( per ) decade that began in the late 1970s . "
The new analysis combines sea-surface temperature records with meteorological station measurements and tests alternative choices for ocean records , urban warming and tropical and Arctic oscillations .
It concludes the urban " heat island " impacts are small compared to the warming attributed to greenhouse gas emissions .
And it finds that , while this winter 's unusually strong Arctic Oscillation - which funnels cold northern air to the East Coast and pulls warm mid-latitude air up to the Arctic - is predicted as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise , seasonal temperature anomalies associated with it are n't enough to blunt long - term warming trends .
" In the United States only one of the past 10 winters and two of the past 10 summers were cooler than the 1951 - 1980 climatology , a frequency consistent with the expected ' loading of the climate dice , ' " the scientists wrote .
Hansen and other co-authors could not be reached for comment .
The analysis has not been subjected to a peer review , though Hansen , in an email sent discussing the paper , said he intended to revise it for submission to a journal " within a month or so . "
Michael Mann , director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University , called the analysis solid .
" Essentially he 's just pointing out that we 've come out of this short - term , relatively cool period , " Mann said .
" The globe clearly continues to warm . "
Joe Romm , editor of ClimateProgress.org and a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress , added that the study is " important for those who care about the science . "
Whether it would quell the debate over global cooling - fueled in part by the East Coast 's hard winter and the revelation of errors in the United Nation 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change synthesis report - is less certain .
Mann said many claims of global cooling are spurious and " intellectually dishonest . "
" The question becomes can you confront those who are choosing to be intellectually dishonest with more facts and hope they become more honest ?
Unfortunately , that 's not the case , " he said .
" But hopefully , as evidence continues to come in , those who have genuinely , honestly skeptical views about climate change will be swayed by the fact that evidence continues to ... to be stronger and stronger . "
Romm was hopeful the analysis might inspire media to become less prone to arguments the globe is cooling .
" If journalists want to write their global cooling piece , they better get it out soon , " he said .
In an e-mail that accompanying the study , Hansen suggested defrocking the cooling theory was a chief aim of the subject .
" Somehow we have to do a better job communicating , " he wrote .
" The paper has relevance to current public discussions , but the usual scientific journals are not too accommodating for explicit discussion of that relevance . "
The Goddard analysis challenges in particular a respected and widely quoted study by climatologist Susan Solomon and colleagues at the National Center for Atmospheric Research that states the trend in global surface temperatures " has been nearly flat since the 1990s . "
Not so , Hansen and his co-authors write .
" Climate trends can be clearly seen if we take the 60 - month ( five year ) and 132 - month ( 11 year ) running means . "
The five year mean minimizes El Niño variability , while the 11 - year mean minimizes solar - cycle variability .
Solomon could not be reached for comment Saturday night .
The warming trend was visible , Hansen said , even in this year 's bitter Northern Hemisphere winter , which blanketed Britain and the East Coast in snow and had Congressional Republicans mocking former Vice President Al Gore for his climate claims .
Winter weather will always be highly variable , Hansen wrote in an email .
Areas cold enough to have snow can expect more from a carbon - rich atmosphere containing more water vapor .
But while the Arctic oscillation over the past three months was remarkable , he said , the cold temperatures were relatively benign compared to the late 1970s .
Filtering that " noise " makes long - term temperature trends visible , the authors said .
It is also what allows them to predict that 2010 will emerge as the hottest year on record .
At first blush , it does n't seem likely :
The sun is near the bottom of deepest solar minimum in a century ; this year 's El Niño , while strong , is nowhere near as powerful as the 1998 cycle that drove temperatures higher across much of the globe .
But the underlying trend , Hansen and colleagues conclude , is up .
" This new record temperature will be particularly meaningful , " they wrote , " because it occurs when the recent minimum of solar irradiance is having its maximum cooling effect . "

Conceptually , carbon credits are fine and could have potential , but their current application is horribly flawed .
Metal Miner highlights how Cap & Trade can be gamed whereby it destroys developed nation jobs and does n't protect the environment either .
The example of Corus ’ Redcar plant is a case in point .
The plant was closed because key clients reneged on long term contracts and the 3 m ton facility was left without enough sales to cover its costs .
European steel producers receive about 2 tons of carbon credits for every ton of steel produced .
Closure of Redcar will mean Corus will reduce its carbon emission by the equivalent of 6 m tons of carbon emissions .
But Tata , Corus ’s owners , are rapidly expanding steel production in India where it could receive hundreds of millions of dollars annually from the Clean Development Fund by building new plants that are less polluting than existing Indian plants ( not less polluting than Redcar you understand , just less polluting than older plants in India ) .
As we have written recently elsewhere , the Indian steel industry is set to more than double production to some 124 million tons a year by 2011 - 2012 .
Even environmentalists must see this is a disaster for the reduction of carbon emissions .
It merely transfers production from western steel mills where steel is produced in a carbon constrained environment to a non constrained market
Thus carbon credits can be gamed so that they pay for companies to shut down factories in developed nations and simply rebuild them in developing ones .
Even if the new factory is n't more efficient than the one shut down back in the developed nation .
It apparently just has to be more efficient than older local plants in the developing country .

A " sexist " attitude towards health funding means men are missing out despite being more likely to suffer heart attacks and cancers than women , Canterbury health - promotion workers say .
A new report , The State of Men's Health in Canterbury 2009 , paints a dismal picture of men's health , but says little is being done to improve it .
Men were more likely to have high cholesterol and heart disease and have higher rates of many common cancers than women .
" While men continue to show , on average , poorer health than that of women , there appears to be significantly more health promotion targeted at women , " it said .
Young Canterbury men were more likely to be hospitalised with mental - health issues and abuse of substances such as drugs and alcohol .
They were also more likely to die or be injured in an accident .
In the past five years , 1693 Canterbury men aged 15 to 24 were involved in serious - injury crashes compared with 1221 females .
More than 70 per cent of drowning victims are male .
" It would appear that this is due to the `untouchable ' or `bulletproof ' attitude a lot of young men tend to possess , " the report said .
Canterbury Men's Centre manager Donald Pettitt said there had been a strong focus on women 's health for the past 20 years , but men had the worst health - related behaviour and worst health outcomes over that time .
" The system has been blind to the outcome for men and unresponsive to the obvious statistics and it's hard not to think of it as sexist when you look at it long enough , " Pettitt said .
He put the lack of focus on men's health down to the absence of advocates within the system and because people were naturally more sympathetic to women 's health .
" We have been bailing out half of the boat and the bigger holes are on the men 's side , " he said .
Report co-author and Sport Canterbury events and marketing manager Jonny Kirkpatrick said it was difficult to attract funding for male - focused health projects .
" Men are partly to blame themselves because of the `she 'll be right attitude ' , but it starts at the top , " he said .
" The awareness around women 's health is fantastic , but men get breast cancer too and as many men die from prostate cancer as women of breast cancer . "
The report 's main recommendations were raising awareness around men's health and making services gender appropriate .
" The services are there for them , but the pathways for men to access them are n't quite right , " Kirkpatrick said .
A Canterbury District Health Board project , Green Prescription , involved GPs referring patients to a supported physical activity programme rather than prescribing medication .
However , males made up only one quarter of participants , meaning the pathways or programme itself were not engaging enough for men , the report said .
Another health board project , Appetite for Life , was a free service offered only to women wanting to make a healthy lifestyle change .
Kirkpatrick said a steering committee was meeting this month to look at what funding could be available for supporting some of the report 's recommendations .
" The reality is health was hit pretty hard with budgets this year and men's health is n't high on the radar . "
Health Minister Tony Ryall said major men's health issues were covered by significant spending each year , including an estimated $ 430 million on heart disease ; $ 950 m on cancer ; just over $ 1 billion on mental health ; and more than $ 750 m on primary care .

A facebook friend , Andrew Taranto , posted :
Ayn Rand was , at least rhetorically speaking , a capitalist and an anti-libertarian .
Should n’t we , libertarians , regard this as significant when considering the value of the term “ capitalist ” ?
To this , my knee - jerk hit & run response was :
Her biggest problem with free market libertarians was what she called ‘ plagiarism ’ because ‘ no capitalist would plagiarize ’ .
She was right in the sense that ‘ intellectual property ’ is a tenet of capitalism , only protected by the State .
Which leads to her disdain toward free market anarchists — that she was uncompromising in the fact that the State is [ an absolutely necessity ] for capitalism to exist .
She said she believed in the separation of State and economy , but this was a lie because her legal philosophy regarding corporations , ‘ intellectual property ’ , land redistribution ( a la “ Confiscation and the Homestead Principle ” require the State to create , enforce and preserve these fictional entities to limit liability , fictional property rights that forcefully monopolize ( steal ) and protect immoral land possession .
She was indeed a capitalist , not a free marketeer and definitely not a libertarian .
A key portion of the ‘ conscience ’ of a libertarian , for lack of a better phrase , is the harsh scrutiny toward all forms of hierarchy , domination , existing institutions which wield any degree of authority AND to support little less than the dismantling of these institutions when their authority cannot be justified .
She never justifies the State , only that it is an imperative for capitalism and never scrutinized ‘ non - governmental ’ institutions which wield authority .
If her logic connects anywhere in her conclusions — according to her excellent interpretation of metaphysics and epistemology — she subjectively never states belief that ex post facto justice be applied to capitalists .
This conservatism of the status quo is an elitist categorical imperative ( funny as she was such a militant opponent of Kant ) .
This categorical imperative is the preserver of capitalism and the State .
She was right .
Capitalism cannot exist without the State because the imperative is n’t justice or liberty , but preserving capital as the guiding force of interpersonal relations .
I like to clarify a couple of things because I was n’t completely fair to Rand :
First , Rand ’s argument with libertarians regarding the legitimacy of the State was that it is a necessary final arbiter .
That even when it is immoral , it is immoral to dismantle it without replacing it with another monopoly of force .
The State ’s immorality , by her own definition of morality , leaves only her utilitarian argument to tolerate such injustice .
Her ideal social system ’s immorality was acceptable to her ( for no other reason that I see than ) to perpetuate capitalists ’ status quo — the elite to have access to the State as a monopoly agency .
Second , she did scrutinize the status quo more often and accurately than most of her time and throughout history — irrational orthodoxy and institutions such as the Church , the State and the perception of the self .
This includes the workplace in her fiction , but my comment was directed to when she zeroed in political science and economics later in her life .
Third , I do n’t see a linguistic definition of “ capitalism ” worth using to describe a free market because it was already defined by pre-U.S.S.R. free marketeers as an unjust system .
Otherwise .
I do n’t know how one forms an ‘ - ism ’ from ‘ capital ’ .
The derivation process just does n’t work .
We can really only interpret the word as an ‘ - ism ’ through its historical usage or base a political philosophy on ‘ capital ’ as some sort of categorical imperative .
I fully agree with Professor Roderick Long — who I trust well as a go - to on Rand , Aristotle , virtue ethics , liberal philosophy — that “ capitalism ” is an “ anti-concept ” , a term coined by Rand .
From his lecture “ Left and Right : Forty Years Later “ :
Rand used to identify certain terms and ideas as “ anti-concepts , ” that is , terms that actually function to obscure our understanding rather than facilitating it , making it harder for us to grasp other , legitimate concepts ; one important category of anti-concepts is what Rand called the “ package deal , ” referring to any term whose meaning conceals an implicit presupposition that certain things go together that in actuality do not .
Although Rand would not agree with the following examples , I ’ve become convinced that the terms “ capitalism ” and “ socialism ” are really anti-concepts of the package - deal variety .
Intellectual Property
In Capitalism , The Unknown Ideal , Rand does n’t say that the status quo is capitalism to its ideal , but uses examples from her time and history to argue that the ‘ benefits ’ come from capitalism as it existed .
It can not be argued that she did n’t argue capitalism as an element of the mixed economy of private and government - owned property .
It ’s the government possession of any property that makes government antithetical to the free market , but a market freed from coercion is more than an economic system .
Free market principles are rooted in morality and ethics , but that injustice is not to be tolerated from any and all institutions .
Rand ’s book defines “ capitalism ” as — not as an economic science , but — a “ social system ” of property rights .
( p.10 ) In Capitalism , Rand adds that “ patents and copyrights are the legal implementation of the base of all property rights ” and the imperative that “ government certifies the origination of an idea and protects its owner ’s exclusive right of use and disposal ” .
( p. 130 )
Instead of scrutinizing the privilege of ‘ intellectual property ’ , she justifies it as “ man ’s right to the product of his mind ” , but uses it to justify the existence of the State which violates her fundamental principle of morality — the non-aggression principle , which translates that the initiation of force is always immoral and ought not ever be acceptable means toward ends .
She acknowledges and fully supports an individual ’s monopoly of “ an idea ” and the State — which holds ( her words ) “ a legal monopoly on the use of physical force ” , not moral but legal — to enforce this ‘ intellectual ’ monopoly .
( p. 130 )
Rand concedes that the “ nature of governmental action is : coercive action ” — coercion being the threat of the initiation of force , therefore , antithetical to free markets .
( p. 46 )
Prof .
Long makes the case against ‘ intellectual property ’ being a right in a manner which should be uncontroversial ( emphasis added ) :
The objects of ownership in the case of intellectual property are supposed to be abstract objects ; but what does ownership over an abstract object amount to ?
Ownership is supposed to solve conflicts over use , but there cannot literally be conflicts over the use of abstract objects ; I do n’t have to wait until you ’re done thinking the Pythagorean theorem before I can start thinking it .
Putative conflicts over the use of abstract objects are always really conflicts over the concrete items in which those abstract objects are embodied .
An abstract object , such as a design for a new kind of mousetrap , gets its foothold in concrete reality only by being embodied in , say , a mind that is thinking of it , or a sheet of paper that describes it , or an actual mousetrap built in accordance with it .
But if those concrete objects are already owned — - the mind by the person whose mind it is , the paper and the mousetrap by whoever made or bought them — then the question of who has rights over those things is already settled , and there can be no further question of who owns the design itself .
If the originator of the design were to claim exclusive rights over it , he or she would thereby be claiming , in practice , the right to control someone else ’s property — someone else ’s individual mind or individual sheet of paper or individual mousetrap .
Intellectual property is thus essentially a claim of ownership over other people and the products of other people ’s labor , and so is necessarily illegitimate ; in forbidding the free circulation of ideas it constitutes a form of censorship as well .
A core tenet of Rand ’s “ capitalism ” was forceful intellectual monopoly .
Her straw manning of libertarianism aside , her disdain for libertarianism was largely based on two perceptions :
That libertarians do not tolerate the “ coercive action ” inherent in the State ’s nature ; and That she perceived libertarians as ‘ stealing ’ her fictitious ‘ intellectual property ’ .
Libertarians who scrutinized the privilege of ‘ intellectual property ’ morally oppose recognition of it .
The concept is in support of slavery and a manifestation of State privilege , enforced by immoral aggression .
Rand was a self - professed pro-capitalist anti-libertarian — in part — due to ( and I feel she was correct here ) ‘ intellectual property ’ privilege being a tenet of capitalism .
A purpose of the State , then , is not to suppress capitalism , but necessary to preserve the ‘ social system ’ of it .
A proponent of markets free of coercion — by Rand ’s own definition of the State ’s nature — must be anti-State ; but capitalism is a “ social system ” where “ patents and copyrights are the legal implementation of the base of all property rights ” and the “ government secures ” the privileged entity the “ exclusive right of use and disposal ” of ideas .
In this , she makes the case that it is the State ’s duty to create and preserve monopoly by force .
Rand ’s recognition of ‘ intellectual property ’ as a right is debunked by herself a couple of pages later where she concedes that “ the question of their time limit is an enormously complex issue ” , citing Great Britain ’s Copyright
Act of 1911 as the “ most rational ” time limit .
Rand ’s views on property and perpetuity would have her follow that ‘ intellectual property ’ has no moral , rational time limit .
Her own views on property rights cite ‘ intellectual property ’ as a State - granted monopoly privilege .
The Capitalist : The Categorical Imperative
Her views on ‘ intellectual property ’ and the State seem sloppy when one is familiar with her extremely wise writings on metaphysics and epistemology until you understand the word “ capitalism ” .
Her definition of “ capitalism ” is basically a regurgitation of incorrect reactionary definitions of her time .
Rand was n’t stupid .
She was very aware of the historical usage of “ capitalism ” to pejoratively describe people who expropriated profit from laborers ’ production ; that capital was stolen wealth as non-labor related income .
Rand went as far as to call this an ideal in the title of the book I reference , which leads me to ask : were Rand ’s inconsistencies in applying the non-aggression principle to economics and statism due to capital as an irrational categorical imperative ?
The argument for “ capitalism ” by those who also call themselves “ libertarian ” is that the etymology of “ capitalism ” does n’t change the objective meaning .
But the objective meaning is n’t that which anti-Soviets used as a reactionary term to oppose Bolshevism and Stalinism .
What do I mean by this ?
Ayn Rand and capitalism :
Ayn Rand is born in Russia in 1905 , traveled to the U.S. after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1926 and vowed never to go back .
Rand hated the Bolsheviks who called themselves ‘ socialists ’ .
They were n’t socialists , but it ’s what they called themselves , so Rand called what she hated , ‘ socialism ’ .
The Bolsheviks called themselves ‘ Marxists ’ .
Marx hated the ‘ capitalist ’ who “ develops technology , and the combining together of various processes into a social whole , only by sapping the original sources of all wealth — the soil and the labourer ” .
( Das Kapital , Vol. 1 , Chap. 15 ) .
Rand expresses her anti-Bolshevism as ‘ anti- socialism ’ and ‘ anti-Marxist ’ by latching onto to what Marx hated : “ capitalism ” .
It ’s my contention that Rand did not see the social system she called “ capitalism ” as an “ ideal ” because it was truly the greatest extension of her philosophy , as she defines it heavily with ‘ property rights ’ that are inconsistent with her philosophy .
The only explanation I can see is that she latched onto what Marx hated and called that what she loved employing capital “ as the standard of rationality from which all moral requirements derive ” , relating to economics .
I ’ve discussed this with neither Roderick T. Long nor Charles Johnson , but upon this thought , I decided to do a little digging .
My history with Rand began at 15 and my love affair lasted until I became a libertarian around 21 , but I ’ve always clung to and reviewed her writings pretty frequently .
I still consider myself an Aristotelian in terms of ethics and find myself illuminated by Rand ’s fiction — which she always claimed was the clearest expression of her philosophy , describing herself as a novelist first , then a philosopher .
Her non-fiction , especially where she dabbled in economics and political science was later in her life and I have a theory about her sloppiness and stubbornness that I wo n’t express here because it would serve as an ad hominem distraction .
Prof. Long and Mr. Johnson make several points on her economic views with which I do n’t contend that are extremely relevant to her subjective connection between free markets and capitalism .
Prof . Long , earlier this year ( emphasis added ) :
Rand describes a “ pyramid of ability ” operating within capitalism , wherein the dull masses are carried along by the intelligent and enterprising few .
“ The man at the top , ” Rand assures us , “ contributes the most to all those below him , ” while the “ man at the bottom who , left to himself , would starve in his hopeless ineptitude , contributes nothing to those above him , but receives the bonus of all of their brains . ”
Rand does n’t say that the top and the bottom always correspond to employers and employees respectively , but she clearly takes that to be the usual situation .
And that simply does not correspond with the reality of most people ’s everyday experience .
If you ’ve spent any time at all in the business world , you ’ve almost certainly discovered that the reality on the ground resembles the comic - strip Dilbert a lot more than it resembles Rand ’s pyramid of ability .
In Kevin Carson ’s words : as in government , so likewise in business , the “ people who regulate what you do , in most cases , know less about what you ’re doing than you do , ” and businesses generally get things done only to the extent that “ rules imposed by people not directly involved in the situation ” are treated as “ an obstacle to be routed around by the people actually doing the work . ”
To a considerable extent , then , in the real world we see the people at the “ bottom ” carrying the people at the “ top ” rather than vice versa .
Rand ’s notorious reference to big business as a “ persecuted minority ” ( Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal , ch. 3 ) likewise jars with our real - world experience of “ capitalism , ” as we see the corporate elite lining up for tax - funded subsidies , protectionist regulations , bailouts , mandates , monopoly contracts , war profits , eminent domain giveaways , and other state - granted privileges .
But , Rand does understand that the persecuted are within every class .
She ’s sloppy in Capitalism , but Atlas Shrugged contains a wealth of heroes and villains from every economic class — expressing that producers and parasites are results of free will , not circumstance .
The Fountainhead ‘s villains are people who live by capital as a categorical imperative — Peter Keating , Gail Wynand .
And Dominique Francon , the heroine , is someone who endures struggle with integrity instead of selling out .
It ’s the lack of moral standards ( because she deplored Kant and the concept of the categorical imperative ) that made the villans immoral , irrational , evil profit - seekers at the expense of others ; and the adherence to morality over profit that defines her heroes .
It ’s part of why I love her fiction !
Prof .
Long wrote in 2007 ( emphasis added ) :
Now the second , more left - wing reading is clearly the “ official ” one , both because the novel draws its heroes and villains from capital and labour alike ( and even the über - hero John Galt is a proletarian of sorts ) and because in her nonfiction works Rand always insisted that the greatest conflicts between producers and parasites occur not between but within economic classes .
But the novel is nonetheless heavily and unmistakably flavoured with the first , more right - wing reading .
Why so ?
Is it just because Rand the creative novelist could n’t resist the attraction of what she would have called the “ gimmick ” of reversing the conventional picture of a strike ?
Surely it ’s more than that .
What of class solidarity as an explanation ?
It seems to have something going for it : while Rand lived a proletarian life during her early years in the U.S. , she had come from a bourgeois family ( albeit more petit than grand ) who had been expropriated by a proletarian revolution — so it might seem only to be expected that she would identify with capital rather than with labour .
Charles Johnson rationalizes that Rand ’s view of capitalism was aptly not logically consistent with a free market , stating ( emphasis added ) :
Rand knew perfectly well that the historical data underdetermined the question of whether predation or voluntary cooperation was essential to the capitalistic form of society : the rise of the societies we call capitalist involved the liberation of many people and of the markets in many commodities ; it also involved the escalation of many forms of predatory state patronage and the invention of new ones ( it meant , for example , considerably more freedom in agriculture or textiles ; it also meant considerably more government intervention in banking , land use , and transportation infrastructure ) .
You could describe the picture by identifying the growth in freedom as the capitalist stuff , with the new levels of predation as anti-capitalist deviations from capitalism marring its productive development .
But you could just as easily describe it by identifying the growth in predation as the capitalist stuff , with the growth in freedom as a countervailing , non-capitalist or anti-capitalist development , which the capitalist stuff had an antagonistic , or often parasitic , relationship to .
So which description should you choose ?
I think the best explanation why Rand chose the first picture instead of the second one has to do with what she would have identified with her sense of life — the degree to which her aesthetic and affectional imagination were engaged on behalf of actually existing capitalists , as she understood them , in the known reality of the mixed economy : that is , her view of the grand bourgeoisie — big industrialists , business - owners , money - men , the top tier of entrepreneurial inventors , and ultimately the wealthy broadly — as the heroic prime movers in business , and thus as the world ’s motor , driving the production of the material means of survival and human flourishing .
( See , for example , Atlas Shrugged or America ’s Persecuted Minority : Big Business . )
Though she ’d no doubt fume at the description , one way of putting it is that she made her choices about what language to reclaim and what language to abandon on the basis of class solidarity .
I have no quarrel with Rand ’s procedure ; but rather only with the particular class she chooses to stand in solidarity with .
If Rand is right that the capitalist is the chief victim of the predatory state , and if the picture she draws of the archetypical capitalist is well - drawn , it makes perfect sense for her to reclaim the word capitalism for the free market as against political patronage .
If , on the other hand , the bosses are the chief beneficiaries of the predatory state , and if the picture she draws of the archetypical capitalist is ill - drawn — if the archetypical boss is a busybodying mediocrity , a cunning predator , or a petulant grafter , and if their role in the workplace is a drag on the productive labor on the shop floor rather than the animating force behind it as Rand claims — then it makes perfect sense to locate the essence of capitalism elsewhere from where Rand locates it , and to treat capitalism as a term of criticism for political patronage as against the free market .
Rand ’s views on economics were not consistent with the free market principles many derive from her morality , but pretty consistent with the descriptions of capitalism given by critics of capitalism — Marx , Pierre - Joseph Proudhon , Benjamin Tucker , Friedrich Engels .
Rand was indeed a capitalist and not a libertarian , by her own admission , but we can prove this by showing her solidarity with capitalists over free market libertarians when she decided to become the armchair economist .
Further proof that a free market libertarian is not a capitalist , Andrew ?
Sure .
I can get into why Rand ’s fiction writing is special to me and objectively profound elsewhere .
In a nutshell , it actually does apply valid objective metaphysics , epistemology , ethics and aesthetics to scrutinizing all forms of hierarchy and domination in our culture .
This is what makes her expression relevant to libertarianism .
Her economics and conservative reactions to authoritarianism in the workplace expressed later in her life , on the other hand , are antithetical to libertarianism and why I agree with Professor Gary Chartier ; that libertarians are inherently anti-capitalist .
A highlight of libertarianism is not punching numbers to produce the ‘ greatest for the greatest number ’ because — as the antithesis of authoritarianism — libertarians do n’t only see authority as not self - justifying , but also the self - defeating aspects of central planning institutions to dictate such numbers .
No one with half a brain will argue that the status quo or etymology of “ capitalism ” is libertarian .
Linguistically , we can only objectively say that capitalism , as a social system , is one driven by capital .
One can take this abstract to many levels , but this truism should n’t be controversial .
The liberty of the individual as sovereign over authoritative institutions has been wrongly associated with capitalism because capitalism is a hybrid of the two — private ownership of the means of production with a monopoly of force ( the State ) driving the direction of capital in society .
Though Rand and other minarchists who call themselves ‘ capitalists ’ call for a separation of state and economy , their rationale is seldom rooted in the free , voluntary exchange of justly possessed property .
It is usually to prevent the State from expropriating capital from the economy .
For this reason , the scrutiny that minarchists apply to the top - down , bureaucratic , forceful domination of government is not applied to the workplace .
The fact of the matter is that the workplace functions in the same way — expropriating capital from laborers .
The pyramid scheme of top - down organization is accepted as conventional wisdom for how to control the successes and failures of a corporation .
Another truism ignored by minarchist capitalists is that governments are corporations and act like corporations .
The evil it commits is heavily rooted in that it produces nothing and enabled by its monopoly of force intruding on the economy to extract capital , but a dysfunction of government is also its inner top - down bureaucratic structure — where those at the bottom do most of the work and best understand how to maximize without wasting resources , but they have no say .
If you do n’t believe me , just ask a schoolteacher .
Every critic of the education system , especially those of public education , claims that their schoolteacher friend is one of the few great ones .
You do n’t hear people bragging about their friends in the administrative bureaucracy of the education system .
The beauty of Rand ’s fiction is that heroes do n’t strive for capital .
They strive for eudaimonia .
Yes , there is no virtue in sacrifice , but Rand contends that there is no such thing as ‘ sacrificing capital ’ in the rational pursuit of eudaimonia .
A large part of this rational pursuit is not only to recognize your sovereignty as an individual , but that this recognition is meaningless ( or in most cases , hedonistic , which she abhorred ) without recognizing and respecting that sovereignty in all individuals .
The libertarian applies this Aristotelian view on virtue by not only refusing to tolerate any authority which cannot justify itself with logical , moral consistency ; but any social system where the pursuit of eudaimonia is curbed by aggression .
A common minarchist , austrolibertarian , “ anarcho ” - capitalist argument against the mixed economy concentrating wealth to privileged classes of cartels is that now the American family has to have two working parents or starve .
Instead of applauding the capitalists ’ use of child labor for “ providing 15 - year - olds with the training , life experience , and sense of self - worth that only a private job can bring “ , as Lew Rockwell , Jr. did recently , libertarians should be scrutinizing the conditions that deter the child from acquiring an education , making quality friendships , participating in a sport , enhancing a need to feed the creative juices that flow through an adolescent or helping his mother and father care for his siblings .
The libertarian does n’t value a social system guided by authority or capital , but by the free and non-aggressive actions of individuals within said society .
Ludwig von Mises argued well that human action drives the marketplace and the most efficient market is one where human action is most genuine .
Mises also argued for the State and in favor of the capitalist sacrificing his morality when it best serves the customer ; not that there ’s any virtue in it , but with capital as a categorical imperative , it ’s in the capitalist ’s best interest to obtain capital .
Murray Rothbard ’s treatise on ethics argues a natural law of individual sovereignty and defines libertarianism as a political philosophy with a rational framework of scrutinizing the legitimacy of institutions which threaten or violate individual sovereignty and the imperative that a libertarian seeks justice when they are illegitimate .
Of the Federal Reserve I stated , loosely paraphrasing Professor Noam Chomsky ’s words on the financial system in the 90’s , “ When in the pursuit of justice , an inherently tyrannical institution stands in the way , you do n’t ‘ reform ’ it .
You get rid of it . ”
Mises ’ argument that the most efficient market is one where human action is most freely expressed is n’t an ideology ; it ’s a truism .
The libertarian accepts that the State is illegitimate and understands justice is served only when this illegitimate authoritative institution is dismantled .
The libertarian supports , not capital , but human action to drive the marketplace .
Not top - down , highly centralized concentrations of capital to solve the problems in society or improve it to better fit our preferences , but voluntary participation of people to construct institutions and means to achieve common goals where they exist .
Maximum liberty is achieved when institutions are controlled by the people who construct and maintain them , but also by the people who are affected by them or else the institution will always infringe on individual sovereignty .
I do n’t mean to ‘ straw man ’ Misesean anti-Statists or Rothbardians here .
Rothbard took Mises ’ economic philosophy and the Aristotleian - Randian ethical philosophy to a more logical conclusion of free market libertarianism which he dubbed “ anarcho - capitalism ” .
The problem with Rothbard ’s self - diagnosis was that he using the flawed , reactionary interpretation of “ capitalism ” that Mises and Rand used .
Samuel E. Konkin III coined the term “ agorism ” as radical means toward a free market — understanding that without scrutiny of all institutions possessed by a government or ‘ private ’ hands , there could be no justice .
And without justice , a market could not be reasonably called “ free ” .
He responded to “ anarcho - capitalism ” and the way “ Rothbardian ” was used in a 2002 interview ( emphasis added ) :
First and foremost , agorists stress the Entrepreneur , see non-statist Capitalists ( in the sense of holders of capital , not necessary ideologically aware ) as relatively neutral drone - like non-innovators , and pro-statist Capitalists as the main Evil in the political realm … .
The “ Anarcho - capitalists ” tend to conflate the Innovator ( Entrepreneur ) and Capitalist , much as the Marxoids and cruder collectivists do… .
Agorists are strict Rothbardians , and , I would argue in this case , even more Rothbardian than Rothbard , who still had some of the older confusion in his thinking .
But he was Misesian , and Mises made the original distinction between Innovators / Arbitrageurs and Capital - holders ( i.e. , mortgage - holders , coupon - clippers , financiers , worthless heirs , landlords , etc. ) .
With the Market largely moving to the ‘ net , it is becoming ever - more pure entrepreneurial , leaving the brick ‘ n ’ mortar “ capitalist ” behind … .
Agorists , as you have undoubtedly picked up , are revolutionary ; we do n’t see the market triumphing without the collapse of the State and its ruling caste , and , as I point out in New Libertarian Manifesto , historically , they just do n’t go without unleashing senseless violence on the usually peaceful revolutionaries who then defend themseelves .
Whose Streets ?
Our Streets !
The workplace should not be the third rail of libertarian discourse .
Seeing as we ’re at work eight hours of our day and construct the remaining hours to comply with those eight hours , there ’s nothing more libertarian than self - employment or the construction of institutions where people cooperatively organize to produce and possess a mutually agreed upon portion of the fruits of their labor .
It is n’t in a human being ’s best interest to dehumanize oneself or tolerate the dehumanization efforts of others .
The imperative of capital over people as an ‘ - ism ’ is extremely dehumanizing and therefore , directly in conflict with liberty .
Is this socialism ?
The etymology of “ socialism ” ranges from stateless communism to the Soviet Union to everything I ’ve just described .
The historical usage of “ socialism ” is actually cloudier than that of “ capitalism ” .
Linguistically , it makes sense — as Sheldon Richman made the point in a lecture titled , “ Capitalism vs. the Free Market “ — that if we designed an objective linear political spectrum , it would be socialism at the left polar opposite of statism because the far extremes visualize control of the means of production as either in the hands of the government or the people .
I really ca n’t argue against this rationale with my contention that the State , like any corporation , is an inherently antisocial institution .
The primary objective of an entity is usually to preserve itself .
No matter what other motives lie in the background , those cannot be met by the entity if it ceases to exist .
The driving force of non -human entities controlled by humans is the same .
The State does n’t really own anything , justly ; it only possesses and control that which is either stolen outright , acquired with the directly stolen production from laborers or with borrowed capital that becomes odious debt on the working class .
Rothbard rationalized applying justice to the wrongfully possessed land by the State of the Soviet Union in the article , “ Confiscation and the Homestead Principle ” ( emphasis added ) :
The principle in the Communist countries should be : land to the peasants and the factories to the workers , thereby getting the property out of the hands of the State and into private , homesteading hands … .
The libertarian sees the State as a giant gang of organized criminals , who live off the theft called “ taxation ” and use the proceeds to kill , enslave , and generally push people around .
Therefore , any property in the hands of the State is in the hands of thieves , and should be liberated as quickly as possible .
Any person or group who liberates such property , who confiscates or appropriates it from the State , is performing a virtuous act and a signal service to the cause of liberty … .
Often , the most practical method of de-statizing is simply to grant the moral right of ownership on the person or group who seizes the property from the State .
Of this group , the most morally deserving are the ones who are already using the property but who have no moral complicity in the State ’s act of aggression .
These people then become the “ homesteaders ” of the stolen property and hence the rightful owners … .
Alan Milchman , in the days when he was a brilliant young libertarian activist , first pointed out that libertarians had misled themselves by making their main dichotomy “ government ” vs. “ private ” with the former bad and the latter good .
Government , he pointed out , is after all not a mystical entity but a group of individuals , “ private ” individuals if you will , acting in the manner of an organized criminal gang .
But this means that there may also be “ private ” criminals as well as people directly affiliated with the government .
What we libertarians object to , then , is not government per se but crime , what we object to is unjust or criminal property titles ; what we are for is not “ private ” property per se but just , innocent , non-criminal private property .
It is justice vs. injustice , innocence vs. criminality that must be our major libertarian focus .
Prof .
Chartier calls this application of justice “ libertarian redistribution ” ( emphasis added ) :
Libertarian redistribution is just because it employs voluntary or rectificatory means and because it is undertaken by non-state actors .
It does not require any sort of global consequentialist justification .
And it serves to empower ordinary people and compensate them for injustice … .
Libertarians rightly reject statist redistribution as a variety of slavery .
But they have every reason to embrace solidaristic , transactional , and rectificational redistribution .
A libertarian commitment to redistribution helps clearly to identify libertarianism as a species of genuine radicalism that challenges the status quo , undermines hierarchy , exclusion , and poverty , and fosters authentic empowerment .
Because the State produces nothing but destruction , it actually preserves itself through capital forcefully expropriated from the labor of not only its citizens , but also the agents within the State — more - so as you go down the ladder to that schoolteacher , marine , firefighter .
The reaction of many populist statists is to call for more ‘ democratic ’ structures to enter the political realm , but this never solves the problem inherent with existence of the State .
Democracy , linguistically translated , is ‘ people power ’ and without the power to dismantle an authoritative institution , the people will never have power .
For this reason , it ’s always in any government ’s interest to use its monopoly of force to preserve its viability by any means necessary .
The State ’s nature of being antisocial is that which makes it inherently anti-democratic .
How does a libertarian society ‘ work ’ ?
Prof .
Chomsky tells people over and over again that “ anarchism is participatory , so that means you do n’t wanna hear a speech about ” how ‘ society will work ’ .
I wo n’t pontificate like a technocrat , but the best answer to the question of how a libertarian society would work is : that ’s up to the individuals in said societies , how they cooperate to solve problems , raise production and maximize the standard of living when individuals have a direct stake in the culmination of actions within the society .
This is n’t ‘ socialist ideology ’ to ‘ enslave ’ individuals to some abstract coercive collective .
The State is a coercive collective by any definition .
Participation in society is n’t a mythical duty to serve arbitrary masters .
It ’s in any non-primitivist ’s rational self - interest to engage in interpersonal relations .
There ’s no virtue in dehumanizing one ’s self to live by an ‘ - ism ’ revolving around capital .
This is just a basic truism that without the coercive collective of the State and the compartmentalizing workplace atmosphere governing our lives , it ’s in our interest to have more control of our destinies within our own hands
Human beings are rational , social , pleasure - seeking animals with relatively infinite mental and emotional capacities .
The extremely rare quality for a group in nature to have the capacity to create , innovate and revise material objects that improve the quality of life .
The fact that these mental capacities are combined with the infinite beautiful ability to express , empathize and sympathize in our relations with one another to gut - wrenching degrees makes it in individuals ’ rational self - interest to cooperate with one another to improve the quality of life of those who improve ours .
Limiting ourselves to the adherence to dehumanizing social systems based on force , materialism and domination is anti-liberty and therefore , anti-libertarian .
The marketplace is n’t just an exchange of material goods at prices and this outlook has become a categorical imperative that inhibits people from scrutinizing the ethics of the systems which govern most of our lives : the workplace .
The market is culmination of the interdependent interactions of people within society .
Capitalist ethics isolate scrutiny to exchanges inhibiting further exchange of capital .
Libertarian ethics ought not be ignorant of the social costs forced upon non-capitalists and capitalists in all interpersonal relations , direct and indirect .
These are the costs bankrupting humanity of eudaimonia .
The ‘ Benjamin Tucker called himself a socialist ’ argument is a lazy one by itself , I feel , that advocates of freed markets are socialists .
Remember , the totalitarian , genocidal , authoritatively central planning Bolsheviks called their government the “ Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ” .
Whose philosophy or direct action you prefer more should n’t dictate your definition of “ socialism ” , either way .
Mr. Richman ’s argument that that statism and socialism are existential polar opposites and the uncompromising scrutiny of the social costs expropriated by private tyrannies , where they exist , displays ‘ socialism ’ as an accurate classification of the libertarian left .
Left and Right
The usage of ‘ left and right ’ in the 21st century has been so dumbed - down that it does n’t really mean anything .
In America , the political sector has been so centralized , exclusive and demoralized that you can be a proponent of virtually unlimited government , with nationalism as a categorical imperative and be considered ‘ left ’ or ‘ right ’ based on the difference between whether you ’re an incremental Fabian socialist or neo -Nazi extremist .
What ’s even weirder is that the extremists are viewed as the ‘ right wing ’ and the incrementalists are the ‘ left wing ’ .
The fact is that a linear spectrum is relative .
There is no objective ‘ left ’ and ‘ right ’ , but an individual spectrum can be objective if what ’s being gauged is clearly communicated .
Adherence to a certain political party of amoral cynics provides absolutely no framework for an objective spectrum .
Basically , those who identify Republicans as ‘ right ’ and Democrats as ‘ left ’ might as well be reading The Potty Book out loud .
Then , they ’d actually begin to make some sense .
The history of ‘ left ’ and ‘ right as political identifiers is chronicled well enough by Prof .
Long in the article I quoted earlier , but not so much relative to the question of what a ‘ left - libertarian ’ is .
‘ Left - libertarian ’ is not an objective classification .
‘ Libertarian ’ can be , but a ‘ left - libertarian ’ is only ‘ left ’ relative to what can be objectively defined as a ‘ right - libertarian ’ .
What distinguishes a libertarian in this spectrum better than any other description , politically , is the level of scrutiny applied to authoritative institutions .
We can label those who apply minimal scrutiny to — - or scrutiny to the minimum amount of — institutions as ‘ the right ’ and those who maximize scrutiny and the institutions scrutinized as ‘ the left ’ .
‘ The right ’ being the more conservative through their loyalty to existing institutions and ‘ the left ’ more liberal through the refusal to accept any existing institution on it face .
Establishing that the status quo is much closer to capitalism than to a free society , libertarians who identify as ‘ capitalists ’ would be within the further - right end of the spectrum and those who identify as ‘ communists ’ at the further - left .
We can reasonably put Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) and the Zapatistas as the extremists — philosophically speaking as Constitutionalist - incrementalists and revolutionary direct actors for abolition .
As a libertarian becomes more radically defiant of the status quo , the libertarian is further left .
Mutualism seems to be the purest free market philosophy , as it incorporates individual sovereignty with the pluralism — or ‘ mutual coexistence ’ — of diverse economic systems and institutions .
One could very easily mistake this as ‘ centrist ’ , but I contend that mutualists ’ disdain for ‘ change through the system ’ which already exists as placing it left - of - center .
Though , agorism is widely misunderstood as a system or “ ‘ anarcho ’ - capitalism ’ by another name ” , I contend this as incorrect .
The disdain for ‘ change within the system ’ and the practices of active resistance against direct government intervention against the individual are too uncompromising for the ‘ center ’ of this spectrum .
The direct action of non-capital , labor and innovation - based production widely separate the means from the social system of the status quo toward more radically liberal ends than the austrolibertarians who rarely scrutinize hierarchy within the workplace , let alone the Church .
The agorist does n’t really differ much from the mutualist and neither does the syndicalist .
But the two are not ‘ social systems ’ in the sense of a political spectrum .
They are means toward mutualist or communist ends .
As a syndicalist and agorist in support of a society of coexisting individuals within confederated institutions and communities , interacting within a market freed from coercion within itself and from any governing monopoly of force , where individuals own stakes in decision - making processes proportionate to the extent they are effected by said decisions , I am a left - libertarian .

She worked nights , sometimes two jobs , changing bedpans and offering solace .
When Amos D. Harring was arrested for assault , she stuck by him .
The police said he had shot someone .
She arrived in Washington County on Sept. 29 on the journey thousands of women make every year to the state ’s far reaches , where their men are locked away .
She came twice a month or even more often , sometimes alone , sometimes with her two girls , ages 16 and 4 .
This time , the three of them had driven together , 240 miles across the state from Rochester , where they had always lived .
There was to be a family visit the next day at the hulking maximum - security prison , Great Meadow Correctional Facility , where Mr. Harring , who was 30 , was doing eight years .
But that morning , she left the girls at the Budget Inn and went by herself to see him .
When she got to the turreted wall that makes Great Meadow look like some 1940s - movie prison , two investigators hustled her off .
They had recordings of the couple ’s phone conversations .
They knew about the marijuana in the condom , a tactic that was more of a prison cliché than an investigative challenge .
Three - quarters of an ounce was not much .
But any marijuana is contraband .
She was terrified as the investigators laid out their case , and confessed .
“ I am very , very , very sorry that I did this , ” she wrote , acknowledging , too , that it was not the first time .
Her husband said later that it had all been his idea .
“ I have threatened and forced her to bring drugs into the facility , ” he wrote in a notarized statement a few days after her arrest .
There was a frantic call to an aunt in Rochester to pick up the girls .
A local judge set bail at $ 10,000 , an impossible sum .
Then she landed in Alpha Pod , the spartan women ’s dormitory at the county jail , where 22 women slept on metal bunks in a concrete - block room .
She worried .
About her girls .
About her mother , a stroke victim .
About her future .
She knew a felony conviction meant any nursing home job would be gone , along with her rent - subsidized apartment and a lot of other things .
A hacker by the name of Vash posted code he dug up from SEGA 's Sonic the Hedgehog 4 official website on Game - Hackers.com .
The code is pulled straight from the game 's official flash page , and may give insight into the new episodic title heading to all big three downloadable platforms .
First , this bit of info came up in the decompiled flash code :
preorderBtn1 = new preorderBtn ( ) ;
This may indicate that there could be a retail release for the game , or an alternative method of purchasing it .
Given that it is a multi- platform game , there 's no guarantee that this would apply to the WiiWare release , but if Amazon could do it , why not SEGA ?
broniksBtn = new Sprite ( ) ;
Next , we can speculate on what a " Bronik " is .
Does the Eggman have an extra-evil brother ?
This may be supported by this bit of supplemental XML line :
< broniks text = " BADNIKS " />
Next , we veer into how long Episode 1 of Sonic 4 is .
At least , we can assume that 's what we 're speculating on , given this :
zone1 Btn zone2Btn zone3 Btn zone4Btn zonesBtn
This could mean that the first episode has a total of 4 playable zones .
Sounds like a decent enough length , if we assume that each zone has two or three levels ( like the classic games in the series ) .
Lastly , we have a series of four images that do n't seem to be in use for the flash site :
First , these images may be related to different playable characters in the game .
As the Game - Hackers poster put it , " It could suggest a blue character ( Sonic ) , green character ( Vector ? Jet ? ) , yellow character ( Tails ) , and a red character ( knuckles ) . "
Even more likely is the second bit of speculation on the title : the method of delivery for the game .
Blue may indicate its WiiWare release , Green is Xbox Live Arcade , Red is Playstation Network , and Yellow may even confirm a release for the iPhone / iPod Touch ( which Kotaku seems to have confirmed ) .
Of course , the nature of the news should be taken strictly as rumor , but keep in mind that this code comes from SEGA themselves .
Besides , the Sonic 4 site has a few countdown timers running , with roughly three days until we 'll see an update on characters , and 12 days until new concept art is revealed .
Any thoughts ?
Would you welcome more playable characters to the game , or is Sonic enough ?
Are four zones enough ?

AUSTIN , TEXAS — Joe Stack , the 53 - year - old software engineer who allegedly flew a single engine aircraft into an Austin - based IRS office on Thursday morning , was more than just a criminal or possible domestic terrorist .
He was also a musician who played the bass and accordion in a band that once crooned about how the world just is n’t made for autistic people .

The “ Band ” section of their Web site does not mention Stack , however a domain search for his name turned up numerous results .
Stack , a longtime IT worker turned alleged suicide bomber , even tried his hand at a little singing of his own , according to the site .
The band ’s Web site says that Stack played the accordion on the song “ Spook Lights of Marfa ” .

“ Then it did n’t .
My friend and former bandmate Joe Stack was a gr8 , friendly , easygoing , normal guy . ”
“ We will miss him & we are heartbroken 4 his family & 4 the pain that must have been in him , ” Eli wrote in a follow up post .

Federal authorities are treating the matter as criminal and not an act of terrorism .
The district ’s congressman , Rep. Lloyd Dogget ( D - TX ) , called the attack an act of “ domestic terrorism . ”

College has added two wine - production programs to the school ’s fall class schedule .
The new curriculum will feature classes in viticulture , or grape growing , and enology , or wine making .
Students who enter the program can earn an associate 's degree in applied science or a certificate in grape growing / wine making , school officials said .
Classes will be offered online and during weekend camps at vineyards and wineries in the region .
Internships will also be offered .
HACC hopes to draw students from across the eastern U.S. , Canada and other cool climate , grape - growing regions , officials said .
Pennsylvania is the fourth largest wine - grape producer in the U.S. and is home to 230 wine - grape growers , HACC officials said .

WASHINGTON — Forensic scientists could soon use hand germs to help identify criminals and victims , a study said Monday .
Researchers led by Noah Fierer of the University of Colorado at Boulder swabbed individual keys on three personal computer keyboards , extracted bacterial DNA from the swabs and compared the results with bacteria on the fingertips of the keyboards ’ users .

They also lifted germs from an unspecified number of other private and public computer keyboards that the three individuals did not use to see if there was a cross-over between the bacteria on an individual ’s hands and bacteria on keyboards that had never been touched by that individual .
The bacteria on each person ’s fingers were “ personal ” and gave a much closer match to the germs on the keyboard they used than to bacteria found on keyboards they had never touched , the researchers said .
The researchers also swabbed nine personal computer mice that had not been touched for at least 12 hours and took bacteria samples from the palms of their owners .
The bacteria on each mouse were “ significantly more similar ” to those found on the owner ’s hand than to bacteria taken from 270 other hands , which were on record from previous studies .
“ Each one of us leaves a unique trail of bugs behind as we travel through our daily lives , ” said Fierer , a professor at the University of Colorado ’s ecology and evolutionary biology department , adding that hand bugs could “ become a valuable new item in the toolbox of forensic scientists . ”

Hand germs are abundant , can be lifted from small areas and are remarkably hardy .
The researchers found that colonies of hand bacteria remain essentially unchanged after two weeks at room temperature , and recovered within hours of handwashing .
Fingerprints , however , can be smudged or impossible to obtain , such as on fabric .
And unless there is blood , tissue , semen or saliva on an object , it is often difficult to obtain enough human DNA for forensic identification , said the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .

“ Given the abundance of bacterial cells on the skin surface … it may be easier to recover bacterial DNA than human DNA from touched surfaces although additional studies are needed to confirm that this is actually true , ” the study said .

Kitchen sinks are apparently too expensive to mail for some frustrated fringe - dwelling conservatives who have lost their minds over health reform .
“ Rep. Betty McCollum , D - Minnesota , was one of several members of Congress who reported receiving obscene and threatening letters after voting for the health care reform bill passed by Democrats on Sunday , ” CNN ’s Political Ticker reports .

But her spokeswoman told CNN that inside one letter received Thursday was a condom , removed from its original packaging .
McCollum ’s spokeswoman Maria Reppas said Thursday that the congresswoman ’s district office in St. Paul received the condom in an envelope dated March 23 , along with an anonymous typed letter reading : “ Betty McCollum you ’ve been dry f***** by the liberal party . ”
The condom had been removed from its original packaging and placed in a plastic bag , according to McCollum ’s district director .
McCollum ’s office said the U.S. Capitol Police and local law enforcement are investigating the package along with another one received Thursday .
Her office also reported receiving part of a shredded American flag doused in gasoline and a typed letter addressed to McCollum , Rep. Keith Ellison , Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Sen. Al Franken – all Democrats from Minnesota .
All Headline News adds ,
“ The letter accompanying the flag stated each member received a part of the flag representing Obama and ‘ your liberal filth , ' ” the article continues .
“ The letter goes on to say [ Democrats ] have tainted the government and the country with Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ dirt , shame corruption and slime .

This is too much even for conservatives like Dan Riehl , who recently blogged that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid should “ pull the plug ” on his wife after she was injured in an auto crash , adding , “ you can bury her during recess on your own time and dime . ”
“ I denounce this stupid behavior , ” Riehl wrote Thursday evening , but could n’t resist adding , “ Everyone knows it ’s dry h***** , not dry f***** and it does n’t require a condom . ”
Riehl continued , “ What kind of idiots are behind this stuff , anyway ?
This would be painful for both parties , literally speaking . ”
After the tanker company Maran Tankers Management paid a record $ 5.5 million to free one of its tankers taken hostage by Somali pirates , a fight broke out among the pirates over how to divide the spoils .
The European Navy watched .
NYT : But disputes over the delivery of the ransom and how to divide it touched off fighting among pirates , according to the European Union Naval Force and spokesmen for the pirates .
Skiffs carrying rival bands of marauders traded fire on Sunday , even prompting one of the pirate groups to radio naval ships for help .
“ Of course , the European Union Naval Force would never intervene in a pirate fight , ” said Cmdr. John Harbour , a spokesman for the naval force , which watched the gun battle from a safe distance .
At least one pirate was reported killed in the exchange , but Commander Harbour said he could not confirm any deaths .

It is without doubt that there are people who experience romantic / erotic attractions to more than one sex .
Typically we have called this group of people bisexual .
There are many individuals who have moved away from the term finding that it is n't inclusive enough of their own feelings and identity .
Some are taken back by the stereotypes associated with bisexuality and therefore seek to distance themselves from being associated with those negative and false connotations .
Some people simply do not like that the word ' sexual ' is in the term because it implies that the orientation is only about sex when in fact that is only one aspect of it .
Finally , there are those who prefer terms such as queer , pansexual , omnisexual , and fluid to describe their identity because they find bisexuality limiting .
Bi means two and therefore many are turned off by the dichotomy that it presents .
If you are bi it means you like males and females to some degree .
Many people find that this excludes many other sexes and genders such as those who are intersex , transgender , genderqueer , androgynous or non-gendered .
That is why these new terms have popped up to describe sexual identities that are more inclusive of all people .
What about re-conceiving what bisexuality is all about ?
Bi does mean two but we do n't have to approach bisexuality as interest in two sexes ( male & female ) .
Why can't bi refer to those who are romantically / erotically attracted to both a masculine and feminine spirit that individuals offer .
By discussing the essence of an individual it eliminates all reference to gender and sex and instead focuses on the characteristics that people find attractive .
Do you think bisexuality is outdated ?
Or is there room for new interpretation that can include everyone with attractions to more than one sex and gender under an already established and understood term called bisexual ?
Hands Off the Yuan
Pick something up from your desk or countertop , anything at all .
Chances are that it was made in China .
We just tried that experiment — and our clock and stapler came from Chinese factories , along with $ 296 billion of other goods imported into the United States last year .
Those imports are the driving force behind calls for a stronger Chinese yuan and the renewed threat of a congressional bill to add a 27.5 percent tax on Chinese products — calls that China has pushed back against , with Premier Wen Jiabao reiterating the country ’s determination to keep the yuan " basically stable . "
And both are based on the assumption that if the yuan is more expensive relative to the dollar , U.S. domestic production will rise and the U.S. trade imbalance will fall .
But neither assumption is correct .
For one , U.S. domestic production is actually rising — even if employment in manufacturing is not .
The percentage of jobs in the sector has dwindled from 20 percent of the total in 1979 to 10 percent today , not due to China so much as U.S. innovation .
Over time , manufacturing has become more automated and efficient , and factories now produce more goods with fewer workers ( many of whom have transitioned into the service industries ) .
The United States today produces nearly a quarter of all global goods , up from about a fifth a decade ago — even with fewer employees .
The problems of the American factory worker are real , but cannot be solved with trade embargoes against Beijing .
China ’s dramatic manufacturing growth over the same period makes it look like Guangzhou has stolen jobs from Detroit .
But the growth of China ’s manufacturing sector , and its accompanying jobs , came at the expense of other countries in Asia , not across the Pacific .
Televisions and audio equipment that once came from Japan , for instance , are now made in China .
By 2007 , Japan produced 6 percent less of the world ’s goods than it did in 1995 while China produced 7 percent more , rising to an 11 percent share of the global total .
Goods once made in Thailand , Malaysia , and Singapore are increasingly made or assembled in Chinese factories .
What is striking about all those items on your desk is not how many are made in China , but how few are made in other Asian countries , even ones with low - cost workers and friendly trade policies .
Making Chinese products more expensive in the United States will do nothing to shift production to U.S. factories .
Let ’s say that a certain kind of cell phone costs $ 100 if made in China and $ 200 if made in the United States .
Using tariffs to increase the price of the Chinese version to $ 130 does little to make the domestically produced version more attractive , and nothing to encourage local hiring .
Furthermore , increasing the value of the yuan does not increase U.S. exports by making them cheaper abroad .
If the yuan rises in value , it does not spur Germans to start driving Fords .
Plus , a strong yuan in many cases means higher costs for U.S. goods , too .
A large proportion of goods imported from China are not end - state products , but components ready for assembly .
A U.S. auto manufacturer that uses Chinese car seats , for instance , pays more for the seats under a strengthened yuan and then either cuts into its profits or charges higher prices on the finished vehicle .
Domestic clothing companies loudly protested a proposed tax on imported cotton fabrics for precisely that reason .
If the prices of Chinese components ( like fabric ) and simple goods ( like buttons ) rise , the prices of finished products made primarily in the United States rise in turn .
All that does is increase costs for American consumers .
A rise in the yuan , though , would nudge production toward other developing countries , giving the United States an artificial indicator of success : the trade deficit specific to China would fall .
But the overall trade imbalance would likely actually worsen .
To buy the same $ 100 phone , an American would send $ 130 to Beijing or perhaps $ 120 to Singapore .
In either case , more dollars would go abroad for the same goods .
In the case of an iPhone , the real cost in the store is closer to $ 300 — but very little of that money goes to China , whose workers assemble the device .
That final step adds just $ 4 of value to the phone , whose components come from other countries .
Singapore builds the core processor , and the United States provides the touch screen — and keeps most of the profit .
If the proposed 27.5 percent tax applies only to the $ 4 assembly , the overall cost will rise just one dollar , hardly affecting consumer choices .
But if it were applied to the whole phone , pushing the price closer to $ 400 , any drop in demand would cause greater losses to American firms than to Chinese ones .
The trade deficit will not improve even with goods made entirely in China if the tariff ( or increased value of the yuan ) exceeds the impact on consumer demand .
When Chinese goods leap in price 30 percent , Americans cut back their purchases .
Imagine that before the price increase , every day 10 Americans bought a shirt for $ 10 .
At the increased $ 13 price , though , two of them ( 20 percent ) decide to skip the purchase .
The other eight now pay a total of $ 104 — more than all 10 did before .
The rising prices make the trade deficit worse because it takes more money to buy fewer items .
Still , it remains the rule that policy recommendations about exports focus nearly exclusively on currencies — ignoring the economic realities .
For instance , about 90 percent of U.S. production is consumed domestically , so any move that increases the cost of production is borne primarily by Americans .
Moreover , policy recommendations about exchange rates neglect the fact that foreign exchanges are high volume and highly volatile , hardly providing a solid foundation for Washington initiatives .
There is a better way to improve the U.S. trade deficit and help American workers and consumers .
To do so , Washington needs to help provide opportunities for U.S. exporters .
A better economic grounding can be found in the exchange of actual goods and services .
Because U.S. manufacturing output has grown but domestic demand has wavered , foreign markets offer a natural opportunity .
China often protests that it would like to import more from the United States , but there are excessive U.S. export controls — such as on security - related goods , like closed - circuit cameras .
The White House estimates than more $ 40 billion in additional goods could be sold annually without any threat to national defense .
There is also truth to Washington ’s claim that Beijing could do more to open its markets to U.S. goods and that so doing would benefit both Chinese consumers and U.S. producers .
For instance , the United States has world - class companies in fields such as express delivery , financial services , consumer safety , and medical products — services and products in demand in China .
But China restricts the activities of foreign firms and has currency controls that make it difficult for mainland companies to buy U.S. services .
Removing such impediments would heighten trade as much as $ 60 billion a year , Oxford Economics estimated in 2006 .
Further gains could be made through increased Chinese enforcement of intellectual property protections and patents , improving the demand for genuine American products .
Unlike import tariffs , which China has met with retaliatory measures , market access and product protections are areas where China has shown a willingness to negotiate for mutual benefit .
That benefit might prove substantial , if pursued on a wiser course than through currency intervention .
The currency market is enormous and volatile , and it is a poor place to pin hopes for stable improvement .
The United States and its skilled workers will see more success by focusing on improving ways to get their goods and services to the billions of people who want them .

Scientists agree practicals are vital Science teachers are doing fewer practical experiments because of the demands of the curriculum , tests and badly behaved pupils , a poll suggests .
Online research among 1,300 teachers by the government - funded Science Learning Centres found 96 % said they faced obstacles to doing practical lessons .
Two thirds blamed pressure from the curriculum while four in 10 blamed the demands of testing and marking .
Pupils ' behaviour was cited by 29 % , and one in four blamed a lack of equipment .
Only one in 10 said health and safety fears were an issue .
Director of the National Science Learning Centre Professor Sir John Holman said : " Learning science without practicals is the equivalent of studying literature without books .
Activities such as ripple tanks , dissection and microbiology , which were once to be found in school science labs up and down the country , are becoming endangered species
Professor Sir John Holman , Director , National Science Learning Centre " Experimental evidence is the mainstay of science and the UK has a very strong tradition of scientific practical work in schools .
" It concerns me that , for a range of reasons , many teachers currently feel unable to dedicate as much time to practical work in the classroom as they would like .
" Activities such as ripple tanks , dissection and microbiology , which were once to be found in school science labs up and down the country , are becoming endangered species . "
The survey suggests that time for experiments falls as pupils go up through secondary school , the Science Learning Centres say .
While 63 % of Key Stage 3 teachers ( teaching 11 to 14 - year - olds ) said they spent 40 % of their teaching time on practical work , 43 % of Key Stage 4 teachers said the same and just 28 % of those teaching over - 16s did so .

Who are Israel ’s true friends ?
( Hint : it ’s not AIPAC )
I ’ve been fighting the temptation to weigh in on the current " crisis " between the United States and Israel — Lord knows I ’ve already said a lot on this issue over the past few years — but a few comments are in order .
As one would expect , hard - line groups in the Israel lobby like AIPAC , the Conference of Presidents , JINSA and WINEP are now trying to pin the blame for the rift on the Obama administration .
They want to portray Obama as insufficiently supportive of the Jewish state , in order to force him to back off the same way he did during last summer ’s confrontation with Netanyahu over a settlement freeze .
This view has it exactly backwards .
Whatever you might think of its strategy or its tactics , the Obama administration has been genuinely committed to achieving a two - state solution before it is too late .
This polichy is not an act of hostility toward Israel ; on the contrary , it is an act of extraordinary friendship for Obama to keep this difficult item on an already overcrowded agenda .
As former prime minister Ehud Olmert and current defense minister Ehud Barak have warned :
If the two - state solution fails , the Palestinians will be occupied forever and Israel will become an apartheid state .
Instead of helping Israel drive itself off a cliff — as George W. Bush did — the Obama administration is trying to prevent that disastrous outcome .
And because Obama ’s team understands that the relentless expansion of Israel ’s illegal settlements is making a two - state solution increasingly difficult to realize , they believe that a halt to settlement building is a key part of a successful peace process .
That includes East Jerusalem , by the way , whose annexation by Israel in 1967 is regarded as illegal by the rest of the world , including the United States .
Achieving a two - state solution is obviously in America ’s strategic interest as well , because it would remove one of the major sources of anti-Americanism in the Arab and Muslim world .
The vast majority of Muslims reject al Qaeda and its murderous methods , for example , but they share its harsh views about U.S. policy towards the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
A two - state solution wo n’t solve all of our problems in the region , of course , but it would make a lot of them easier to address .
It ’s clear that the U.S. military , which now has a lot of experience in the region , thinks so too .
As Centcom commander General David Petraeus told the Armed Services Committee earlier today :
The enduring hostilities between Israel and some of its neighbors present distinct challenges to our ability to advance our interests in the AOR [ area of operational responsibility ] .
Israeli -Palestinian tensions often flare into violence and large - scale armed confrontations .
The conflict foments anti-American sentiment , due to a perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel .
Arab anger over the Palestinian question limits the strength and depth of U.S. partnerships with governments and peoples in the AOR and weakens the legitimacy of moderate regimes in the Arab world .
Meanwhile , al - Qaeda and other militant groups exploit that anger to mobilize support .
The conflict also gives Iran influence in the Arab world through its clients , Lebanese Hizballah and Hamas . "
A two state solution is also the best guarantee of Israel ’s long - term future .
By showing real backbone this time and explaining to the American people why his approach is right , Obama could be a true friend to the Jewish state .
Netanyahu , AIPAC and the rest of the " status quo " lobby do n’t get that , and neither do narrow - minded politicians like Joe Lieberman or John McCain .
They seem to think it is okay for Israel to keep expanding its control over Palestinian lands and that the United States should back Israel ’s actions no matter what it does .
When disputes arise they should be handled privately , because , as Lieberman put it , the U.S. and Israel are " family . "
Not true , of course : the United States and Israel are separate countries whose interests are not always identical , and sometimes it makes sense to air those differences in public .
The " Christian Zionists " are even worse :
They think Israel should control these lands forever in order to fulfill their wacky interpretation of Old Testament prophecy and bring the " end- times " closer .
Never mind what happens to Israel itself in the process .
In fact , these people are false friends of Israel , because their recommended course of action will keep it on its current dangerous path .
So when you hear them defend the special relationship , or when they accuse Obama or Mitchell or Biden or Clinton of putting unwarranted pressure on Israel , ask them what their long - term solution is .
Do they think Israel should control all the territory that once was Mandate Palestine ?
If so , do they favor a one - party democracy in which Jews and Arabs get equal voting rights , or an apartheid state in which Jews rule over stateless Palestinians ?
Or are they in favor of ethnic cleansing , the same way that former House Speaker Dick Armey was ?
Or perhaps they support Netanyahu ’s bizarre version of " two - states , " where Israel keeps all of Jerusalem and confines the Palestinians to a handful of dismembered Bantustans under Israeli control ?
Those are the only alternatives to a viable two - state solution , and if you do n’t like them , then you should give Obama credit for his efforts and hope that he holds his ground this time .
Because time really is running out .

A Hamas leader has disowned his son after the younger man claimed he spied for Israel .
Hamas Web sites on Monday quoted a letter by Sheik Hassan Yousef disowning the son .
Hamas said the letter was smuggled out of the Israeli prison where he is being held .
The elder Yousef , who helped found the militant Islamic group two decades ago , was humiliated last year when his son Mosab announced he had converted to Christianity .
Monday 's announcement means the son loses his inheritance and the family will never speak to him — or about him — again .
American Story Tellers
Short stories have always been popular no matter the age , class and social orientation of the reader .
American short story writers have been read all across the world , the most popular ones being translated into multiple languages , bringing them closer to the different cultural scenarios .
This way , appearing just as short chunks among the stream of life , short stories have poignantly made way to people ’s hearts .
It is possible to relate with short stories more than with longer works due to their easy accessibility and nature representing a greater whole through a chunk of nugget .
These pearls and gems of stories thus go on to create some of the most influenced cross cultural references .
American short stories , at their best , have had this adaptive quality more than any other short stories emerging from other countries .
The following is a list of the most widely embraced short story writers from America :
1. Chuck Palahniuk :
He has been the famed author of “ Fight Club ” , a story that went beyond all limitations to prove its popularity among people .
Over the years , it has been expressed through various medium .
People have been able to relate to the wide appeal of a story that gets as real as this .
Palahniuk dedicated his life at writing a story every day and became one of the creators of the most important stories that the world has ever seen .
His Ray Bradbury like ritual shot him to fame .
Most of his stories throb with originality and pulsating life .
His infamous story “ Guts ” has caused several people to faint as he would read them out at book signings .
He bridged all conventions of story writing to create something unique and totally trademark of his own .
2. Washington Irving :
The famous American writer , essayist , biographer as well as historian , began his writing career in the early 19th century .
His best known stories remain “ The Legend of Sleepy Hollow ” and “ Rip Van Winkle ” .

Enlarge By J. Scott Applewhite , AP President Obama signaled a thumbs - up when reporters asked about his health .
PRESIDENT'S VITAL SIGNS PRESIDENT'S VITAL SIGNS
His height : 6 - foot - 1 Obama 's results
What 's healthy Weight 179.9 pounds 166 202 Body mass index 23.7 20-27.5 Blood pressure 105/62 120/80 Total cholesterol 209 200 " Good " cholesterol ( HDL ) 62 over 45 " Bad " cholesterol ( LDL ) 138 under 130 Sources : White House , USA TODAY research WASHINGTON  President Obama , 48 , passed his physical exam Sunday , though the results show he should watch his diet and keep up his efforts to quit smoking .
" The president is in excellent health and ' fit for duty , ' " said a report from Jeffrey Kuhlman , the president 's doctor .
" All clinical data indicate that he will remain so for the duration of his presidency . "
Obama underwent his first physical as president at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda , Md. Kuhlman said the president could wait until he 's 50 ( in 2011 ) for his next physical .
After the 90 - minute exam , Obama visited with wounded soldiers who are being treated at the facility .
Kuhlman recommended changes to Obama 's diet to reduce his cholesterol level and urged him to " continue smoking cessation efforts . "
Last June , Obama acknowledged he had sometimes " fallen off the wagon " and occasionally still smoked , despite efforts to quit .
POLICY : Obama set for ' up or down vote ' on health care
The president is " doing the right things , " says Cam Patterson , a cardiologist and professor at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill .
" The stress of being president has n't made his weight go up . "
Obama 's weight , blood pressure and resting heart rate are all much lower than average , suggesting he is very physically fit and is exercising regularly , Patterson said .
He estimates that the president is in the top 25 % of men his age in terms of health .
" That does n't mean he 's without risk , " Patterson said .
" It means he 's taking care of himself . "
Obama does have several factors for heart disease , including being a man , a history of smoking and moderately high " bad cholesterol , " or LDL , Patterson said .
If this number continues to rise , Patterson said , Obama 's doctor might consider prescribing drugs to lower his cholesterol , known as statins .
Screening tests for prostate cancer and colorectal cancer found nothing suspicious , the medical report said .
Obama 's mother and grandmother died of cancer .

Nerd burlesque is all the rage these days , and our friends at Asylum recently attended the Epic Win's Holy Sh*t ... Batman !
Burlesque show in New York City , and brought back photos of its burlesque interpretations of Batman characters like Two - Face , The Joker , Riddler , and Harley Quinn .
The attention to detail ( Harley starts out as Joker 's therapist before stripping down ) is admirable , though occasionally disturbing .
While most of the act had a playful take on Batman 's rogues gallery , we 're going to need a pretty strong drink after seeing the " sexy " interpretation of Joker torturing Barbara Gordon from " The Killing Joke " -- a little too close to torture porn for our tastes .
Consider yourself warned -- and as you might imagine , many of the photos are NSFW .
We 've got an interview with Riddler performer Lefty Lucy conducted by Bonnie Biess after the jump .
Are most of the [ burlesque performers ] fans of comics ?
Lefty Lucy : All of the Epic Win girls were and are fans of comics .
A number of us even swap comics as we find new ones we love ...
My favorite comic books are definitely " Transmetropolitan , " and I love Daniel Clowes stuff , esp. " David Boring . "
I also love " Sandman , " and really enjoyed reading " Civil War " as it was coming out .
I know a lot of the girls love " Preacher " and a lot of the Alan Moore stuff ( " Watchmen , " " Promethea , " etc ) .
I also love Brian K. Vaughn and Darwyn Cooke , though I 've lost patience for Vaughn 's " Ex Machina " for awhile now .
What inspired you to play the Riddler ?
Can you give us any details on what inspired the high energy interpretive dance ?
LL : Well , I had originally been drawn to Poison Ivy , when I was first starting and did n't realize how fun and creative a male act could be .
Then , early on , I heard of and saw Nasty Canasta 's PI act , and knew I did n't have anything on her ( she is amazing - a total burlesque idol of mine ) , so I began looking in to other Batman characters .
I tend to not go for the pretty sexy characters , as I 'm more comfortable being funny , and I love old comedy and vaudeville style burlesque and storytelling .
When I was growing up , I was OBSESSED with the live action batman show , and [ Frank ] Gorshin 's performance really struck me .
Add to that my favorite color is green and that I am a chronic over - sharer myself ( Riddler 's fatal flaw is that he can't not get caught ) , and it was a no brainer .
If you could do any other comic book burlesque theme , which one would it be ?
What character would you pick to perform personally ?
LL : I 'm working on an act as Delight / Delirium from " Sandman . "
Storybook has tossed around the idea of doing a " Sandman " show , but we 're working on a few others , too , so time will tell .
But I have a song and act concept
worked out already and have been piecing together the costume for months , so I may get around to it before a themed show .
How do you all decide on what theme you will do for a show ?
How did it come to Batman ?
LL : Basically , we 're all nerds , and so Schaffer and Nelson ( the producers of the show ) will talk and if there 's an idea that thrills them and chills them to the bone , they 'll put out the feelers and see if we 're also feeling it .
Usually , we are , and start getting ideas for acts immediately .
Batman was an obvious choice .
First , we all LOVE Batman , either in comic book , movie , cartoon , or live - action form .
I know for me , personally , the Riddler was one of the very first acts I decided I wanted to do when I began performing , about a year ago .
Doing a love letter to Batman around valentines day just seemed natural for Epic
Win .
How do the performers decide on who they will play ?
LL : Divvying out the characters mostly comes down to a school yard dibs system , but can also come from the group saying , " OMG !
You 'd be an AMAZING ____ . "
Luckily , the group is pretty diverse , and we are n't the sort of people to all want to play one part .
Like I said , I 've wanted to do an act as the Riddler for sometime , so when Batman was announced as the theme , I already had dibs on the role .
Any clues on what the next themed burlesque show might be ?
LL : The theme for the next Epic Win should be announced soon , but I 'll let Schaffer and Nelson lead that announcement .

Occasionally We Will Have Our Own Opinions Or Observations To Make .
One of my ongoing projects is to go through all my favorite musical artists , listen to all their albums , and make audio CD compilations of the very best stuff .
One thing I like about audio CD's is that they have a small fixed size , so you 're forced to exercise your judgment , whereas a big hard drive is like a vacuum cleaner bag that accumulates whatever trash it happens to suck up .
I do n't imagine that anyone cares what songs I put on my multi-CD compilations of Camper Van Beethoven or Hawkwind , so I did n't write about those .
But the Beatles are the most popular and influential band of all time , and because I 'm not a huge fan , I decided to hold them to one CD .
This is something that might be interesting for other people to read or write about :
What if you had to edit the Beatles down to less than 80 minutes ?
So , after many hours of listening to the 2009 remasters of the Beatles ' UK albums and singles , here 's what I came up with .
( Note : even though I use words like " greatest " , this is purely an expression of my own personal taste , with which nobody will agree .
If you make your own one - CD Beatles page , send me the link .
For audio editing , I used mhWaveEdit in Linux .
If you 're in Windows I recommend Audacity . ) From their first two albums , Please Please Me and With The Beatles , I took nothing .
My disc is not a historical document -- it 's a collection of songs that I will actually enjoy listening to , and there are a lot of Beatles songs , especially from the early years , that I 've already heard to death .
From their third album , A Hard Day 's Night , I took only four seconds : the famous opening chord .
Originally I was going to take " Things We Said Today " , but after a few listens I got tired of it .
Some Paul McCartney songs are like sweet barbecue sauce with no meat , and no fire .
From their fourth album , Beatles For Sale , I again used the editor to take only the first minute and fourteen seconds of " I'll Follow The Sun " , because after that it just repeats and I was tight for space .
And rather than having the chord from " A Hard Day 's Night " as a separate track , I stuck it on the beginning of the wrong song .
Yes , I have no respect for the intentions of the artists .
So , through 1963 and 1964 , the track list is most ofplus the chord .
In 1965 , the Beatles released Help ! , which had John Lennon 's first great song , , and two great McCartney songs , and " Yesterday " .
The melody for " Yesterday " came to McCartney in a dream , and then he became obsessed with it and spent a year figuring out the title and lyrics .
After its release , it was the most played song on American radio for eight straight years , and it is easily the most covered song of all time .
I did n't put it on my disc because I do n't need to hear it again .
( For the same reason , I left " Stairway to Heaven " off my Led Zeppelin compilation . )
From Rubber Soul , which came later in 1965 , I took two Lennon songs , andNow we come to 1966 and Revolver , where the Beatles were musically mature but not yet self - indulgent .
I took three songs , McCartney 's , Lennon's , and George Harrison's , the first and best showcase of the classical Indian stuff that Harrison learned from Ravi Shankar .
I think it would be better without the vocals .
It was the Beatles ' policy to keep their singles off the albums .
The singles were eventually all compiled on the Past Masters discs , and I ended up taking only two .
The first , from the Revolver sessions , released as a B - side to " Paperback Writer " , is my new favorite John Lennon song : .
I had no idea how good it was until I did this project .
In 1967 , The Beatles released Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , the most influential album of all time , and frequently cited as the greatest album of all time by people who were listening to music when it came out .
I was n't quite born yet , so by the time I started listening to music , everything new on Sgt.
Peppers was old .
And when you factor out the influence , what 's left is a bunch of average songs , and one classic : .
( But I cut off the famous piano chord at the end . )
Most Beatles albums exist in both stereo and mono versions .
In the UK in the mid-1960 's , stereo was not taken seriously , so the Beatles put all their attention into the mono mixes , and then the stereo mixes were done quickly by other people .
Presumably the 2009 remastering improved the stereo versions , but there are some people who like the mono remasters better , especially on the first two albums and Sgt. Pepper's .
Since I took only one song from those three albums , I decided to go with stereo for everything .
From Magical Mystery Tour I took nothing .
" I Am The Walrus " , " Strawberry Fields " , and " Penny Lane " are , eh , pretty good .
Then in 1968 came The Beatles , the legendary White Album .
Having never listened to it straight through , I was a bit disappointed .
On a double album , Lennon manages only one good song , .
Then I took Harrison's , and one of McCartney 's greatest , .
Next , my respect for Paul McCartney increased immensely when I found out thatwas his song .
But I killed the part where the music comes back after the false ending , and replaced it with the amazing ending of , made by a wine bottle resonating on top of a speaker .
Finishing off the White Album , I used the single version of , which is much better than the album version .
From Yellow Submarine I took nothing .
Next is my favorite Beatles album , Abbey Road .
I took Lennon's , Harrison 's second greatest song , , and used the editor again for Lennon's .
I hate the bluesy vocals in the first half , but I totally love the long jam at the end , so I just took the last 3:10 .
Then I switched the order of the next two songs , becausebegins with almost the same riff that " She 's So Heavy " ends with , so they fit perfectly back to back .
Then , of course , is George Harrison 's masterpiece , .
Next I edited together two McCartney songs , , because they were recorded together and they 're always played together on the radio ( but I do n't like " The End " ) .
Finally I stuck inbecause it 's only 26 seconds long .
Let It Be was recorded in 1969 , before Abbey Road , but released after it , and was famously ruined in post - production by Phil Spector .
Then in 2002 McCartney and three engineers went back and remixed it , and released it as Let It Be ...
Naked .
The Naked version of , without the orchestral overdubs , is clearly better , and after careful listening I also chose the Naked versions of McCartney 's , and Lennon 'sand .
Also I used the Naked ordering of the songs .
And for " Two of Us " I did more editing .
It 's a great 40 second song that 's repeated four times plus some filler to push it over three minutes .
So I just took the first 40 seconds .
Finally , the reason I put Let It Be after Abbey Road was so I could end the disc with my favorite Paul McCartney song , .
After listening to the original album version , the single version , and the Naked version , I picked the original album version , which is weaker in some ways , but has by far the best guitar solo .
Final time : just over 79 minutes .
The Kama Sutra an ancient Hindu text considered to be a manual on sexual behavior has long been studied and revered for its breakthroughs in the field of human sexuality .
Upon closer examination it appears that there are sections that speak to what we quite possibly today call asexuality or grey - a that may have been ignored by readers with a sexual perspective .
The Kama Sutra recognizes that just as sexuality falls along a spectrum and some are gay , bi , or straight , that sexual desire falls along a spectrum as well .
There are nine kinds of unions described based on the level of sexual desire of an individual .
There are those labeled " small " , " middling " , or " intense " to describe their level of sexual desire and interest .
" A man is called a man of small passion whose desire at the time of sexual union is not great , whose semen is scanty , and who cannot bear the warm embraces of the female .
Those who differ from this temperament are called men of middling passion , while those of intense passion are full of desire " ( Sacred Texts ) .
The text then goes on to discuss the length of time a person sustains themselves sexually indicating that the verses above are not about the length of the sexual act but merely the desire and intensity of the behavior .
All people who are sexually involved find that there are times they are more desiring of sex than others .
Is the Kama Sutra referring only to periods of time that people are not as sexually inclined , or may the authors have been speaking to those who are to some degree asexual , or quite possibly both ?
Republican House Whip Eric Cantor may have made a Freudian slip Sunday when he told NBC ’s David Gregory that the GOP wants to “ get people more uninsured . ”
Gregory asked a panel to comment on what he called the fundamental tension of the health reform debate .
“ The tension seems to be that individual elements are popular .
You can talk to people who want better health care , better access to health care , reform .
But there ’s a lot of distrust that government can deliver this kind of care and handle it well . ”

“ The reality is Republicans do care about health care , ” Cantor replied .
“ We want to address the first and most foundational element which is cost .
Because if we can bring down cost , more people can access care .
But we also know that there is something we can do to get people more uninsured . ”
“ The problem is , ” he continued , “ with the president ’s bill it ’s about expanding Medicaid .
No one wants to go onto Medicaid .
That ’s why physicians in Florida and other states are leaving Medicaid in droves because of the imperfect reimbursement structure .
That ’s what this bill is about , is expanding the government programs that do n’t work .
We need real reform to bring down costs . ”
Democratic Chief Deputy Whip Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz jumped in to counter his assertion that Democrats would n’t address costs .
“ There ’s 47 million people in America that do n’t have insurance .
We are all paying for them because they show up at the emergency room as their primary access point for health care , ” she said .
“ In order to reduce costs we can cut a tax of $ 1000 on American families just by covering those people , ” she insisted .
“ We can also make sure that we bring down costs by broadening the pool , adding the healthiest people who are choosing right now to not carry health insurance .
Then when they get hit out of the clear blue sky by an unexpected illness , they do n’t have insurance , and we ’re all paying for it . ”

Indian authorities frown at nudity on the ramp
India suspends Fashion TV ( FTV ) for 10 days for showing topless models during a show last year .
Officials said that FTV had violated several provisions of the Cable Television Networks rules by showing women in an " obscene " manner .
The ban comes into effect at 1900 local time ( 1330GMT ) , the information and broadcasting ministry said .
In 2007 , FTV was suspended for two months for showing skimpily - clad models in the " Midnight Hot " show .
The prohibition was revoked less than a month later after the channel offered an apology and promised not to broadcast such material again .
The latest ban is for a programme aired in September 2009 when the channel showed " women with nude upper body which was offending against good taste and decency " , the ministry said in a statement .
" The visuals were found to be obscene , denigrating women and were not suitable for children and unrestricted public exhibition , " the statement added .
Alessandra Torresani : Life On “ Caprica ”
For years we ’ve caught glimpses of Alessandra Torresani through guest roles in high profile television series like JAG , Bones and Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles .
Now she ’s carrying her own show , starring as Zoe Graystone in Syfy ’s Caprica , playing the brilliant young woman who , after her death and transformation into an avatar , will ultimately inhabit the first Cylon consciousness nearly six decades prior to the events of Battlestar Galactica .
Yet how much do we really know about the young actress ?
ADD snagged a few tidbits at last week ’s Syfy Upfront to learn more about Torresani .
You have hinted that your character Zoe has a rocky road ahead .
Obviously the Caprica showrunners do not always give the cast a heads up as to what is going to be happening from week to week .
Does being left hanging like that alter your performance ?
Definitely .
There would be days where they would not tell us [ anything ] until literally we got right on set .
Sometimes they would give us advance notice —
“ This is where we think we ’re going with the character ” — [ but ] it ’s a free - for - all .
They ’ll just give it to us , and we have to take what we get .
Is it fun going back and forth between being Cylon and being human ?
It ’s fun !
I also think that the visual arts team that we have made it a lot easier .
It ’s been great .
How does this compare with other roles that you have done ?
I love it .
I love our method of working .
We ’ve got the best cast and crew .
Were you a sci- fi fan before you started working on Caprica ?
No , this is new to me .
What preconceptions of the genre did you have beforehand , and how have they changed ?
It ’s all changed .
I love sci - fi now .
I understand it , and it ’s so much deeper than just space dramas .
There ’s a lot more to it .
Outside of sci - fi , what ’s your guilty pleasure ?
Mad Men .
What do you love about that show ?
The men .
The clothes .
And the drama .
And the sex .
It ’s all so great , that show .
What do you think your fans would be surprised to learn about you ?
That I ’m kind of funny .
I try to be funny , and I try to be very relatable .
There are a lot of actors out there that are n’t so fun to be around .
Do you interact with your fans a lot through social media ?
Yeah , I love it .
I ’m convinced I ’m going to meet my soulmate at a convention .
We ’ll see what happens .

What Does The Federal Budget Freeze Look Like ?
For more on budgetary math behind the freeze please see What Does the Federal Budget Freeze Look Like ?
The amount saved from this freeze has been consistently reported as $ 15 billion in the first year and $ 250 billion over 10 years .
I hate the “ we ’re saving $ 250 billion over 10 years ” line .
It is a piece of crass political rhetoric and I ’m disappointed that the administration would use it .
If they actually implement a three year freeze on the portion of the budget they ’re talking about ( which is a big if , but let ’s assume the best ) , why measure the effects in the space of 10 years ?
The answer is “ To make the freeze look bigger ” .
They might as well say that they ’re saving a trillion dollars over the next 25 years or a hundred trillion over the next 300 years .
It is a data statement designed to trick people .
Second , I hate the “ We ’re saving all this money by not spending it ” line because it is similarly political .
If a future politician wants to play this stupid numbers game , all they have to do is “ project ” that they will spend like a crazy person next year and when the next year comes , they decided to spend like a half crazy person .
Then they can claim that they have “ saved ” all this money because they “ reduced ” their projected spending .
Keep in mind the hypocrisy on both sides of the aisle .
Overall , it looks like both sides are more interested in political gain than in having a frank discussion about the numbers and what they mean .
This should surprise no one , but I confess to finding myself somewhat dismayed that the Obama administration , for all their hype about being pro-science and pro-data , has no problem spinning the numbers in a way that decreases clear comprehension in order to increase message potency .
Where Are The Fiscal Conservatives ?
When people say they " had sex , " what transpired is anyone 's guess .
A new study from the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University found that no uniform consensus existed when a representative sample of 18 - to 96 - year - olds was asked what the term meant to them .
Is oral sex considered sex ?
It was n't to around 30 percent of the study participants .
How about anal sex ?
For around 20 percent of the participants , no .
A surprising number of older men did not consider penile - vaginal intercourse to be sex .
More than idle gossip , the answers to questions about sex can inform -- or misinform -- research , medical advice and health education efforts .
" Researchers , doctors , parents , sex educators should all be very careful and not assume that their own definition of sex is shared by the person they 're talking to , be it a patient , a student , a child or study participant , " said Brandon Hill , research associate at the Kinsey Institute .
The study , conducted in conjunction with the Rural Center for AIDS / STD Prevention in IU 's School of Health , Physical Education and Recreation , delves deeper into a question first examined in 1999 -- in the midst of a presidential sex scandal where the definition of sex was an issue .
Researchers from The Kinsey Institute asked college students what " had sex " meant to them , taking the approach , which was unique then , of polling the students on specific behaviors .
No consensus was found then , either .
The new study , published in the international health journal " Sexual Health " in February , examined whether more information helped clarify matters -- study participants were asked about specific sexual behaviors and such qualifiers as whether orgasm was reached -- and researchers also wanted to involve a more representative audience , not just college students .
" Throwing the net wider , with a more representative sample , only made it more confusing and complicated , " Hill said .
" People were even less consistent across the board . "
The study involved responses from 486 Indiana residents who took part in a telephone survey conducted by the Center for Survey Research at IU .
Participants , mostly heterosexual , were asked , " Would you say you 'had sex ' with someone if the most intimate behavior you engaged in was ... , " followed by 14 behaviorally specific items .
Here are some of the results :
Responses did not differ significantly overall for men and women .
The study involved 204 men and 282 women .
95 percent of respondents would consider penile - vaginal intercourse ( PVI ) having had sex , but this rate drops to 89 percent if there is no ejaculation .
81 percent considered penile - anal intercourse having had sex , with the rate dropping to 77 percent for men in the youngest age group ( 18 - 29 ) , 50 percent for men in the oldest age group ( 65 and up ) and 67 percent for women in the oldest age group .
71 percent and 73 percent considered oral contact with a partner 's genitals ( OG ) , either performing or receiving , as having had sex .
Men in the youngest and oldest age groups were less likely to answer " yes " compared with the middle two age groups for when they performed OG .
Significantly fewer men in the oldest age group answered " yes " for PVI ( 77 percent ) .
Hill said it is common for a doctor , when seeing a patient with symptoms of sexually transmitted infections , to ask how many sexual partners the patient has or has had .
The number will differ according to the patients ' definitions of sex .
William L. Yarber , RCAP 's senior director and co-author of the study , said its findings reaffirm the need to be specific about behaviors when talking about sex
" There 's a vagueness of what sex is in our culture and media , " Yarber said .
" If people do n't consider certain behaviors sex , they might not think sexual health messages about risk pertain to them .
The AIDS epidemic has forced us to be much more specific about behaviors , as far as identifying specific behaviors that put people at risk instead of just sex in general .
But there 's still room for improvement . "

Digby and Turkana note Sarah Palin 's most recent utterance on Twitter :
Commonsense Conservatives & lovers of America : " Do n't Retreat , Instead - RELOAD ! "
Pls see my Facebook page .
Reload ?
Really ?
Of all the images to convey about her movement , it is revealing that Sarah Palin chose one associated with violence .
Palin 's rhetoric comes amidst a surge in right - wing extremism , a time during which she should be urging cooler heads to prevail instead of fueling the most radical elements of her base .
Remember , just a few weeks ago , an anti-tax radical launched a suicide plane attack on an IRS building in Texas .
Over the past few days , anti-reform thugs have vandalized Democratic Party headquarters in several states in retribution for the passage of health care reform .
And now , today , just hours after teapartiers posted the home address of Democratic Congressman Tom Periello 's brother and told people to " stop by , " authorities found a severed gas line running to the home .
No matter that the tea party people mistakenly targeted the congressman 's brother instead of the congressman himself , their goal was clear -- to influence the political process through the threat of violence .
That 's not just way over the line , that 's terrorism .
And I do n't care how much money Sarah Palin might want to make off her political celebrity , if she were the patriot she claims to be , she'd be doing everything in her power to rein in the rising tide of right - wing extremism .
The fact that she 's not doing so undercuts everything she 's ever said about loving this country and our political system .
At best , she 's a crass opportunist .
At worst , she 's palling around with terrorists .
Update ( 11:40 AM ) : Several commenters point out that Palin's Facebook posted features more violent imagery : a map with gun sights marking the Democratic seats she 's " targeting " for GOP takeover ( including Periello's ) .
Here 's the image ( more at HuffPost ) :
As a woman , I know I ’m supposed to swoon at the sight of chocolate and lower my voice when I rhapsodize about chocolate truffles , souffles and bouchons , as if I were talking about an illicit love affair .
So the first time my then - boyfriend , now - husband brought me a box of exquisite chocolates for St. Valentine ’s Day , I squealed with delight like I knew I should -- and then promptly stowed the box in the back of the fridge .
He found them a few months later -- the cold and the cocoa butter had already rendered them dusty , and it was clear that I had n’t eaten a single one .
He looked at me , he looked down at the box he held in his hand , he looked back at me -- a look of utter shock on his face .
I was caught .
I had no choice but to confess :
I do n’t like chocolate .

I ’m actually not much for sugar at all .
Now , do n’t get me wrong .
I have yet to turn down a dessert that is offered to me .
But when it comes to cravings , I tend toward the salty and crunchy .
Say , a plate piled high with twice - fried French fries .
Or salty potato chips .
Or salty pretzels .
Or salty . . . well , you get the idea .
But then I met Crack Pie .
Sold at Momofuku Bakery & Milk Bar in Manhattan , this pie has taken New York City by storm , partly because of the audacious name , partly because of the jaw - dropping price tag -- $ 44 a pie , yes , $ 44 a pie -- and partly because anyone who has tried it , including myself , CNN bigwig Anderson Cooper and the people who are buying the 60 to 90 Crack Pies sold each day or two , ca n’t stop raving about it .
Still not convinced ?
Out - of - town demand is so high that the bakery just started shipping the pie by FedEx .
They ’ve even sought trademark protection for the name .

Crack
Pie is a twist on Chess Pie -- an old - school dessert found in the “ Joy of Cooking , ” popular because it can be made with common pantry ingredients such as butter , eggs , sugar and vanilla .
But Milk Bar pastry chef Christina Tosi ’s reimagining makes Crack Pie an original .
Instead of just a humdrum pie shell that serves as a container for the filling , Tosi dreamed up a shell that begins with a homemade oat cookie blended with a bit more butter , sugar and a healthy dash of salt .
The result is a crust that is divinely rustic and unrefined -- do n’t bother trying to get a perfect edge as you press it into the pie plate .
It just wo n’t happen .
Under Tosi ’s reconsidering , the interior of this pie takes a glug of heavy cream , a bit of milk powder to help give the mixture body and egg yolks instead of whole eggs .
Advertisement
It ’s baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes , and then 325 degrees for about 10 minutes , just until the top is golden brown .
The interior will jiggle when you remove it from the oven .
You will fear that the pie is undercooked .
But you must have faith .
It ’s not an understatement to say that this pie defies description .
But I ’ll try .
It ’s ooey - gooey .
Buttery and rich .
Silky .
Pillowy .
I ’ll wager that it ’s not like any pie you ’ve ever had before because that salty - sweet - crunchy - oaty crust is as much a part of the pie as the filling itself .
In a weird way , it remind me of kettle corn , with that one - two , salty - sweet hit that keeps you coming back for more .
And more .
And more .

Now , Tosi says Crack
Pie must be served cold .
And this is where she and I disagree .
Take it out of the oven and let it cool just a bit -- otherwise , it ’s like pouring molten lava on your tongue , and I tell you this from personal experience -- but you want it to be warm when served .
Tosi and I agree , however , on how it should be eaten .
With a spoon .
While it ’s still in the pie plate .
Advertisement
With your favorite someone .
It ’s clear that I ’m in love .
I ’m prepared to forsake all others .
In my mind , I might as well be on a Crack Pie diet -- reaching this level of dessert nirvana means I can happily pass up all other desserts forevermore .
( This must be what other women mean when they say they will do anything for chocolate . )
As for my husband , he ’s given up trying to guess what I want for Valentine ’s Day .
We ’re at that “ Here ’s the credit card , just tell me what I bought you ” stage .
But that does n’t mean romance is dead .
I know exactly what I am buying for this holiday of love , and with whom I ’m going to eat it .
And if you ask me for details , I ’ll look around to make sure no one else is listening in , drop my voice to a throaty whisper -- and tell you all about it .

The Arizona Cardinals and former Cleveland Browns quarterback Derek Anderson have agreed to a two - year contract worth $ 7.25 million , a source told ESPN.com Wednesday .
The source said the deal includes $ 3.25 million guaranteed , and with incentives would max out at $ 18.25 million .
Anderson would compete with current Cardinals quarterback Matt Leinart for the starting job .
Leinart had been the only quarterback on Arizona 's roster following the retirement of Kurt Warner .
" We have seen a tremendous amount of growth from Matt .
He has worked hard , " coach Ken Whisenhunt said Wednesday , " but I am also excited about Derek and there will be competition at that position .
That 's not anything different than what we have at other positions . "
Anderson was released by Cleveland on March 9 , ending an uneven five - year stint with the team .
He made the Pro Bowl in 2007 when he threw 29 touchdown passes and led the club to a 10 - 6 record .
" I think a fresh start was something that I wanted , " Anderson said in a conference call , " getting out of Cleveland and getting out there and compete and kind of prove that I can play .
2007 was a great year , but the last couple of years have n't been , obviously , good for me or the team I was playing on .
So I am just excited about a new opportunity with a new team . "
Anderson visited the Cardinals last Friday .
He also made a stop in Seattle .
Anderson knows Leinart is ahead of him on the depth chart .
" It was understood to me that I was going to be the No. 2 and come in and compete and do what I 've done over my career , " he said .
" I am coming into camp and everything like that and I 've gone into every training camp I have been involved in thinking I am going to play and get better .
Obviously , my job will be to push Matt and make him better , too . "
Whisenhunt said he got a text from Leinart on Wednesday saying he " knew there was going to be competition , but he was going to show he was ready to play . "
" So that indicated to me that Matt was in a good place , " the coach said . " ....
I do n't know necessarily that it was a function of any announcements about us reaching an agreement with Derek as much as it was just Matt staying in communication .
That is what we want from our players and I was excited to see that . "
Information from ESPN.com 's James Walker and John Clayton , ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter and The Associated Press is included in this report .

Analysis
More details have emerged about a cybercrime investigation that led to the takedown of a botnet containing 12 m zombie PCs and the arrest of three alleged kingpins who built and ran it .
As previously reported , the Mariposa botnet was principally geared towards stealing online login credentials for banks , email services and the like from compromised Windows PCs .
The malware infected an estimated 12.7 million computers in more than 190 countries .
The botnet was shut down on 23 December 2009 following months of collaboration between security firms Panda Security and Defence Intelligence in co-operation with the FBI and Spain 's Guardia Civil .
Half the roster of Fortune 1000 companies harboured machines infected by Mariposa at one time or another , according to Christopher Davis , chief exec at Canada - based Defence Intelligence , who first discovered the Mariposa botnet back in May 2009 .
Defence Intelligence teamed up with academics at Georgia Tech Information Security Center and security experts at PandaLabs and law enforcement to form the Mariposa Working Group in order to eradicate the botnet and bring the perpetrators to justice .
The Mariposa Working Group infiltrated the command - and - control structure of Mariposa to monitor the communication channels that relayed information from compromised systems back to the hackers who run the botnet .
Analysis of the command system laid the groundwork for the December 2009 shutdown of the botnet , as well as shedding light on how the malware operated and provided a snapshot of the current state of the underground economy .
Butterfly collectors
Mariposa ( Spanish for butterfly ) botnet malware spread through P2P networks , infected USB drives , and via MSN links that directed surfers to infected websites .
Once infected by the Mariposa bot client , compromised machines would have various strains of malware installed ( advanced keyloggers , banking trojans like Zeus , remote access trojans , etc ) by the hackers to obtain greater control of infected systems .
The botmasters made money by selling parts of the botnet to other cybercrooks , installing pay - per- install toolbars , selling stolen credentials for online services and laundering stolen bank login credentials and credit card details via an international network of money mules .
Search engine manipulation and serving pop-up ads was also part of the illegal business model behind the botnet .
The criminal gang behind Mariposa called themselves the DDP ( Días de Pesadilla or Nightmare Days ) Team .
They nearly always connected to the Mariposa controlled servers from anonymous VPN ( Virtual Private Network ) services , preventing investigators from identifying their real IP addresses .
However when the December shutdown operation happened , the gang ’s leader , alias Netkairo , panicked in his efforts to regain control of the botnet .
Netkairo made the fatal error of connecting directly from his home computer instead of using the VPN , leaving a trail of digital fingerprints that led to a series of arrests two months later .
A blog post by Panda Software explains what happened next .
Netkairo finally regained control of Mariposa and launched a denial of service attack against Defence Intelligence using all the bots in his control .
This attack seriously impacted an ISP , leaving numerous clients without an Internet connection for several hours , including several Canadian universities and government institutions .
Once again , the Mariposa Working Group managed to prevent the DDP Team from accessing Mariposa .
We changed the DNS records , so the bots could not connect to the C&C servers and receive instructions , and at that moment we saw exactly how many bots were reporting .
We were shocked to find that more than 12 million IP addresses were connecting and sending information to the C&C servers , making Mariposa one of the largest botnets in history .
On February 3 , 2010 , the Spanish Civil Guard arrested Netkairo .
After the arrest of this 31 - year - old Spaniard , police seized computer material that led to the capture of another two Spanish members of the gang : J.P.R. , 30 , a.k.a. “ jonyloleante ” , and J.B.R. , 25 , a.k.a. “ ostiator ” .
Both of them were arrested on February 24 , 2010 .
Domains used by Mariposa were unwittingly hosted by US ISP CDmon , which assisted security researchers and law enforcement officials in taking down the botnet .
The main botmaster , nicknamed “ Netkairo ” and “ hamlet1917 ” , as well as his two alleged lieutenants “ Ostiator ” and “ Johnyloleante ” have been charged with cybercrime offences .
More arrests are expected to follow .
Under Spanish law suspects are not named at this stage of proceedings .
Pedro Bustamante , senior research advisor at Panda Security , said : “ Our preliminary analysis indicates that the botmasters did not have advanced hacking skills .
" This is very alarming because it proves how sophisticated and effective malware distribution software has become , empowering relatively unskilled cyber criminals to inflict major damage and financial loss . " ®

High Level Testing
Virgil Dupras
2010-03-03
Too often , developers new to unit testing see them as a liability .
They 're hard to write , and when you want to deeply refactor your code ( for example , when you want to re-organize your classes ' respective responsibilities ) , you have to change your unit tests .
This then discourages you to refactor your code , making you less agile .
These developers will probably abandon unit testing and write on their blog that TDD sucks ( because it 's common knowledge that unit testing is good , so you can't say that it sucks .
It 's easier to attack TDD , aka. too many unit tests ) .
You know what ?
They 're right .
I think we do way too much unit testing when we should be doing integration testing instead .
If you have a class that is all neat and cute and unit tested and that a new requirement in your application requires you to split that class in two ( to do it correctly ) , you either have to change all your tests , or you implement a kludge that allows you to keep your former architecture ( do n't do that ) .
What I 've been doing for about 2 years ( for money Guru 's development , to be precise ) is what I call high level testing , which is like integration testing , but without ( or very little ) unit testing .
It has some downsides , but it 's been working great so far and has empowered me with nearly unlimited refactoring potential on the whole project .
I 'm under the impression that a lot of developers have a narrow view of unit testing , which prevents them from even considering this possibility .
I hope , with this article , to broaden their horizon a little bit .
The Accounting Example
We interrupt this program for a message of general interest .
In the real word , nobody cares about implementing the Fibonacci sequence .
Stop using it in your examples .
Stop it .
The benefits of high level testing are better illustrated with an example .
I 'll use my own ( simplified , for the purpose of the article ) use case , which is an application that does accounting .
Let 's say that we want a little app that has accounts with entries in them .
If we write the app using TDD and " normal " unit tests and we end up with something like :
class App ( object ) : def __init__( self ) : self.accounts = [ ] def add_account ( self , name ) : self.accounts.append( Account( name ) ) class Account ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , name ) : self .name = name self.entries = [ ] def add_entry ( self , description , amount ) : self.entries.append( Entry(description , amount ) ) def balance ( self ) : return sum ( e.amount for e in self.entries ) class Entry ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , description , amount ) : self .
description = description self .
amount = amount
and unit tests looking like :
from nose .
tools import eq_ from accounting import App , Account , Entry def test_entry ( ) : entry = Entry ( ' foo ' , 42 ) eq_(entry.description , ' foo ' ) eq_(entry.amount , 42 ) def test_account ( ) : account = Account ( ' foo ' ) account.add_entry ( ' bar ' , 42 ) account.add_entry ( ' baz ' , 43 ) eq_(account.entries[0].description , ' bar ' ) eq_(account.entries [ 1].description , ' baz ' ) eq_(account.balance ( ) , 42+43 ) def test_app ( ) : app = App ( ) app.add_account(' foo ' ) app.add_account(' bar ' ) eq_(app.accounts [0].name , ' foo ' ) eq_(app.accounts [ 1]. name , ' bar ' )
On top of that , you slap a nice GUI around your neat classes .
Users love your app and the suggestions keep flowing in .
Users have needs for entries that represent a transfer of money between two accounts .
They 're tired of having to manually add / edit / delete both sides of that transfer to each account .
You know what 's coming .
There 's a word for that kind of entries in the accounting world .
It 's a transaction .
This is the right thing to do , but it would completely reverse your class hierarchy .
Instead of having entries belonging to accounts , you 'd have transactions moving money between accounts .
All your tests would have to be re-written , yeaouch !
You could kludge around your current design by somehow linking entries together , but you know it would just delay the inevitable .
The temptation to throw away these unit tests and freely refactor the code becomes so strong now ...
You should have used high level testing !
With high level testing , you would have first asked yourself how the user would interact with your software .
In this case , that would be a list of account names on the left side with a " + " button underneath ( for simplicity , we overlook all other functionalities , like removal ) , and at the right of that list , a two - columns table with a " + " button and a " Balance " label underneath .
After that , you design a public API for these functionalities and make sure that your tests only use this API .
The resulting code for Account and Entry would stay the same , but your App class would get larger :
class App ( object ) : def __init__( self ) : self.accounts = [ ] def add_account ( self , name ) : self.accounts.append( Account( name ) ) def account_names ( self ) : return [ a.name for a in self.accounts ] def account_balance ( self , account_index ) : account = self.accounts[account_index ] return account.balance ( ) def add_entry ( self , account_index , description , amount ) : account = self.accounts[account_index ] account.add_entry ( description , amount ) def entry_rows ( self , account_index ) : account = self.accounts[account_index ] return [ ( e.description , e.amount ) for e in account.entries ]
and your tests would only use App 's public API :
from nose.tools import eq_ from accounting import App def test_entry_rows ( ) : app = App ( ) app.add_account ('' ) app.add_entry(0 , ' foo ' , 42 ) app.add_entry(0 , ' bar ' , 43 ) eq_(app.entry_rows (0 ) , [ ( ' foo ' , 42 ) , ( ' bar ' , 43 ) ] ) def test_account_balance ( ) : app = App ( ) app.add_account ('' ) app.add_entry(0 , ' bar ' , 42 ) app.add_entry(0 , ' baz ' , 43 ) eq_(app.account_balance(0 ) , 42+43 ) def test_account_names ( ) : app = App ( ) app.add_account(' foo ' ) app.add_account(' bar ' ) eq_(app.account_names ( ) , [ ' foo ' , ' bar ' ] )
If you build your app this way , you are then completely free to re-organize your underlying code to accommodate a new requirement .
First , just add a new test for your requirement :
def test_transfer ( ) : app = App ( ) app.add_account(' first ' ) app.add_account(' second ' ) app.add_entry(0 , ' transfer ' , 42 , transfer_index=1 ) eq_(app.entry_rows (0 ) , [ ( ' transfer ' , 42 ) ] ) eq_(app.entry_rows ( 1 ) , [ ( ' transfer ' , - 42 ) ] )
Then , after you quickly made the test pass in your old architecture ( because that 's what you 're supposed to do with TDD , making tests pass and then re-factor ) , you 're completely free to re-organize your code to something like the code below and this , without touching your tests .
class App ( object ) : def __init__( self ) : self.accounts = [ ] self .
transactions = [ ] def add_account ( self , name ) : self.accounts.append( Account( name ) ) def account_names ( self ) : return [ a.name for a in self.accounts ] def account_balance ( self , account_index ) : account = self.accounts[account_index ] return account.balance ( ) def add_entry ( self , account_index , description , amount , transfer_index=None ) : account = self.accounts [account_index ] if transfer_index is not None : transfer = self.accounts[transfer_index ] else : transfer =
None transaction = Transaction ( description , amount , account , transfer ) self.transactions.append(transaction ) account.rebuild_entries_from_transactions(self.transactions ) if transfer is not None : transfer.rebuild_entries_from_transactions(self.transactions ) def entry_rows ( self , account_index ) : account = self.accounts[account_index ] return [ ( e.description , e.amount ) for e in account.entries ] class Account ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , name ) : self .name = name self.entries = [ ] def balance ( self ) : return sum ( e.amount for e in self.entries ) def rebuild_entries_from_transactions( self , transactions ) : self.entries = [ ] for txn in transactions : if txn .
from_account is self : self.entries.append(Entry(txn.description , - txn.amount ) ) elif txn.to_account is self : self.entries.append(Entry(txn.description , txn.amount ) ) class Transaction ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , description , amount , to_account , from_account ) : self .
description = description self .
amount = amount self .
from_account = from_account self .to_account = to_account class Entry ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , description , amount ) : self .
description = description self .
amount = amount
See ?
We 've just completely changed the way our classes interact with each other without having to change our tests .
Of course , using high level testing does n't mean that you 'll never have to change tests again , because a change in your public API is always possible .
There was even one in the example : the addition of the transfer_index argument .
However , such changes are usually much less frequent and , more importantly , much less radical .
They usually only require simple search and replace in the tests .
NOTE : Technically , it was too soon to perform this refactoring because the code without transactions was simpler .
However , if there was an editing feature and a deletion feature , the code with transactions would become much simpler .
This refactoring was , again , for the purpose of the article .
The Downsides
This nearly unlimited refactoring potential comes at a price .
The biggest downside is that it makes tests more complex .
For every little thing that you want to test , you have to have the whole App setup .
For example , if you want to add amount formatting to your app , you ca n't just add a format_amount ( ) function and test it in isolation ( well , you can , but that limits your refactoring potential ) .
You have to create an App instance , add an account , add an entry and then test the formatting .
The solution to that is to build a testing framework specific to your application .
You have lots of tests that create an app with an account with an entry in it ?
Build a app_with_entry ( description , amount ) helper function and use it in your tests .
It might sound like an hackish way to solve the problem , but in the case of money Guru , a rather nicely designed helper suite emerged from the initially hackish code ( I love the concept of code " emerging " and " evolving " ... ) .
The key to this is to keep test - writing convenient .
If you start every test with a big sigh of total boringness , then you need to write yourself some helper code .
Another downside is the public API .
If you make all your calls go through that App instance , you 'll end up with a huge and ugly unit .
The solution to this problem , again , is open ended .
For moneyGuru , interactions with the GUI are handled by individual public controllers .
For each GUI element , a table for example , there 's a controller that provides a public API for the view to use .
This controller then talks to the " core " of the application .
Tests only use these public controllers to manipulate the app .
The end result is pretty nice looking and works very well for money Guru , but I 'm sure that there are other ways to deal with this problem .
NOTE : Curious about moneyGuru ?
The code is publicly available .
Conclusion
As with cross - toolkit software , high level testing is something that works very well for me but that seems to be overlooked by a lot of developers .
There 's also a fair part of TDD 's critic that is centered around how time - consuming and error - prone constant unit tests changing is .
Hopefully , this testing method will be considered more in the future and TDD critics will start to have more valid arguments .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New York City must pay $ 33 million in damages to thousands of victims of illegal strip searches conducted in city jails over an eight - year period , a U.S. judge ordered on Monday .
The settlement resulted from a class - action lawsuit that claimed that between 1999 and 2007 , correctional officers subjected detainees to invasive and humiliating strip searches on their admission to city jails .
The crimes the detainees committed , the suit alleged , were too minor to warrant the extensive searches the city ’s Department of Corrections conducted .
“ We are pleased that this serious deprivation of rights has been redressed for the tens of thousands of people who suffered these humiliating strip searches , ” Richard Emery , lead attorney for the class , said in a statement .
The suit described a grizzly ambience for detainees as they were brought to jail before trial : “ Each person was required to fully disrobe and stand naked for DOC officers to visually inspect his or her armpits , oral cavity , ears , nose , and navel , ” court documents said .
“ The detainee also had to squat or stand with his or her legs spread and body bent forward at the waist so that an officer could visually examine the detainee ’s genitalia and anal cavity .
Women were also required to lift their breasts . ”
Civil rights activists called the decision it an “ important settlement . ”
“ The Department of Corrections has no business subjecting an accused turnstile jumper or shoplifter to a strip search if there is no individualized suspicion of having a weapon or contraband , ” said New York Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Donna Lieberman .
City officials said jail procedures were changed in 2007 , and that privacy was now being protected .
“ The City of New York and its Department of Correction have worked diligently to ensure that both safety and privacy are given high consideration during intake search procedures , ” said Genevieve Nelson , senior counsel at the New York City Law Department .
The settlement was given preliminary approval by Manhattan federal Judge John Koeltl on Monday .
Victims must fill out claims before the judge grants final payment approval .
If about 15 percent of the 100,000 members of the class file for damages , they can expect up to $ 1,900 each out of the $ 29 million of settlement cash , class lawyer Mariann Wang said .
The boss of BT has criticised the government 's plans to cut - off persistent illegal file - sharers from their internet accounts , suggesting that fining them would be a far more progressive option .
British Telecom 's Chief Exec , Ian Livingston , has teamed up with a number of other key industry figures and written a letter to the Financial Times urging that changes be made to the Digital Economy Bill .
Unnatural justice
Plans to cut off filesharers go against what Mr Livingston refers to as ' natural justice ' and instead he wants to see those accused of filesharing either pay a fine or fight their case in a court of law .
ISPs will no doubt see this as a preferable option to the current suggestions in the Digital Economy Bill , which , if ratified , will essentially see them being forced to cut off their own customers .
The BT boss said that this alternative approach would " create a fund " and " you get some good , rather than getting some hurt out of people infringing copyright " .

Climactic changes might currently be threatening the survival of polar bears ( Ursus maritimus ) , but similar shifts appear to have played an important part in bringing the species into existence in the not too distant past .
Researchers announced today that they have sequenced the mitochondrial genome of an ancient polar bear .
The genetic traces they found in the bear 's 110,000 - to 130,000 - year - old jawbone reveal that the species likely split from brown bears ( U. arctos ) just 150,000 years ago , at a time when specializing in arctic living quickly became an advantage rather than a liability .
The species ' rapid evolution sheds new light on one of the emblematic species of climate change .
Although the breed has become a popular flagship species for the issue , scientists knew little about how past climate affected the bear 's evolutionary success .
The new genetic portrait gives a firmer frame to the polar bear 's relatively rapid adaptations in the past .
" From a conservation perspective it does tell us the polar bear has been through warming periods before , " says Lisette Waits , a professor in the Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources at the University of Idaho , who was not involved with the research .
The bear 's mitochondrial genome is the oldest one yet reported from a mammal — nearly twice as old as the mammoth genome .
The results were published in the March 1 online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Parsing the polar bear
To arrive at the new portrait of polar bear evolution , the researchers used high throughput sequencing ( a speedy DNA sequencing technique ) to compare the genetic information gleaned from the ancient polar bear jawbone with that of six mitochondrial genomes of two modern polar bears and four brown bears from various habitats .
They found that the polar bear whose jawbone was sequenced " existed very close to the most recent common ancestor of polar bears and brown bears . "
Previous estimates of polar bear evolution had placed the split any where from 70,000 years ago to more than one million years ago .
A mitochondrial genome does not give away physiological secrets like the more complete nuclear genome ( such as the 4,000 - year - old one recently completed for an ancient human ) .
So the genetic fragments cannot tell us the color or thickness of this particular animal 's fur .
But it does lend some perspective to the genetic pedigree of the species and individual .
Judging from comparisons of modern bear genetics , it is estimated that the common ancestors of truly modern polar bears lived about 45,000 years ago , surviving what may have been a population bottleneck resulting from changing climate patterns .
Discovering the jawbone ( from the bear 's left mandible ) was an accomplishment in itself .
" Just finding such an ancient fossil was pretty magnificent , " says Charlotte Lindqvist , a research assistant professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo and lead author of the study .
As the researchers pointed out , because polar bears live primarily on sea ice , their remains often end up in the ocean .
But this rare relic was found in 2004 on a small spit of land on the Norway 's Svalbard Island .
Having been preserved in large part by the cold , dry climate , the fragment , which includes a canine tooth , still held some genetic remnants .
" That was pretty astonishing as well , " Lindqvist says .
She and her colleagues were also able to ascertain a bit about the bear 's eating habits .
" From isotope analysis , we were able to get a good idea of its feeding ecology , and it fits very well at the top of the feeding chain of marine mammals " like polar bears today , she notes .
And even without the genetic revelations , the jawbone itself gives a few hints about the individual .
" We can say it was probably a male adult polar bear of a size which can be found in modern polar bears and had a feeding ecology similar to today , " Lindqvist says .
" I 'm really impressed with their accomplishment , " says Waits , who had previously published estimates about the genetic origins of polar bears that align closely with the new findings .
Kissing cousins
The news of these findings comes on the heels of a February report that grizzly bears have been encroaching onto polar bear territory in Canada 's Wapusk National Park in Manitoba .
The observation has concerned many conservationists , who worry about the grizzlies competing with — or even attacking — polar bears .
But competitors though they may be , grizzly bears ( being of the brown bear subspecies Ursus arctos horribilis ) are such close relatives that the two species can produce fertile offspring .
The arrival of grizzlies into polar bear country opens up a fresh set of questions about the polar bear 's genetic future in the midst of new discoveries about their past .
" We know from earlier observation that polar bears and brown bears can hybridize , so there 's a whole new potential for change in speciation or change in the polar bear gene pool or change in the brown bear gene pool , " Waits says .
And polar bears are n't the only ones who harbor curiously close cousins .
One group of brown bears on Alaska 's Alexander Archipelago , in fact , has a genetic makeup more closely related to modern polar bears than their fellow brown bears elsewhere around the globe .
Conservation through climate change
Lindqvist and her team see the nuclear genome as their next step in tracking down polar bears ' past — and possibly their future .
More clues from that code , Lindqvist says , can " provide us with a genetic window into past environments and into how polar bears evolved in response to climate change . "
A nuclear genome would give the researchers more crucial information about the polar bear 's physical characteristics , elucidating how the owner of the ancient jawbone was evolving to rule over its harsh landscape .
For example , Lindqvist says , " If we 're able to retrieve more of the nuclear genome , we 'll be able to get hold of at least some genes that are known to be in charge of coat colors in other mammals . "
And lessons from these ancient and minuscule parcels of information can make a difference in preservation practices in the future .
" There are a lot of really powerful ways we can use genetics for conservation and management , " Waits says .
She is investigating the interplay between genetics and the landscape itself to better understand how changes in habitat — whether climatic or manmade — impact a species 's genetic make up over time in hopes of improving wildlife corridors and management under the conditions of climate change and continued human development .
The polar bear 's short history has already revealed itself to be one of nimble evolutionary moves .
And the new findings present " another example of how rapidly — in evolutionary terms — species can evolve , " Lindqvist notes , a lesson we know well from human evolution , as well .
" This is just yet another very astonishing example that such a specialized species can evolve fairly rapidly to probably fill an opening of habitat — a new niche — in response to climate change . "
And it promises to play an important role , the authors pointed out , in understanding " how polar bears will be able to cope with the predicted changes of their main habitat . "

As much of the country braces itself for further snow falls and freezing temperatures word reaches me from several US forecasters that the whole of the Northern Hemisphere is in for a very cold start to 2010 .
Apparently there 's been a strong downspike in something called the Arctic Oscillation Index and the North Atlantic Oscillation Index is also strongly negative .
This alignment in both atmospheric circulation patterns in a downward direction has led some forecasters in North America to predict a bitterly cold snap for the first half of January for North America and Northern Europe .
One AccuWeather senior meteorologist called Joe Bastardi is even forecasting
" cold of a variety not seen in over 25 years in a large scale is about to engulf the major energy consuming areas of the northern Hemisphere .
The first 15 days of the opening of the New Year will be the coldest , population weighted , north of 30 [ degrees ] north world wide in over 25 years . "
Some other forecasters agree .
But not the Met Office here in Britain , which is apparently sticking to its forecast of a relatively mild winter ( I think ... it's not really clear from its website ) , despite recent evidence ( ie from the mid-December onwards ) to the contrary .
Indeed , from Scotland to the Great Lakes in North America the December weather has been fiercer than it has been for quite some time .
It will be interesting to see how this pans out , especially in the context of the post - Copenhagen global warming debate .
The climate gods have not been kind to those who gathered in Copenhagen , which took place in freezing temperatures and snow flurries and broke up as the weather got even colder .
Scepticism seems to be on the rise , perhaps encouraged by the failure of the " warmist " consensus at Copenhagen and recent bitterly - cold weather .
I appreciate the current weather conditions have little bearing on long - term climate trends and should not be used in the warmist v sceptics debate about global warming , though both sides can't stop themselves when current weather would seem to bolster one side or the other .
But if January turns out to be as cold or colder than December then the Met Office will have some explaining to do : after its forecast that we were in for a BBQ summer in 2009 ( yes , I missed it too ) if it can't get its winter forecast broadly right , why should we believe its forecasts for 2020 or 2050 ?
Meanwhile I pass on this advice from one US forecaster who thinks we 're in for a tough time : " bundle up , stock up and get ready . "
Oh yes -- and Happy Hogmanay !

The size of a fingernail , this is one of six new species in its genus discovered in the last two years in southern Brazil
This cute orange toadlet , Brachycephalus pitanga , is only about half an inch long ( 10 - 14 mm ) .
It is diurnally active , lives among humid leaf litter and can on occasion be seen in large numbers in the Parque Estadual da Serra do Mar reserve and nearby , old - growth , lower montane ( up to 1,800 m in altitude ) forest of the state of São Paulo , Brazil .
This is the sixth new species in the genus named in the past two years , doubling the number endemic to the coastal rainforest of south - eastern Brazil .
The species name , pitanga , was chosen by Ana Alves and her team at the Departamento de Zoologia , Universidade Estadual Paulista , from an indigenous Tupi- Guarani word meaning " reddish " .

Leftist Hollywood stars freaked out over President Donald Trump ’s comments about white supremacists and the Proud Boys during the first presidential debate on Tuesday .
Celebrities seized on the the president ’s remarks as an opportunity to equate him and his supporters to white supremacists , while fanning the flames of panic that the commander in chief was making a veiled threat to his opponents .
Year to Year Change
Changes in money supply have implications both for domestic economic activity and inflation , as discussed in the previously mentioned Money Supply Special Report .
Here we show year - to - year growth as a measure of the changing money supply .
Note : A downward slope in this growth curve does not necessarily mean that the money supply is dropping .
Only if the curve goes below zero does that show money supply having contracted over a full twelve months .
Also , for money supply changes over periods of less than a year , such need to be viewed on a seasonally - adjusted basis .
Unadjusted change over short periods may show changes that are little more than regular seasonal variations .
Short - term changes also may run counter to year - to - year change , as seen in the latter part of 2009 , for example .
Money Supply Level
According to The New York Times , President Trump paid only $ 750 in federal income tax in 2016 and he will owe $ 421 million in debt payments in the coming years even as his businesses lose money .

XSS , SQL Injection and Fuzzing Barcode Cheat Sheet
I was listening to an episode of Pauldotcom , and Mick mentioned something about attacks on systems via barcode .
Because of the nature of barcodes , developers may not be expecting attacks from that vector and thus don�t sanitize their inputs properly .
I had previously written " XSS , Command and SQL Injection vectors : Beyond the Form " so this was right up my alley .
I constructed this page that lets you make barcodes in Code 93 , Code 39 , Code 39ext and Code 128A , B and C . I got the PHP libraries from these folks , which seem to be free for non profit use .
If you do n't give input to the form , the page just shows barcodes that can be useful for sort of " fuzzing " a system to see if the input is properly sanitized .
If you have problems getting them to scan , adjust the bar size .
The default tests are as follows :
< script > alert ( " test " ) </ script >
This is of course the canonical XSS attack , for more interesting ones see here ' or 1=1 -- The the canonical SQL injection attack '
Just a single quote to see if SQL queries break -- Common SQL comment to see if queries break " Just a normal quote to see if SQL queries break >
Lets see if HTML breaks < same as above , but opposite . :)
Can't print this ASCII characters 31 - 16 for fuzzing to see what breaks Can't print this ASCII characters 15-0
Please only use on your own barcode reading system .
By the way , please just ignore Clippy if you see him , he has to do with my IDS testing from before .
If you want to make your own custom barcodes type in your string in the text area below , choose your options , and hit submit .
If you just want to recode my bar codes leave the text area blank , choose your options , and hit submit .
You can also type the decimal equivalent ASCII values as comma separated string , and it will ignore what is in the textarea .

Some scientists believe dark matter ( in pink ) is everywhere in the universe Researchers in the US say they have detected two signals which could possibly indicate the presence of particles of dark matter .
But the study in Science journal reports the statistical likelihood of a detection of dark matter as 23 % .
Deep underground in a lab in Minnesota experiments to detect WIMPS , or Weakly Interacting Massive Particles have been going on since 2003 .
Scientists are currently developing an even more sensitive experiment .
" It 's a very difficult situation , " said Professor Jodi Cooley from Southern Methodist University , Dallas in the US , who led the research .
" In some ways I feel we 've been very unlucky .
It 's a very exciting time in the field
Professor Jodi Cooley ,
Southern Methodist University " Either we had a statistical fluctuation in our background or it could be that these two events are evidence of dark matter but there were n't enough of them to be sure .
" We can't rule them out as being a signal but we can't conclude that they are a signal . "
The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search ( CDMS ) , an experiment designed to detect the dark matter particles , is a joint effort by several US universities and institutes .
The scientists describe dark matter as being " the gravitational scaffolding that caused normal matter to coalesce into the galaxies we see today " .
Ordinary matter - gas , stars , planets and galaxies - is thought to make up less than 5 % of the Universe .
The rest of the cosmos is unseen , 70 % is thought to be " dark energy " and 25 % is believed to be dark matter .
Different theories
Some scientists believe dark matter is made up of WIMP subatomic particles .
These are thought to have a similar mass to the nuclei that give each atom the majority of its mass , but are predicted to " bounce off " rather than interact with any other matter .
This would make the particles themselves impossible to find .
So the detectors in the CDMS experiment are designed to pick up the tiny amount of energy that Wimps leave behind as they scatter - the only clue that might remain .
Other scientists argue that that the dark substance consists of everyday matter , but that this ordinary matter , referred to as Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects ( Machos ) , happens to radiate little or no light .
Professor Cooley hopes that the new experiment that 's being developed will speed up the process of looking for evidence of dark matter .
" It 's a very exciting time in the field , " she added .

raises some provocative scenarios in regards to Goldman 's participation in Greece 's scheme to obfuscate its debt levels .
In particular , he expects a full audit of the company , and perhaps some kind of ban :
If the Federal Reserve were an effective supervisor , it would have the political will sufficient to determine that Goldman Sachs has not been acting in accordance with its banking license .
But any meaningful action from this direction seems unlikely .
Instead , Goldman will probably be blacklisted from working with eurozone governments for the foreseeable future ; as was the case with Salomon Brothers 20 years ago , Goldman may be on its way to be banned from some government securities markets altogether .
If it is to be allowed back into this arena , it will have to address the inherent conflicts of interest between advising a government on how to put ( deceptive levels of ) lipstick on a pig and cajoling investors into buying livestock at inflated prices .
And the US government , at the highest levels , has to ask a fundamental question :
For how long does it wish to be intimately associated with Goldman Sachs and this kind of destabilizing action ?
What is the priority here - a sustainable recovery and a viable financial system , or one particular set of investment bankers ?
Police in Durham , NC , arrested Duke lacrosse accuser Crystal Gail Mangum , 33 , after she allegedly assaulted her boyfriend , set his clothes on fire in a bathtub and threatened to stab him , WRAL - TV reported Thursday .
Authorities charged her with attempted first - degree murder , five counts of arson , assault and battery , communicating threats , three counts of misdemeanor child abuse , injury to personal property , identity theft and resisting a public officer .
Shortly after 11:30 p.m. late Wednesday , police received an emergency call about a domestic dispute from a house in Lincoln St .
Authorities said they believed the call came from one of the three children inside the house .
When officers arrived , they found Mangum and her boyfriend , Milton Walker , 33 , fighting .
According to police documents , Mangum scratched , punched and threw objects at Walker and told him , “ I ’m going to stab you . ”
She then went into a bathroom and set his clothes on fire in the bathtub , police said .
Officers called the fire department to put out the flames .
Milton was not charged in the incident , police said .
The three children inside the house , aged 3 , 9 and 10 , were not injured .
Police charged Mangum with identity theft because she gave them a fake name , “ Marella Mangum , ” and age , authorities said .
She also resisted the officers who responded to the scene , according to police documents .
Mangum was being held in the Durham County Jail on no bond and was scheduled to appear in court later Thursday .
She was ordered to have no contact with Walker .
Mangum , the author of the memoir “ Last Dance for Grace , ” was a student at North Carolina Central University in 2006 and also worked as an exotic dancer when she performed at the now infamous Duke lacrosse party .
It was there , she claimed , that three white members of the team trapped her inside a bathroom and raped and sexually assaulted her .
David Evans , Collin Finnerty and Reade Seligmann were indicted on rape and other charges on the basis of her allegations but eventually exonerated after North Carolina ’s attorney general dismissed the case , citing a lack of evidence .

OTTAWA–Two big U.S. retailers may have written off Alberta 's oil sands , but the U.S. ambassador to Canada says the fuel is too important to his country to simply snub the controversial resource .
" If we 're looking for long - term safe and secure sources of energy , Canada , and therefore the oil sands , need to be part of it , " David Jacobson said in an interview with the Star .
Jacobson praised the " significant progress " being made in cleaning up the environmental impact of the oil sands , though he stressed that more needs to be done .
" I have been to Fort McMurray .
I have seen both the mining and the underground extraction of the oil sands .
I have met with both representatives of industry and representatives of environmental groups and representatives of the First Nations who are up there .
I have learned a lot about the situation .
I 'm still not expert .
" But I will say this : I think they have made significant progress from what it looked like 10 or 15 years ago , in terms of the environmental impact of the oil sands , " Jacobson says .
" But I think they need to make significantly more progress . "
On Wednesday , organic food retailer Whole Foods Markets Ltd. , as well as the home furnishings giant , Bed Bath and Beyond , announced to fuel suppliers that they would shun gasoline refined from the Alberta oil sands .
There are now concerns in the Alberta petroleum community that the boycott will spread to something larger south of the border .
But Jacobson says he 's been learning a lot about American dependence on Canadian oil since he arrived to take up his post here last fall .
There have been a lot of slide presentations , Jacobson says , and two of the slides stand out for him .
" One of them was a list of the countries with the largest proven reserves of petroleum in the world – Canada being two , behind Saudi Arabia .
And the other 11 were probably not countries that were typically high on the list of the closest friends of the United States , " he said .
" The other slide showed that of the proven reserves of petroleum in the world that are not owned by a government , half of them are in Alberta . "
It all means the United States simply can't afford to demonize the oil sands , Jacobson says .
" The other side is that while there has been significant improvement , with respect to air , land , water degradation as a result of oil sands – and there has been – they 've got a ways to go . "
Oil sands production is condemned by environmental activists because the process used to refine the oil emits significantly more carbon dioxide than the process used in production of other fuels .
The environmental organization ForestEthics says Wednesdy 's action by the two major retailers is just the beginning .
" At least 30 large U.S. brands are seriously considering taking action to address the brand risk of being associated with tar sands , " said ForestEthics activist Aaron Sanger .
Following the events of yesterday 's Infinity Ward firings , Activision formed a new business unit dedicated to producing one new Call of Duty game annually .
Their first announced game that we did n't already know about is a 2011 Call of Duty game in development at the newly formed Sledgehammer Games .
A press release hit the wires just moments ago , detailing the news .
The company reiterated that the Treyarch - developed Call of Duty game in production is due out this fall , while two downloadable map packs for Modern Warfare 2 are set to release sometime in 2010 .
The new game at Sledgehammer " will extend the franchise into the action - adventure genre , " according to the press release .
Sledgehammer is run by Glen Schofield and Michael Condrey , both Dead Space developer veterans .
The Call of Duty business unit falls under Philip Earl 's jurisdiction .
Earl currently manages Activision 's Asia Pacific region .
In that same paragraph , Activision confirmed that " Jason West and Vince Zampella are no longer with Infinity Ward . "
The last piece of the Activision press release says that the company is focusing on " a select number of partners " to bring the Call of Duty Franchise to Asia , " one of the fastest growing regions for online multiplayer games . "
This story , " Activision Forms Call of Duty Business Unit " was originally published by GamePro .
Canada ’s Effort to Criminalize Criticism of Israel
By Seriously Free Speech | February 11 , 2010
Israel ’s siege of Gaza has made it a “ closed zone ” – no access , no exit , cut off from the world .
By attempting to shut down criticism of Israel ’s practices , Canadian supporters of the government of Israel are creating another “ closed zone ” in Canada – in which criticism , open debate , and freedom of expression will not be allowed .
Who is doing this ?
Quietly , without authority from Parliament , an all - party group which calls itself the Canadian Parliamentary Coalition to Combat Antisemitism ( CPCCA ) has been formed to investigate antisemitism in Canada .
Not antisemitism as it is traditionally understood : discrimination against or denial of the right of Jews to live as equal members of society .
( Members of this Coalition are well aware that traditional antisemitism exists only among fringe groups in Canada . )
Instead , their focus is on something they label as the “ new antisemitism ” — which they define as criticism of the State of Israel !
WHAT IS THE CANADIAN PARLIAMENTARY COALITION TO COMBAT ANTISEMITISM ?
Whenever criticism of Israel increases , as it did in the wake of Israel ’s 2006 attack on Lebanon and after the 2009 Gaza massacre , organizations supporting the State of Israel insist that this is a symptom of a “ new antisemitism ” .
This argument is designed to deflect attention from Israel ’s real crimes by smearing those who criticise Israel .
The CPCCA , which is integral to the effort to protect Israel from criticism , was formed in March , 2009 .
It is comprised of twenty - two Parliamentarians , including members of all four parties in the House of Commons .
Jason Kenney , the Harper government ’s Minister of Citizen , Immigration and Multi-Culturalism and the Conservative government ’s point person on Israel , and Irwin Cotler , former Liberal Justice Minister and long time supporter of Israel , are ex-officio members .
( For a full list of committee members and more details on this committee go to http://www.cpcca.ca)
The CPCCA was publicly launched on June 2 , 2009 with a call for written submissions “ to consider evidence on the nature of antisemitism …. and consider further measures that might be usefully introduced ” .
It received more than 150 submissions .
Contrary to commitments made by CPCCA ’s executive director Monica Kugelnass , however , most of these submissions have not been posted on its website .
Nor has the CPCCA fulfilled its commitment to reveal the source of its funding .

WHAT IS THE CPCCA UP TO ?
The CPCCA began public hearings in Ottawa on Nov. 2 , 2009 .
Almost without exception , none of the many organizations that submitted briefs critical of the CPCCA ’s mandate or which criticized the notion of a “ new antisemitism ” were invited to make presentations to the inquiry panel .
Meanwhile , representatives of organizations which did not submit briefs , including university presidents and representatives of police departments , were called as witnesses .
Clearly the CPCCA anticipated that these submissions would support their preordained conclusion that the new antisemitism was a large and growing problem in urgent need of legislative response .
The CPCCA will issue a report at the conclusion of these hearings and “ anticipates that the Government will respond to this report no later than the fall of 2010 ” .
The Coalition ’s stated objective is to include criticism of Israel in an expanded version of existing Hate Crimes legislation .
In addition , consideration is being given to doing something similar with respect to Canadian Human Rights legislation .
Canada , viewed by Israel as one of its strongest supporters , could then provide a model for similar legislative undertakings in other countries .
WHAT IS AT STAKE ?
The essence of the “ new antisemitism ” campaign is an attempt to conflate discrimination against Jews – something which is as illegitimate as any other form of racism and discrimination and must be opposed – with criticism of the State of Israel , its actions , or its governing ideology , Zionism .
It is the view of CPCCA ex-officio member Irwin Cotler , Israel is “ the collective Jew among nations . ”
From this perspective , criticizing Israel is the same as discriminating against Jews .
At a time when racism and bigotry against many communities in Canada — First Nations , Muslims , South Asians and Chinese , Haitians among them – constitute a much greater problem than antisemitism , it is not clear why the Coalition has chosen to focus its attention solely on the latter .
The CPCCA accepts some criticism of Israel may be legitimate .
But it also declares that criticism of Israel as a Jewish State – rather than a state where all citizens enjoy equal rights – is inherently antisemitic .
That calling Israel ’s treatment of its Palestinian citizens apartheid is antisemitic .
And that supporting the growing international Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions campaign by those determined to change Israel ’s behaviour is antisemitic .
Ironically if this expanded definition of antisemitism becomes legislation , it will be possible to criticize the actions of the Canadian government but not those of the government of Israel .
Just the fear of being prosecuted is likely to create a “ chill ” on both university campuses and in the media .
But why should Israel be the one country in the world we are not allowed to criticize ?
Moreover , branding those who criticise Israel as “ antisemitic ” is part of a campaign to help organizations such as the Canadian Jewish Congress ( CJC ) and B’nai Brith — which provide uncritical support for Israel – put themselves forward as the only legitimate representatives of Canadian Jews .
While there are many Jewish organizations and individuals , both within Israel and throughout the world , whose views on Israel differ dramatically from those of the CJC and B’nai Brith , the CPCCA is not interested in hearing from those voices .
The SFSC insists that criticizing Israel is not antisemitic and that restricting debate on the illegal occupation of Gaza and the apartheid nature of Israel society will only allow the continued oppression of the Palestinian people and make a mockery of political free expression in Canada .
If we keep silent about the CPCCA , even a document like the one you are reading may ultimately be considered illegal .

​ A Seattle - based marijuana advocacy group is trying to learn the identity of the “ confidential informant ” responsible for the recent arrest of Olympia City Councilman and Mayor Pro Tem Joe Hyer on pot charges .
Hyer was arrested February 18 by agents from the forfeiture - funded and citizen - feared Thurston County Narcotics Task Force for allegedly selling marijuana .
An acquaintance of Hyer had contacted the task force and reported that he was able to get cannabis from the councilman , and that he was ready and willing to wear a wire and go “ undercover ” in an expensive , month - long , taxpayer - funded marijuana investigation cum political vendetta .
Democrat Hyer ’s high - profile arrest has already resulted in a chorus of calls for his resignation from ambitious local Republicans who see an opportunity to make political capital from the councilman ’s misfortune .
The Cannabis Defense Coalition ( CDC ) is seeking to uncover the identity of the confidential informant — who was , in reality , a political operative — who sought retribution against Hyer by making him the focus of a taxpayer - funded marijuana investigation and prosecution
The researchers are finding ways to take energy from the sun and carbon from the air to create new forms of biofuels , thanks to a semi-tropical frog species .
Their results have just been published online in 
Artificial Photosynthesis in Ranaspumin - 2 Based Foam
 ( March 5 , 2010 ) in the journal  Nano Letters . 
( It will be a cover story for the print edition in the fall . )
Research Assistant Professor David Wendell , student Jacob Todd and College of Engineering and Applied Science Dean Carlo Montemagno co-authored the paper , based on research in Montemagnos lab in the Department of Biomedical Engineering .
Their work focused on making a new artificial photosynthetic material which uses plant , bacterial , frog and fungal enzymes , trapped within a foam housing , to produce sugars from sunlight and carbon dioxide .
Foam was chosen because it can effectively concentrate the reactants but allow very good light and air penetration .
The design was based on the foam nests of a semi-tropical frog called the Tungara frog , which creates very long - lived foams for its developing tadpoles .
 The advantage for our system compared to plants and algae is that all of the captured solar energy is converted to sugars , whereas these organisms must divert a great deal of energy to other functions to maintain life and reproduce ,  says Wendell .
 Our foam also uses no soil , so food production would not be interrupted , and it can be used in highly enriched carbon dioxide environments , like the exhaust from coal - burning power plants , unlike many natural photosynthetic systems . 
He adds ,  In natural plant systems , too much carbon dioxide shuts down photosynthesis , but ours does not have this limitation due to the bacterial - based photo - capture strategy . 
There are many benefits to being able to create a plant - like foam .
 You can convert the sugars into many different things , including ethanol and other biofuels ,  Wendell explains .
 And it removes carbon dioxide from the air , but maintains current arable land for food production . 
 This new technology establishes an economical way of harnessing the physiology of living systems by creating a new generation of functional materials that intrinsically incorporates life processes into its structure ,  says Dean Montemagno .
 Specifically in this work it presents a new pathway of harvesting solar energy to produce either oil or food with efficiencies that exceed other biosolar production methodologies .
More broadly it establishes a mechanism for incorporating the functionality found in living systems into systems that we engineer and build . 
The next step for the team will be to try to make the technology feasible for large - scale applications like carbon capture at coal - burning power plants .

On “ reconciliation ” the Republicans are being such a gang of hypocritical liars it ’s shocking even for them .
It really is .
The Health Care Bill is n’t being passed through reconciliation ; it ’s being used to pass a few amendments to the bill that ’s already passed .
The Republicans have used it numerous times and themselves and for bill ’s that were far bigger in budgetary terms than this bill .
The whole thing is just an immense crock .
And it ’s borderline scandalous that any of their nonsense is even being taken serious .
E.J. Dionne has a great column explaining the whole thing .
Do read it .
Toronto police say two robbers stole $ 7,000 worth of jewelry from an unconscious elderly woman just moments before she died at a Toronto hospital .
According to police , two men entered the Toronto East General Hospital on Tuesday around 8 p.m. and began going floor to floor .
Det. Const . Nora Blackmore said the robbers then made off with the jewelry of the woman in her 70s who was in the palliative care unit .
Police say the family had just left the woman ’s bedside vigil to get some coffee when the robbers struck .
They alerted the police when the family returned and noticed some misplaced items .
By the time the police arrived around 8:45 p.m. , the victim had died .
“ The family is obviously very upset , ” Blackmore said .
“ But no one was physically hurt during this incident . ”
Hospital spokesperson Penny Walcott said it is not believed the men stole from other patients on Tuesday .
" To the best of my knowledge , there were no others , " Walcott said on Wednesday night .
The hospital has security cameras at all entrances and exits , meaning police have video of possible suspects , she said .
“ I ca n’t speak to the hospital security , but we are releasing these security images in the hopes that someone will recognize them , ” Blackmore said .
The suspects are described as white , between 20 and 30 years of age .
One male has short dark brown hair and was wearing blue jeans , a leather jacket , white running shoes and a black - and - white striped shirt .
The other man had a shaved head and was seen wearing a fedora - style hat and a dark jacket .
Police are also urging any other potential victims to come forward .

when movies lose all sense of plausibility
Thankfully for us , the future Repo Men imagines is very unlikely to happen , which makes it difficult to take its parable seriously .
There ’s money to be made from other people ’s misery .
A good example of this is the repossession industry , a currently thriving line of business due to the skyrocketing defaults in the wake of the recession .
And according to the upcoming dystopian flick Repo Men , the near future is looking even better for those who repossess the unpaid wares of their clients .
When people facing death from organ failure or in need of a new eye , or arm buy artificial organs on credit and ca n’t afford to keep up with the payments after their surgeries , they might just get a visit from a repo man who ’ll take the machines inside their bodies back .
How ?
Well , let ’s just say that a very sharp set of scalpels is involved .
Nothing personal , it ’s just their job .
So , still want that robotic liver or what ?
First and foremost , I have to ask what kind of government would allow corporations to send what amounts to a team of professional hit men to cut out people ’s organs after they miss a few monthly payments .
Yes , I know , that ’s the whole point of the antihero - doing - something - morally - questionable - has - an - epiphany - and - fights - the- system tale , but those only work when the stories are either close to real events or seem highly plausible .
The notion of legally killing people for not being able to pay their bills and recycling their used mechanical organs is just too excessive to meet that criterion .
It ’s one thing to explore the dark side of today ’s societies with a film that ’s already built on a fantastical or surreal premise .
We can go along with that .
But a setup we can imagine being outlawed in the blink of an eye is in the cinematic uncanny valley territory where films lose their potential punch .
Instead of truly considering the implications of the world being presented to us , we just brush it off as a relatively typical action flick based on a classic storyline .
The second big problem that jumped out at me when looking at the film posters and the viral site promoting the artificial organs of The Union Corporation , the fictional stronghold of the movie ’s villains , were the prices for the robotic hearts , livers , kidneys and eyes .
A heart for $ 975,000 ?
Kidneys at $ 1,048,000 a pair ?
A liver for some $ 756,000 ?
Bionic arms starting at $ 375,000 ?
Either people are being sold the very first prototypes that were custom built for them with handcrafted , never before used machinery , or natural donors are no longer an option for any patient .
Even buying organs on a black market would cost less than a tenth of the eye - popping price tags to which we ’re treated in Repo Men .
True , having artificial organs that work as well as the real thing would mean there would be no need to wait for a suitable donor heart .
Depending on the materials used for the machine , you could even minimize the risks of severe foreign - body rejection and with a new generation of power supplies for internal medical devices , they may even have a long working life .
But for decades to come , they would be a bridge between lethal organ failure and finding a suitable donor .
Still , let ’s stay with the idea of perfectly working artificial organs for just a moment since they are possible and there ’s a lot of research and development happening in this field .
However , the stratospheric prices of the film would mean that none of the resulting devices would ever be suitable for mass market use .
In reality , with the application of economies of scale , we should expect the prices of mass produced artificial organs to drop to several tens of thousands of dollars .
Today ’s most expensive and sophisticated prototype of an artificial heart costs $ 192,000 while less ambitious devices run between $ 70,000 and $ 100,000 according to the numbers floating around news sites .
The supposedly safe , efficient and effective artificial organs made by the thousand in vast industrial labs are bound to cost far less than that , just like computers today are a lot cheaper when the now ubiquitous technology was in its infancy .
Yes , the implantation could still run into six digits , but since it ’s covered by insurance companies , the patient would only be on the hook for a part of the bill , even in the worst case scenario .
And come to think of it , would n’t insurance companies of the future also try to cover proven and reliable artificial organs , thus lowering the out of pocket costs even further ?
So it seems that Repo Men managed to not only create a totally implausible set of laws for our future , but also made major mistakes when it comes to robotics , medicine , healthcare and business .
It ’s very difficult to take morality tales seriously when you know full well that everything happening as the story unfolds simply would n’t happen and a potentially terrifying allegory for what could happen if creditors are given far too much leeway to collect their debts is reduced to just another action flick based on a rather shaky premise .
We knew vaguely that Google was looking toward the living room , but the NYTimes has the details on Google TV , an ambitious platform to deliver web content to Android - based set - top boxes and TVs through partnerships with Sony , Intel , and Logitech .

Google hopes that the new platform will succeed where dozens of lesser efforts have failed — to truly and seamlessly integrate web content onto TVs , bringing services like Twitter and sites like YouTube , in addition to games , webapps , and , of course , Google 's search , to the big screen .
The Google TV software reportedly includes a version of Google 's Chrome browser for doing some light surfing , as well .

The Times says Google TV will be delivered on set - top boxes that use Intel Atom chips and run an Android - based platform , though the technology will also reportedly be built directly into Blu-ray players and TVs from Sony .
Additionally , Google is working with Logitech to built a keyboard - equipped remote control for the platform .
Though spokespeople from the companies would n't comment on the project , the Times notes that Intel and Logitech have recently put out job listings for programmers with Android experience .

Television is a relatively unexplored frontier for Google .
It 's one of the few spaces left in which the company it is yet to extend its services ( as well as its advertising . )
But Google TV is far from a sure thing .
Many companies have struggled to figure out the right user interface to finally make web on TV make sense .
Google 's interfaces tend toward the functional , rather than the beautiful , but on a big screen , the sexiness factor cannot be ignored .
Bringing web content to TVs is a role that 's still very much up for grabs .
If Google TV , which has reportedly been in works for months , is the right solution for the problem — Gmail was for web mail , Buzz was not for social networking — then it could very well could be the platform that finally brings the power of the internet to the realm of the couch - potato .

In 2005 , Christopher de Bellaigue , a British journalist , installed himself in a remote , forbidding Turkish town and , by so doing , acquired an anguished intimacy with the region ’s peoples and their secret and mythic pasts .
This extraordinary intervention — which can be read as old - fashioned Orientalism or , more generously , as a globalized conscience courageously at work or , most accurately , as a bit of both — has a reflexive subplot , namely de Bellaigue ’s own intellectual and moral odyssey , which is of an unusually vulnerable and romantic character .
As de Bellaigue freely explains in “ Rebel Land , ” a love affair drew him to Turkey in 1995 , whereupon “ the love affair ended but Turkey captivated me . ”
He stayed ( in Ankara and Istanbul , writing for The Economist ) , learned to speak Turkish fluently and , immersed in a Westernized environment , more or less unwittingly became a Kemalist , which is to say , a subscriber to the “ foundation myths ” promulgated by Kemal Ataturk and holding sway in Turkey ever since .
Notable among these are the notions that the Turkish republic is a nation - state containing no subgroups with valid claims to ethnic or political differentiation , let alone autonomy ; that the country has a European and secular essence and destiny ; and , more emotionally , that the achievement of Turkish nationhood was an enterprise reflective of a righteous people who to this day remain victimized by the self - interested incomprehension of the West .
In the grip of such prejudicial ideas , de Bellaigue in 2001 wrote an article for The New York Review of Books containing a blandly pro-Turkish account of the fate of the Ottoman Armenians .
To de Bellaigue ’s somewhat surprising surprise , this excited a furious response .
The controversy led the writer to a searching , shameful examination of his sources and his soul : “ I had been charmed by the Turks , and perhaps intimidated by their blocking silence ” about the Armenians .
“ I had helped to keep Turkey ’s past hidden . ”
It may strike some as odd that a leading authority on modern Turkey should be capable of such a blunder ; an honest scrutiny of the plentiful and detailed accounts of the 1915 events provided by ( overwhelmingly Christian ) bystanders and survivors makes the case for an Armenian genocide hard to resist .
On any view of the available materials — the Ottoman archives remain largely forbidden to scholars — the Armenians suffered a comprehensive and horrifying ethnic cleansing from their ancient homeland .

Solar Sails : State of the Art 2010
Centauri Dreams readers know that I ’m a great supporter of solar sailing as a technology that has interstellar ramifications as well as immediate practical value right here in the Solar System .
What ’s particularly appealing about the solar sail is that we ’ve already shaken out many of the problems and are ready to begin testing sails in space , which is why it ’s so frustrating to see NASA and ESA locked in to budgetary constraints that keep that vital next step from happening .
NanoSail - D is one cheap way we might fly a sail soon , and so is The Planetary Society ’s LightSail project , but as with so many aspects of the space program , we seem to be well behind earlier optimistic schedules .
In that environment , though , it ’s important to keep the goal in front of us and to continue the work on solar sail theory .
In June of 2007 , the 1st International Symposium on Solar Sailing took place at Herrsching at Lake Ammersee , Bavaria .
The 2nd in this symposium series is now scheduled for July 20 - 22 of this year at New York City College of Technology ( City Tech ) of the City University of New York .
The venue is home to solar sail experts Greg Matloff and Roman Kezerashvili .
The focus in New York will be recent advances in solar sailing technologies and near - term solar sail missions .
Particular attention is focused on hardware , enabling technologies , concepts , designs , dynamics , navigation , control , modeling and mission applications and programs .
For more information , check the ISSS 2010 site , where you can register online .
For those interested in submitting papers , abstracts are due May 15 .
The proceedings will be published to add to the substantial solar sail literature that continues to refine the concept .
As to The Planetary Society ’s plans , LightSail - 1 is to have four triangular sails constructed of 32 square meters of mylar , a configuration that will be placed 800 kilometers above the Earth to test the practicality of using sunlight as a means of propulsion .
The Society talks about a launch before the end of 2010 , but much depends upon the choice of launch vehicle — LightSail - 1 will be flying as a secondary payload on either an American or a Russian launch .
Assuming success , the next LightSail will carry a larger payload , with a third sail intended to fly on a multi- year mission that will create an early - warning station for geomagnetic storms triggered by events on the Sun .
The Planetary Society calls solar sailing “ … the only known technology that might carry out practical interstellar flight , helping pave our way to the stars . ”
Although the language is stirring , I ’ll have to disagree with the word ‘ practical ’ in that sentence given the times involved in a solar sail mission to a nearby star , and I ’m sure fusion advocates would argue that by the time we develop laser or microwave beaming methods to boost sails to faster speeds , we ’ll likely have fusion options as well .
But who can argue with the excitement of funding a solar sail mission with public and private contributions , bypassing government bureaucracies to move the state of the art forward ?
Meanwhile , we also have to keep an eye on Japan , where work continues on the IKAROS Project , a solar sail / ion engine hybrid whose first mission may fly this year .
IKAROS ( Interplanetary Kite - craft Accelerated by Radiation of the Sun ) will use thin film solar cells on the 20 - meter sail membrane to power up its ion engines , with a second , larger sail envisioned that would one day target Jupiter and the Trojan asteroids .
All told , 2010 looks to be a significant year for solar sail technologies .
And in some cases , according to the Tenth Amendment Center , the politics of states ’ rights are veering left .
Rhode Island , Vermont and Wisconsin , for example — none of them known as conservative bastions — are considering bills that would authorize , or require , governors to recall or take control of National Guard troops , asserting that federal calls to active duty have exceeded federal authority .

“ Everything we ’ve tried to keep the federal government confined to rational limits has been a failure , an utter , unrelenting failure — so why not try something else ? ” said Thomas E. Woods Jr. , a senior fellow at the Ludwig von Mises Institute , a nonprofit group in Auburn , Ala. , that researches what it calls “ the scholarship of liberty . ”
Mr. Woods , who has a Ph.D. in history , and has written widely on states ’ rights and nullification — the argument that says states can sometimes trump or disregard federal law — said he was not sure where the dots between states ’ rights and politics connected .
But he and others say that whatever it is , something politically powerful is brewing under the statehouse domes .
Other scholars say the state efforts , if pursued in the courts , would face formidable roadblocks .
Article 6 of the Constitution says federal authority outranks state authority , and on that bedrock of federalist principle rests centuries of back and forth that states have mostly lost , notably the desegregation of schools in the 1950s and ’60s .
“ Article 6 says that that federal law is supreme and that if there ’s a conflict , federal law prevails , ” said Prof.
Ruthann Robson , who teaches constitutional law at the City University of New York School of Law .
“ It ’s pretty difficult to imagine a way in which a state could prevail on many of these . ”
And while some efforts do seem headed for a direct conflict with federal laws or the Constitution , others are premised on the idea that federal courts have misinterpreted the Constitution in the federal government ’s favor .

Bill Gross , the world 's biggest bond investor , has not been in Greece for 15 years .
Yet the welfare of millions of Greeks could improve with only a few kind words from him .
Even so , he chooses not to .
From the LA offices of Pimco , the investment fund he co-founded nearly 40 years ago , Gross is sorry for the Greeks but is zealous about separating his investor from his global citizen self .
He also feels sorry for millions of Britons , whose government has to pay higher interest to lure investors after he said in January that gilts were " resting on a bed of nitroglycerine " .
Despite his sympathy , while in his office , which has a view of the Pacific , the investor always prevails .
" My clients do n't pay me to feel sorry , they pay me to bring them money .
I am tough but I have a soft side , " Gross says .
" When I go home , I do n't watch Fox [ the Murdoch - owned right - wing news channel ] and I vote for Obama . "
Given the choice , he would vote for Labour in the forthcoming UK election .
People need jobs and the economy needs to grow , he says .
" I would vote Labour .
Favouring employment versus the financial markets is a decent policy ; certainly not beneficial for the currency or the gilt market but beneficial for the people , " Gross says .
" Good for you , go for it – but beware of the consequences . "
The prospects of low interest rates and inflation , as well as a potential fall in sterling , could lose bond investors a lot of money .
These scenarios could be considered a " default " in Gross 's view – hence his comparison of Britain 's debt to volatile nitroglycerine .
Devaluation
" The UK will try to get out of 16 tonnes of debt by reflation [ low rates and high inflation ] or devaluation , " Gross says .
" The pound is going down and they will have to keep policy rates under 1 % for a long , long time because of the housing market , and because many mortgages have a floating rate . "
Gross , however , gives credit to the government for having left the door open to continuing the gilt - purchasing programme – quantitative easing – as a way to re-ignite the financial system .
Despite his ferocious criticism of British finances , he admits he holds some short - term UK bonds as they are less vulnerable to inflation .
At 65 , and with $ 2bn ( £ 1.3 bn ) to his name , Gross 's idea of a fun weekend is to have a $ 12 dinner with Sue , his wife of 25 years , in the local El Torito Mexican chain , and dedicating time to golf , stamps and his three children .
All of them are artists , encouraged by their father , who thought his big shadow might bring them more pressure than help .
Son of a steel sales executive who moved from Ohio to San Francisco when he was 10 , Gross landed in bonds by chance – he was unemployed after finishing an MBA at UCLA , when his mother found an ad for a junior credit analyst at Pacific Mutual in Newport Beach and encouraged him to apply .
Forty years and some $ 1trillion under management later , Gross still works from 4.30 am to 6 pm and has a small circle of friends .
He does n't like to socialise and hates cocktail parties .
He admits he is not a " people person " , although he declares himself anything but a " stuffed - shirt Wall Street - type " .
Mild mannered and shy , he is proud that his trading room is quiet , far from Wall Street 's tension and aggression .
Interested in people above all , he studied psychology at Duke University – although he never thought human behaviour would affect finance so much .
" It gave me a window of interest into ' animal spirits ' [ Keynes ' phrase for naive consumer confidence ] , " he says .
" I am not a quant [ quantitative analyst ] , I do n't have a 150 IQ , so you behave according to where you are , and I tried to put an amount of suspicion in the modelling of anything .
The model could get broken by animal behaviour . "
He did not trust the investment bank models that so hugely overvalued toxic assets – one factor leading to the credit crunch .
But now the worst recession since the second world war will put an end to the financial extravagance , he says .
" It was a terrible display of excess and greed .
Wall Street has had it too good for decades , it 's time for Main Street to go on the ascendancy . "
Time for people
Markets will be downsized by regulation , even if governments are slow in applying new laws .
" The sun is not setting on Wall Street – there will always be sunshine on financiers – but high noon is in the past .
It 's time for ordinary people to benefit . "
Governments should raise taxes on bankers , who " do n't deserve all this " , Gross says , including himself .
" I do n't need so much , " he says .
Economies such as the UK and the US should look to making " things , rather than paper " to prosper .
" The bubble was reflective of wealth as a function of house prices and derivatives – that 's not wealth .
The Chinese are showing us what wealth is : transforming creative and well - trained work into exportable goods . "
Gross says speculative products , such as the instruments that investors buy to protect themselves against a sovereign default , should also be withdrawn , backing a recent call by Germany and France , whose leaders have criticised speculators who use this market to bet against a country , most recently , Greece .
But Greece , as well as Spain , Britain and Portugal , have a bigger enemy than speculators : the bond vigilantes , or activist bond investors , of whom Gross is an arch - exponent .
With funds worth almost half the size of the UK economy , high - deficit European countries need Gross , and the 15,000 investors who follow his podcasts , to buy their bonds .
This year alone , Britain is due to raise £ 220 bn to pay for bailed - out banks , rising unemployment and falling taxes .
Calling Britain a " must avoid " area , and one of the highly indebted countries that Gross calls the " ring of fire " , does n't help governments market their bonds .
Asked whether he 's tempted to show some sympathy for Greece to help the country regain investors ' confidence , he is adamant : " No .
We 've seen this game before – politicians talk it up and it's back to normal ; they want to bring the vigilantes to their money .

Second TSA nominee withdraws his name
By Ed O'Keefe
Spencer S. Hsu and The Federal Eye report in Saturday 's Post : The Obama administration 's second choice to lead the Transportation Security Administration withdrew from consideration Friday , days after senators questioned his business and personal dealings as a military contractor who provided services ranging from Iraq war interrogators to private guards at the White House .
" Distractions caused by my work as a defense contractor would not be good for this Administration nor the Department of Homeland Security , " retired Army Maj.
Gen. Robert A. Harding said in a late - evening statement released by the White House .
" The president is disappointed in this outcome , " Obama spokesman Nicholas Shapiro said in a separate statement .
Obama 's previous nominee , Los Angeles airport police executive Errol Southers , withdrew from consideration in January .
He blamed stalling tactics by Republicans opposed to extending collective bargaining rights to TSA employees , but his withdrawal also followed disclosures that he gave Congress and the White House misleading information about incidents two decades ago .

Give tropical forests back to the people who live in them – and the trees will soak up your carbon for you .
Above all , keep the forests out of the hands of government .
So concludes a study that has tracked the fate of 80 forests worldwide over 15 years .
Most tropical forests – from Himalayan hill forests to the Madagascan jungle – are controlled by local and national governments .
Forest communities own and manage little more than a tenth .
They have a reputation for trashing their trees – cutting them for timber or burning them to clear land for farming .
In reality the opposite is true , according to Ashwini Chhatre of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
Hand it over
In the first study of its kind , Chhatre and Arun Agrawal of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor compared forest ownership with data on carbon sequestration , which is estimated from the size and number of trees in a forest .
Hectare - for - hectare , they found that tropical forest under local management stored more carbon than government - owned forests .
There are exceptions , says Chhatre , “ but our findings show that we can increase carbon sequestration simply by transferring ownership of forests from governments to communities ” .
One reason may be that locals protect forests best if they own them , because they have a long - term interest in ensuring the forests ’ survival .
While governments , whatever their intentions , usually license destructive logging , or preside over a free - for - all in which everyone grabs what they can because nobody believes the forest will last .

The authors suggest that locals would also make a better job of managing common pastures , coastal fisheries and water supplies .
They argue that their findings contradict a long - standing environmental idea , called the “ tragedy of the commons ” , which says that natural resources left to communal control get trashed .
In fact , says Agrawal , “ communities are perfectly capable of managing their resources sustainably ” .
Flawed plans
The research calls into question UN plans to pay governments to protect forests .
The climate change meeting in Copenhagen in December is likely to agree on a formula for a programme called Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation .
“ There is a real fear that REDD will lead to dispossession of local communities [ as ] governments stake their claim on emissions reduction credits , ” says Chhatre .
Simon Counsell of the Rainforest Foundation UK is not surprised by the findings .
“ In Brazil and elsewhere , we know the most enduring forests are in indigenous reserves , like that run by the Kayapo in the eastern Amazon – the largest protected forest in the world . ”

In 2001 , the brilliant British writer Douglas Adams left us Earthlings behind .
Before he left , however , he kindly informed us of the answer to the Ultimate Question — more specifically , the answer to “ the Ultimate Question of Life , the Universe , and Everything . ”
In case you missed it , here ’s a brief overview …
The answer was first revealed on March 29 , 1978 , when the fourth episode of Adams ’ radio creation The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 .
In that episode , Earthman Arthur Dent visits the planet Magrathea , where he meets Slartibartfast .
Slartibartfast tells
Arthur he is one of the Magrathean planet manufacturers who helped design the Earth long ago , as a project for some hyper - intelligent , pan-dimensional beings who happen to look like little white mice in our dimension .
Of course , Arthur Dent is a bit surprised to learn this .
So , Slartibartfast plays an ancient tape recording for him that explains things .
Sort of .
The narrator tells us that , millions of years ago , the mice ( i.e. , the hyper - intelligent , pan- dimensional beings ) “ got so fed up with the constant bickering about the meaning of life , which used to interrupt their favourite pastime of Brockian Ultra Cricket — a curious game which involved suddenly hitting people for no readily apparent reason and then running away — that they decided to sit down and solve the problem once and for all .
And , to this end , they built themselves a stupendous supercomputer … ”
The tape includes the initial conversations between computer technicians and the supercomputer , which they had named Deep Thought .
They ask Deep Thought if there is an answer to “ the Ultimate Question of Life , the Universe , and Everything ” and , if so , whether Deep Thought could provide it .
Deep
Thoughts answers :
“ Yes …Life , the Universe , and Everything .
There is an answer .
But I ’ll have to think about it ... the program will take me seven - and - a - half million years to run . ”
Fast forward to seven - and - a - half million years later .
The descendants of Deep Thought ’s creators anxiously await the computer ’s answer .
Deep
Thought tells them what it is , after warning that they ’re not going to like it .
He provides the answer in a series of lines that are interrupted by comments from the listeners .
When Deep
Thought ’s lines are pieced together , they comprise one of the two most famous quotations from The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy ( the other being “ Do n’t Panic ! ” ) :
“ The answer to everything … Life , the Universe , and Everything ...is... Forty - two . ”
The listeners are flabbergasted .
Forty - two !?!
Yes , that ’s it .
The number 42 .
Deep
Thought helpfully explains :
“ Now that you know that the answer to the Ultimate question of Life , the Universe , and Everything is forty - two , all you need to do now is find out what the Ultimate Question is . ”
When asked if he can tell them what the Ultimate Question is , Deep Thought says ‘ no . ’
But , he adds , another computer can be built that will :
“ A computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that organic life itself will form part of its operational matrix .
And it shall be called …the Earth . ”
If at this point you do n’t understand the Ultimate Answer or the Ultimate Question , do n’t panic .
Just listen to The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy radio series , or read the book version , published in 1979 .
Or watch the BBC Television adaptation , first aired in 1981 .
Then you ’ll probably also want to watch the 2005 movie version .
After all that , the Ultimate Question and the answer will make perfect sense .
Sort of .

Health and safety for space tourists and disputes over satellite damage among legal modules to start at Sunderland University
Would - be lawyers at a British university are taking a lesson from the Starship Enterprise and boldly going into the potential legal conundra of outer space .
For the first time in a UK syllabus , a module on law and the legal system beyond Earth 's atmosphere will be included as an option for students starting at Sunderland University in September .
" It is a fascinating topic , which many students will benefit from studying , " said Viv Kinnaird , dean of the faculty of business and law .
Topics already arising in the field include gaps in health and safety for potential space tourists , and damage to satellites from other objects orbiting the Earth .
Looking further ahead , some lawyers have raised questions about land titles on the moon or other planets .
Chris Newman , one of the lecturers who will be teaching the module , said : " It is a growing area which has relevance across commercial , company , property , environmental , intellectual property and IT practice sectors .
We think that our qualification will offer valuable knowledge in a fascinating area . "
The course will offer relief from more conventional topics in the three - year bachelor of law degree such as pensions law or conveyancing .
Ben Middleton , another of the staff lined up to teach the course , said : " We expect it to be an extremely popular module . "
The syllabus is likely to draw on earlier attempts to extend legislation into uncharted areas , such as the arguments between nations over huge sections of Antarctica .
There are no plans as yet to test students on how they would make a case for Earth law against that of other civilisations , should any be discovered .
As many as four Colorado lawmakers have come together to try and regulate medical marijuana dispensaries .
On Monday , they sent in a request to the Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to halt the ongoing raids on medical marijuana operations .
As has been stressed by the lawmakers , the raids are discouraging dispensary operators and medical marijuana patients and growers from working with them on regulations which have been proposed .
The letter was sent in jointly by Senators Chris Romer and Nancy Spence and Representatives Tom Massey and Beth McCann .
" It 's kind of hard to build trust in the environment that 's been created by these raids " , Sen .
Romer said .
While declining to share any additional comments , a Justice Department spokesperson , Tracy Schmaler , said that the agency would review the letter .
I ’ve searched around the internet to find foods that are not only palatable for eating while on a long ride , but also nutritionally functional for exercise .
I ’m going to start out with Dr. Lim ’s recipes first , since his items are on Youtube , and I believe he was the most under - appreciated member of Garmin - Slipstream last year .
Pocket Panini
Power Potatoes
Savory Rice Cakes
This one is personally my favorite .
If stored in a sealed container , they can hold up in the refridgerator for up to 2 - 3 days ; they taste great , give a salty and savory taste … and it really is like a true lunch .
Just
Make sure you get a sticky rice , or you will not be able to clump them together .
Christian Vande Velde ’s Wife , Leah is making a contest winner ’s recipe for these Home - made Energy Bars .
Going along with Dr. Allen Lim ’s philosophy of using real - world food and keeping it simple , but specifying it for the needs of an endurance athlete , I went searching for more recipes .
Here is what I came up with :
Spinach Ricotta Calzones
These little sandwiches are terribly easy to make the night before for dinner , and have a few left over for a morning ride .

Cornmeal for rolling2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion , finely chopped
2 ( 10 ounce ) packages frozen chopped spinach , thawed and squeezed dry

Separate rolls onto a cornmeal - sprinkled work surface .
Cover with plastic wrap and let rest while preparing filling .
Heat oil in 12 - inch skillet over medium - high heat .
Add onion ; saute until tender and golden , 2 to 3 minutes .
Add spinach , garlic and nutmeg ; saute , breaking up large clumps with a wooden spoon , until heated through , 2 to 3 minutes .
Add salt and pepper .
Transfer to a medium bowl ; stir in ricotta .
Let cool ; stir in remaining cheeses .
Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 450 degrees .
Sprinkling with cornmeal as necessary , roll out each roll into a 7 - inch circle .
Spoon a scant 1 / 2 cup of filling just below the center line , leaving a 1 - inch border along the bottom half of the dough circle .
Spoon filling just below the center line of the circle of dough , leaving a border along the bottom half of the circle .
With wet fingertips , moisten the bottom border .
Fold dough over filling and press edges together .
Thoroughly seal by using fingertips to crimp and flute the edges or by pressing with the tines of a fork .
Place on a large cookie sheet lined with parchment paper .
( At this point , can be frozen up to 2 weeks . )
Brush tops with oil .
Bake until golden brown , about 16 minutes ( longer if frozen ) .

Apple Sweet Potato Waffles
While I was not able to find nutritional information for these waffles online , the recipe came from an athletic recipe website , and has relatively few ingredients that would bother anyone ’s stomach .
The addition of sweet potato was brilliant .
Ingredients
Dry :
2 cups flour
2 t baking powder
1 t baking soda
¾ t salt
½ t cinnamon Wet :
2 eggs , beaten
1 T vegetable oil
2 cups low - fat buttermilk
water ( as needed ) Other
1 cup diced apple , diced
1 lb sweet potato , cubed ( or 1 15 oz can yams )
cooking spray Directions
Cut the sweet potato into inch and a half pieces .
Place in a pot of water on the stove and bring to a boil .
Cook until very soft , about twenty minutes .
Remove skin and mash well .
Combine the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl .
Whisk to combine .
Combine the wet ingredients in a separate bowl .
Whisk to combine .
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir well , then add the diced apple and mashed sweet potato , stirring well to combine .
Slowly add water as needed to thin the batter .
Heat a waffle iron and lightly spray with cooking spray before cooking each waffle .
Tijuana Tortas
Everyone already knows that Avocados are great for any kind of healthy , active human being that may put food into their mouths .
I tweaked this recipe a bit by notching down the amount of Jalapeno included in the mix , just in case this a stomach concern while out on the road .
That and along with beans and avocados , this recipe originally called for green cabbage instead of lettuce .
While I think lettuce will still make this a bit messy , the cabbage would have been the final step in a time bomb for a gastronomic meltdown an hour or so after eating this .
I like the idea of this recipe , but would be tempted to add meat to it in some way .
Ingredients
1 can(s ) black beans , or pinto beans , rinsed ( see Tips & Techniques )
2 tablespoon (s ) prepared salsa
1 teaspoon (s ) chopped pickled jalapeño
1/2 teaspoon (s ) ground cumin
1 ripe avocado , pitted
2 tablespoon (s ) minced onion
1 tablespoon (s ) lime juice
1 16 - to 20 - inch - long baguette , preferably whole - grain
1 cup(s ) shredded lettuce
Directions
Mash beans , salsa , jalapeño and cumin in a small bowl .
Mash avocado , onion and lime juice in another small bowl .
Cut baguette into 4 equal lengths .
Split each piece in half horizontally .
Pull out most of the soft bread from the center so you ’re left with mostly crust .
Divide the bean paste , avocado mixture and lettuce evenly among the sandwiches .
Cut each in half and serve .

I hope these recipes bring some variety to your future long rides , and you will leave those clif bars and energy gels for the triathletes and other people who ca n’t eat and pedal at the same time .

In doing research for a feature related to water , I came across an almost unbelievable statistic from an otherwise sober and respectable report .
A day later , I 'm still unable to comprehend the scale of it ; I keep re-reading it , turning the page around , and saying out aloud , so strong is the instinct that it can't quite be true .
The report is Charting our water future : Economic frameworks to inform decision - making ; it was put together by consultants McKinsey & Company on behalf of the 2030 Water Resources Group , an alliance of concerned bodies including the World Bank Group and big private interests such as the Coca - Cola Company , SAB Miller and Standard Chartered Bank .
The headline point of the report is that by 2030 , unless substantial changes are made to conserve water and build new supplies , there will be a 40 % gap between projected water demand from a bigger , richer global population , and " accessible , reliable " supplies .
The really astonishing statistic though was this : that 42 % of all projected water demand – yes , nearly half of all the water for homes , industry and agriculture – will be required by just four countries .
Four .
China , India , Brazil and South Africa .
Read it for yourself on page 15 of the Executive Summary .
I know China and India are big , and getting bigger , fast .
But still ...
To avoid future water crises , we 're told that gargantuan investment is needed in water infrastructure .
Some of this will be big desalination plants and dams ; much of it – as McKinseys stress – will be smaller , cheaper and potentially hugely beneficial improvements to irrigation ditches and pumps , to leaking pipes and the types of seeds farmers plant .
The big question is not really what will help , but how to get it done .
Water pricing is the single biggest factor that would make a difference , but few politicians will campaign , or even govern , for a mandate to put up bills because water is essential .
Which is , of course , the reason why they should .
It may be true that the global water problem is made up of a series of local water issues .
But if 42 % of demand is in China , India , Brazil and South Africa – all of which are already suffering water stresses – then perhaps the world needs to put a much , much greater focus on these four countries .
Solving shortages in Rio or Shanghai will not help farmers in Tajikistan or California , but many millions of people would benefit , and could set an example to the rest of the world .
Using Django as a Pass Through Image Proxy
An earlier post shows you how to setup Nginx as a pass through image proxy .
This post shows you how to do it with just Django and nothing else .
The Problem We 've solving the same problem as the earlier post .
However , I will repeat it here for clarity as there 's been some confusion .
You have a production DB with lots of images uploaded by users .
For example , NationalGeographic.com has over 11gb of user uploaded images .
When you download a data dump of the production database , it has links to all these images which you do n't have .
You either have to download and sync all the images locally every time you copy the database , live with broken images or point your static images to the prod server .
Copying images locally is the brute force method and will work .
If you have all day to sync up images .
Pointing to the images in prod also works , but if you upload your own images to test functionality ...
You will not be able to see those new images .
You have a prod site with gigabytes and gigabytes of user generated static content .
Whenever the database from production is copied to some lesser environment , like your sandbox , you either need to copy all the images locally , point static to the production server or live with broken images .
Solution Django allows you to serve static files through your sandbox .
By replacing Django 's standard static " serve " function with the one below , you will be able to serve images locally , but look for them on a remote URL if it 's not found locally .
Thanks to Johnny Dobbins for the idea . " " " Views and functions for serving static files .
These are only to be used during development , and SHOULD NOT be used in a production setting .
file : static_fallback.py " " " import mimetypes import os import posixpath import urllib import urllib2 import django from django.
conf import settings from django.http import Http404 , HttpResponse , HttpResponseRedirect from django.views.static import serve as django_serve def serve ( request , path , document_root = None , show_indexes = False , cache = True , fallback_server = None ) : " " " Serve static files using Django 's static file function but if it returns a 404 , then attempt to find the file on the fallback_server .
Optionally and by default , cache the file locally .
To use , put a URL pattern such as : : ( r '^ ( ? P< path > .* ) $ ' , ' static_fallback.serve ' , {' document_root ' : '/ path/to/my/files/'} ) in your URLconf .
You must provide the ``document_root`` param ( required by Django ) .
You may also set ``show_indexes`` to ``True`` if you 'd like to serve a basic index of the directory .
These parameters are passed through directly to django.views.static.serve .
You should see the doc_string there for details .
Passing cache to True ( default ) copies the file locally .
Be sure to set settings .
FALLBACK_STATIC_URL
to something like : FALLBACK_STATIC_URL = ' http://myprodsite.com'
Alternatively , you can also tell it the fallback server as a parameter sent in the URLs .
Author : Ed Menendez ( [ email protected ]
Concept : Johnny Dobbins " " " #
This was mostly copied from Django 's version .
We need the filepath for # caching and it also serves as an optimization .
If the file is not found # then there 's no reason to go through the Django process .
try : fallback_server = settings .
FALLBACK_STATIC_URL
except AttributeError : print u" You 're using static_fallback.serve to serve static content " + \ " however settings .

We can't shun countries that torture , says Foreign Office
Torture victim : Binyam Mohamed claims Britain was complicit in his treatment .
Today 's report will fuel speculation UK intelligence agencies collaborated with the torture of detainees abroad
Britain cannot afford the ‘ luxury ’ of only co-operating with countries which do not use torture , the Foreign Office says .
The statement in the department 's annual human rights report will fuel suspicions that UK intelligence agencies collaborated with the harsh treatment of detainees abroad .
In its conclusions , the Foreign Office insists that Britain has to work with many international intelligence agencies , not all of which share the same standards and laws as Britain .
‘ But we can not afford the luxury of only dealing with those that do .
The intelligence we get from others saves British lives , ’ the 194 page report said .
‘ We do all we can to minimise , and where possible avoid , the risk that the people in question are mistreated by those holding them .
However , there are times when we cannot reduce the risk to zero . ’
Former Shadow Home Secretary , David Davis , said this amounted to a change of policy .
‘ All previous statements from Ministers say we have confined ourselves to using any information we receive from foreign agencies known to use torture , not to actively seeking information , ’ he said .
‘ It is frankly not good enough to slip this out in two paragraphs of a 200 - page report . ’
Ministers have faced accusations that UK residents detained under suspicion of plotting terror had been tortured in foreign prisons while MI6 and MI5 turned a blind eye .
The Court of Appeal found that the Security Service was complicit in the ' cruel , unusual and inhumane treatment ' meted out to British resident Binyam Mohamed while he was held at Guantanamo Bay by the Americans .
Police are also investigating the actions of two British intelligence officers over their alleged complicity in the torture of people held overseas .
A dozen former Guantanamo Bay detainees , 11 of whom now live in Britain , have launched legal cases against the government accusing it of condoning their mistreatment abroad .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown pledged last year to release the guidance given to spy chiefs .
But despite pleas from the Intelligence and Security Committee to publish the guidelines ahead of a debate today , Downing Street could not confirm when they would be unveiled .
Mr Brown ’s spokesman said discussions were ongoing .
In its report , the Foreign Office said that ultimately it was for ‘ ministers to balance the risk of mistreatment against the national security needs and make a judgment ’ on whether a Briton was at risk of torture if they were handed over to another country for questioning .
‘ If the risk of mistreatment is too high then we will not go ahead with an operation . '
In a foreword to the report , Foreign secretary David Miliband warned of emerging challenges to human rights .
He said : ' The increasing threat to gay people 's rights in some African countries reminds us that tolerance is a dream rather than reality for much of the world 's population . '
Yep , Larry King , the host who 's heard it all , is starting to bristle at the ongoing right - wing freakout .
And he gave the teabaggers more than enough rope to hang themselves .
Larry King & Teabaggers - part 2
Transcript
It 's a great interview and I recommend watching the whole thing .
But I think the section on Social Security is particularly important :
KING : Dana , are you a little concerned about tea partiers who use the word terrorism when talking about the president ?
LOESCH : I think perhaps that went -- that 's maybe an adjective that is a little bit egregious .
But there are things that they -- KING : A little bit ?
LOESCH : I mean they do -- I mean they do have some valid concerns , though .
I mean , we just saw this health care legislation go through .
And I 've mentioned it before .
it's -- it completely disregarded the original intent of the commerce clause and the welfare clause and the constitution .
I mean for the first time ever in American history just to exist in this country you have to purchase the product now .
You have to purchase the insurance .
And they can try to make it -- KING : No .
Wait a minute .
We have -- we had to pay social security .
That was a socialist concept .
Republicans voted against it .
LOESCH : I agree .
KING : Would anyone turn away social security now ?
Would you do away with it ?
LOESCH : I would , yes .
KING : You would ?
LOESCH : Yes , absolutely .
KING : Would do you away with it , Wayne ?
ROOT : I 'd certainly like to .
At best , I do away with it because I could find better ways to spend and save my own $ 15,000 a year .
KING : If you would put it up for a vote in America , what do you think the vote would be on social security in America ?
Referenda .
ROOT : I think if you put it up for a vote , I think , a majority of people today would want to keep it .
But they certainly would want to privatize a small portion of it .
I personally think I could do better with my own $ 15,000 a year any day of the week and I 'd like it to be mine .
It 's mine .
So , I 'd like to leave it to my kids and grandkids the way it stands now --
KING : That was n't the purpose .
When it began , the purpose was you are your brother 's keeper , right ?
ROOT : But , Larry , you got to realize that money is not there .
Do you realize they said it was going to be in a lock box .
But there is nothing there in the lock box but a bunch of IOUs from a bankrupt government .
So that money is being like -- LOESCH :
And it was established as a temporary program .
KING : Maybe tea partiers will turn it back .
Can you say third rail ?
Well , Marco Rubio grabbed that rail this weekend , and since this issue is popular among tea partiers , I 'd expect it to keep coming up ( and Democrats should be bringing it up ) .
I wonder how John McCain feels about repealing Social Security ?
How about Mitt Romney ?
He seems especially eager to win the favor of tea partiers .
Enough so that Larry King could n't even believe he was talking to a supposed adult last week when Romney appeared on the show .
Again , the whole interview is worth checking out , but here 's a sample :
KING : You 've called the passage of health care reform " an unconscionable abuse of power . "
Unconscionable ?
ROMNEY : Well , I -- I think that the decision to take the nuclear option , as the president did , to not secure a single Republican vote in -- in contravention of his promise during the campaign that he would reach across party lines , he'd work on a bipartisan basis , that was very , very disappointing .
KING : Well , if he 's not -- if they 're not going to vote for it , what was he supposed to do ...
ROMNEY : Well ... KING : -- scratch it ?
ROMNEY : Well ...
KING : If he ...
ROMNEY : Well ...
KING : If he liked the plan , he ran on it .
ROMNEY : Well , what he 's supposed to do is have a plan which is bipartisan .
We , after all , have a -- a reform plan in Massachusetts that I worked with Democrats on .
We worked on a bipartisan basis .
It 's not perfect .
It 's a work in progress .
But nonetheless , we worked together and , therefore , secured , I think , a better piece of legislation and more support in the community by virtue of doing so .
But in addition to that , he said that he was going to eschew the politics of special interests .
And yet by paying off the unions with a special deal for union members and then also giving special deals to senators like Senator Nelson and others we 'll find as the light of day continues to ...
KING : The Nelson thing , he backed off , though .
ROMNEY : Yes .
Well , but others have come -- have come to light and will come to light in the ensuing days .
I think what you 'll find is that -- that the process is one which violated the -- the principles which he laid out during the campaign and , frankly , was a -- a power push by a single party .
And it says that no longer do you need more than 51 votes in the Senate .
A simple majority can accomplish whatever they want .
And it 's a -- it 's a dramatic change in the way that democracy will work .
KING : You also wrote that , " President Obama has betrayed his oath to the nation . "
Now , Governor , you -- you 're pretty scare -- careful with language .
That 's -- are you saying he should be impeached ?
ROMNEY : Well , no , of course not .
But in the ...
KING : Well ... ROMNEY : -- in the following ...
KING : -- what 's betraying an oath ?
ROMNEY : Well , the oath to the nation goes piece by piece , which is , one , he 'd bring a new style of politics to Washington , and instead it 's -- it 's the Chicago politics of the past .
He said he would work , as I indicated , on a bipartisan basis .
He did n't .
He instead put in place a -- a bill which has no support on the other side of the aisle .
Got that ?
Romney thinks that Obama has violated his oath of office -- you know , the oath to be bipartisan .
I 'd really like somebody to ask Mr. Grown - Up Republican how he feels about repealing Social Security .
Here 's the thing .
When you say something so ridiculous that Larry F - 'n King sits up and takes notice , you 've left the mainstream of American politics .
And the teabaggers are pushing Republicans further and further into the wilderness .
So the Tea Party wants to repeal Social Security .
What say you GOP ?
Romney transcript
The Liberal Democrats have distanced themselves from the Conservatives by warning they would not support plans to cut public spending too early in the next parliament .
The party 's leader , Nick Clegg , said early deep cuts would be " economic masochism " .
It came as the Lib Dem treasury spokesman , Vince Cable , hit out at the Tories ' economic plans .
In his speech at the party 's spring conference in Birmingham , Cable accused the Conservatives of engaging in a " phoney war over cuts " that would affect millions of lives .
He also hit out at George Osborne , the shadow chancellor .
Cable said the Tories were trying to present their economic team as " ' Slasher ' Osborne and the Hard Men " .
But , he added , they appeared to have taken cuts straight after the election off the table – at least for now .
" Or at least that 's what I think they said .
I 'd love to attempt a critique of the Tories ' budget plans , but I have no idea what they are .
I think the present line on the budget is : ' Trust us and we 'll tell you after the election ' , " he told cheering delegates .
He added : " People are desperate to see the back of this Labour government .
But they do n't want the same old Tories .
And make no mistake they are exactly the same . "
He also claimed that David Cameron 's party and its " cronies " were trying to create financial panic to frighten people into voting for them .
" Playing fast and loose with the financial stability of this country for political gain – destabilising the markets – is dangerous , irresponsible and wrong , " said Cable .
He did not limit his criticism to the Conservatives .
Cable , having famously compared Gordon Brown to Mr Bean , this time made delegates laugh when he said the prime minister sounded like the Chelsea footballer Ashley Cole , pleading : " Give me another chance . "
The Lib Dems had identified £ 15 bn worth of reductions in public spending that would cut the deficit , he said .
The party has come under an increasing level of scrutiny as the polls narrow .
Observers are watching for any signs to suggest whether the Lib Dems would be prepared to make a pact with Labour or the Conservatives in the event of a hung parliament .
That is the scenario suggested by two polls released today .
YouGov research for the Sunday Times finds that the Tories ' lead has narrowed from five points to four over the past week .
An ICM poll for the Sunday Telegraph places Cameron 's party seven points ahead – not enough for a majority .
The same research suggests that the Lib Dems have strengthened their position and are now on 21 points .
Clegg will discuss a hung parliament when he addresses MPs today .
" People often ask me what the Liberal Democrats will do after the general election .
Some days I read we 're planning a deal with Labour , some days that we 're planning a deal with the Conservatives , other days that we 'll refuse to talk to anyone at all , " he is reported as planning to say .

MIAMI ( Reuters ) —
The Wachovia Bank , a unit of Wells Fargo & Company , has agreed to pay $ 160 million to settle accusations that it laundered Mexican drug money .
Under the agreement , Wachovia will forfeit $ 110 million , representing the proceeds of illegal narcotics sales that were laundered through the bank , the United States attorney ’s office in the Southern District of Florida said .
The bank will pay an additional $ 50 million fine to the Treasury .
A deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department resolved charges that the bank had willfully failed to establish a program to guard against money laundering .
It also resolved Wachovia ’s admitted failure to identify , detect and report suspicious transactions in third - party payment processor accounts .
A Wachovia representative was not immediately available for comment .
The federal prosecutor in Miami began an investigation about three years ago , focusing on the supposed role of a Wachovia unit in processing illegal money transfers for Mexican exchange houses along the border between the United States and Mexico .
The investigation predated Wachovia ’s takeover by Wells Fargo .
At a Glance :
The increasingly occult circles of Japanese fetish porn invade the pathetically iconic sport of the Winter Olympics : curling .
The curling premise only holds up for the first 20 minutes and even then it's just an excuse to get naked squealing Japanese girls on a Slip N ' Slide covered with gunk .
Nation of Origin : Glorious Nippon .
Languages : Japanese , shouting " yeah ! " over and over in English .
Sexual Content :
The heavy censoring applies only to the vagina , leaving the everyday human butt hole to flap in the breeze during spinning sludge slides .
Plenty of prodding vibrators and Homeless Chachi donk .
Available From : Jlist is your one - stop - shop to ruin all obscure sports with pornography
Every four years the world endures the Winter Olympics and every four years we rediscover curling , the most popular sport among ironic Winter Olympics viewers .
It 's the sporting version of that friend you had in college that you lost touch with and then run into four years later at a Yankee Candle and you 're with your wife and he's alone buying pumpkin spice candles and he is wearing a Christmas sweater that is so earnestly lame that you sort of want to be his friend again .
That 's curling .
Timely porno Zenra Curling attempts to harness the fleeting uptick in worldwide curling enthusiasm by reimagining the sport as a porno version of shuffleboard .
There are no stones or bumping for position in Zenra Curling , instead there are ... well ... I 'll let the video explain .
It 's in another language but I think it can provide a quick overview of the sport .
This video does not contain nudity , but it does feature women in swimsuits being hurled down greased lanes at dildos , so just a heads up .
If you are looking for a realistic pornographic depiction of curling then Zenra Curling will disappoint .
The goal consists of three upright dildos at approximately vagina - level standing within a circle resembling a curling goal .
The white lane is plastic covered in a translucent lubricant goop .
The women also prior to sliding down the curling lane .
Launch is done by two women , with each holding one arm and one leg of the woman being launched .
A fourth woman sweeps in front of the slider using a mop in the goop .
Several clips depict women hitting the goal dildos mouth - first , but the coveted vagina goals are always reversed video closeups , suggesting the actual goal of the sport is impossible .
There are two curling segments : the one you see in this video and another in which the women are completely naked .
Both versions are heavily edited and the women will often slide to an obvious halt well before the goal , at which point the movie cuts to a closeup of them sliding into the goal or hitting their mark .
The curling portion of the movie is confusing ( there 's no real score - keeping ) and heavily padded with reused footage and " training " scenes .
The training portions center around an unkempt Asian Chachi lookalike who barks instructions at the competitors and forces them to squat on dildos and use some uncomfortable contraption that is a cross between a stripper pole and a dildo .
Messy Chachi involves his wetsuit - wearing assistant coach and they two hang one of the women from a meathook , coat her with the goop used to lubricate the curling track , and treat her like a sick dolphin at Sea World .
The nude curling segment follows all this training and it seems to be the " official " curling portion of the video .
There are four girls competing in the curling events .
I do not understand Japanese so I have called them by names phonetically similar to words I heard during their introduction .
" Bean "
Skills include guido princess hair , childlike yelling , and rampant bun-clenching .
Attractive until she starts making that dying animal yowl that is the hallmark of Japanese pornography .
" Segundo "
Skills include weirdly happy about everything , possibly mentally handicapped , huge fucking shovel face , vaudevillian levels of blush .
Probably born intersexed .
" Father "
Big jugs , civil war graveyard teeth , looks " farty ' , seemed very adept at squatting on a plastic baby - sized wiener during the training portion .
Good to know if you need a scary - mouthed farter to tear up your baby 's dingus .
" Push - top "
The real star !
Looks like Lisa Simpson , constantly upset , skilled at most training exercises including the stripper pole and the vibrators .
When threatened makes an awesome turtle face .
I think Push - top won the curling competition , but it is hard to be certain .
After the curling has ended all of the girls head back to the training area and are rewarded with Homeless Chachi and his wetsuited buddy giving them the full hot order .
This is pretty standard porno stuff other than the curling girl flower formation .
If you 're looking for a way to celebrate the Winter Olympics with a few friends you would have more fun emulating this movie than watching it .
I call that the Funny Games clause , when I literally wanted to be torture killed instead of watching that movie .

( CNN ) --
The murderer of a 16 - year - old girl who bragged about his crimes was electrocuted Thursday night , a spokesman for the Virginia Department of Corrections said .
Paul Warner Powell was pronounced dead at 9:09 p.m. at a correctional center in Jarratt , Virginia .
He did not make a last statement at the execution attended by the victim 's family .
Powell was convicted in the 1999 murder of Stacie Reed and the rape of her 14 - year - old sister in their Manassas , Virginia , family home .
Powell 's execution comes after Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell denied him clemency and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to block the execution .
The killer claimed double jeopardy after state prosecutors put him on trial for a second time in the killing .
In July , the high court delayed Powell 's execution while considering the broader constitutional claims , which were finally rejected .
Powell rejected lethal injection , the state 's usual method of execution .
" I 'm hopeful this is the last legal chapter in the long history of this case , " said Powell 's prosecutor , Prince William County Commonwealth 's Attorney Paul Ebert .
" The survivors -- Stacie 's mother and [ her sister ] -- have really been traumatized by delay after delay .
Hopefully they 're going to get some peace and closure after all these years . "
CNN does not identify sexual assault victims without their permission , even though the surviving victim , now 25 , has talked publicly about the case .
The crime shocked the Washington area .
Reed knew Powell , then 20 and an admitted racist .
The state 's highest court eventually threw out the 2000 verdict in the first trial , saying prosecutors had not proven other necessary death - eligible offenses were committed against the 16 - year - old .
Such " aggravating " factors could include rape , attempted rape or robbery in commission of the murder .
The sexual assault and attempted murder of Reed 's younger sister was upheld , and Powell was given a long prison sentence .
Powell , believing he was free from execution , proceeded to write a taunting , profanity - filled letter from behind bars to Ebert , laying out explicit details of the crime unknown to investigators at the time .
" Since I have already been indicted on first degree murder and the Va. Supreme Court said that I can't be charged with capital murder again , I figured I would tell you the rest of what happened on Jan. 29 , 1999 , to show you how stupid all of y'all ... are , " wrote Powell , who is white .
He said he had gone to the family 's home to confront Reed about dating a black man .
He admitted pinning the victim , threatening to rape her , then stabbing her in the heart when the girl resisted .
He then stomped on her throat .
" I guess I forgot to mention these events when I was being questioned .
Ha Ha ! " he wrote in 2001 .
" Do you just hate yourself for being so stupid ... and saving me ? "
The killer also said that after that crime , he waited in the house until the younger girl returned from school , then attacked her , leaving her for dead .
In the meantime , he drank iced tea from the family refrigerator and smoked a cigarette , part of the forensic evidence that investigators used to place Powell at the scene of the crime .
With this first - hand account from Powell , he was indicted again and charged with murder and attempted rape of Stacie Reed -- a capital - eligible crime .
He was convicted again , and federal and state courts subsequently upheld the conviction on appeal .
Navigation and Orientation T he question of how birds find their way between breeding and wintering grounds has puzzled people for as long as they have been aware of the phenomenon of migration .
Today we know many more parts of the puzzle 's solution than we did even twenty - five years ago .
Some would argue that there are really two puzzles : ( 1 ) how birds navigate over thousands of miles to find their way between breeding and wintering sites , and ( 2 ) how birds find their way back to precise nesting or roosting sites ( homing behavior ) .
To do either , birds must be able to orient ( that is , determine compass direction ) and to navigate ( judge their position while traveling ) .
The short explanation of these complex phenomena is that birds find their way by using a variety of cues in a hierarchical fashion .
Different species may use these cues in different orders of priority , and some cues may always be used in preference to others .
Birds acquire directional information from five primary sources : ( 1 ) topographic features , including wind direction which can be influenced by major land forms , ( 2 ) stars , ( 3 ) sun , ( 4 ) Earth 's magnetic field , and ( 5 ) odors .
Some of the most convincing experiments demonstrating the navigational abilities of birds were performed by behavioral ecologist Stephen Emlen .
He took advantage of the " migratory restlessness " of caged migrant birds -- fluttering and hopping that tend to be oriented in the direction of migration .
Using Indigo Buntings in a planetarium , Emlen found that the birds oriented in the proper migratory direction using the stellar cues projected onto the planetarium ceiling .
When Emlen shifted the position of the planetarium 's stars , the birds shifted their orientation as well .
The buntings were shown to learn a " sky map " as they watch the rotation of the stars while they grow up .
The young birds learn to recognize the area of least apparent movement around the pole ; if maturing buntings were exposed to a false sky rotating around the star Betelgeuse ( in the constellation Orion ) , they acted as if Betelgeuse were the North Star .
But how do birds find their way on overcast nights ?
Apparently , they are able to set course by the setting sun , unless this too is obscured by cloud cover .
Lacking either stars or sun for information , birds will orient by wind direction , although not always correctly .
Ornithologist Kenneth Able used radar and portable ceilometers ( electronic devices for measuring the altitude of overcasts ) to track nocturnal migrants and reported that birds frequently flew in the wrong direction by using wind as a cue when stars were unavailable .
Interestingly , while most ornithologists believe that birds employ topographic features like mountains , rivers , tall buildings , etc. , to navigate in the vicinity of the home site , there is little evidence of the use of such cues .
Recent experiments have revealed that pigeons are capable of detecting the Earth 's magnetic field and can use it to orient and possibly to navigate .
We still do not understand just how pigeons manage to sense such weak electromagnetic fields , but birds are far more sensitive to them than are human beings .
We have yet to learn how widespread this ability may be among other species of birds .
Homing pigeons , in addition to sensing magnetic fields , recently have been shown to use smell for at least short - distance orientation in returning to their loft .
Earlier studies indicated that Leach 's Storm - Petrels ( and probably other " tubenoses " ) might possibly use their sense of smell to locate their nest burrows , although they rely on other cues to find the colony .
Shearwaters , like pigeons , are capable of spectacular homing feats .
Many Shearwaters were taken from their nest burrows off the coast of England , transported across the Atlantic Ocean , and released near Boston .
Twelve and a half days later some of these individuals were back in their nest burrows .
How they accomplished the feat is unknown , but they certainly did n't sniff their way home .
One clear message emerges from studies of avian orientation and navigation : birds do not rely on a single source of information to guide them on their travels .
Instead , they possess the ability , shaped over evolutionary time , to use redundant cues from a variety of sources .
Such a system enables birds to find their way under most conditions that they routinely encounter .

This is painfully cynical because Bush calls himself " compassionate " while the California law was entitled the " Compassionate Use Act of 1996 " and the federal program that dispenses medical marijuana is called the " Compassionate Investigational New Drugs " program -- and during his campaign for president , Bush said the States should decide about medical marijuana .
It makes sense for Bush to issue a presidential pardon for Mr. Epis as a gesture toward keeping his word .
The US Supreme Court ruled in the US v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers Coop case that state law does not supercede federal law but federal law does not overturn state law , either .
Rather than allow the will of the voters to take effect in California , however , the Bush administration has aggressively pursued patients and caregivers throughout the state .
Epis was the first case to work its way through the federal courts .
In order to increase the severity of the penalty , Ashcroft 's office chose not only to charge Epis with the plants he was actually growing , but also with " conspiracy " to grow more than 1000 plants , which carries the same penalty as actually growing 1000 plants !
The federal judge instructed the jury to disregard state law and vote to convict despite it , which they did .
Epis was sentenced to 10 years for trying to help sick and dying people live with comfort and dignity , in accordance with the democratic will of the voters .
Bryan Epis learned about the medical value of marijuana to treat his chronic pain after he was seriously injured in a car accident .
When California voters overwhelmingly passed Prop 215 ( Cal HS 11362.5 ) , a law authorizing cultivation and possession of marijuana for patients and their caregivers , Brian Epis saw an opportunity to do a tremendous service .
His dream was to create a legal medical marijuana dispensary that would be safe , accessible and affordable .
Representatives Sam Farr , Lynn Woolsey and Dana Rohrabacher are introducing a bill called the " Affirmative Defense Bill " that will allow a defense in federal court for patients and caregivers following state medical marijuana laws .
I urge you to introduce and / or support a similar bill in the Senate , as it will show respect for the sovereign states which comprise our federal union .
Representatives Sam Farr , Lynn Woolsey and Dana Rohrabacher are introducing a bill called the " Affirmative Defense Bill " that will allow a defense in federal court for patients and caregivers following state medical marijuana laws .
I urge our to cosponsor and support this bill as it shows respect for state sovereignty .
You can write me at : Political Prisoner , Bryan Epis , 09636-097 , FCI Lompoc , 3600 Guard Rd , Lompoc CA 93436 .
I 'll write back anyone who writes me .
To read more about my case , please enter " Bryan Epis " on a search engine such as google .com .
Thank you ,
I 've included two sample letters , one for your U.S. House Rep. and one for your two US Senators .
Please modify them so they do n't get a bunch of the sme exact letters .
It is only fair that medical marijuana patients and caregivers get a fair trial , where we can present evidence that we followed state law .
According to a CNN / Time poll , 87 % of Americans support regulation by the states .
Please let Congress know you want them to listen to you .
Only with hyour help can this bill become law .
Please help me and my family , Ed Rosenthal and his family , as well as thousands of other patients and caregivers following state and / or local laws , who are rapidly being incarcerated in federal prison for at least 5 years and up to life .
I was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for the " crime " of following California 's medical marijuana law .
Ed Rosenthal was recently convicted at trial and faces 40 years in federal prison .
We were unable to present a defense that we were following the laws of California and / or local laws .
If this bill is signed into law , we will get a new trial .
April 10 , 2003 -- Please spend 5 minutes to write your U.S. House representative at www.house.gov and ask him / her to support a new bill introduced by Rep Sam Farr ( D - Carmel ) , Lynn Woolsey ( D - Petaluma ) and Dana Rohrabacher ( R- Huntington Beach ) , that will allow medical cannabis patients and caregivers to present a defense in federal court that they were following state and / or local medical marijuana laws .
Please spend another 5 minutes of your time to write your two U.S. Senators urging them to introduce and / or support a similar bill in the Senate at www.sentate.gov.

Number one , the earth is warmer in 1988 than at any time in the history of instrumental measurements .
Number two , the global warming is now large enough that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship to the greenhouse effect .
And number three , our computer climate simulations indicate that thegreenhouse effect is already large enough to begin to effect the probability of extreme events such as summer heat waves .
– Jim Hansen , June 1988 testimony before Congress , see His later quote and His superior ’s objection for context1989 - ” On the one hand , as scientists we are ethically bound to the scientific method , in effect promising to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but – which means that we must include all doubts , the caveats , the ifs , ands and buts .
On the other hand , we are not just scientists but human beings as well .
And like most people we ’d like to see the world a better place , which in this context translates into our working to reduce the risk of potentially disastrous climate change .
To do that we need to get some broad based support , to capture the public ’s imagination .
That , of course , means getting loads of media coverage .
So we have to offer up scary scenarios , make simplified , dramatic statements , and make little mention of any doubts we might have .
This “ double ethical bind ” we frequently find ourselves in cannot be solved by any formula .
Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest .
I hope that means being both . ” – Stephen Schneider , lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , Discover magazine , October 19891990 - “ We ’ve got to ride the global warming issue .
Even if the theory of global warming is wrong , we will be doing the right thing – in terms of economic policy and environmental policy ” – Senator Timothy Wirth1993 - “ Global climate change may alter temperature and rainfall patterns , many scientists fear , with uncertain consequences for agriculture . ” – U.S. News and World Report1998 - No matter if the science [ of global warming ] is all phony . . . climate change [ provides ] the greatest opportunity to bring about justice and equality in the world . ”
— Christine Stewart , Canadian Minister of the Environment , Calgary Herald , 19982001 - “ Scientists no longer doubt that global warming is happening , and almost nobody questions the fact that humans are at least partly responsible . ”
– Time Magazine , Monday , Apr. 09 , 20012003 - Emphasis on extreme scenarios may have been appropriate at one time , when the public and decision - makers were relatively unaware of the global warming issue , and energy sources such as “ synfuels , ” shale oil and tar sands were receiving strong consideration ” – Jim Hansen , NASA Global Warming activist , Can we defuse The Global Warming Time Bomb ? , 20032006 - “ I believe it is appropriate to have an over - representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is , as a predicate for opening up the audience to listen to what the solutions are , and how hopeful it is that we are going to solve this crisis . ” — Al Gore , Grist magazine , May 2006 Now :
The global mean temperature has fallen for two years in a row , which is why you stopped hearing details about the actual global temperature , even while they carry on about taxing you to deal with it …how long before they start predicting an ice age ?

I married into a very conservative Christian family earlier this year .
My wife calls herself a Christian , but she ’s much more liberal in her beliefs .
I ’m an atheist .
We do n’t spend much time discussing religion , and so our beliefs rarely conflict .
However , her mother , father , and two siblings attend a large , fundamentalist church every Sunday , and they expect the entire family , including me , to attend Easter services this weekend .
I probably would n’t be opposed to attending a liberal church one day a year with the family , but I ’m very uncomfortable spending even a minute at the church my in - laws attend .
They do n’t know I ’m an atheist , as that would certainly cause them to lose respect for me as their son - in - law , so we ’ve stayed mum about that .
But now that I ’m expected to go against my values in attending an evangelical church this Sunday , I ’m considering “ coming out ” and refusing to go .
My wife has advised against this .
she would prefer that I join her family in the pew .
Should I follow my heart or suck it up and pretend to praise Jesus ?
— Anxious Atheist
Dear Anxious ,
If I were forced at attend a Christian church ( which I do not ) , I would certainly choose one of the more open - minded , gay - affirming churches like First Congo or Holy Trinity .
Like you , I also would be opposed to waking up early on Easter morning to hear the sermon of a right - leaning , evangelical minister .
But if I had to do so for the sake of family , I think I ’d suck it up and don an Easter dress -- but probably a black one to go against the grain .
In all seriousness , one day in church wo n’t kill you .
You certainly do n’t have to bow your head and participate in singing hymns .
But at some point , you really ought to remain true to your beliefs and let your in - laws know that you ’re an atheist .
Staying in the closet -- whether it ’s a gay closet , a religious closet , or whatever -- is never good for one ’s soul .
As a compromise ( and to keep them from freaking out ) , you can offer to attend Easter services with them .
That should make them feel a little better , since evangelicals believe they ’re supposed to be spreading the gospel .
Whether you believe the stuff the pastor is saying or not , you ’ll only have to deal with him for an hour or so .
Then maybe the in - laws will take the family out for Easter brunch , and you can forget all that religious talk over a big stack of pancakes .
Got a problem ?

The challenge of creating relevant but still traditional Heavy Metal in this current age where even the most commercial face of Metal has been changed by the extremity of the underground seems to be an almost insurmountable task .
The most recent efforts of mainstream veterans like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest in continuing the genre provides little in and of themselves to enthrall the masses as they did with their once advanced , Romanticist art .
There are also the countless Power and Doom Metal bands that have hijacked the older forms and do so with little to none of the magic that possessed the music of the seventies and eighties .
Though the secrets of the grand , old tradition have been apparently condemned to obscurity , they can never be lost and befitting the nature of lost wisdom , have turned up in the least likely of places .
Dantesco hail from the small Latin American island of Puerto Rico and through their music , divulge a rich tradition of Spanish music and highly exoteric and vibrant Catholicism .
Although chronicling the triumphant Heathen soul at war with Christendom , ‘ Pagano ’ conjures the sounds of the immanent culture and possesses it with a bestial inflection , as the vocals of Erico that dominate this album resemble a Latin black mass arranged with the magestic sensibilities of an European opera .
Infact , the vocal style is as properly operatic as imagineable in Heavy Metal music , putting the high - pitched aspirations of a Rob Halford or Messiah Marcolin in their places , though still conveying a sense of extreme primality and visceral power rivalled only by the demonic throats of Black Metal vocalists .
These sermons are conducted exclusively in the native Spanish tongue , which suits the guitars incredibly well , as the melodicism of the riffs is only supplemented by the Doomy heaviness of Candlemass influence , but really crafted with Spanish classical guitars in mind .
This is where the music really comes alive , before there ’s any chance of hearing the vocals as just a unique ethnic gimmick to fill space with .
The compositions are constantly engaging , commanding narratives the scale of the epic title - track to Iron Maiden ’s ‘ Seventh Son of a Seventh Son ‘ with attention to mood dynamics often passed over in favour of an intentionally one - dimensional wallowing by other bands who play this melodic , traditional and Doomy kind of Metal .
All the techniques on show have been long perfected , and more recently , have even found their way into the mallcore slang of pre-teen alternative / hard rock bands ( via. Gothenburg ) , but fortunately , it ’s all found an orderly , emotive and inspiring expression in ‘ Pagano ’ .
The tight but hyperbolic interplay of vocals and guitar is a feast for those that love to follow several strands of ancient melody at once , as if transforming the old Hispanic anthems of Mexico ’s Luzbel into rousing , harmonised hymns , tempered and then unleashed to invoke the spirits of pre-Christian warriors .
True Heavy Metal , fit for contemporary ears , giving the current crop of extreme - influenced Pagan and Black Metal bands a serious run for their money .

I ’m currently writing a paper on CHP ’s performance for conjunction , which I have been optimising recently .
The problem with a new feature like conjunction is that there is nothing else to benchmark it against !
But I can benchmark the effect that supporting conjunction has on performance for simple channel communications and other things that do n’t feature conjunction .
Two of my comparisons are simple synchronous channels based on MVars and STM .
These do n’t support choice between events — you ca n’t choose between writing to two synchronous channels built on MVars or STM without more machinery on top .
But they are fast .
Another comparison is the CML package , which does support such choice between events — the performance of CML merits its own post some time ( in short : fine normally , but terrible if you use its choice operator a lot — unless I have made a mistake in the benchmark ) .
I also wanted to benchmark an implementation that supported choice but not conjunction , based on STM .
Version 1.0.0 of CHP fulfils this criteria , but was badly designed and totally unoptimised — and I know from my recent optimisations how bad the performance might be .
So I constructed an optimised version of channels with choice but no conjunction .
I was surprised at how short the algorithm was , and realised that it could be explained in a blog post .
So here it is .
Implementing Event Choice with STM
Let ’s be clear on the problem , first .
I want an Event type such that I can say “ wait for event A or event B , whichever happens first , but only engage in one of them ” .
Then I want someone else to be able to concurrently say “ wait for event B or event C or event D , whichever happens first , but only engage in one of them ” and have the algorithm resolve it all .
STM does n’t achieve this by itself ; you can use orElse to choose between writing to two variables , but that does n’t suffice for multiple people engaging in events with each other .
We begin with a helper function — one of those functions that is general enough that it might almost feature in a standard library .
Here it is :
-- | Executes the actions until it finds one that returns True ( at which point -- it will execute no further actions ) .
Returns
True if an action did , False -- if none of them did .
anyM :: Monad m => [ m Bool ] -> m
Bool any M = foldM orM False where orM True _ = return True orM False m = m
Next we ’ll declare our data - types .
Our Event contains a constant enrollment count ( the number of processes required to synchronise together ) , and a transactional variable holding a list of current offers , each with an associated STM action .
An offer is in turn a list of events which uses a Thread Id as a unique identifier ; think of an offer as saying : I offer to engage in exactly one of the events in the list , and I ’m waiting until I do :
data Offer = Offer { offerThreadId :: ThreadId , offerEvents :: [ Event ] } instance Eq
Offer where ( == ) = ( == ) `on` offer Thread Id data Event = Event { enrollCount :: Int , offersTV :: TVar [ ( STM ( ) , Offer ) ] }
Adding an offer to an event is as simple as adding it to the list of offers .
My modifyTVar ' function has type ( a -> a ) -> TVar a -> STM ( ) and applies the modification function to the contents of the TVar , but it adds a little strictness that helps performance :
recordOffer :: Offer -> ( STM ( ) , Event ) -> STM ( ) recordOffer o ( act , e ) = modify TVar ' ( ( act , o ) : ) ( offersTV e )
We also define a function for checking if an event is able to complete ( when we are making an offer on it ) .
This takes an event , and an action to perform if the event can complete .
It then reads the current offers from the event ’s transactional variable .
If the enrollment count is equal to the number of current offers plus one ( the offer now being made ) , it can complete .
Completion involves performing all the associated STM actions , and then using a revoke function to remove the offers ( which have now chosen this event , say : A ) from all the events that they had offered on ( e.g. event A , event B , event C ) :
checkComplete :: ( STM ( ) , Event ) -> STM
Bool checkComplete ( act , e ) = do offers <- readTVar ( offersTV e ) if enrollCount e /= length offers + 1 then return False else do sequence_ ( act : map fst offers ) mapM_ ( revoke . snd ) offers return
True revoke :: Offer -> STM ( ) revoke off = mapM_ ( modifyTVar ' removeUs . offersTV ) ( offerEvents off ) where removeUs = filter ( ( /= off ) . snd )
We only require one further function .
This function , offerAll , handles the creation of an offer , checks if any of the events in the offer can complete immediately , and otherwise records the offers in the event then waits for one of them to be completed by a later participants .
It must use two transactions for this ; one to make the offers ( this transaction needs to finish for it to be visible to the other participants ) and one to wait for an event to be completed .
A crucial part of the function is not just knowing that an offer completed , but also knowing which one .
For this we construct a TVar of our own into which a result can be written .
This starts off as Nothing , and we later wait for it to become a Just value .
We augment the user - supplied action - on - completion to also write into this TVar .
The design of the algorithm as a whole ensures that this variable will only ever be written to once .
Here is offerAll :
offerAll :: [ ( STM ( ) , Event , a ) ] ->
IO a offerAll off = do tid <- my Thread
Id rtv <- atomically $ checkAll tid atomically $ readTVar rtv >>= maybe retry return where checkAll tid = do rtv <- newTVar
Nothing let offer = [ ( act >> writeTVar rtv ( Just x ) , e ) | ( act , e , x ) <- off ] complete <- anyM ( map checkComplete offer ) unless complete $ mapM_ ( recordOffer ( Offer tid [ e | ( _ , e , _ ) <- off ] ) ) offer return rtv
This is all that is needed for events with choice at both ends .
You call offerAll with a list of offers and it gives you back the value you associated with that offer .
The Public API
To wrap this into a communication channel with a CML - like API , we wrap it up as follows .
First we declare an SEvent type ( named after CML , hence the re-use of the term event for another meaning ) that represents a synchronisation action ; this is a list ( of choices ) , each containing an internal event , an action to perform during the completion of the offer , and one to perform afterwards that will yield a return value ( which we can use for a Functor instance ) :
data SEvent a = SEvent { sEvent :: [ (( STM ( ) , STM a ) , Event ) ] } instance Functor SEvent where fmap f ( SEvent es ) = SEvent [ ( ( dur , fmap f aft ) , e ) | ( ( dur , aft ) , e ) <- es ] choose :: [ SEvent a ] ->
SEvent a choose = SEvent .
concatMap sEvent
You can see that the choose function simply joins lists of choices together .
We define our synchronisation function using offerAll , which will return the corresponding afterwards - STM - action for the chosen event , which we then execute using atomically :
sync :: SEvent a -> IO a sync ( SEvent es ) = offer All [ ( dur , e , aft ) | ( ( dur , aft ) , e ) <- es ] >>= atomically
Finally we can define a type for a synchronous communication channel , SChannel that joins together an event ( the internal kind ) and a transactional variable for passing the value :
data SChannel a = SChannel Event ( TVar a ) send :: SChannel a -> a -> SEvent ( ) send ( SChannel e ctv ) x = SEvent [ ( ( writeTVar ctv x , return ( ) ) , e ) ] recv :: SChannel a ->
SEvent a recv ( SChannel e ctv ) = SEvent [ ( ( return ( ) , readTVar ctv ) , e ) ]
The send function puts the value to send into the variable during the original event completion , and then afterwards the reader takes the value out of the variable at its leisure .
( The implementation assumes that the same participants will use the channel each time ; an extra level of indirection could be added to make the implementation more flexible in this regard . )
The code in this post provides nearly the same functionality as the CML library , but my tests indicate it is faster .
I have now uploaded this code ( with some documentation ) as the sync package on Hackage .
This provides a useful “ lite ” alternative to CHP that runs in the IO monad , and an alternative implementation of most of the features of the CML package .
Shares saw an average return of just 18 per cent over the decade , while cash returned 57 per cent .
It comes despite savers seeing their rates of return plummet to record lows after the Bank of England cut interest rates to just 0.5 per cent a year ago .
As Expected , Ridiculous , Wrong , Exaggerating And Misleading Report Claims That ' Piracy ' Is Killing Jobs
from the oh - come - on dept
The report suggests that there 's a direct correlation between Internet traffic growth and lost jobs .
That is , the more traffic that is generated on the Internet , the more money will be lost .
This correlation is 1 according to the report , which assumes that all growth in Internet traffic will increase piracy at the same rate .
The report makes another bogus assumption by stating that more traffic will mean more piracy and thus more lost revenue .
It does not account for the fact that people might consume higher quality files which are greater in file - size .
All projections are based on bandwidth and not the number of pirated goods .
The report cites some academic literature which suggests that piracy leads to a decrease in sales .
Studies that reported the opposite or a null - effect were carefully left out .
This bias defines the entire outcome of the report .
If they used studies that found a positive effect they would have found that piracy would create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the years to come .
hundreds of thousands of jobs in the years to come .
The report uses fixed substitution rates .
They assume that 10 downloaded albums results in one lost sale and this figure is not adjusted for the projected increase in piracy .
One would think that the public 's budget for entertainment is limited and that the substitution rate would go down as piracy goes up .
Related to the previous point , if the industry did indeed lose over € 240 billion in revenue by 2015 , consumers would have a lot of extra cash to spend .
Depending on where this money was spent it might create more jobs than the entertainment industry claims it is losing .
As a report commissioned by the Dutch Government showed last year , the overall effect of piracy on the economy might actually be positive .
It gets even more ridiculous when we take a closer look at the claims .
In the UK consumers spent € 6.3 on audiovisual products .
If the projected trends continued , the ' lost ' revenue because of piracy would exceed the actual revenue , meaning that the music and movie industries would end up having to pay people for pirating their products .
Lastly , the researchers seem to have trouble putting a decent report together as they messed up the legend of one of the critical figures .
In this figure the bars for " file - sharing " and " global Internet traffic " are switched around .
This makes us skeptical about the other statistics that are published in the report .

As was leaked earlier this week , a study paid for by the International Chamber of Commerce has come out with ridiculously misleading and misguided report about how " piracy " is killing jobs all through Europe .
The tagline is that it's " costing " 1.2 million jobs and about $ 330 million .
And , of course , that sort of report is the kind that the press loves , and so we get a series of headlines :
And on and on and on and on .
Of course , it 's not even close to true .
Thestory is thatand , modern technology will cause them to fail .
However , at the same time , it has already opened upandwhile making it .
Somehow , however , none of that seems to show up in these studies .
Honestly , the claims by this research firm , TERA , read like " automobiles costing buggy makers jobs and money , something must be done ! "
It 's based on a fundamental misunderstanding of basic economics and the nature of dynamic markets ( and , frankly , calls into question anything put out by this particular firm ) .
The only thing " costing " companies money are their own actions .
If they are failing to adapt to a changing market , that 's their fault .
Do n't try to pin the blame on new technologies and consumers getting better access to content .
Even worse , when you start to dig into the report you find all sorts of highly questionable or downright incorrect assumptions .
Torrent Freak put together a starter list of problems ( feel free to add more in the comments ) :
In other words , it looks like a typical study where the folks who created the study had the answer before they did the study , and then just needed to fill in the blanks carefully to make sure they got the results they wanted .
It 's basically a blatant lie .
The unwillingness to look at studies that suggest job increases or that look at the positive impacts from greater and easier distribution and promotion is clearly a joke .

The U.S. Senate has passed the reconciliation bill .
The bill , which now goes back to the House for a final vote , fixes some parts of the larger health care bill that was signed into law on Tuesday .
Senate Republicans today successfully challenged some minor wording in the bill .
Since it is now no longer identical to the bill passed by the House , it must go back to that chamber for one more consideration .
Update at 2:15 p.m. ET : The final vote was 56 to 43 .

A University of Georgia study has found that monarch butterflies that migrate long distances have evolved significantly larger and more elongated wings than their stationary cousins .
As part of the study , researchers in the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources and the Odum School of Ecology examined the size and shape of monarchs from migratory and non-migratory populations using sophisticated computer imaging that was able to measure precise details about the insects ' wings .
Warnell doctoral candidate Andy Davis and Odum associate professor Sonia Altizer compared migratory monarchs from the eastern and western US to those in Hawaii , Costa Rica , South Florida and Puerto Rico that do not migrate .
They also measured the wings of lab - grown monarchs to rule out environmental causes of differences in size and shape , and to demonstrate a genetic basis for variation in wing traits among individual monarchs .
The findings in monarchs were consistent with previous studies comparing migratory and non-migratory bird species , which indicate that the best shape for long - distance flight involves long wings with a narrow tip to help reduce drag .
In addition to their findings on wing size and shape , the team also found that monarchs from the two migratory populations in the US differed in body size , suggesting that each population could have adapted to the demands of migration in subtly different ways .
Larger bodies might help eastern monarchs , with their much longer migration , carry fat deposits to fuel the long journey and five - month overwintering period in Mexico .
" Second , Mallorca appears to be particularly well suited to the task , because neither tectonics nor isostasy - geological forces of crustal motion - over - complicate the record .

Over the course of the last week , we have been inundated with comments of the most reprehensible quality .
Anti-Semitism was bandied about in our comments section for our story on Alpha Epsilon Pi .
This spurred a dialogue between Dean of Students Lori Berquam , Hillel Executive Director Greg Steinberger and the University of Wisconsin - Madison student body over appropriate speech and the need to repudiate anti-Semitic speech in all forms .
Unfortunately , someone accustomed to a particularly virulent brand of that speech picked up on this debate and found it to be a keen opportunity to strike .
Bradley Smith , an infamous Holocaust denier , took this opportunity to place a link to his denial website on our online site .
He paid $ 75 for the ad , and we chose to accept the advertisement .
The placement is a vile , reprehensible and absurd recreation of history that would be rejected as blatant lies and fantasy by any rational student on campus .
But it is because of this very fact that I have decided to accept this ad and allow it to run its course .
The site itself , the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust , is a troth to lies that masks itself as an attempt to challenge conventional wisdom on whether the Holocaust and murder of 6 million Jews took place .
The assertion is so wildly and obviously false that to even address its claims would be an exercise in futility .
But since its posting , members of campus and this office have asked whether that should be grounds for its deletion .
Since that question has been raised , I ’ve poured over the arguments for and against .
Deborah Lipstadt ’s chapter on campus newspapers , whom Smith primarily attacks , detailed some students who chose to run the ad but defended it on First Amendment principle .
Others rejected it as outright lies and apologized for publishing it in the first place .
Some , unfortunately , gave the impression that it was merely a controversial “ opinion ” in the marketplace of ideas .
This paper did not want to give Smith or his foolish ideas any legitimacy , nor did it want to benefit financially from such a reprehensible idea .
However , at the same time , I did not want to serve a paternalistic role , telling this campus that these thoughts are so painful and wrong that to even discuss them would be dangerous .
After wrestling with the consequences of my actions and the principles on which this paper is based , I came to the conclusion that I cannot justify the removal of this ad .
This newspaper has made a principle of accepting any individual or group advertisement submitted .
The only cases in which we would reject an advertisement are if it exhibits threats toward any person or group or is of a libelous nature .
This advertisement , while certainly fueled by veiled anti-Semitism , does not rise to the level of threats and therefore does not merit rejection .
The basis of these decisions does not rest on a desire to collect money for these advertisements , but on the editorial principle that no opinions or assertions can be so offensive that we cannot bring ourselves to hear them .
If we run from manifestly vitriolic , destructive and false arguments when they present themselves , they will continue to roam and perhaps proliferate .
We attend a research university of nearly unparalleled intellectual might .
As such , we have attracted the most intelligent minds of our country into one intellectual community dedicated to the perpetual search for the truth .
This was our mission in 1894 when the UW System Board of Regents defended the “ fearless sifting and winnowing ” for truth , and it serves a guiding social principle for this campus to this day .
It is that mission that should guide us in this instance .
It is patently obvious to the most rational individual that there is no truth to Bradley ’s grand project .
Any student of this university who views the page ( or , perhaps even the link ) would recognize his mission as a wholesale rejection of truth and , in turn , dismiss it .
Removing this advertisement would undercut and debase that belief in rational evaluation .
The UW community has every ability to confront these lies and reject them on their face .
To remove this advertisement would assume our community lacks the intellectual integrity to properly define this movement as an affront to objective truths .
The absolute incompetence with which Smith defends his views can only be fully illuminated if this campus is faced to confront those views in their rawest form .
There are , of course , those who make the argument this advertisement will legitimize a supposed “ opinion ” by giving it publicity , placement and protection .
I would argue the exact opposite would happen if we scrapped the advertisement : Smith would argue , as he has in the past , that such suppression is part and parcel of the exact reason he embarks upon this insane mission of his .
He will caterwaul and gain a few misguided converts and move on to other student communities with a slightly increased entourage .
What is more , many would still be drawn to the site through the sheer amount of ranting and resistance such a rejection would elicit .
By allowing the ad to run and acknowledging its completely vacuous nature , we place this idea in the marketplace where it will be met with disgust , bemused laughter and , above all , facts .
Such refusal to accept these rotten goods will expedite its expulsion from this market ; pretending they do not exist simply allows them to fester and pollute all items that surround them .
For all those who doubt this scenario and the rationality of the student body , I remind you of our most recent high profile case of rampant lies and rejection of the truth .
A few years ago , UW was presented with lecturer Kevin Barrett .
His view , held by a fringe minority , that the September 11 attacks were planned by the United States government , was viewed in a much more dangerous context : UW classrooms .
While many in the state Legislature fought for his removal , UW gave him the class and allowed him to teach and carry out his elucidation of this distortion .
The class came and went and the evaluations of Barrett were positive .
But his continued push on campus of the conspiracy view of 9/11 for Truth was met with eye rolling and dismissal .
He held press conferences on the subject , he crashed a lecture for David Horowitz with the topic and even ran for public office on the issue .
It is not a coincidence that his false rant no longer plagues this campus as an issue of debate — his persistence was met with indifference and dismissal and now barely raises an eyebrow among the campus community .
The same process will and should take place with Smith .
The money he paid for this advertisement will go toward efforts to counter his movement , as is the wish of the Board of Directors .
The text ad to the left will be visited by some , but rejected by nearly all .
His “ argument ” will flounder the second it is exposed .
It will be viewed not as a revision of history but as a rejection of reality .
I understand the majority of this campus ’
Jewish community must feel the placement of this advertisement compounds the harm created by reader comments .
For that reason , every comment on this article will be intensely monitored for attacks , threats and expressions of hatred toward the Jewish community .
Those comments will be deleted .
There will inevitably be those comments that attempt to justify Smith ’s position .
Those comments will be posted .
I can only hope that those who read these comments either meet them with deafening silence or come armed with the truth .
But if there is no debate , if the “ sifting and winnowing ” has been done , and there is no doubt that the truth is clear , we have nothing to fear when presented with obvious untruths .
We must only stand guard of the truth while falsehoods are allowed to expend themselves of manufactured “ legitimacy . ”

In the last few months , the majority of news in the automotive industry has been bad .
Recalls , arbitration , dealership closings – the automotive sections of most publications have very little good to say about the industry .
advertisement
advertisement
The exception has been Ford Motor Company .
They seem to have cornered the market on positive automotive news with much of the credit going to the man at the top : President and CEO Alan Mulally .
As much of the competition struggles with challenges that have followed one of the worst years in the industry ’s history , Ford has its eyes forward .
The choices that Mulally and his team have made over the last 3 and a half years are a model for how struggling automakers and their CEOs should handle adversity and do what few in the business are expected to do today .
Mulally expects to succeed .
Here are a few things his counterparts should learn if they want to have the same expectations .
Making the Right Moves at the Right Time Much can be gleaned from Mulally ’s first few months .
Just prior to being announced as CEO on September 6 , 2006 , Ford had announced major layoffs and cuts in production .
As he stepped into office , Ford announced an unprecedented financing offer , extending 0 % financing to 72 months .
While the timing of these moves and Mulally ’s hand in them are up for debate , one move is not .
“ I arrive here , and the first day I say , ‘ Let ’s go look at the product
lineup . ’
And they lay it out , and I said , ‘ Where ’s the Taurus ? ’
They
said , ‘ Well , we killed it . ’
I said , ‘ What do you mean , you killed it ? ’
‘ Well , we made a couple that looked like a football .
They did n’t sell
very well , so we stopped it . ’
‘ You stopped the Taurus ? ’ I said .
‘ How
many billions of dollars does it cost to build brand loyalty around a
name ? ’
‘ Well , we thought it was so damaged that we named it the Five
Hundred . ’
I said , ‘ Well , you ’ve got until tomorrow to find a vehicle to
put the Taurus name on because that ’s why I ’m here .
Then you have two
years to make the coolest vehicle that you can possibly make .’? ”
The early move that truly marked his understanding of business , trends , and the economy came in his first couple of months when he mortgaged all of Ford ’s assets for $ 23.6 billion .
At the time it was widely criticized as desperate and he was called an alarmist when he said the money would help in both development and as “ a cushion to protect for a recession or other
unexpected event . ”
advertisement
Two years later , the critics were silenced as his desperate move paid off .
Taking Criticism and Acting on It Many good leaders know what they know and fight forward despite criticism .
The ones who recognize which criticism is warranted and should be acted upon have a chance to be great leaders .
When the first round of Congressional hearings regarding a proposed bailout for Ford , General Motors , and Chrysler were punctuated with headlines such as “ Big Three CEOs Flew Private Jets to Plead for Public Funds “ , the public outrage was deafening .
Mulally heard the cries , understood the reasons , and took action .
He immediately ordered the sale of 5 out of 6 of the company ’s corporate jets and drove to the next round of hearings in a Hybrid .
While it did n’t stifle all of the complaints with many saying it was more of a PR move than genuine interest in saving money , the sentiment faded quickly based upon Ford ’s actions at the hearings .
Mulally made a promise both to his company and the American people .
If Ford accepted a bailout , he would reduce his salary ( currently at $ 2,000,000 a year ) to $ 1 .
Luckily for him , his company , and the American people , they did not accept a bailout and are the last of the Detroit Big 3 who stands as an independent company not in bankruptcy .
Being Fearless in the Face of Adversity
The decision to sell Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata Motors in 2007 was symbolic of the turmoil the company was going through as they received $ 2.3 billion , much lower than what was paid for the companies .
advertisement
Jaguar and Land Rover sales subsequently plummeted due to high oil prices in the summer of 2008 and Tata had to request a bailout from the British government .
Volvo is on the chopping blocks and will likely be sold this year .
Aston Martin is out .
Mercury is slowly vanishing .
These moves are difficult to make as they are often perceived as signs of weakness , but Mulally has one focus : Ford .
His vision of building the company through solidarity rather than diversity appears to be paying off as Ford was profitable ahead of schedule and has recently surpassed GM and Toyota in monthly sales .
Embracing Innovation
There are many instances of Ford being “ ahead of the game ” in an industry that is often slow to embrace trends , especially on the Internet .
SYNC has been instrumental in pulling the younger generation into Ford ’s camp while a focus on building greener cars without sacrificing performance ( see the 2011 Ford Mustang ) has helped to separate them from the “ green at all cost ” mentality going thought the industry , but there is one move that stands out in helping to establish Ford ’s innovative mindset .
When Ford hired Scott Monty in July , 2008 , they were already attempting to embrace social media as a way to get the word out .
Monty and his team aggressively pursued different methods that took advantage of social media ’s greatest marketing strength : conversation .
The Ford Fiesta Movement was an example of the success Ford has had in social media .
Rather than push - marketing where they spread their message in a one - way conversation , they instead opened up engagement and allowed real people to converse back and forth about the launch of the car itself .
advertisement
They did not take control of their dealerships ’ social media message but they did offer support in the way of resources .
Now , Fiesta Movement Chapter 2 is launching and the focus is allowed to change .
Because Chapter 1 was geared around exposure and buzz , Chapter 2 can focus on increasing the potential for sales and pre-orders .
Monty and his team “ earned ” the right to sell because they engaged from the start .
This distinction is what separates good automotive social media from failed attempts by the competitors .
Looking Ahead
The automotive industry is due for a rebound .
We may be in the middle of it right now despite setbacks for some as people can only go so long without buying a new vehicle .
The coming months will tell a lot about who will survive and who will falter , but one thing is certain .
Those who embrace the styles and techniques used by successful leaders such as Alan Mulally will have a stronger chance of coming out on top regardless of what happens in the economy , the world , and the industry .
They just have to keep pointing towards their future .

The Walt Disney Company on Monday warned Cablevision subscribers in New York that the local ABC station signal may go dark this weekend in a dispute over how much it is paid .
If the fight is not resolved , the station could go dark after midnight Saturday , affecting 3.1 million Cablevision customers ’ ability to watch the Academy Awards on Sunday on ABC .
The signal can still be pulled from the air by homes with an antenna and a new TV or digital converter box .
Disney is seeking $ 40 million a year in new fees , Charles Schueler , a spokesman for Cablevision , said in a statement .
Cablevision pays more than $ 200 million a year to Disney .
The dispute involving WABC - TV is similar to the standoff at the end of last year between the News Corporation and Time Warner Cable over how much Fox station signals were worth .
That tussle , which threatened the college football bowl season , was resolved without an interruption .
Two thousand US economists and climate scientists , including eight Nobel laureates , are sending a letter Thursday to the Senate urging lawmakers to require immediate nationwide cuts in greenhouse - gas emissions tied to global warming .
Emerging from a wintertime blizzard of bad press , US and international climate scientists are in damage - control mode , holding press conferences , firing off press releases , and affirming that global warming is quite real and that climate change science is up to snuff .
Despite the " climate - gate " hacked e-mail scandal and embarrassing mistakes in previous scientific reports , the bulk of research shows climate change is incontrovertible , they say .
" We call on our nation ’s leaders to swiftly establish and implement policies to bring about deep reductions in heat - trapping emissions , " the scientists write in the letter .
" The strength of the science on climate change compels us to warn the nation about the growing risk of irreversible consequences as global average temperatures continue to increase . "
That letter comes on the heels of Wednesday 's announcement , by the United Nations secretary general and the chairman of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , that an international independent commission will conduct an independent review of all the IPCC ’s " processes and procedures . "
The move is the latest bid to try to shore up credibility for the IPCC , whose reports were tarred after hacked e-mails appeared to show bias in favor of global warming 's severity during development of the panel 's reports .
Add to that glaring mistakes , such as the erroneous prediction in the IPCC 's 2007 report ( which won a Nobel prize ) that Himalayan glaciers would vanish by 2035 .
In fact , the glaciers are melting about as fast as glaciers worldwide – about double the rate of 40 years ago , NASA has found .
Such revelations " have really shaken the confidence of the public in the conduct of science , " Ralph Cicerone , an atmospheric scientist who heads the US National Academy of Sciences , said last month at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
Recent polls show flagging public confidence that global warming is occurring .
A recent Gallup poll shows 48 percent of Americans think the seriousness of global warming is exaggerated .
“ The IPCC ’s mandate is to provide objective scientific assessments for decision makers , ” IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri said in a statement .
“ The IPCC stands firmly behind the rigor and reliability of its Fourth Assessment Report from 2007 , but we recognize that we can improve .
We have listened and learned from our critics , and we intend to take every action we can to ensure that our reports are as robust as possible . ”
The review will be conducted by the InterAcademy Council , the umbrella organization for the National Academies of Sciences , whose 18 - member body includes top scientists from Argentina , Australia , Brazil , China , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Japan , South Africa , Turkey , Great Britain , and the United States .
The letter - writing scientists say the bulk of climate science is sound and , " if anything , the climate problem is actually worse than reported earlier , " wrote Leon Lederman , director emeritus of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia , Ill. , and a Nobel Prize winning physicist , in an individual statement in the letter to the Senate .
" Physicists tend to be super critical of strong conclusions , but the data on global warming now indicate the conclusions are not nearly strong enough . "
Darren Aronofsky 's directorial debut is a science fiction thriller about mathematician Maximillian Cohen who believes that the universal questions that have plagued humankind for centuries can be solved through a pattern of numbers .
As his search progresses , however , he finds that the solution lies somewhere altogether different .
Filmed for a mere $ 60,000 , Pi made its world premiere at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival where the 29 - year - old Aronofsky received the Directing Award for Dramatic Competition .
It also earned him a $ 1 million deal with Artisan Entertainment and a $ 600,000 contract to direct the Miramax / Dimension film Proteus about a World War II submarine crew afflicted by Nazis and monsters .
For now Aronofsky is allowed a brief respite to bask in his newfound success .
Released this past July , the black and white Pi is inventively shot and tightly scripted .
A phenomenal first film on the level of Quentin Tarantino 's Reservoir Dogs or David Lynch 's Eraserhead , there 's many an accomplished director who would like to claim Pi as their own .
I read that Pi was Eraserhead influenced but I did n't see that in your film .
DA : I think it 's a shallow connection : both films are black and white and about one character .
Lynch 's film is very impressionistic and expressionistic , but Pi is really about a story .
We were trying to make a thriller the whole time .
His movie is so static whereas your camera is constantly moving .
We tried to keep it moving , keep it exciting .
We really wanted a roller coaster ride for 90 minutes .
That was the goal .
It reminded me of the Japanese film Tetsuo .
Was that an influence ?
Definitely — not the film per se — but Shinya Tsukamoto 's entire career .
I 'm a huge fan of his .
About two years ago , I was at Sundance and saw his latest film Tokyo biyori .
It totally inspired me to go out to make the cyberpunk movie in America .
No one has done the cyberpunk genre over here .
One shot that was really interesting in Pi was when it appeared that some sort of camera was hooked to the main character , Max .
That 's called a " Snorri - Cam . "
These Icelandic photographers named the Snorri brothers were using it for still photography and we adapted it for motion pictures .
Max is in the center of the frame and the background is moving around him , the idea being that Max is separated from his environment and from his world .
Was n't Rod Serling also in the mix somewhere ?
Sure .
Rod Serling 's totally the patron saint of the movie .
Is that in terms of the story ?
Just as a genre in general — the idea of placing science fiction in the present and making it psychological as opposed to effects driven .
It preserves the tradition of Serling and Phillip K . Dick in that it works the lines separating paranoia , insanity and genius .
What makes your film sci-fi ?
It 's science fiction in the tradition of those two I just named .
And it 's science fiction in the sense of the retelling of the mad scientist story .
The only difference between my film and Frankenstein is that the monster is named Euclid .
It 's just a digital retelling of Frankenstein .
In another science fiction sense , it 's a cyberpunk movie .
It 's about computers becoming conscious and a mathematician searching for a miracle order in the universe .
In that aspect , it reminded me of 2001 : a Space Odyssey .
Kubrick 's science fiction is always about the psychological .
There 's serious stuff in that movie .
All the effects are inspired by ideas , as is the case with A Clockwork Orange .
In fact , A Clockwork Orange had a huge inspiration on Pi in that I was fed up with all the films that had been coming out that were n't really edgy .
In the theaters this past summer , there were no films that had any sort of style or direction — that were cool , hip and different than other films .
Growing up , I always wanted to see A Clockwork Orange .
I 've seen it at least ten times in the movie theater because it 's so riveting .
I want to aspire to those heights .
Pi's sound quality was very impressive for such an inexpensive film .
That 's a big failing for independent films and I would n't allow that to happen .
With a lot of them you say , " This is pretty good but something 's wrong .
It feels cheap . "
But nine out of ten times it will be because the sound is bad .
We hired a really great sound guy and spent the money on expensive mikes .
I also brought in the sound designer and composer very early on so that we could create an entire soundscape .
That was very important because we were working with such abstract film stock and shooting a lot of very strange images .
It was very important to base the film in a very good sound world .
As far as the theme of the film , were you trying to make a particular anti-technology statement at all ?
There 's sort of an anti-science , anti-technology sentiment , but I think there 's more of an anti-religion , pro-spirituality statement .
That 's more of what 's going on there .
The fear of technology undergirds the film , but it 's not at the forefront .
It 's more about a guy who is detached from his humanity , his emotions .
He 's become like a machine and is basically a robot running a giant supercomputer in his apartment , who has to reach out and find his humanity .
Do you think religion keeps people from finding their humanity ?
No , I think religion is often very different than spirituality .
Religion is often about rules and people trying to control our lives who are actually very unspiritual .
Another message of the film is that God can be found anywhere , and , in fact , everywhere .
And so you do n't necessarily need a religious dogma to get you to spirituality .
I would say Max is a very spiritual person , but his spirituality almost killed him .
So all these things — like religion or technology — keep you from reaching your ultimate goal ?
Well , they can .
They 're basically tools to help us become spiritual .
If they 're abused , they wo n't help us get there .
The key scene of the film seems to take place when Sol Robeson tells
Max the story of how Archimedes discovered the principle of buoyancy .
You seem to be saying that it 's important to step back from something in order to reach the desired end .
Sure .
There 's a lot in my film .
A big part of it is about asking " Why ? " and " What is the meaning of life ? "
The age old questions that people have wondered forever like , " Is there a God ? " " Who is God ? " " What is God ? "
Pi suggests some answers but also asks a lot of questions .
When I was little , I was cross-eyed which made me look stupid .
Since my two eyes pointed in different directions and saw different things , I had trouble learning to read .
This only confirmed my stupidity .
In fact , my elementary school principal told my parents that they had to " face facts , " that I was a " dim bulb . "
My mother never believed the principal nor forgot his words .
She taught me to read when the schools gave up on me and when I began to perform well in school , despite my poor performance on " objective , " " scientific , " standardized tests , I was labeled an " overachiever . "
Somehow , I was cheating the system .
So when I became a college professor , I swore to myself that I would never misjudge my students , never jump to conclusions .
This is a very tough task , one that I often fail at , particularly so with the student whose story I describe below .
I knew very little about my student " W. " except that she excelled in my class .
Yet , after I returned each exam and assignment , she would come up to me to discuss her grade .
I could not understand why she did this .
She got A's on everything so why did she haggle with me over a test score of 96 , insisting that the score should be a 97 ?
On the last day of the school year , I turned in all my final grades to the college registrar ( W. got an A ) , and spent the rest of the day straightening up my office , thinking happily about the freedom that lay ahead of me .
Just then , W. walked into my office and asked if she could meet with me the following day .
She planned to apply to dental school and wanted me to write her a letter of recommendation .
I told her that of course we could meet , but inwardly I was thinking that she was the last student I wanted to see .
As for dental school , she probably wanted to go , I thought uncharitably , so that she could have a nice , secure , predictable job .
( My apologies to dentists for this thought . )
W. came to my office the next day with her " Why I want to be a dentist " essay .
She explained that she was not a native English speaker and hoped that I would read over her essay to correct the grammar .
As I read the essay ( which was grammatically perfect ) , I felt my face flush with for this is what I learned .
W. was born the youngest of six children to a desperately poor family in Viet Nam .
When she was 9 years old , her parents put her and her 16 - year - old sister on a boat to travel to Hong Kong and a better life .
There were some adults on the boat but no other family members .
At one point the boat broke down in Chinese waters , but some kind fishermen helped fix the motor .
They made it to Hong Kong ten days before Hong Kong closed its borders to Vietnamese refugees .
W. spent two years in the refugee camp , on a tarp on the ground .
She was embarrassed for her sister , now with the body of a mature woman , for the two of them were still wearing the same clothes that they wore when they left Viet Nam .
To mend her sister 's clothes , W broke off a piece of barbed wire from the fence surrounding the refugee camp and fashioned it into a needle .
She then unwound some threads from her sleeping tarp and , with her makeshift needle , patched her sister 's clothes .
( At this point in the essay , I looked up and asked W. how she knew to do this , and she said , simply , that she was good with her hands . )
W. had always had bad gums and teeth and assumed that the accompanying was something that everyone felt .
At the refugee camp , she saw a dentist who pulled out the bad teeth and gave her the tools to take care of her mouth and gums .
This was a revelation to W. - that she could go through life without mouth pain .
Meanwhile representatives from several countries interviewed W. and her sister and finally the United States allowed W. and her sister to immigrate .
They arrived in a US city where a small community of other Vietnamese helped them set up their own apartment .
W.'s sister got a job as a manicurist while W. went to high school and worked after school in a dentist 's office .
Ten years after they left Viet Nam , W. and her sister brought their parents to this country .
Now I understood why W had argued over every test point and grade .
She had had to fight for everything she received in her life .
Needless to say , I wrote W. the best letter of recommendation I could write .
She was admitted to every dental school that she applied to .
Since that time , I 've lost track of W. , but I have no doubt that she is somewhere in the world providing exceptional dental care to those who can least afford it .
The world is not run according to climate science .
Amid the almost hysterical jeering since the Copenhagen climate summit , it 's a fact worth remembering .
If things were done with one eye carefully checking the planet 's ecological engines and the resource levels in its fuel tank , it would look very different
The largest indoor snow park in the world would not , for example , be in the roasting Middle Eastern emirate of Dubai .
Public transport would be quick and cheap , and Richard Branson would be an unknown gardener , quietly cycling back and forth to his organically - run allotment .
Yet fear of the likely adjustments needed to halt dangerous climate change seems to fuel the vitriol of the vociferous minority attacking climate science .
It 's odd when you think what those changes might be .
A cartoon currently going around sums it up .
An academic - type gives a lecture , listing the outcomes of climate action : energy independence , clean water , clean air , green jobs , liveable cities , healthy children etc etc , while a man in the audience blusters , " But what if it 's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing ? "
And , it 's not , of course , a hoax .
The basic chemistry of global warming has been understood and remained unchanged for around 200 years .
Stories concerning the science in recent weeks have been of the type , " how long can you hold your breath ? "
Not " can we actually breathe underwater ? "
At the same time , observed trends on greenhouse gas emissions , measured since the last major report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , reveal the opposite of scaremongering .
If anything , the IPCC has been too conservative , having underestimated how quickly we would be pushed toward dangerous change .
Actual carbon emissions have been beyond even their " most fossil - fuel - intensive scenario " .
Crowing over the inclusion in its last report of an erroneous date for the melting of Himalayan glaciers drowned out a new report from the World Glacier Monitoring Service , that detailed an " unbroken acceleration in melting " of glaciers around the world .
Sadly , right now , the climate change deniers have little to fear .
We have no policies or actions remotely equal to the threat .
Why is that ?
It is partly because the world is not run in respect of basic , well - understood physical laws .
It is run according to the dictates of an altogether more variable discipline , economics , whose insights and proposals are subject to a weaker scrutiny .
The real world ticks reliably according to the laws on thermodynamics and the conservation of energy .
Such consistency cannot be claimed for the notion that a deregulated , greed - driven approach is the most efficient way to organise banking .
But what if economic policy was subject to the same standard of evidence and review as climate science ?
What would natural science make of the assumptions underlying mainstream economic models ?
They include the classic assertions that we are all perfectly rational , make choices that are unaffected by the behaviour of others , and that we have " perfect information " , knowing everything important there is to know .
Or there 's the one in which an infinite number of small firms compete in open markets with no barriers to entry ( think Walmart , Microsoft , Amazon , Tesco , Google ) .
And the idea that consumption can grow infinitely on a finite planet .
Orthodox economics is based on simplifications that so distort the real world as to make it unrecognisable , yet its basic tenets are credulously repeated on an almost daily basis in national newspapers and on television news .
A genuinely evidence - based approach to economic policymaking would not produce a system remotely like the one we have , the business - as - usual version that many climate sceptics seem so eager to defend .
Given its task , the vast range of subjects covered , the thousands of scientists involved , and the sheer size of its reports , what 's stunning about the IPCC 's work is that comparing it to any economic analysis used to actually run the world is like comparing the complete Oxford English Dictionary to a guide to slang published by the Sunday Sport .
Elsewhere , some voices have called for there to be a separate climate sceptics ' report .
On one hand , this misses the point .
If the sceptics ' science was good enough to be published in decent , peer - reviewed journals , it would be considered alongside everything else by the IPCC .
But on the other hand , subjecting the deniers to the same degree of rigorous review as everyone else is a rather delicious prospect .
If that was done , the final report would likely be short indeed .
And , on current trends , it is still the case that by the end of the year 2016 , the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will make it unlikely that we 'll stay below the critical 2 °C temperature rise .
It 's 82 months and counting ...
Critics of health reform legislation assert that it would crush small business .
The National Federation of Independent Business , for instance , insists reform will have “ a costly and punitive impact ” on these firms .
I do not understand this argument .
Small businesses face huge disadvantages in today ’s insurance market .
Unlike their larger competitors , they ca n’t self - insure or bargain for low premiums and their small risk pools make them highly susceptible to huge rate hikes if just a single employee gets sick .
The health bill would help level that playing field .
Many — though certainly not all - - small businesses would come out ahead .
There are lots of health bills out there , but let ’s look at President Obama ’s version .
In it , small businesses would get tax subsidies for offering insurance to their workers , low - and some moderate - wage workers will get their own subsidies to purchase coverage ( and some may even be newly covered by Medicaid ) .
Small firms would get access to exchanges that should make it less costly for them to insure their workers .
And , perhaps most important , the bill would take some small steps to control future health costs .
There are some trade - offs .
Many firms with more than 50 workers would have to pay a modest penalty if they do not offer insurance .
Those with more than 200 workers must automatically enroll all employees in their health plans .
But the issue that getting the most attention is Obama 's effort to impose an excise tax on high - cost employer - sponsored plans .
Because small businesses on average pay higher premiums than larger firms , some critics of reform argue that these smaller firms would disproportionately suffer under this tax .
This concern seems wildly overblown .
First , the Obama plan is far from draconian .
It would impose a 40 percent tax on the value of plans in excess of $ 10,200 for individual coverage and $ 27,500 for families .
But the tax would not take effect until 2018 .
And companies with workers whose coverage is more costly due to age or gender or those that are located in high - cost states could offer even more costly plans without being subject to the tax .
Second , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation , the average cost of a family plan last year was $ 13,375 .
Other research estimates that small firms pay , on average , about 20 percent more , so their typical cost is about $ 16,000 — far below the $ 27,500 threshold for taxable plans .
So while small firms , on average , may be more likely than big companies to pay the penalty , few of them will .
And , in any event , none will pay a dime of this excise tax for at least eight years .
By then , if the exchanges work out as hoped , premiums should be much more manageable .
At the same time , very small firms ( include many sole proprietorships ) would be in line for an immediate , extremely generous tax credit for buying insurance .
From 2010 - 2013 , these businesses would be eligible for a credit of up to 35 percent of premiums .
Starting in 2014 , they could get a credit of up to 50 percent of the cost of buying insurance through a state exchange , as long as they pay at least half the premium .
It is easy for critics to pull out individual elements of this vast health plan , rip them as tax increases , and claim , as the NFIB does , that the entire package would be a disaster for small business .
But considering the huge labor market disadvantages these businesses face today as a result of their high insurance costs , most of these small firms are likely to be big winners once the dust settles .

With the civil rights movement still fresh in our collective memories , and with a black president at the nation ’s helm , even the most glib commentators can justify focusing on black history .
But putting aside a whole month to honor women seems harder to explain .
When pressed , most Americans would assume that Women ’s History Month arose from a kind of historical politeness or political correctness .
They would be surprised to learn that we study women to better to understand power .
The study of history is the study of power .
For thousands of years , history has used the crudest measure of power , physical force .
History books have been filled with wars , battles , campaigns , successions and elections , as well as their personnel — generals , soldiers , kings and candidates .
No one tells us more about all the ways that power works than people excluded from its official halls : people of color , and women of all classes and races , among others .
For them , power has different faces .
We study women as we study other marginalized people because they tell us fresh stories of power — power wielded in more subtle but deeply transforming ways .
Dolley Madison , the wife and political partner of our fourth president , James Madison , first revealed the power of a first lady .
She was the first wife of a president to command the unofficial sphere of power .
During her tenure , Dolley cemented Washington , D.C. , as the capital city and during the War of 1812 she became a symbol of unity by embodying disinterested patriotism .
Dolley Madison constructed a social sphere of parties and dinners that operated parallel to the official sphere of congressional sessions and cabinet meetings .
This was vital to the early federal government as it lacked the kind of bureaucracy it would need to develop an infant republic into a budding democracy and powerful nation - state .
In contrast , the political machine built by the ladies of Washington supplied the young government and capital city with ways to lobby for legislation , create bipartisan coalitions , and give out government jobs .
In later decades , the official male establishment would adapt these functions and formalize them into institutions such as lobbyist groups , party machines and the civil service — which turned around and excluded women until the 20th century .
Tracing the path of power in early Washington , then , means not merely examining the official records .
For historians , watching what women do , uncovering the networks of kin and friendship that they built , as well as the men they brought into government , gives a fuller picture of why the early government and capital city amassed so much power in an era that so feared excessive governmental authority .
As first lady from 1809 to 1817 , Dolley Madison was famous for her generous spirit , which seemingly rose above politics and welcomed everyone .
This was crucial in an era of heated politics , which was characterized , like today ’s , by “ all or nothing ” rhetoric , but , unlike today ’s , also by actual violence .
Duels with pistols were as frequent in the nation ’s early days as cable news tirades are in ours .
The official men of the government did not know that working together would be the salvation of the bipartisan system .
They did not have the word “ bipartisan ” in their lexicon , even as they were building a two - party system .
But Dolley Madison instinctively knew that , for all their “ lone gunman ” stances , the government men had to learn to see each other as full human beings if they were going to create a ruling class .
Dolley knew that socializing with families was the way to do it .
By her gently gracious interest in everyone , her toleration and civility , she modeled for her contemporaries a feminine vocabulary of politics , one that stressed empathy for others and cooperation as the ruling style .
The problem with evaluating Dolley Madison ’s legacy is that she lost .
Her efforts did not forestall war with Great Britain , and though her work contributed to the creation of the two - party system , Dolley ’s example of cool leadership did nothing to calm the overheated , hyper - masculinity of American politics .
Because she had no official power , Dolley ’s individual efforts could only go so far .
This is another power lesson we learn from studying women .
Winners might write history , but the experiences of those who lose are often more instructive .
Dolley ’s time may have come .
With Women ’s History Month , we can newly evaluate a model of governance rooted in shared humanity , one that stresses bridges over bunkers , and finally see it as her lasting gift to the nation .
By making politics a party to which everyone is invited , Dolley Madison was the most modern politician of her time .
The Obama presidency has given rise to much soul - searching about who we are as a nation and how we should behave toward each other , within our borders and around the world .
Perhaps this is the time we should consider the alternatives Dolley offered us at the dawn of the national experiment .
In the early days of the nation , few of Dolley ’s contemporaries could resist her invitations .
At this particular turning point in our modern nationhood , neither should we .

A third of all marriages in modern Kyrgyzstan are kidnaps .
Typically , a man abducts his bride by force or deception , enlisting his family to break her resistance to the wedding through hours of persuasion .
If successful , the next morning the bride will sit quietly in a curtained - off area wearing the traditional white wedding headscarf and an imam will be called in to marry the couple .
The Kyrgyz phrase ala kachuu describes this process – literally , it means " grab and run " .
Some brides are kidnapped by strangers , others by men they know .
Some escape after violent ordeals , but most are persuaded to stay by tradition and fear of scandal .
In Muslim Kyrgyzstan , where virginity is revered , a girl who has been kidnapped and then leaves is considered to be tainted .
If her family refuses to allow her back home because of the shame , she has few options .
With their purity in question after a night spent at a man 's house , many women accept what they believe is their fate .
Although the practice is said to have its roots in nomadic customs , the tradition remains at odds with modern Kyrgyzstan .
Ala kachuu was outlawed during the Soviet era and remains illegal under the Kyrgyz criminal code , but since the country 's declaration of independence in 1991 , incidents have surged .
Partly , this is because ala kachuu is seen as a symbol of a national identity denied by Soviet rule .
But also , in this religious country , there are few opportunities for single men and women to meet and socialise .
Parental pressure on a man to take a wife at a certain age remains strong and , compared with the expense of ritualistic weddings , kidnapping a bride is considered a cheaper alternative for his family , who traditionally pay for the wedding .
Usually a kidnap is marked by a Muslim ceremony in the home , though some families hold a wedding party .
An animal is slaughtered and celebrations can last up to a month .
These marriages are rarely officially registered , however , leaving the bride with no rights to property or children .
After marriage , a bride is considered to belong to her husband 's family , who pay for her education and living costs .
So , often , the decision to leave a daughter with her kidnapper is an economic one .
Even if the family do protest , they rarely prosecute , since corruption is rife in the justice system and the police are commonly paid off by the kidnapper and his family .
Instead , the groom 's family will visit the bride 's family after the wedding to ask forgiveness for their son's actions , bringing with them gifts such as sheep , cattle or money , clothes , vodka and sweets .

By the late 1960s , the American landscape was ravaged by decades of unchecked land development , blighted by urban decay in the big cities , and plagued by seemingly unstoppable air , noise , and water pollution .
In November 1971 , the newly created Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) announced a monumental photodocumentary project to record changes in the American environment
If a photo is worth a 1000 words , this collection rates millions -- which I will spare you here .
These photos document tragic situations , stark problems that we see today in increased and worsened dimensions ) .
They also have documentations of problems that we have solved ( okay , perhaps ameliorated / partially addressed ) .
And , as per the image to the right , they document promise that we have yet to see fulfilled .
This is a photo taken by Frank Lodge of an
Exhibit at the First Symposium on Low Pollution Power Systems Development Held at the Marriott Motor Inn , Ann Arbor Vehicles and Hardware Were Assembled at the EPA Ann Arbor Laboratory .

And , of course , 30 years later , GM remained in the EV picture as we wondered " Who Killed The Electric Car ? "
Documerica ran from 1971 through 1977 as " the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) hired freelance photographers to capture images relating to environmental problems , EPA activities , and everyday life in the 1970s . "
The National Archives has digitized more than 15,000 photos and made them available for public access .

For the longest time hybrid automobiles have brought to mind one image in people ’s minds — the Toyota Prius .
This is mainly because Toyota and the Prius model have been the leaders in the hybrid market .
However , there are a lot of people that do n’t want a wedge - shaped five - door hatchback .
In fact , there are a lot of people that just find the Prius unsightly .
This is where our four hybrids come in that are changing the face of the hybrid automobile .
2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid
2011 Lexus CT 200h
Two of the above are sports cars that are bound to change the face of the industry by proving that you can be environmentally friendly and still have fun .
The other two show consumers that you can have a regular looking car ( a sedan in one case and a wagon in the other ) that still has all the benefits of hybrid technology like that of the Toyota Prius .
Be sure to check out the links above to check out all the information on these revolutionary vehicles from our partner site AllSmallCars.com .

you fly across the screen at a 45 degree angle .
He can slide along the ground face first and hit punch during for a followup ( only when oiled up ) .
Has an air grab where he belly flops .
Dragon Punch motion +

He takes out both hands and dumps oil on himself and it looks funny .
He then glows white .
When he has oil , he is 200 % better .
putting oil on takes half a second , and its duration based .
EX - Oil lasts a long time .
In non-oil mode , he is like Zangief .
When he is in Oil Mode , he can chain everything , like Crouching Light Kick 4 x into Medium Punch .
Moves in oil mode have more range , including 360 .
Front and backdash are better in oil mode too .
All of his pokes have neutral and toward versions .
Has a ' trap ' ultra , where he lays down , and if you step on him , he grabs you .
You cannot touch him at all , even if not attacking .
You slip on his stomach like its ice .
Then he 69s you as you slide along the ground and you fly out his buttocks .
The 2nd ultra is comedy as well .
720 motion , throws you up in the air and you board the OIL COASTER .
You ride him going around his body till you are ejected into a wall at the end .
His Super is double fireball with kick .
Its a leaping grab that 's crouchable , like Alex DDT he leaps at you .
BBC - Enthüllung Äthiopiens Rebellen klauten Live - Aid-Millionen
Es war die weltgrößte öffentliche Hilfsaktion : Beim Pop - Projekt Band Aid und dem folgenden Benefizkonzert Live Aid kamen 1985 Hunderte Millionen Dollar für die Hungernden Äthiopiens zusammen .
Wie die BBC jetzt berichtet , zweigten Rebellen einen Großteil des Geldes ab - und kauften Waffen davon .
George Clayton woke up on March 3 to 153 emails — quite a lot for the North Dallas High School teacher .
The night before , he had pulled off a stunning upset of 26 - year incumbent Geraldine " Tincy " Miller , R - Dallas , in the GOP primary for the State Board of Education 's District 12 seat .
Now everyone wanted a piece of him — the press , other board members , educators , constituents — and they wanted to know how he will vote on the deeply divided board .
When he joins the board in January ( he has no Democrat opponent in the general election ) , Clayton ’s vote could prove crucial in whether social conservatives continue to dominate a board notorious for ideological bickering .
A bloc of seven social conservatives on the 15 - member panel has garnered national attention — or disgrace , some would say — with its messy public challenges to evolution in the science curriculum and , more recently , with its right - wing rewriting of history standards .
In the past , the bloc has succeeded by pulling its requisite eighth vote from either Rick Agosto , D - San Antonio , or from a revolving cast of moderate Republicans .
But the outcome of this year ’s elections threatens that alliance .
The most outspoken member of the social conservative bloc , Don McLeroy , R - Bryan , narrowly lost to a moderate Republican in the primary .
Another of the social conservatives , Cynthia Dunbar , R - Richmond , did not run .
Further , the Democratic swing voter on whom the bloc often relied — Agosto — also stepped aside .
Two other incumbents — Ken Mercer , R - San Antonio and Rene Nunez , D - El Paso — face general election challenges , which they are expected to win .
( Then again , everyone expected Miller to beat Clayton . )
For now , Clayton proclaims his independence — though he gives a pretty clear indication that social conservatives should n’t count on him .
" I am not going to side with either of those two factions , " he says .
Much like Thomas Ratliff — the Republican who beat social conservative icon and former SBOE chair McLeroy — Clayton talks a lot about de-politicizing the board .
" The debates over social studies , the debates over evolution ... all of that needs to come to a quick end , " he says .
" That is not the duty of the board .
I think it overstepped itself bringing those political issues onto the stage . "
The SBOE 's recent fights over which figures to include in the state 's social studies curriculum echo similar battles over science , in which the board demanded teaching the weaknesses in the fossil record — which many creationists see as the prime argument against evolution .
In social studies , the board has pushed an aggressively conservative and patriotic agenda , while limiting mention of minority historical figures and any event casting American policy negatively .
Clayton has no patience for what he calls " all of the nonsense . "
He says he has no problem with the teaching of evolution in school , and that he would have pushed for the inclusion of Cesar Chavez and Thurgood Marshall in the history curriculum .
( Two board - appointed curriculum “ expert reviewers , ” both Christian conservative evangelists , recommend cutting Chavez and Marshall ; social conservatives have since assured they will include them . )
“ I was taught evolution , and it did n’t shake my faith in the Almighty whatsoever , ” he says .
“ Should creationism be taught as a counter to evolution ? …
No , I do n’t think so .
I think evolution is in the science book — it should be taught as a science . ”
" If the members of the board are that politically inclined , " Clayton says , " then they need to be in the Legislature , which is the proper forum for that . "
Such proclamations may be bad news for Jonathan Saenz , spokesman for the right - leaning Liberty Institute .
Saenz is adamant that efforts to de-politicize the board will fail because of left - leaning activists that lobby the board .
“ The first time Thomas Ratliff or George Clayton does n’t vote the way the Austin liberals want , they ’ll be all over them just like they were Don McLeroy , ” he says .
“ It will be business as usual . ”
Clayton , for his part , vows to bring the voice of teachers into the board ’s debates .
He has proposed quarterly town hall meetings , where teachers could share their own struggles .
His website , however , proposes a variety of policies that the state board does n't control — everything from minimizing the impacts of standardized testing to increasing teachers ' salaries .
Clayton says he understands the board ’s limited power , but that he would use his influence as to lobby the Legislature .
“ Since we ’re representing these districts , [ we could ] say , ‘ Boy , these teachers need some money — what can we do it about ? ’ ” he says .
Clayton seems to view teachers as his primary constituency — in stark contrast to some socially conservative members , who have openly dismissed what they call “ the education establishment ” as a bastion of liberalism .
North Dallas High School , where Clayton teaches , has struggled with low teacher retention , and only 56 percent of students graduate in four years .
Clayton says watching such problems as a teacher inspired his interest in running .
“ The teacher is the face of education , ” he says .
Clayton ’s emphasis on a nonpartisan , teacher - based approach echoes the ideology of the woman he just defeated .
Miller , a former reading specialist in the public schools , was fond of saying , “ There ’s no Republican or Democratic way to educate a child . ”
Though she decried partisanship , she was still a traditional Republican who sometimes sided with social conservatives .
“ Her conservatism was eclipsed by the [ social conservative ] radicalism , ” says Dan Quinn , spokesman for the Texas Freedom Network , one of the SBOE ’s biggest critics .
Miller attributes the defeat to the negative press around the state board generally .
She acknowledges that she ’s still having trouble coping with the loss , but Miller applauds what she hopes will be a new direction for the board .
“ We ’re seeing a move , a slow move but a gradual move , back to the middle — more moderation if you will — and that ’s good , ” she says .
“ That ’s always a positive . ”
She still does n’t quite understand how she lost .
She outspent Clayton by an enormous margin and spent all her time knocking on doors and attending forums , she says .
“ I was trying to do it right , ” she says .
“ It was n’t enough . ”
Clayton , on the other hand , believes he understands how he won : “ I think she felt , well , this guy ’s nobody .
He ’s just a teacher .
Well , I think ‘ just us teachers ’ went out and beat her . ”
No one knows how Clayton will fit into the mix .
Miller , despite running against him , says she has little sense of his ideology .
“ He ’s not really a quote - unquote Republican , ” she says .
“ All I know is that George Clayton is a very angry man and a very angry teacher . ”
Education lobbyist Davis Anderson , of Austin - based Hillco Partners , believes Clayton will remain a political enigma even after he starts voting .
“ I think he is a true independent , ” Anderson says .
“ There will be some things that he will vote with conservative Republicans , I think ; there are other things [ where ] he ’ll vote with moderate Republicans .
“ What would be great to see is more of a nonpartisan approach to some of the issues , ” Anderson says .
“ But I ’m not sure , immediately coming off an election , you ’ll see that . ”

Many people have asked me how I manage to bring such a scientific approach to writing jokes about penises and dicks .
It actually goes back to my seventh grade science class when I wrote the joke , " Hey , Mr. Higgins , I do n't need to dissect this pig fetus to know what 's inside it ! "
I never got to finish the joke because of the sudden onset of symptoms from a pig disease no human body was expecting to catch .
Baffled doctors told me I 'd never walk again without it being towards sex with a ham , but I never lost my love of science .
I even kept the textbook we used that year .
Thanks , public school !

MOMENTS after she stabbed her boyfriend to death on Christmas Day , a NSW Central Coast woman sent a text message telling another man she was going to eat the body because " I think he tastes good " .
In the NSW Supreme Court today , Tamie Melehan admitted to killing her boyfriend , but pleaded not guilty to murder by reason of mental illness .
David Vaughan , 30 , suffered 16 stab wounds to his neck , six to his chest and four to his abdomen during the frenzied knife attack by his girlfriend of three months at her apartment on December 25 , 2008 .
An autopsy revealed his jugular veins had been slashed on both sides of his neck and he died from those " rapidly fatal " injuries .
As her murder trial was about to begin , Melehan , 29 , admitted to the actions which caused Mr Vaughan 's death , but pleaded not guilty for reasons of mental illness .
Melehan has a long history of mental illness and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2002 , the court heard .
Prosecutor Michael O'Brien said that at the time Mr Vaughan was killed , Melehan sent another man a series of text messages telling him she missed him and inviting him over to feast on her boyfriend 's " delicate meat " .
" Oi , can I eat this fella ? " she said .
" I think he tastes good ... there 's enough to go around if you want to join in - no joke , delicate meat ...
" Dear me , need help to get rid of the body . "
A little later she phoned her mother saying : " Can you come over and get him before I slit his throat ? "
Melehan 's mother , Loretta Watts , arrived at her daughter 's home to find Mr Vaughan dead on the floor of the shower with blood gurgling out of a slash wound in his neck .
Mr O'Brien told Justice Monika Schmidt there was ample psychiatric evidence to support claims that Melehan was suffering " an acute exacerbation of her chronic mental illness " and was acting in " a delusional way " at the time of the attack .
" The Crown submits on the evidence that is before your honour , your honour would make a finding that the accused is not guilty of the offence within the grounds of mental illness , " he said .
Justice Schmidt adjourned proceedings and is expected to give her decision soon .
Is a flawed health - care bill better than no bill at all ?
Marcia Angell , a single - payer supporter and former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine , does n't believe the House bill is better than nothing .
She thinks , instead , that it " throws more money into a dysfunctional and unsustainable system , with only a few improvements at the edges , and it augments the central role of the investor - owned insurance industry . "
The fact that we need to do something does not mean we need to do this .
" I would rather see us do nothing now , " Angell concludes , " and have a better chance of trying again later and then doing it right . "
This is , I think , a misreading of not only the politics of this issue going forward , and also the history of health - care reform going backward .
Failure does not bring with it a better chance for future success .
It brings a trimming of future ambitions .
Truman sought single payer .
His failure led to Kennedy and Johnson , who confined their ambitions to poor families and the elderly .
Then came Nixon , whose reform plan was entirely based around private insurers and government regulation .
He was followed by Carter , who favored an incremental , and private , approach , and Clinton , who again sought to reform the system by putting private insurers into a market that would be structured and regulated by the government .
His failure birthed Obama 's much less ambitious proposal , which attempts to reform not the health - care system , but the small group and nongroup portions of the health - care system by putting a small minority of private insurance plans into a market that 's structured and regulated by the government , and closed off to most Americans .
Failure does not breed success .
Obama 's defeat will not mean that more ambitious reforms have " a better chance of trying again . "
It will mean that less ambitious reformers have a better chance of trying next time .
Conversely , success does breed success .
Medicare and Medicaid began as fairly limited programs .
Medicaid was pretty much limited to extremely poor children and their caregivers .
Medicare did n't cover prescription drugs , or individuals with disabilities , or home health services .
But once the programs were passed into law , they were slowly and continually improved .
They became more expansive , with Medicaid growing to cover not only poor families but also poor adults , and the federal government giving states the option , and matching dollars , to include more people under the program 's umbrella .
Medicare was charged with covering people with long - term disabilities , and it was eventually strengthened with a drug benefit , more preventive coverage , the option of supplementary plans and much more .
It is not hard to imagine health - care reform following a similar path .
The exchanges can be opened to all employers and all individuals , creating a competitive insurance market virtually overnight .
The public plan could be strengthened , or the government could begin to set payment rates for insurers who participate in the exchange ( as is common in other countries ) .
Subsidies could expand , and new funds could be used to encourage the development of integrated care organizations rather than simple insurance companies .
The public option could be strengthened and the employer tax exclusion converted , as Ron Wyden has long advocated , into a standard deduction , which would strike at the heart of the employer - based market .
But all that is predicated on the creation of this new , flawed , insufficient system .
As any scientist will tell you , it 's much easier to encourage something to evolve in a certain direction than it is to create it anew .
The idea that a high - profile failure in a moment where a liberal Democrat occupies the White House and Democrats hold 60 seats in the Senate for the first time since the 1970s will encourage a more ambitious success later does not track with the history of this issue , nor with the political incentives that future actors are likely to face .
If even Obama 's modest effort proves too ambitious for the political system , the result is likely to be a retreat towards even more modest efforts in the future , as has happened in the past .

A dad was killed in a freak accident when a plane crashed on top of him as he jogged along a beach .
Robert Jones , 38 , was struck from behind by pilot Edward Smith after he got into difficulties at 3,000ft and oil began spraying on to his windscreen .
The propeller then fell off and the single - engined plane began falling from the sky .
Aiming the craft at the nearby beach , Mr Smith had no vision ahead of him and the runner was unable to hear the plane because its engine had stalled and he was listening to his iPod .
Witness Patrick Murphy , boss of a beachside bar , said : “ It was awful .
It was obvious the engine had gone as there was no sound – it was like a glider . ”
Firefighter Joheida Fister added : “ The pilot and his passenger were really shaken .
I would have to say that it was a very unusual incident . ”
Mr Smith had tried to make it to the nearby Hilton Head airport in South Carolina , America .
But when his windscreen became smeared and he lost power he had no choice but to crash - land .
Mr Jones of Woodstock , Georgia , had two children .
The name of the plane passenger has not been released .
Aviation experts are investigating the cause of Monday evening ’s crash .
The 370 mph four - seat Experimental Lancair IV - P can be built from a kit .
It was yesterday attached to an anchor so the tide would not pull it out to sea .
There are so many benefits to having a dog in your home as part of your family , and many people …
“ We ’ll be posting videos to YouTube , ’’ Filamond said .
A motley crew of friends who ate bagels at the yard sale and hula - hooped in a colorful variety of vintage , geek , and repurposed finery planned to visit .
Many traveled down in 2008 to check out the site .
Their extensive plan , detailed on texarrakis.com , includes clearing brush and building a water capture system , raised garden beds , and some kind of latrine .
A wind generator will power lights , electronics , and cellphones .
Do n’t call them slackers , though .
They like good hard work .
They may need to map the land ’s boundaries :
They could n’t get the only surveyor in Culberson County , someone called Smiley , on the phone , Filamond said .
“ It just seems so logical to us for some reason , ’’ said Filamond , Atwood ’s girlfriend , wearing a tie - dyed silk skirt .
“ Selling our time away by the hour . . . is just very draining . ’’
Moving , they believe , means time for creative projects .
She ’s a fiber artist ; Gibeault and Atwood write .
But you have to unload the old life to start the new , especially if the new life requires water receptacles and a windmill .
So the foursome set up a trading post in Somerville last Saturday to sell the detritus of civilization — a “ Braveheart ’’ DVD , a croquet set , Nintendo controllers , ski boots .
Atwood presided over the proceedings in a cowboy get - up .
Now , Atwood , Gibeault , Mariah Sharpe , 25 , of Northampton , and Haley Filamond , 21 , are trading subways for silence , the Milky Way in JP for the one in the night sky .
According to Census data , Texas ’s Culberson County has less than one person for each of its 3,812 square miles .
In Texarrakis ’s founding myth , charismatic ringleader Gene Atwood , 28 , of Watertown bought the land off eBay in 2003 for $ 550 plus $ 100 in fees .
He put it on his mom ’s credit card .
Early next week , Gibeault and three friends will put into action the most outlandish escape fantasy short of flying to the moon :
They ’re driving 2,300 miles to a 5.152 - acre patch of dirt in the west Texas borderlands , 18 miles from the nearest town , to live off the land for at least a year .
They call it “ Texarrakis , ’’ a reference to the desert planet in “ Dune . ’’
It ’s 2010 and war , economic downturn , and a crummy job market wear on .
It ’s enough to make anyone feel the lure of the wild — of leading an independent , authentic life instead of “ working full time at menial jobs for low pay and drinking and going to parties to make us feel like we ’re having fun , ’’ as 25 - year - old Mat “ Chopper ’ ’ Gibeault of Belmont put it .
“ It ’s been leading up to something like this , ’’ said Peter Berard , 24 , now of Brooklyn .
Even as a teenager , Atwood “ was talking about going out and forming his own community . ’’
Atwood ’s mother , Martha Fay of Roslindale , 60 , applauds the venture .
Although she admitted to a little empty - nest syndrome and a few “ mother worries , ’’ “ my main feeling is one of pride , ’’ she said .
“ You want to see your kids be themselves . ’’
As for safety , “ He ’s going into this having researched it to death , ’’ Fay said .
“ He knows more about living in the desert than I do , and I ’ve lived in the desert . ’’
She plans to visit in June .
The urge to chuck it all and start over , scratching out a life on the land , is woven into the fabric of this country , starting with the Pilgrims and followed by waves of immigrants and pioneers who pushed west till they could go no farther .
Opportunities to blaze trails are harder to come by these days , but many still dream of abandoning modern life for something more rugged .
Of course , the realities are often none too romantic , but many people who hear of the Texas plan ca n’t help but see it that way .
“ I definitely sometimes want to get away , ’’ said Kevin Guiney , 40 , of Arlington .
Still , getting away for him means a Maine lake “ within driving distance . ’’
Tag sale visitor Seth Rosen , 27 , of Somerville has lived in California , worked on a cruise ship , and gone to the desert festival Burning Man .
“ I feel like people have needs that normal society is n’t fulfilling , ’’ he said .
Even so , Rosen was taken aback to hear the foursome was moving to a place that remote .
“ I ’m surprised they ’re not bringing the croquet set , ’’ he said .
“ It seems like that would be useful . ’’
Some of the settlers - to - be sound more light - hearted than others .
Sharpe approached the move with ease .
He was psyched to ditch “ all my childhood knickknacks , ’’ he said , with a puckish grin , picking dirt off his bare toes .
The Converse - wearing Gibeault , however , had some angst over selling his boxes of neatly packaged comics .
“ I got over my deep depression over it a couple of hours ago , ’’ he half - joked , hollow - eyed from lack of sleep .
His girlfriend is staying in Somerville .
Regardless , the need to escape drove Gibeault .
If he did n’t go , he ’d become “ a misanthropic weirdo , ’’ he said .
Besides , the land is glorious .
“ You have no idea . ’’
In the end , the group made $ 1,300 from the tag sale .
Most of it came from Gibeault ’s comics .

Which Sayid Are Ya On ?
Rough Night , Huh ?
Everybody ’s Kung - Fu Fighting .
You Sayid Goodbye , I Say Hellooooooo , Claire !
Well Hello , Claire ( ice )
I Will Follow You Into the Dark
Flocke :
What if I told you that you could have anything you wanted ?
What if I said you could have anything in the entire world ?
Sayid : I would tell you that the only thing I ever wanted died in my arms .
And I ’ll never see it again .
Flocke :
What if you could ?
Let the Bodies Hit the Floor
An Offer You Can’t Refuse
Last week , I titled my review , “ Choosing Sides . ”
On second thought , should ’ve held onto that for a week .
Because last night , with dead Jacob and not - so - dead - Fake - Locke serving as captains , teams were truly decided .
And the result was , quite frankly , one of the best non-finale episodes since The Constant .
What emerged last night was a much clearer picture of LOST ’s endgame .
And from what I can tell , it has to do with deliverance from evil , self - actualization and being careful what you wish for .
I 'll get to all that at the end of the article .
But first , let 's talk about what we saw .
Last night ’s alternate reality storyline focused on Sayid , the tortured torturer whose love for Nadia and moral ambiguity apparently were not sacrificed in this iteration of his life .
In the world where Oceanic 815 did n’t crash , Sayid ’s essential make up has remained the same : he still served as a Republican Guard “ interrogator , ” he still cares for Nadia and he still ca n’t decide whether he ’s a lover or a fighter .
But , at least initially , this version of Sayid is strong enough to let go of the love of his life .
However , he does n’t let her too far out of his sight , as his own brother has married her and they have two lovely , precocious , boomerang - wielding children .
Sayid , meanwhile , is content to play the role of favorite uncle .
He brings the kids presents from his business trip to Sydney , but even they can see through his veneer and sense his love for their mother .
( Kind of icky , by the way ) .
What we ’ve seen in the alternate reality are characters who have – to varying degrees – coped with their assorted demons .
Sayid temporarily quelled his dark side by resigning himself the uncle role , realizing that he was too violent , vicious and dark to be what the love of his life needed .
Or , in his words , “ I ca n’t be with you because I do n’t deserve you .
” But whereas characters like Jack and Kate seem to be more fully combating their flaws in the alternate reality , characters like Sayid ( and perhaps Claire ) ca n’t fully silence those demons .
In Sayid ’s case , his brother ’s careless mistake of taking a loan from the scariest mofo on the planet forces him to give in to his inherent darkness .
His brother implores him to intervene – even playing the “ for Nadia ’s sake ” card – and Sayid can only manage to refuse to step in until his brother is hospitalized from a “ mugging .
” At that point , Sayid got all Sayid on everyone ’s asses .
After being involuntarily included in a meeting with Keamy , Omar and one of their henchmen , Sayid got pushed a little too far .
Even after Keamy caved and absolved the loan , Sayid ’s darkness overcame him , and he cooked up a carnage omelet in the kitchen of a restaurant , murdering all three men in cold blood .
Granted the grace to let go of his anger in this alternate timeline , Sayid nevertheless reverted to what was comfortable to him : violence .
I ’m going to come back to that in a little while .
But first … Okay , it was a freezer .
But Jin !
Wondering what happened to him after his TSA airport arrest ?
Here ’s what .
Jin was being held by Keamy and his men , and lucky for him , an angry Iraqi just turned his luck right around .
Did the introduction of Jin into this story arc seem random to anyone ?
Me , too .
Until I remembered who Jin works for : Mr. Paik .
Remember , Jin was delivering a watch ( and cash , apparently ) to Mr. Paik ’s business associate in Los Angeles .
And who is a known business associate of Mr. Paik ?
Charles Widmore !
And ( last question ) who do we know Martin Keamy to have worked for in his checkered past ?
Widmore .
I think Jin ’s detention at the airport angered Widmore ’s henchmen ( Keamy and Company ) , and they were holding him until he could recover the funds lost in the process .
And that ’s when Sayid unwittingly rode in to the rescue .
What becomes of them from here is a story for another week .
And I bet you ’re expecting me to brandish my old , “ Oh , character connections mean the storylines are going to converge , see , see , look how right I am !!
Look ! ” chestnut .
Well first of all , I do n’t talk like that .
And secondly , I ’m not going to say that .
I 'll have you know , I ’ve got a different theory about the significance of the alternate reality .
I ’ll tell you as soon as I ’m done breaking down one of the coolest on - Island storylines in recent history .
“ There ’s a war coming . ”
Or so we ’ve been told .
Until last night , I was n’t sure how much I believed that .
Ha !
Let ’s get ready to rumble .
“ For every man there is a scale .
On one side of the scale there is good .
On the other side , evil .
This machine tells us how the scale is balanced .
Yours tipped the wrong way .
” Before asking him to go kill Flocke , Dogen dismissed Sayid as pure evil – an accusation that spawned an excellent fight scene .
But later , we saw Dogen issue a challenge to Sayid .
Much in the same way that we saw Alternate Sayid ( and , hell , Sayid for the last five seasons ) torn between his violent nature and his desire for serenity , Dogen moved the first pawn last night .
He challenged him to prove his inner goodness , and Sayid took the bait .
A little word of advice to Sayid : if somebody wants you to prove you ’re not evil by stabbing a man , you are probably being played .
Before Sayid can embark out on his journey , Miles warns him that whatever brought him back from the dead , it was n’t the Temple Others .
You could just see it in Sayid ’s face : he knew right then that he was n’t about to prove himself a good man .
That “ darkness ” Dogen told him about was no myth , and he knew it .
Just then , a visit from Claire !
Or , as later described by Miles , “ Right , Claire .
She just strolled in here a couple hours ago , acting all weird .
Still hot though . ”
Hands down , the line of the night .
And I could n’t agree more .
Before Claire entered the Temple , though , did you catch her asking Flocke why Jin or Sawyer could n’t deliver the message ?
That was a nice little nugget of confirmation that Sawyer is indeed allied with them , and Jin is along for the ride , for now .
Claire ’s mission seemed a little empty , did n’t it ?
What , she was just supposed to tell Dogen to come out and play ?
Regardless , it did n’t work .
Instead , this is when Dogen altered Sayid ’s mission plan to include the dagger - through - the - heart strategy .
In the mission briefing , though , Dogen tells Sayid that Claire is under the influence of a “ trapped ” man who is now free because of Jacob ’s death , and who wants to destroy every living thing on the Island .
Most ominously , he declared , “ He is evil incarnate . ” Pretty heady stuff .
And it seems that , no matter where Sayid goes , he has someone simultaneously pulling him toward good and evil .
Within 30 minutes , Dogen went from banishing the “ evil ” Sayid to challenging him to prove his worth .
The survivors did this to Sayid early on in the series – wanting him to be the caged pit bull most days , but expecting him to channel his torturer instincts when needed , at the drop of a hat .
Even his army commanders in Iraq – and the Americans he worked with during the war – tried to play both sides of Sayid ’s psyche .
I think Sayid ’s moral ambiguity is both a product and a reflection of this kind of treatment .
I actually still think he ’s a good guy .
But when you ’re capable of what he ’s capable of , people do n’t want to use that for good .
Even if they like you .
And if you get told you ’re a “ violent man , ” enough times , you start to believe it .
In Sayid ’s case , he ’s taken it to heart .
Meanwhile , Claire is attempting to lure a sociopath ’s dog into a dungeon .
Okay , she ’s just chilling down there waiting for her “ friend ” to come set her free .
If you did n’t get a clear , “ It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again , ” vibe from this scene , then I congratulate you on having a mind that does n’t automatically take you to the darkest place possible .
And also on getting much more sleep than I did last night .
Because that was just terrifying .
Claire seems fairly well at peace – if not “ all there ” – while sulking at the bottom of that well and murmuring the lyrics to “ Catch a Falling Star , ” ( the song she requested Aaron ’s adoptive parents sing to him before she decided to keep him , and the song that was sung to her as a child ) .
And then Kate has to come and snap Claire right back into full - blown crazy mode by revealing that yes , in fact , she had taken Aaron off the Island and raised him .
Good move , Austen .
If there ’s one piece of advice that I can very confidently give to anyone in the world , it ’s this : no matter how hot a chick is , if she ’s crazy , do n’t go out of your way to piss her off .
But Claire did n’t snap like I thought she would .
She almost seemed to pity Kate , telling her , “ I ’m not the one that needs to be rescued . “
Claire seems more interested in revenge and validation at this point than she does in a mother and child reunion .
And with the Others removed as prime suspects in Aaron ’s abduction , Kate has just become enemy number one .
If I were her , I would n’t turn my back on Claire .
Hell , if I were anyone , I would n’t turn my back on Claire .
She ’ll put an axe right through your heart and make a poop baby .
You do n’t come back from that level of crazy .
I wo n’t spend much time on Flocke and Sayid ’s jungle conversation , because while it was unbelievably powerful , it was also fairly straightforward .
One set of dialogue I do want to make sure you keep in mind , though , is this : Yeah , remember that .
That offer was the straw that broke the camel ’s back for Sayid ; the final shred of evidence he needed to believe that his only path to deliverance was one shrouded in darkness .
He returned to the Temple with the stark , confident message that , “ There is a man in the jungle …he wants you to know that Jacob is dead .
And because he ’s gone , none of you have to stay here anymore .
You ’re free .
The man that I met is leaving the Island forever .
And those of you who want to go with him , should leave the Temple and join him .
You have until sundown to decide .
” With that , Sayid tossed a mental grenade in the room .
The Temple entered full freak - out mode , with the Others forcing themselves to instantly make a metaphorical version of the decision Sayid has wrestled with all his life : do I take the easy way out , even though I believe it to be evil ?
Or do I stick it out and do things the hard way , because I believe it to be the right way ?
Most of them chose the easy way out ; to follow Flocke to freedom , off the Island .
But some chose to stay .
And I ’m really glad they did .
Because what ensued was a scene that I will always look back on as one of LOST ’s finest .
In fact , I ’ll call it the best scene since Michael shot Ana Lucia ( mercifully ) and Libby ( tragically ) in Season Two .
Yes , that good .
That powerful .
Just when you were starting to like Dogen … The surly Temple Master opened up to Sayid toward the end of last night ’s episode ( and , as it would turn out , his life ) , explaining that he was brought to the Island as part of a sinister bargain with Jacob .
Jacob agreed to save Dogen ’s son's life after Dogen injured him by driving drunk after baseball practice .
In return for the gesture , Dogen agreed to come live on and serve the Island , and his only remnant of his relationship with his son was that tattered baseball we ’d seen him rend between his hands for the last few episodes .
Did Dogen ’s plight remind anyone of Juliet ’s ?
A loved one saved by Jacob in return for a life of servitude to the Island ?
Me , too .
It was pretty touching , actually .
But not for Sayid , who figured he ’d do Dogen the favor of ending his Island captivity by drowning him in The Spring .
Sayid ’s darkness and evil was in full effect at this point .
And when Lennon got in the way , you knew he was next .
Even the previously un-frighten - able Ben Linus backed away from the bad man when Sayid told him it was “ too late ” for him to be saved .
Pure , unadulterated , dark evil .
But nothing compared to the fate that awaited the Temple dwellers who did n’t take Flocke up on his offer of escape .
Earlier in the episode , Flocke told Claire , “ I always do what I say . ”
He was n’t kidding .
Flocke went out for a smoke , and came roaring through the Temple with reckless abandon .
Kate would ’ve fallen victim to it had Claire not gotten her out of the way .
But all the Temple Others that stayed around were wiped out .
The only other people who escaped Smokey ’s wrath : Ilana , Frank , Sun and Ben – who arrived to the Temple just in time to almost die – as well as tag - along Miles .
Their narrow escape salvaged a thin sliver of hope for Team Jacob , but things do n’t look good .
Because while the Avengers were slipping out the Temple ’s backdoor , the newly - formed Team Flocke was assembling outside of the Temple .
As LOST serenaded us with Claire ’s ethereal rendition of her favorite nursery song , we saw her , Sayid and Kate tread through the carnage left by Smokey .
In a gorgeous slow - mo execution , they united with Flocke and his new Temple followers .
And off they went , to catch a falling star .
I need to reiterate : best scene in a long time , possibly ever .
That was about as cinematic as TV gets .
For the first five weeks of Season Six , I ’ve posited the theory that the inevitable convergence of our two storylines ( the one where Oceanic 815 crashed and the one where it did n’t ) would be a result of all our characters ’ connections in the alternate timeline .
Somehow , Jack +
Locke , Kate +
Claire , etc. would lead to a reconciliation of the two realities .
I am – at least temporarily – abandoning that theory in favor of a new one .
Last night , Flocke told Sayid that he could , “ Have anything you wanted … anything in the entire world , ” by following him .
When Sayid replied that the only thing he wanted ( Nadia ) was dead , and that he ’d never see her again , Flocke ’s retort was loaded with significance : “ What if you could ? ” That grabbed me .
Here ’s what I think .
Flocke has been talking for a few weeks about escape , deliverance , “ freeing ” himself from a “ prison . ”
And now , he ’s recruiting followers to escape with him .
Last night , he told Sayid that he could escape to a world where Nadia was still alive , despite the fact that she had died years earlier , in a turn of events that ultimately led Sayid to his return trip to the Island .
My theory is this : your “ escape ” is an “ escape ” to an alternate version of yourself .
More specifically , it ’s an escape to the “ best possible version ” of yourself .
If you ’re Jack , you can escape to a world where you are a caring , loving father who is free of any substance abuse and at peace with your dead father .
If you ’re Kate , you can escape to a reality where you are n’t always on the run , and where your own selfishness and guilt does n’t eat away at you constantly .
Do these realities sound familiar ?
They ’re the alternate realities we ’ve seen portrayed , so far , for Jack and Kate .
And those realities are , in a sense , examples of the concept of “ self - actualization , ” a psychological theory defined as “ the motive to realize all of one ’s potentialities . ”
Put another way , it ’s the best you that you can be .
That ’s what Flocke is promising his followers : that he can take their soul , their consciousness , and free it from the hellacious conditions and travails – be they physical , mental or emotional – of the Island .
That he can then implant your very essence into a world where your longest - held demons and deepest personality flaws are erased ( or at lest muted ) .
A world of self - actualization .
Flocke is promsing to deliver his believers to an alternate , self - actualized version of themselves .
Remember when Desmond 's consciousness was leaping between worlds ?
I think this might 've been what made him special - that he could , without any assistance , self - actualize and transport his soul / consciousness into an alternate version of himself .
[ Important but possibly distractingly - complicated thought … ]
My limited understanding of Multiverse Theory and super - tricky - quantum physics tells me that , in theory , every decision you ’ve ever made splits your reality .
Stay with me .
So , when I was deciding whether to go to TCU or SMU for college , I chose TCU .
But there is a version of me that went to SMU , and he ’s still out there in an alternate universe .
My conscious mind stayed with the version of me that went to TCU , then moved back to Nebraska , started working at an ad agency and became obsessed with LOST .
But the Multiverse Theory – which LOST appears to be dabbling in this year with its alternate reality storylines – holds that there is a version of me that went to SMU , got addicted to cocaine , battled depression over my inferior football team , took a job in finance and married a southern belle ; and that version of me still exists .
It ’s just , my soul and my conscious mind exist in the me that ’s writing this article right now .
So , theoretically , there are countless versions of me living out alternate existences .
It ’s just , I ’m only conscious of this one .
Does that makes sense ?
I thought it was pretty good for 1 a.m. on a Tuesday .
[ And now back to the theory … ]
So what Flocke is offering is to deliver you to the best version of yourself .
But here ’s the catch : nobody ’s perfect .
Even our “ best selves ” are inherently flawed .
For Jack , he still ca n’t hold on to a woman despite all his triumphs as a father , son and surgeon .
For Kate , she ’s still on the hook for murder , despite her sincere attempts at atonement in her alternate existence .
Which brings us back to Sayid .
What can Flocke deliver him to ?
His “ best self ” is still a murderer who ca n’t have the woman he loves .
Or even , Claire .
Her “ best self ” is still reluctant about her responsibility as a mother and unsure of how to handle her role with maturity and a level head .
As long as I ’ve got my tinfoil hat on , I ’ll offer an explanation on these two damned souls .
They ’re not going anywhere .
Flocke needs someone to replace him , and it ’s either going to be Claire , Sayid or Sawyer .
Because for Flocke to free himself from his Island prison , he – like Jacob – has to find some willing soul to take his place .
So he has cherry - picked the three most tortured souls on the Island ( angry mother Claire , tortured Sayid and grief - stricken Sawyer ) as his very own candidates , to take his place as the Island ’s perennial pessimist .
All this sounds like I ’m painting Flocke as the good guy , the guy who helps you live your best life .
But as Maggie put it , I think following Flocke might be the Island equivalent of making a deal with the devil .
If he is promising deliverance , what is it going to cost those who take him up on it ?
And perhaps that ’s the metaphor LOST is driving at .
Yes , you can live your best life .
But it may come as the result of tough choices you have to be prepared to make .
Time will tell .
But for now , I ’m telling Flocke that I ’ll follow him into the dark .
With fingers crossed behind my back .
Namaste .

A hot topic in recent Japanese politics has been : Should suffrage be extended to resident aliens ?
As an underlying principle of suffrage , Article 15 of the Constitution of Japan stipulates that “ [t ] he people have the inalienable right to choose their public officials and to dismiss them . ”
On the strength of this provision , many of politicians in this country have posited that suffrage is exclusively vested in the Japanese people -- those who have Japanese nationality -- and that the enfranchisement of aliens is prohibited constitutionally .
In 1995 , the Supreme Court of Japan stated , however , that a legislative measure to grant aliens — or foreigners — with permanent residency the right to vote in local elections is permitted constitutionally , because a local government ’s activity is closely related to a resident ’s daily living .
[ 1]
It is juristically called the “ permission doctrine . ”
This landmark triggered a political movement for the extension of suffrage .
In this decade , many bills aiming to give local suffrage to aliens have been submitted to the Diet .
When conservative Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) was the biggest force , those bills were all rejected .
However , through the 2009 Lower House election , the center of political power shifted to more liberal Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) .
At last , this electoral reform plan gets a grip on reality now .
Arguments For And Against
So why , in the first place , should local suffrage be extended to resident aliens ?
Proponents state several reasons .
In particular , tax payment is one convincing argument .
Since aliens are liable to taxation just like the Japanese , likewise aliens should have the right to check the ways the government uses taxpayers ’ money .
Another persuasive reason is , as the Supreme Court remarks , the close relationship between a local government ’s activity and a resident ’s daily life .
Unlike national politics dealing with diplomacy or security , local politics directly influences many aspects of community life .
For example , should surveillance cameras be installed all around the city ?
Should a mono railway be laid in the town ?
These all depend on local politics and administration .
As such , the participation in local elections may be one of the “ daily necessaries ” for resident aliens , along with property rights or social security .
On the other hand , there are many opponents of aliens ’ suffrage .
They argue that suffrage has not been associated with tax payment in Japan for a long time .
[ 2 ]
Taxes are paid in exchange for not political rights but public services such as road , park , police or fire fighting .
In short , citizenship cannot be bought with money .
Next , according to such “ anti- suffragists , ” the daily connection between local politics and residents is not an adequate ground for the extension of local suffrage .
If an alien takes root in Japanese society so deeply as to need local suffrage , all he or she has to do is acquire Japanese nationality .
In Japan , the conditions for naturalization are not too difficult .
[ 3 ]
Seen in that light , the extension of suffrage is an unnecessary measure .
Moreover , some xenophobes fear that local suffrage for alien will lead to the intervention of foreign power in Japan ’s national politics .
In this country , local politics is deeply committed to national politics .
Local governments play a major role in some national policies including welfare , education and even security .
More importantly , the support of local politicians is one of the most crucial factors in the outcome of national elections .
In that context , there is a future possibility that local politicians without Japanese nationality will have a certain influence on Japan ’s national politics .
Is Suffrage Inalienable To Aliens ?
This suffrage issue has been debated widely from various perspectives .
Above all , Article 15 of the Constitution still seems the most focal point .
This provision defines suffrage of the Japanese people as an “ inalienable right . ”
This “ inalienable ” is traditionally considered as “ exclusive ” in this country .
In sum , suffrage is seen as the exclusive right of the Japanese people .
From such a standpoint , the enfranchisement of aliens can be interpreted to violate this Article 15 , even if this measure is limited to a local level .
Additionally , to reinforce the argument , these anti-suffragists often bring up one political idea : popular sovereignty .
The Preamble to the Constitution stipulates that “ sovereign power resides with the people . ” [ 4 ]
Japan must be governed by the Japanese people themselves only .
Therefore , according to the anti-suffragists , resident aliens -- those who are not indigenous Japanese - - are not qualified to participate in Japan ’s governance .
Supposing that the anti-suffragists are right , how then should we consider the “ permission doctrine ” once adopted by the Supreme Court ?
On this point , anti-suffragists focus on the fact that this doctrine is not the ratio decidendi ( rationale for the decision ) but merely the obiter dictum ( incidental remark ) included in the body of the court opinion .
This means that the doctrine is not legally binding .
The anti-suffragists argue that such a thing has little authority and hardly deserves mention .
What Right ?
To be sure , an obiter dictum does not have the force of law , but at least it sometimes has de facto binding effect .
There are many previous cases that a mere incidental remark by a court had some influence on subsequent trials or government activities .
Originally , Japan ’s legal system is not common law but civil law .
Generally , under the civil law system , a judicial opinion scarcely has the force of law , whether ratio decidendi or obiter dictum .
It is only de facto binding effect to some extent .
According to the anti-suffragists , the permission doctrine is meaningless because it appeared merely in an incidental remark by the court .
However , such an argument is based on a misunderstanding about Japan ’s legal system .
That said , the most important thing is the “ inalienable right ” stipulated in Article 15 of the Constitution should be considered .
If you are a native English speaker , you ought to know that the word “ inalienable ” means “ untransferable ” or “ unforfeitable . ”
Moreover , if you are American , you ought to know that the phrase “ unalienable Rights ” appears in the U.S. Declaration of Independence .
If you are French , you ought to know that the phrase “ les droits naturels , inaliénables et sacrés ” appears in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen .
The point is that the meaning of “ inalienable right ” must be guessed from the context of natural right theory , which was once elaborated by some Western philosophers or politicians in the 17 - 18th centuries .
This theory challenged the divine right of kings , and argued that citizens have some basic rights which cannot be transferred to a sovereign .
In some ways , the above two historical declarations came under the influence of this political theory .
It is safe to bet that the Allied Powers ’ senior officials playing a major role in drafting the postwar Constitution of Japan also drew their inspiration from that classical theory .
Considering that one of the most serious matters at that time was the governing power of the Emperor , the phrase “ inalienable right ” provided in the Constitution of Japan ought to mean the Japanese people ’s right untransferable to the state or sovereign . [ 5 ]
According to the anti-suffragists , suffrage is not sharable with resident aliens because this political right is the exclusive right of the Japanese people .
However , such an argument shows no regard for the historical context of the word “ inalienable . ”
Issues At Large
Can tax payment be a path to citizenship ?
Should nationality and suffrage be discussed separately ?
Are national politics and local politics two different things ?
These are issues with highly political implication .
At this time , we must avoid rough - and - ready conclusion .
On the other , it suffices to say here that the Constitution of Japan can be interpreted to leave the door open for further extension of suffrage .
There is also a more fundamental point : the exclusive nature of Japanese society .
To meet international expectations , Japan ’s government has tried to improve aliens ’ human rights situation for over the past two decades .
However , Japanese society is still not much receptive to resident aliens on the whole .
For some Japanese , aliens are always gaijin - - literally , “ outsiders . ”
Many resident aliens are given discriminatory treatment in such occasions as job hunting , house hunting or community involvement .
For resident aliens in this country , such a social situation is definitely a more pressing issue than political rights .
In that sense , the suffrage issue is perhaps placing the cart before the horse .

[ 1 ] See Sup.
Ct.. 28 Feb 1995 . Keishu 49 [ 2]:639 .
This case was brought before the court questioning the constitutionality of the Public Office Election Act ( Koshoku Senkyo Hou , Act No. 100 of 1950 as amended by Act No. 86 of 2007 ) and the Local Autonomy Act ( Chiho Jichi Hou , Act No. 67 of 1947 as amended by Act No. 96 of 2009 ) , which qualify only the Japanese people as eligible voter .
[ 2 ] Since the revised Lower House Election Act 1925 ( Shugiin Giin Senkyo Hou , Act No. 47 of 1925 ) was enacted , universal suffrage has been continually one of the basic principles in Japan ’s electoral system .
[ 3 ]
As to the statutory conditions for naturalization , see Article 5 - 8 of the Nationality Act ( Kokuseki Hou , Act No. 147 of 1950 , as amended by Act No. 88 of 2008 ) .
[ 4 ]
There is a similar phrase “ the people with whom resides sovereign power ” in Article 1 of the Constitution .
[ 5 ]
The draft Constitution of Japan submitted by these officers in 10 Feb 1946 stipulated that “ [t ] he people are the ultimate arbiters of their government and of the Imperial Throne .
They have the inalienable right to choose their public officials and to dismiss them . ”
Since fourteen states have legalized the use of cannabis for sick and disabled people we here at NORML have reported on numerous stories of medical users harassed , arrested , and jailed by police .
We have also reported on healthy adults in all fifty states whose lives are turned upside down by an arrest , sometimes losing student loans , jobs , children , pets , dignity , property , and freedom over a single joint , seed , or even a cannabis stem .
When we and others bring up these insane injustices to the police who are making these arrests , we often hear the platitude that “ cops do n’t make the laws , we just enforce the laws . ”
So why do we consistently see representatives of law enforcement opposing medical marijuana , marijuana decriminalization , and marijuana legalization efforts in state legislatures ?
In California , the California Narcotics Officers Association schools police officers to believe the public “ have been misled … into believing there is merit to their argument that smoking marijuana is a safe and effective medicine . ”
This is in direct contradiction of the stated position of the American Medical Association otherwise that “ short term controlled trials indicate that smoked cannabis reduces neuropathic pain , improves appetite and caloric intake especially in patients with reduced muscle mass , and may relieve spasticity and pain in patients with multiple sclerosis . ”
In New Jersey , the medical marijuana law was severely curtailed when the Assembly heard the unfounded assertion by a representative of New Jersey ’s Fraternal Order of Police that “ I ’ve heard in California there ’s a lot peripheral crime around these centers [ medical marijuana dispensaries ] , I get that from the different law enforcement agencies around the country who I have regular contact with . ”
This is in direct contradiction of the findings of the Chief of the LAPD who stated : “ Banks are more likely to get robbed than medical marijuana dispensaries . ”
The Chief was responding to the notion that there is greater crime around dispensaries and said “ I have tried to verify that because that , of course , is the mantra .
It does n’t really bear out . ”
And in Oklahoma , the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics & Dangerous Drugs Control publishes a “ fact sheet ” on marijuana that states : “ Today ’s new cultivation methods are producing a drug with up to 30 percent THC , or 3,000 percent higher than the old 1960 ’s - 1980 ’s available marijuana . ”
This is in direct contradiction to the DEA ’s own figures on marijuana potency which find that today ’s average cannabis seizure may have doubled in THC potency ( a 100 % increase , not a 3,000 % increase . )
Oklahoma ’s bureau does n’t address why 30 % THC marijuana is to be feared , but 100 % THC Marinol pills are FDA - approved .
The attitudes of most in law enforcement are also contrary to the attitudes of the public .
A recent ABC News / Washington
Post poll found that support for medical marijuana is now at 81 % nationwide , with a majority overall ( 62 % nationwide ) who support a system at least as open as Oregon ’s OMMA where not - necessarily terminal patients can only qualify if they suffer a specific condition from a list and a majority of those who support medical marijuana ( 56 % of the 81 % who support it ) supporting an open system like California ’s Prop - 215 where “ doctors should be able to prescribe medical marijuana to anyone they think it can help ” .
But according to a June 2009 survey in POLICE Magazine , even though a majority ( 54.6 % ) of police say they support medical marijuana , almost all of those who support it ( 88 % ) say it must be only under stricter regulation than we have currently in the medical marijuana states .
When asked about marijuana legalization overall , even for healthy adults , the American Public are also contrary to the opinions of law enforcement .
The latest Angus Reid poll is the first to show majority American support for legalization ( 53 % ) , while the latest Gallup poll puts support at 44 % , its best mark in forty years of polling .
But according to the same POLICE survey , marijuana legalization has less than half the support among cops than among the public they protect and serve .
Only 23 % of police supported re-legalization of cannabis .
When asked why , specifically , those police who opposed re-legalization felt that way , eight in ten said that marijuana is a “ gateway drug ” , there was the danger of “ people driving high ” , and seven in ten cited the “ harm to user and society ” .
Longtime NORML readers know that the gateway drug theory has been debunked by the Institutes of Medicine in 1999 and every reputable study over the past ten years .
While everybody , especially NORML , discourages driving under the influence of cannabis , we understand that there are people behaving irresponsibly now and re-legalization would not encourage less responsibility , but more .
Under re-legalization , money raised from taxes could sponsor anti-stoned - driving campaigns like the ones that have successfully reduced drunk driving .
As for the “ harm to user and society ” , POLICE readers still felt by a margin of 3 - 2 that alcohol was “ more of a threat to the community ” than marijuana .
( The survey does not record the support among police for reinstating alcohol prohibition to prevent alcohol ’s “ harm to user and society ” , however . )
This 39 % of police who believe marijuana is safer than alcohol comes closest to matching public opinion , which shows now a slim majority ( 51 % ) believe marijuana is safer than alcohol .
While the general public is barely approaching majority support for outright marijuana legalization , the public has long held the belief that any punishment for adult marijuana possession should be a fine only .
Three out of four Americans ( 76 % ) believe that if marijuana users are to be punished , they should only be fined and not arrested and sent to jail .
Yet the POLICE Magazine survey finds that two out of three cops ( 65 % ) think it is “ worth law enforcement ’s time to bust marijuana users ” .
Another area where police opinions differ from the public is on the issue of the murderous Mexican drug gangs that have assassinated , kidnapped , murdered , tortured , and beheaded over 15,000 Mexicans in just two years .
The Arizona Attorney General has cited that “ marijuana sales make up 75 percent of the money that Mexican cartels use for other operations , including smuggling other drugs and fighting the Mexican army and police . ”
But in the POLICE Magazine survey , two - thirds of cops ( 68 % ) believe marijuana legalization would have no “ favorable impact on problems associated with gangs and cartels . ”
So do the police know something about the dangers of cannabis use that the American Medical Association , the American people , and the Arizona Attorney General do not ?
A cynic might think that police are merely acting in their own best interest , protecting their source of easy statistic - padding arrests and asset forfeiture bounty , but I ’m more inclined to believe many of these front - line soldiers in the War on Marijuana are acting in good faith based on terrible misinformation about cannabis .

The Super Bowl is almost upon us , and you can practically feel the rustle of energy in the air .
For many nerds , though , this Sunday 's matchup between the New Orleans Saints and Indianapolis Colts means absolutely nothing .
While every other member of the family is grunting and oh-ing at the action from Miami , they 'll probably be thumbing through their comics and thanking genetics from sparing them from idiocy .
Is it because jocks beat them up ?
They could never play football because of a brittle septum and concave chest ?
No .
They just do n't like false advertising .
Super Bowl ?
There 's nothing super about it .
Nobody has heat vision or superspeed , nobody teleports or duplicates himself or phases through another player .
And that , sir , is not a Super Bowl .
It 's a Performance - Enhanced Bowl at best .
We at ComicsAlliance could n't take it anymore .
The misleading name .
The complete and utter lack of cross-dimensional entities .
The sheer hubris of those bastards , thinking they 're super !
We 'll show you super , NFL .
Compiled below are our choices and scouting reports for the Big Two dream teams , who we will pitch in battle in an epic computer - simulated clash to decide who is truly super !
It 's Marvel vs DC , kiddies .
Seven - on - seven on a mile - long field , with no wimpy punting or flying allowed .
At stake : market share .
If you thought the Laff - a - Lympics were wild , strap in , Gladice , because we 're on a crazy train to Awesomeville .
Quarterback
DC : Booster Gold
That 's right , haterz .
Still high off of saving the multiverse in " 52 , " former Gotham University star Michael Jon Carter – aka Booster Gold – gets a chance to redeem himself .
BG has good footwork , a rocket arm , and is just cocky enough to get away with things he should n't .
Can be flighty at times , and does n't like to get hit , but provides any fake meta - team with the chance to win .
And he promises , promises not to throw the game .
Marvel : Captain America
Um , natch .
Who else besides Steve Rogers could lead the All - Marvel squad ?
With his keen vision and honed instincts , Cap is the Joe Montana of the UEFL ( Useless Excursions Football League ) , setting the gold standard for every other comic character inexplicably turned quarterback .
As Wesley Snipes once almost said , " Always bet on Cap . "
Offensive Line
DC : Hal Jordan
How'd that green wall taste , blitzers ?
How bout those yard - long needles that popped up outta nowhere ?
Or the ball bearing cloud ?
I mean , did you really think you were gonna touch my Quarterback ?
Yeah .
That 's what Hal Jordan thought .
Marvel : The Thing
At 800 - plus pounds of solid rock , Ben Grimm is tougher than nails and as loyal as the day is long ( loyal to the 24th power - ed . ) .
Unfortunately , his in - game banter is just above mentally challenged .
He yells " It 's clobberin ' time ! " on every snap .
At one point he actually said " Do n't even try blitzing , numbskulls , or something something my Aunt Petunia . "
Running Back
DC : Red Tornado
With his Tasmanian Devil - like abilities , Red Tornado has touchdown potential every time he gets the ball .
Tacklers do n't know whether to go low or high , and typically get bounced off with an infuriating sound effect .
And with the proper programming , our little android will have only one thing on his mind : " GIVE ME THE ROCK . "
Marvel : Black Panther
Agile , athletic , quick and smart , Prince T'Challa of Wakanda can juke tacklers out of their boots , bowl them over , or stymie them with a wicked hard math problem .
Bone - crushing defenders are no problem for a man with the reflexes of a cat .
Rumors of Vibranium - spiked shoes and pacts with panther deities unconfirmed .
Receivers
DC : Wonder Woman , Jay Garrick , Beast Boy , Steel
At over six feet tall and quick as hell , Wonder Woman has all the skills to be a dominant wideout .
Willing to take a big hit to make a big catch .
Drafting Wally West or Barry Allen would be totally unfair , and Coach Superman do n't play it like that .
To even things out , we have the Golden Age Flash Jay Garrick .
Still super - fast and athletic at 70 - something years .
When he can remember the routes , that is .
At Tight End , John Henry Irons provides a solid short receiver and fierce run-blocker .
Beast Boy provides lots of matchup difficulties in the slot – have you ever tried covering a spider monkey ?
Marvel : Marvel Boy , Nightcrawler , Spider - Man , Thor
Opting for hands and agility rather than size and speed , Marvel 's receivers provide big plays after the catch and always make the difficult grab .
With Marvel Boy 's muscular routes across the middle and Nightcrawler 's ability to get open deep , Spider - Man fits perfectly in the slot , taking short passes deep every time he gets his sticky little hands on the ball .
At TE , Thor is a strong blocker and decent receiver , but tends to cause problems in the locker room by demanding sacrifices of livestock and wenches .
There 's always one bad apple .
Linebackers
DC : Lobo , Orion , Deathstroke
Or , as they prefer to be called , " Wham , " " Bam , " and " Thank you , ma'am . "
Orion is an absolute monster on the blitz , and despite his depth - perception impediment , Deathstroke is a chillingly astute option in the middle .
As the enforcer , Lobo obliterates anyone he comes into contact with .
Then violates their corpse .
Ahhh , Lobo ...
Marvel : Luke Cage , Wolverine , The Punisher
196 confirmed kills .
Secondary
DC : Green Arrow , Blue Beetle , Batman , Robin
Green Arrows cover method is different – standing in one place and using trick arrows to break up the play – but effective .
With the scarab at his command , Jaime Reyes is the definition of a shutdown corner , always adapting to the wide receiver 's moves .
With Robin ( Tim Drake ) as a nimble free safety , and defensive captain Batman ( Bruce Wayne ) as a terrifying presence over the middle , the All - DC defense is a continuity to be reckoned with .
Marvel : Daredevil , Longshot , Reed Richards , Iron Fist
The corner tandem of Daredevil and Longshot is easily the most fearsome in all of Fairytale Land .
With his echo- location and deceptive speed , DD absolutely blankets his assignments with Catholic guilt .
Longshot is somehow in on every play .
Leads the league in interceptions ( 997 ) and fumbles ( 997 ) .
At strong safety , Iron Fist is quick and merciless , disrupting plays and laying the wood with his mysterious Tackle of the House of Broken Cranes .
At free safety , " Mister Fantastic " is not only the smartest man on the field ; he 's capable of making plays all over it .
Kiiind of a dick .

Hutaree 's logo includes the initials CCR - for " Colonial Christian Republic "
Nine alleged members of a radical US Christian militia group have been charged with conspiring to kill police officers and wage war against the US .
The suspects were detained in a series of FBI raids across the Mid-West , while one remains at large .
Prosecutors say the eight men and one woman belonged to the Hutaree group .
It is alleged they planned to kill a police officer in Michigan and then stage a second attack on the funeral , using landmines and roadside bombs .
Preparing for the Antichrist
The FBI raided properties in Michigan , Ohio and Indiana over the weekend in the belief that the group was planning a reconnaissance exercise .
" The indictment ... outlines an insidious plan by anti-government extremists to murder a law enforcement officer in order to lure police from across the nation to the funeral where they would be attacked with explosive devices , " said Attorney General Eric Holder .
" Thankfully , this alleged plot has been thwarted and a severe blow has been dealt to a dangerous organisation that today stands accused of conspiring to levy war against the United States . "
A website in the name of the group shows video footage of military - style training exercises and describes Hutaree as " Christian warriors " .
It is edited to a backing track of rock music .
A statement on the website says the group are preparing to defend themselves upon the arrival of the Antichrist .
The website says Hutaree is " preparing for the end time battles to keep the testimony of Jesus Christ alive " .
In the indictment , Hutaree is described as an " anti- government extremist organisation " advocating violence against the police .
The Palestine Liberation Organization and the Irish Republican Army , two of history 's most notorious terrorist groups , have never appeared on the State Department 's List of Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations .
By the time the list was first compiled in 1997 , both groups were deemed to be moving away from violence and toward a peaceful resolution of their grievances .
Ralph Fertig , president of the Humanitarian Law Project , wants to encourage a similar change within the Kurdistan Workers '
Party , a violent separatist group in Turkey also known as the PKK ( its Kurdish initials ) .
But he worries that doing so will expose him to prosecution for providing " material support " to a terrorist organization , a crime Congress has defined so broadly that it includes a great deal of speech protected by the First Amendment .
When it hears Fertig 's case next week , the Supreme Court will have a chance to correct that error .
Fertig , a civil rights lawyer and former administrative law judge , seeks , as the district court described it , to " provide training in the use of humanitarian and international law for the peaceful resolution of disputes , engage in political advocacy on behalf of the Kurds living in Turkey , and teach the PKK how to petition for relief before representative bodies like the United Nations . "
Fertig says he also wants to " advocate on behalf of the rights of the Kurdish people and the PKK before the United Nations and the United States Congress . "
Another plaintiff in the case , an American physician named Nagalingam Jeyalingam , wants to do similar work with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , a violent separatist group in Sri Lanka that , like the PKK , appears on the State Department 's list of terrorist organizations .
In the words of the district court , Jeyalingam seeks to " provide training in the presentation of claims to mediators and international bodies for tsunami- related aid , offer legal expertise in negotiating peace agreements between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government , and engage in political advocacy on behalf of Tamils living in Sri Lanka . "
Whether you think Fertig and Jeyalingam are humanitarian heroes , naïve dreamers , or inadvertent flacks for terrorists , the projects they have in mind clearly amount to " pure speech promoting lawful , nonviolent activities , " as their attorneys say .
Yet the federal law they are challenging seems to make such speech a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison .
Under the law , it is a crime to provide an organization on the State Department 's list with " training , " defined as " instruction or teaching designed to impart a specific skill , as opposed to general knowledge " ; " expert advice or assistance , " defined as " advice or assistance derived from scientific , technical or other specialized knowledge " ; " personnel , " which means any person , including oneself , who works under the organization 's " direction or control " ; or " service , " which is not defined at all .
These terms ( especially that last one ) could easily be construed to cover the activities proposed by Fertig and Jeyalingam , even though they would be trying to discourage terrorism and promote peaceful alternatives .
During oral arguments before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit , which ruled that several aspects of the " material support " ban are unconstitutional , the government 's lawyer said you could go to prison for filing a friend - of - the - court brief on behalf of a listed group , for pressing its case at the U.N. , or even for asking Congress to take the group off the list .
" Congress wants these organizations to be radioactive , " he explained .
By that logic , The New York Times and The Washington Post committed felonies when they published op - ed pieces by Hamas spokesman Ahmed Yousef , an act " for the benefit of " a terrorist group and therefore , according to the government , a prohibited " service . "
A speech defending the rights of Kurds or Tamils could be treated the same way .
By definitively rejecting such unconstitutional applications of the law , the Supreme Court can stop the war on terrorism from becoming a war on freedom of speech .

The FA are bringing Football into disrepute
The FA have rejected Arsenal 's appeal against the red card handed to Thomas Vermaelen for his alleged offence of " preventing an obvious goalscoring opportunity " .
This , despite the equally obvious evidence that West Ham's Franco tripped over his own legs , and the ball bounced high beyond both players .
Having watched the incident a number of times again in slow - motion , I was convinced the FA would see sense and rescind the red card .
Others were equally convinced that regardless of the evidence the FA would reject the appeal — and so they did .
This incident is not unique ; merely the latest in a line of high profile cases where the FA have issued a ruling apparently contrary to common sense .
Referees
One cannot completely blame the referees for mistakes made during games — they are making snap judgements on incidents sometimes barely seen at very high speed .
Without technology to help them , as available in other sports , they will always make mistakes .
Those mistakes must either be accepted as part of the game , or worked on in order to eradicate them .
The stance the FA seem to be taking is to accept them as part of the game .
That stance , I would argue , is bringing football into disrepute .
I am in no way arguing for the persecution of referees , as are the less charitable element .
While some of their mistakes may seem ridiculous , even for someone in charge on the pitch , it can often be argued that some judgement had to be made .
The FA take little if any steps to apply the same high standards to it 's referees , as it does to clubs , players and managers .
A manager is not allowed to express displeasure volubly with a decision that may have cost his club dearly .
Whilst a referee , who made such a decision , walks away with no regret expressed .
Technology
With the advent of instantly reactive technology , such as that used in Tennis , it could easily be argued that there is no excuse not to use it to cut down mistakes .
Yet the FA continually and consistently reject calls to introduce it , even in unobtrusive ways such as on the goal line .
Rugby uses video replays to rule on tries where the referee is n't able to see it on the pitch — why not use the same technology for penalties in football ?
This article is not focused on the refusal to even consider the use of technology — rather the cumulative impact of that apparent stubborn refusal to follow the lead that other sports have taken to eradicate mistakes .
Chief Executive
After 10 months in role , the chief executive of the FA has resigned , making the turnover six chief executives in about 10 years .
This is not a natural progression for a growing and changing organisation .
Speculation is rife , and growing with more evidence appearing daily , that there is a problem deep within the corridors of Soho Square .
The outgoing Chief Exec , Ian Watmore , is apparently citing as reason , an organisation that seeks to prevent change and improvement .
Lord Triesman , the Independent Chairman , has expressed regret , unlike when Brian Barwick was asked to leave in 2008 .
The reason given then was disagreement between Barwick and Triesman on the future direction of the organisation and the role of the chief executive .
Whilst Barwick oversaw a new Wembley , a new National Football Centre , and a television deal worth £ 425 M , his legacy is perhaps not as grand as he would have liked .
The reputation of the FA also diminished over the last 10 years , and especially during his time in charge due to a number of mistakes and mismanagement :
The mishandled construction of the new Wembley , especially the long delays
The highly public fiasco over the appointment of the last four England coaches
An apparently increasingly parochial view of the game that sees technology sidelined
Increasingly bizarre and inconsistent decision making with regard to after - game punishment
Refusal to Change
The FA appears to be an organisation that simply refuses to change .
Perhaps they consider the small measures that have been allowed to take place , enough progress .
Certainly their publicity heralds a forward thinking body .
Many believe however , that the FA is simply another manifestation of an " Old Boys Network " .
In other words , an organisation that seeks to protect and promote the status quo and image of the existing hierarchy .
Other examples are given of otherwise inexplicable decisions , that point to a reactionary element within the FA .
Incidents where certain players , with a guaranteed place in the England set - up , being excused the same standard of justice meted out elsewhere .
One such example recently where Steven Gerrard committed a forearm smash against the back of an opponents head demonstrates this phenomenon .
Captured on cameras very clearly , the incident went unpunished during the game , yet the FA refuse to pursue any action against someone who is a guaranteed England starter and ex-captain .
Meanwhile accusations of racism were made when Rio Ferdinand committed a similar foul , captured on video , and received retrospective punishment .
It must be pointed out that those accusations were not made officially and have not been tested in a court of law .
There is enough other evidence however to suggest that the FA are an organisation determined to protect themselves , while protecting their own agenda .
An agenda it seems based on clinging to a ' traditional ' view of the game — one that cannot cope with advances in other areas .
Advances
Technology continues to gain ground in other sports arenas , even in a quick flowing game such as Rugby .
Advances in streaming video worldwide over the internet meanwhile , cut through attempted restrictions to protect traditional media broadcast contracts .
Video itself is now considered simple technology , yet advances in freezing action and recreating 3D images of scenes are making ground , even in tennis where the smaller ball moves much faster than football .
Advances in technology are also being matched by advances in decision making in other sports .
Eye gouging in rugby for example is captured on video and punished retrospectively regardless of the decision on the field of play , yet a recent incident between Hull and Arsenal of poking in the eye was barely commented on .
Conclusion
There is an element within the FA that seeks to protect and preserve what they see as their traditional game .
In doing so they are bringing the whole sport into disrepute not only amongst it 's own fans , but amongst the world at large .
The FA may choose to disregard the ridicule and damages to their image that they are responsible for bringing about , but it will have an inevitable impact .
The only logical conclusion to their behaviour is that they will bring down the game in England — creating a sport so anachronistic and out of touch , that fans will begin to turn to other sports in their droves .
The phrase " adapt or die " was never so apt .
A federal appeals court rebuked a Pennsylvania district attorney who threatened to file felony child pornography charges against teens who were photographed semi-nude unless they attended an " education program . "
In a unanimous decision issued Wednesday by the appeals court in Philadelphia , a three - judge panel said the threat amounted to a " Hobson 's Choice " that would retaliate against one of the girls and her family for exercising their constitutional right to free speech .
A rare dose of government - issued sanity in the prosecutorial crusade against teenage " sexting " , the ruling upheld a lower - court order issued last year in the case .
The case stems from " inappropriate images of minors " found by officials at Pennsylvania 's Tunkhannock School District , that included , among other things , a girl posing in her bathing suit .
In late 2008 , Wyoming County District Attorney George Skumanick told an assembly of about 20 students and their parents he would bring felony child pornography charges against them unless they completed a six - to nine - month program .
For female offenders , that meant attending classes designed to help the participants " gain an understanding of what it means to be a girl in today 's society , " and require them to write a report on what the students did and " why it was wrong " .
When the parent of the girl who posed in her bathing suit publicly complained , Skumanick responded that she was posing " provocatively " and concluded by saying : " These are the rules .
If you do n't like them , too bad . "
( Skumanick is no longer District Attorney . )
The panel from the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit said the education program requirement amounted to compelled speech , in violation of the Constitution 's First Amendment .
As such , Skumanick 's threat to prosecute was retaliation .
The judges went on to uphold the lower - court 's order barring the filing of child pornography charges against one of the girls caught up in the dragnet , who was identified as only as Nancy Doe .
" In sum , absent an injunction , the Does would have to choose either to assert their constitutional rights and face prosecution of Nancy Doe based not on probable cause but as punishment for exercising their constitutional rights , or forgo those rights and avoid prosecution , " they wrote .
" On the facts before us , this Hobson 's Choice is unconstitutional . "
The offending image of Nancy Doe showed the teen in a " white , opaque towel , just below her breasts , appearing as if she just had emerged from the shower , " according to the decision .
While the ruling is a breath of fresh air , its applicability to other sexting cases sweeping the country is questionable .
Had Skumanick not offered the option of the education program compelling the writing of papers , there 's no reason to believe the judges would have reached the same conclusion .
Still , the decision appears to be the first time an appeals court has weighed in on the prosecution of teen " sexting , " a practice that 's growing increasingly common in an age where kids have the unprecedented ability to take pictures of themselves and immediately zap them to world + dog .
In a world populated by Skumanick and other overzealous prosecutors , a little sanity is a good thing . ®
David Moyes has revealed it is unlikely that Landon Donovan will remain at Everton when his loan expires .
But Toffees boss admits player wants to stay
Improvement
Everton manager David Moyes has revealed it is unlikely that Landon Donovan will remain at the club when his current loan deal expires .
The United States international has enjoyed a fruitful spell since moving to the Toffees from Los Angeles Galaxy in January , scoring once in seven Premier League appearances for the club .
With the 27 - year - old set to return to America when the Major League Soccer season starts at the end of March , Moyes says that he is expected to leave Goodison Park , despite the player having a desire to stay .
Speaking after his side 's impressive 3 - 1 win against Manchester United , Moyes said : " I think Landon would like to stay but at the moment it probably looks as if not .
" I would n't want to have any disrespect to his club or the contract he has over there . "
Everton have only suffered one defeat in their last 12 Premier League games and they are moving within sight of the European places .
Moyes admits that he is beginning to think about a better - than - expected finish after a poor start to the campaign , and insists his team can still improve .
" We can start looking upwards a bit more than downwards , " he added .
" This was always going to be a tricky month and we have started it pretty well .
" It was a great result and you do n't beat the big teams that often so we are delighted .
" I have said for a while on our day we can be a match for the teams above .
" We have not got everyone fit but I think it shows the spirit we have got .
" I think we can play better and I think we will .
" At the start of the season we struggled to win the games when we had players missing , but there were reasons for that .
" I honestly think when we have got the squad together we can be a match for most teams . "
Picture Of The Day : Aaaaaaaaaaa-Choooooooo
There might not be anything more nerve racking than an oncoming sneeze in front of a group of people .
“ Will snot come out of all my orifices ? ” is generally the major concern , so most people ( at least I do ) try to hold it back .
This guy , who additionally is in front of pervasive camera men during a soccer match , has another issue : his front teeth .
As you can see , not only does he throw up saliva with this monster gesundheit , but he loses his dentures !
He smiles it off as no big deal , but you ca n’t see that — the majority of his smile is hidden in his hand .

Krupskaya spent a good deal of her later years attempting to disseminate through the means available to her the legacy of Lenin .
Thus she wrote and published her famous Reminiscences of Lenin .
By Graham Milner
March 7 , 2010 -- Born into a family of radical Russian gentry in 1869 , Nedezhda ( which from Russian translates as " Hope " ) Konstantinovna Krupskaya became , with her partner V.I. Lenin , a founder and central leader of the organisation of revolutionaries that led the Russian working class to power in October 1917 -- the Bolshevik Party ( majority faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party ) .
Following the 1917 October Revolution , Krupskaya played an important role in developing public education and cultural life in the Soviet state .
A prolific writer and speaker , her collected works in the field of education alone fill a dozen large volumes .
After Lenin 's death in 1924 , Krupskaya was one of the first prominent communists in the Soviet Union to raise her voice against the usurpation of power by the conservative , bureaucratic forces around Joseph Stalin .
Although she withdrew her support from the United Opposition to Stalin ( led by Leon Trotsky , Gregory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev ) in 1926 , Krupskaya never reconciled herself to the gangster regime established by the Stalinists .
Soon after her death in 1939 , Stalin ordered Krupskaya 's name never again to be mentioned in the public media , and indeed it rarely was until after Stalin died in 1953 .
Radical beliefs
Krupskaya came early to radical beliefs .
She recalled in a brief personal memoir written in later life how the experiences of her parents in resisting the autocratic regime of the tsars had brought her to an appreciation of different aspects of national and social oppression .
At one time her father worked as a factory inspector , until he was sacked for giving too accurate an account of abuses by the factory management .
Krupskaya recalls that she used to play with the factory workers ' children , and that they always tried hard to ambush the factory manager and hit him with snowballs .
She had a lifelong love of the great populist poet Nekrasov , and her first political article , entitled " The Woman Worker " , began with a quote from one of his poems :
Thy lot is hard , a woman 's lot .
A harder lot can scarce be found .
Like Lenin , Krupskaya was a brilliant student , and won a gold medal at secondary school .
Kept out of higher education by reactionary laws that excluded women , after graduating from secondary school she became a teacher .
This was to be the beginning of a lifelong interest in the theory and practice of education .
She was strongly influenced by Tolstoy 's libertarian ideas in the field .
In 1889 , Krupskaya first came into contact with Marxist ideas , through a St. Petersburg radical discussion circle , one of several meeting in the city at that time .
She read the first volume of Karl Marx 's Capital , and was captivated by its imaginative and profound analysis of modern society .
She devoured all the Marxist literature she could get her hands on , reading among other books Friedrich Engels ' Anti-Duhring and The Origin of the Family , Private Property and the State .
Krupskaya spent five years in all teaching at an adult education institution for industrial workers in St. Petersburg .
This school operated before any organised socialist movement in Russia had come into being .
The Marxist teachers at the school organised themselves into an underground circle in order to recruit and educate workers , and to distribute pamphlets and leaflets in factories around St. Petersburg , a major centre of Russia 's burgeoning industrial development .
Krupskaya became a member of this circle , and it was at one of its meetings , in 1894 , that she met Lenin for the first time .
In 1895 , the St. Petersburg Marxists organised themselves into a League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class and extended their propaganda work among the proletariat of the city .
Police repression escalated and both Lenin and Krupskaya were arrested that year .
Lenin was detained in jail and eventually sent into exile in Siberia .
Krupskaya was released , only to be arrested a year later and sent in her turn to Siberia , to join Lenin , whom she had decided to marry .
Exile
Life in Siberian exile for Krupskaya and Lenin was not all hard .
As Krupskaya recalled later , ``we were young then , [ and ] were deeply in love with one another ' ' .
They shared a passion for the classics of Russian literature -- Lermontov , Chernyshevsky , Turgenev , as well as their mutual devotion to the cause of socialism .
While in Siberia they both worked on Lenin 's major treatise , The Development of Capitalism in Russia , and jointly translated Sidney and Beatrice Webbs ' History of Trade Unionism .
At the end of their terms of exile , in 1900 and 1901 respectively , Lenin and Krupskaya agreed to go to Western Europe to join the Russian Marxist movement in exile abroad .
Once in Western Europe they both became deeply involved in the production and distribution of the newspaper Iskra -- " The Spark " -- the major project then being undertaken by Russian Marxists .
Krupskaya became the secretary of the Iskra group , handling the correspondence that formed the tenuous but vital link between the revolutionary underground in Russia and the team of emigres producing the newspaper .
She received and answered something like 300 letters a month , many containing articles or messages that had to be decoded .
The tsarist secret police paid Krupskaya a back - handed compliment when its Paris office filed a memo from the St. Petersburg police chief that identified her as one who " occupies a central position in the organisation of Iskra abroad [ and conducts ] a lively conspiratorial correspondence with all the active committees of the RSDLP [ Russian Social Democratic Labour Party ] in Russia " .
The tedious , painstaking work done by Krupskaya as Iskra 's secretary contributed enormously towards the development of those links across the Russian underground that formed the organisational basis for a united Russian socialist movement -- a party in fact .
The second congress of the RSDLP met in 1903 .
Krupskaya wrote a full organisational report to be delivered by Julius Martov , but this was never presented due to the sharp disagreements over political and organisational questions that rent the congress and split the party .
Following the congress the opportunist " Menshevik " tendency , defeated on the congress floor , managed to seize control of the editorial board of Iskra .
Lenin resigned in protest , and the Mensheviks took steps to remove Krupskaya , who supported Lenin and the Bolshevik tendency , from her position as secretary .
Split
This split in the Russian socialist movement was to have wide - reaching ramifications .
It effectively divided the movement into two opposed camps : a revolutionary wing on the one hand -- the Bolsheviks -- and a compromisist , opportunist wing on the other -- the Mensheviks .
From the time of the second congress onwards there were effectively two parties differing more or less fundamentally over questions of program and tactics .
In 1917 , these divisions came to a head when the development of the revolution posed the question of working - class power .
Krupskaya continued to play her central organisational role in the separate Bolshevik apparatus established after the split in 1903 .
She and Lenin returned to Russia during the revolution of 1905 - 06 , although at that time no tendency in the labour movement was sufficiently strong to decisively affect the outcome of what was regarded later by revolutionaries as a great " dress rehearsal " for the events of 1917 .
The period of reaction that followed the 1905 - 06 events was a bleak age for Russian revolutionaries .
Krupskaya and Lenin once again went into Western European exile , and fought hard to preserve the precious apparatus of the Bolshevik organisation from attempts to " liquidate " it , or move it from the course of revolutionary Marxism .
Krupskaya continued at the centre of organisational work .
The radical movement began to pick up again in Russia in the years before the onset of World War I .
In early 1914 a plan for a legal socialist newspaper for women , called The Working Woman , was drawn up by leading women members of the Bolshevik Party , including Krupskaya , Inessa Armand and Lilina Zinoviev .
The paper ran through only two issues however , before police repression compelled abandoning the project .
The war , which broke out in August 1914 , forced Lenin and Krupskaya to move to the neutral country of Switzerland , where they lived until their return to Russia , after the February Revolution in 1917 .
During this period Krupskaya was secretary of , and the leading force in , a Commission for the Aid of Russian Prisoners of War .
The commission was established under Bolshevik auspices , with the aim of reaching Russian POWs interned in Germany and Austria .
She was also involved in aiding Russian political emigres caught in Switzerland by the war .
Krupskaya continued to study and write on educational questions .
She published a book in 1915 on Public Education and Democracy .
She was on the verge of beginning work on a bigger project -- a Pedagogical Dictionary for Russian readers -- when the February revolution broke out .
Russian Revolution and socialist education
Once back in Russia , Krupskaya became closely involved in the work of the Bolshevik Party organisation in the Vyborg district of Petrograd -- one of the major centres of working - class power in the city , where the All - Russian Soviet convened .
She was a member of a Vyborg Bolshevik committee delegation that met with and urged the central committee to speed the insurrection , shortly before October 1917 .
After the October Revolution had transferred power to the workers ' and peasants ' councils , Krupskaya was appointed to a central administrative position in the People 's Commissariat of Enlightenment -- the body entrusted with developing education in the period of transition towards socialism in Russia .
" Education " included not only schools , but also adult education , overcoming illiteracy , the emancipation of women , the development of libraries , the communist youth movement and the coordination of political education .
In this capacity Krupskaya travelled around the country speaking to gatherings of workers and peasants .
During the dangerous days of the civil war , when the young Soviet Republic was threatened by a host of internal and external enemies , she addressed Red Army units on the matters covered by her portfolio .
Krupskaya believed in the maximum possible degree of local autonomy and control over education , with strong representation for groups involved , such as teachers and unions .
She had n't forgotten the libertarian precepts of Tolstoy absorbed in her youth .
As she wrote to a co-worker : " It is such a pity that Leo Nikolaevich [ Tolstoy ] is not alive . "
Such a program , however , was almost impossible to achieve in the conditions prevailing in the young Soviet state , where an already backward economic and social life was further devastated by years of war and civil war .
The material preconditions for building a socialist education system did not exist .
Stalin
Given these conditions of extreme material scarcity , and a decline in the immediate prospects for revolutionary victories outside Russia , as the initial post - war revolutionary wave in Europe subsided , a strong conservative current manifested itself in the Communist Party and the Soviet state apparatus .
This current found its material base in the burgeoning party and state bureaucracy , and its chief spokesperson in Joseph Stalin , general secretary of the Communist Party .
Stalin and his supporters steadily increased their influence and control over the party apparatus .
They succeeded , among many other things , in hampering the activities of Krupskaya 's commissariat and reducing its effectiveness .
For the last two years of his life , Lenin sought ways and means of reducing the power of Stalin and his secretariat , and the bureaucratic forces that threatened to wreck the achievements of the Soviet Republic since 1917 .
Finally , Lenin called for the removal of Stalin from his post as party secretary , and approached Trotsky with a view to fighting the bureaucratic forces that Stalin represented .
However , Lenin died before such an alliance could be cemented and his testament , which recommended the removal of Stalin , was suppressed .
Soon after Lenin 's death in early 1924 , Krupskaya learned of a decision by the ascendant group in the party leadership to embalm Lenin 's body and place it on permanent display in a Moscow mausoleum .
She wrote an open letter to the Russian people , published in the party daily Pravda :
I have a great request of you .
Do not permit your grief for Ilyich [ Lenin ] to take the form of external reverence for his person .
Do not raise memorials to him , palaces named after him , splenderous festivals in commemoration of him .
To all this he attached so little importance in his life , all this was so burdensome to him .
In line with Lenin 's express wishes , Krupskaya attempted to have his testament read out at the 13th party congress in May 1924 .
But her attempt was quashed by the ruling group on the central committee around Stalin .
She was , however , able to take the floor at the congress to defend Trotsky , who faced a demand from the Stalinists for the recantation of his anti-bureaucratic views .
Krupskaya again defended Trotsky 's contributions to the socialist revolution in Russia , during the so - called " literary debate " over Trotsky 's booklet The Lessons of October .
In 1925 the ruling group began to suppress articles Krupskaya wrote for the party press , attacking the party leadership 's conciliationist attitude towards the new class of rich capitalist farmers ( kulaks ) which had developed since the early 1920s , under a shift in orientation known as the New Economic Policy .
In the same year Krupskaya signed a manifesto protesting against the party leadership 's policies .
At the December 1925 14th congress , Krupskaya opened the attack on Stalin and Nikolai Bukharin ( the other central leader of the rightist course ) on behalf of the so - called Leningrad Opposition , which also included Grigorii Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev -- both of whom had only recently broken with Stalin -- and Grigorii Sokolnikov .
As well as taking issue with the leadership 's policies , she attacked the restrictions placed on the full discussion of dissenting views in party publications under Stalin 's apparatus , and defended Lenin 's traditional position on the rights of dissenting minorites within the party .
Krupskaya remained with the United Opposition until October 1926 .
She signed , along with Trotsky and Zinoviev , the " Declaration of the Thirteen " , a document that sought to draw the party 's attention to the deepening bureaucratic deformations ravaging the foundations of the workers ' state .
She also endorsed a protest against the Communist International 's disastrous policy in the British general strike of 1926 .
Illness kept her out of much of the political struggle , although she continued to write and speak .
It was Krupskaya who arranged for publication in the West of Lenin 's testament , in 1926 .
She is said to have told Kamenev at this time : " If Lenin were alive today , he would be in jail . "
Smear campaign
Stalin and his acolytes were not slow to recognise the threat that Krupskaya represented to them , and they began a smear campaign against her similar to the one launched some years earlier against Trotsky .
Trotsky himself recalled this campaign of innuendo in an article written on Krupskaya 's death in 1939 :
... within the ranks of the apparatus they systematically compromised her , blackened her , degraded her , and in the ranks of the Komsomol [ Communist Youth ] spread the crudest and most ridiculous scandals '
In May 1927 Krupskaya , in a letter to Pravda , announced that she no longer supported the Opposition .
But unlike most other former Oppositionists in the same situation , she did not recant or repent -- nor did she have a single word of support for Stalin .
Nevertheless , even without going back on her previously held positions , she too , up to a point joined the chorus against the only forces opposing in a principled way Stalin 's increasingly disastrous policies .
Although nominally reconciled to the ascendancy of Stalin , Krupskaya spent a good deal of her later years attempting to disseminate through the means available to her the legacy of Lenin .
Thus she wrote and published her famous Reminiscences of Lenin .
These memoirs present a realistic and politically well - informed portrait of a figure so often , before and since , distorted by hagiography or venom .
Krupskaya 's record of the disputes in the Russian socialist movement is presented fairly , and without that acrimony typical of Stalinist - inspired accounts .
Stalin himself rarely appears in the narrative .
Krupskaya 's work in the sphere of education continued until her death , but it declined in importance as the causes and organisations that she supported were discarded by the Stalinist bureaucracy .
However , even as late as 1937 , during the height of the purges , Krupskaya protested against the destruction of polytechnical education , invoking the authority of Karl Marx .
Although denied access to Soviet educational journals when she sought to publicise her views , she was heard to comment , after being shown over one of Stalin 's educational establishments : " A typical old school , in which there is nothing at all apart from the most boring studies ...
Dead studies , with which we fought from the first , installed anew in full measure " .
While essentially powerless to affect the course of Stalin 's terror , Krupskaya attempted to save the lives of the Old Bolsheviks facing the execution squads .
Thus , according to evidence held by the former dissident Soviet historian Roy Medvedev , she pleaded for the life of Osip Piatnitsky , in vain , and begged Nikolai Yezhov and Stalin to spare the lives of others , in at least one case successfully .
Thus Krupskaya spent her last years miserably , in the knowledge that many of her generation of revolutionaries had been physically or morally destroyed by the Stalin regime , and uncertain that a restoration of Soviet democracy was a near prospect .
From exile in Mexico , Trotsky , who was himself to outlive Krupskaya by only a year , wrote her epitaph :
Many Lemba are Christians and Muslims , but they embrace their Jewish roots
By Steve Vickers
BBC News , Harare
The Lemba people of Zimbabwe and South Africa may look like their compatriots , but they follow a very different set of customs and traditions .
They do not eat pork , they practise male circumcision , they ritually slaughter their animals , some of their men wear skull caps and they put the Star of David on their gravestones .
Their oral traditions claim that their ancestors were Jews who fled the Holy Land about 2,500 years ago .
It may sound like another myth of a lost tribe of Israel , but British scientists have carried out DNA tests which have confirmed their Semitic origin .
These tests back up the group 's belief that a group of perhaps seven men married African women and settled on the continent .
The Lemba , who number perhaps 80,000 , live in central Zimbabwe and the north of South Africa .
Lemba women do not have Jewish DNA
And they also have a prized religious artefact that they say connects them to their Jewish ancestry - a replica of the Biblical Ark of the Covenant known as the ngoma lungundu , meaning " the drum that thunders " .
The object went on display recently at a Harare museum to much fanfare , and instilled pride in many of the Lemba .
" For me it 's the starting point , " says religious singer Fungisai Zvakavapano - Mashavave .
" Very few people knew about us and this is the time to come out .
I 'm very proud to realise that we have a rich culture and I 'm proud to be a Lemba .
" We have been a very secretive people , because we believe we are a special people . "
Religion vs culture The Lemba have many customs and regulations that tally with Jewish tradition .
They wear skull caps , practise circumcision , which is not a tradition for most Zimbabweans , avoid eating pork and food with animal blood , and have 12 tribes .
Many people say that the story is far - fetched , but the oral traditions of the Lemba have been backed up by science
Tudor Parfitt
University of London
They slaughter animals in the same way as Jewish people , and they put the Jewish Star of David on their tombstones .
Members of the priestly clan of the Lemba , known as the Buba , were even discovered to have a genetic element also found among the Jewish priestly line .
" This was amazing , " said Prof Tudor Parfitt , from the University of London .
" It looks as if the Jewish priesthood continued in the West by people called Cohen , and in same way it was continued by the priestly clan of the Lemba .
" They have a common ancestor who geneticists say lived about 3,000 years ago somewhere in north Arabia , which is the time of Moses and Aaron when the Jewish priesthood started . "
Prof Parfitt is a world - renowned expert , having spent 20 years researching the Lemba , and living with them for six months .
The Lemba have a sacred prayer language which is a mixture of Hebrew and Arabic , pointing to their roots in Israel and Yemen .
Despite their ties to Judaism , many of the Lemba in Zimbabwe are Christians , while some are Muslims .
" Christianity is my religion , and Judaism is my culture , " explains Perez Hamandishe , a pastor and member of parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
Despite their centuries - old traditions , some younger Lemba are taking a more liberal view .
" In the old days you did n't marry a non-Lemba , but these days we interact with others , " says Alex Makotore , son of the late Chief Mposi from the Lemba " headquarters " in Mberengwa .
" I feel special in my heart but not in front of others such that I 'm separated from them .
Culture is dynamic . "
Crowds
The oral traditions of the Lemba say that the ngoma lungundu is the Biblical wooden Ark made by Moses , and that centuries ago a small group of men began a long journey carrying it from Yemen to southern Africa .
Hearing from those professors in Harare and seeing the ngoma makes it clear that we are a great people and I 'm very proud
David Maramwidze
Lemba elder
The object went missing during the 1970s and was eventually rediscovered in Harare in 2007 by Prof Parfitt .
" Many people say that the story is far - fetched , but the oral traditions of the Lemba have been backed up by science , " he says .
Carbon dating shows the ngoma to be nearly 700 years old - pretty ancient , if not as old as Bible stories would suggest .
But Prof Parfitt says this is because the ngoma was used in battles , and would explode and be rebuilt .
The ngoma now on display was a replica , he says , possibly built from the remains of the original .
" So it 's the closest descendant of the Ark that we know of , " Prof Parfitt says .
Large crowds came to see the unveiling of the ngoma and to attend lectures on the identity of the Lemba .
For David Maramwidze , an elder in his village , the discovery of the ngoma has been a defining moment .
" Hearing from those professors in Harare and seeing the ngoma makes it clear that we are a great people and I 'm very proud , " he says .
" I heard about it all my life and it was hard for me to believe , because I had no idea of what it really is .
" I 'm still seeing the picture of the ngoma in my mind and it will never come out from my brain .
Now we want it to be given back to the Lemba people . "

Captured in Indonesia after eating three people
Prudential of Britain said Monday that it had agreed to buy American International Group ’s life insurance business in Asia in a deal valued at $ 35.5 billion .
The sale of American International Assurance , which is based in Hong Kong and is commonly known as A.I.A. , would lead to the biggest repayment yet toward the more than $ 180 billion that the U.S. government has invested in A.I.G. as part of a huge series of bailouts .
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York , which holds preferred shares in A.I.A. , would receive the first $ 16 billion in proceeds from a sale .
With a takeover of A.I.A. , Prudential would become the indisputable leader in Asia .
Prudential said the combined group would be the leading life insurer in Hong Kong , Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia , Vietnam , Thailand and the Philippines and the leading foreign life insurance business in China and India .
A 162 - year - old company — which is not related to Prudential Financial in the United States — the British Prudential already draws a large part of its revenue from Asia , with more than 11 million policyholders in 13 markets .
How ' Free Market ' Snookers Americans Editor ’s Note : The Big Lie being sold to rank - and - file Tea Partiers is that “ big government ” is the great threat to their freedoms , not the unrestrained power of corporations , many of which are quietly funding the right - wing movement that seeks to block even modest government efforts to protect the people from corporate excesses .
Deceived by the Right ’s massive messaging machine , the Tea Partiers and other middle - class conservatives are , in effect , serving themselves up as modern - day serfs to corporate power , a point underscored in this guest essay by Don Monkerud : Although some Americans worry about the growing power of the government , few understand the real power that controls their everyday lives .

Printer friendly Private monopolies determine the brand of breakfast cereal we eat , the type of car we drive , where we bank , the medical treatment we receive , the fashion of our clothes , and the kind of toothbrush we use , in addition to the beer we drink , the health insurance we buy , and what we feed our pets .
Under the guise of " the free market , " conglomerates merged and bought up smaller companies , until , today , they dominate their respective markets in every commodity offered for sale in the U.S .
In this race to consolidate , companies " rationalized " their offerings , in many cases dropping up to 40 percent of what they formerly produced .
They buy from the same suppliers , use interchangeable parts and common ingredients , and re-name similar brands , essentially placing the same product in different packages .
For example , one company produces all of the pet food under 150 different brands .
" People say we have an uncontrolled free market but we have the opposite , " says Barry C. Lynn , senior fellow at the New American Foundation .
" What we have today is a laissez - faire American version of feudalism ; a private government in the form of private corporations run by private individuals who consolidated power to govern entire activities within our political economy . "
In a new book , Cornered : The New Monopoly Capitalism and The Economics of Destruction , Lynn describes the many past struggles in America between small elite oligarchies and democratic government .
Throughout our history , Americans have beaten back the attempts of monopolies to control various industries .
The Boston Tea Party fought to overturn monopolization of commerce by the private British East India Company .
Alexander Hamilton 's attempt to help his friends out with the whiskey tax , led to the Whiskey Rebellion .
People acting through government prevented a small elite from controlling our railroads , steel mills , the oil industry and other concentrations of power .
" In the case of railroads , people realized they could consolidate power discriminating against some companies by charging them higher rates and stripping them of cash , " says Lynn .
" The American people then decided that if you had a monopoly hauling goods , you have to charge everyone the same rate .
We used our government to keep them from consolidating political and economic power . "
According to Lynn 's research , early Americans made decisions to balance power between farmers , consumers and the market itself .
This is why we created " open and public markets . "
Labor , managers , engineers , shareholders , and local communities ran our corporations , which are social institutions .
The ultimate function of a well - regulated open - market system is not to ensure an “ efficient ” distribution of resources , but " to reveal , harness , and direct power within a society in order to ensure the widest possible distribution of political freedom and the greatest possible degree of political and economic stability , " says Lynn .
With the election of Ronald Reagan , conservatives redefined " free enterprise " to mean the unfettered power of an individual to amass as much wealth as possible , while liberals sought to use planning and efficiency to lower costs , even if it resulted in the loss of some economic freedom .
Using theories developed by Chicago School of Economics leaders such as Milton Friedman and Alan Greenspan , Reagan directed the Justice Department to base anti-trust decisions on a vision of efficiency as measured solely by lowered costs .
" Before Ronald Reagan we accepted inefficiencies to protect a free political system , " says Lynn .
" In 1981 , we changed laws to a consumer welfare test , measured by price and economies of scale ; hence , any consolidation can appear to promote the welfare of the consumer .
Unlimited growth was made acceptable .
This was a revolutionary overthrow of our antimonopoly laws . "
Today libertarian think tanks such as the CATO Institute , serve as " the vanguard of a neofeudalist movement " to attack democratic government .
They and other conservative propagandists have spent $ 30 billion in the past 30 years to promote their agenda and convince people that massive layoffs , foreign competition , and higher prices are the result of " natural free - market forces . "
Squeezed from all sides , some Americans react by becoming corporate shock troops attacking their own government .
" Those who control our corporations managed an Orwellian achievement to redefine the use of brute corporate force as ' market forces , ' " says Lynn .
" We still believe in a consumer utopia , but we have an illusion of choice .
Corporate powers manipulate our decision - making and direct us to buy certain goods at certain prices . "
Institutional power shifted to Wall Street and large financial institutions .
Today a small elite runs corporations to serve themselves as they concentrate their power .
Some Americans are waking up to the reality of their situation , but Congress lacks the will to regulate corporate power .
" If we choose to protect our republican way of government , which depends on the separation of powers within our economy and our political system - then we have only one choice , says Lynn .
"
We must restore antitrust law to its central role in protecting our economic rights and breaking up dangerous concentrations of power . "

It is often said by believers of all faiths that to be without God is to be without a thing called Hope .
Hope , defined as the feeling that what is wanted can be had or that events will turn out for the best , is far from foreign to me .
I ’d even go so far as to say that my life is more filled with hope now than it ever was when I believed in the god of Christianity .
When I was a believer my hope was in my salvation , something I believed to have been provided by Christ ’s sacrifice on the cross .
I had the hope that the things of this world would soon pass away and that there would be an eternity of God ’s presence to endure .
I had hope in the promise of a relationship with that god and in the idea that he wanted for me to experience his love and compassion despite my own depravity ( and in the idea that he desired this same thing for all mankind . ) .
I experienced the hope of an afterlife and hope in miracles while still living .
I know the hope that the Christian speaks of , I ’ve experienced it , felt it , lived it …in fact I know from personal experience all of the elements that Christians or other religious folks may claim that the godless are not privy to , yet hope is by far one of the most prevalent elements of my life now – without god .
I have hope , I have lots of it .
I feel that what I have now is far more tangible than what I had prior to my fall from grace .
People give me hope daily .
Sometimes people take some of my hope away , but when we make progress toward a brighter future it is renewed .
When we do good things to one another or fight for causes we deem just , I am overwhelmed by hope .
When one of us spends his or her life ’s work on developing cures for diseases and cancers it gives me hope that we care about one another , and that if we keep doing so eventually we ’ll get to our next step toward a society that can be considered appropriate .
I have a hope that one day our species will find a way to cope with the problems of life without a need for religion and that also one day there will be social justice for all people .
I have hope that at some point in the near future that technology will be developed that can provide nutritious food for all people and that we will use that technology to actually feed people .
In the idea that our prejudices and our failures will one day be forgotten .
Out of curiosity I asked my Facebook fans if they as atheists lacked a sense of hope , I wanted to share their answers … anonymously of course :
DJ Said : I hope for things all the time .
I mean I “ hope ” the Patriots go to the Superbowl this year .
I hope I have fun on vacation .
I mean these things are n’t exclusive to theism .
I usually get pretty irritated when certain people claim you “ can’t ” have certain things without a God .
HD said : I tend to be cheerfully pessimistic about most things .
I hope for the best and prepare for the worst .
Never ( certainly not in the past 40 years ) had a need for a god to be hopeful .
CS Said : I have never met a hopeless atheist , but I have met many religious with false hope .
They may think they have hope , but the downtrodden look in their eyes and the depression of their very being begs to differ .
When deep down you know your hope is meaningless , how could you possibly feel anything but despair ? :

I do hope for all kinds of things though , be it a better economy , progress , more freedom , and so on .
TC said : Oh I have hope .
I ’m optimistic and hopeful every day 🙂
Do n’t need a god to do that 🙂
GW said : God is lack of hope .
I do n’t want to be a tiny part in something else ’s plan .
I do n’t want to be judged on unknown criteria .

In part two of our Q&A series with Tokyo Vice author Jake Adelstein , we 'll answer some basic questions about the yakuza : why people join , how they operate , and how much influence they have on mainstream Japanese culture .
You will also find out why some parents might voluntarily send their kids to mobsters and how landing an innocent - seeming IT job could accidentally spiral you into a lifetime of crime .
If you have n't read part one , which is a more intimate look at Adelstein 's own experience as a crime beat reporter in Japan , it 's here .
Why do people join the yakuza ?
They 're usually misfits from Japanese society .
The word yakuza itself comes from a losing hand in gambling .
893 ( ya - ku-za ) .
It 's the worst hand you can have .
So when they refer to themselves as yakuza , they 're referring to themselves as losers .
It 's a very self - deprecating term .
In western Japan , there 's still a lot of discrimination against burakumin , the outcast class .
If you come from certain parts of the country , they might think you 're inferior , dirty , and unclean .
There are also a lot of Korean - Japanese yakuza because of the discrimination against them .
It 's getting better , but in the past , the job choices for Korean - Japanese were pretty much pachinko parlor , barbeque restaurant operator , sex club operator , or the yakuza .
Some of them are just normal people who are basically running a very small home security business .
They collect money from bars and clubs in the neighborhood and in turn provide a service .
If there 's an unruly customer , they 'll beat the shit out of him without calling the cops .
If someone does n't pay the tab , the yakuza will go to their door and politely ask for the money .
Do they come from broken families ?
Not necessarily .
A lot of them are from wealthy families — sons of cops , bureaucrats .
[ My bodyguard and ex-yakuza boss ] Mochizuki - san 's grandfather was a cop , and his father worked for a government institution his whole life .
Sometimes , if parents were worried about their kid 's drug use , they would take him to the local yakuza and be like , beat some sense into this kid , get him off drugs , make him a man .
And they would do it .
And then the kid would join the yakuza afterwards .
But I 'm sure that 's not what the parents wanted !
Well at least their kid's not on drugs , right ?
And he has a job .
In fact , lots of normal people go to the yakuza to solve problems .
In Japan , civil lawsuits take forever to get resolved , and even if you win the lawsuit nobody will enforce it — if a guy owes you money but wo n't pay up , police officers are n't going to go out there to seize his assets .
If someone owes you money or you 're in a civil dispute , the yakuza will take half of whatever they can get out of the person who wronged you .
But at last you get half , and it 's fast .
Are there any misconceptions we have about the yakuza ?
Mochizuki - san is a wonderful father to his child .
He 's incredibly patient and never yells at him .
Some yakuza parents make sure their children do n't become yakuza .
Some of them actually do charity work and contribute funds to orphanages and things .
It 's rare , but it always surprises me .
The other thing that surprises me is that on their days off they 're at home wearing Mickey Mouse t- shirts and sweatpants , and I 'm like , wow .
I never would have pictured you like this when you 're off the job .
I know one yakuza boss who is really into akachan play , where he gets diapered like a baby and sucks on a lactating woman 's tits .
I 'm like , this is what this fearsome guy does for pleasure ?
From what you 've told me about him , he seems like a perfectly decent guy .
What made him join the yakuza ?
Excitement , thrills , the promise of women .
He racked up huge debts in a Soapland — Japan 's legal brothels .
He kept putting it on his tab until he could n't pay it back .
He was trying to raise money when the yakuza Soapland owners were like , why do n't you work for these guys and you can pay me back ?
What happens a lot now is that people graduate college and go work for some IT startup , and then they realize it 's being bankrolled by the yakuza .
The yakuza go , hey , this guy 's smart .
He earns money .
We could use him .
So they 'll say to him : how would you like to become a member ?
We 'll make you a corporate associate so you do n't have to spend two years cleaning the office and answering the phone .
It 's employment for life !
Because of the reputation of the yakuza , most people would be scared and hesitant to refuse .
When you 're privy to knowledge of how a large front company works , it 's kind of hard to back out .
Do yakuza kill random people ?
The traditional yakuza value is : katagi ni meiwaku wo kakenai .
We do not bother ordinary citizens .
You can come to us for gambling , drugs , or sex , and that 's our business .
But we 're going to leave ordinary citizens alone .
We 're not involved in robberies , thefts , or muggings , and we do n't rape people .
This does n't hold true anymore .
Now it 's all about money .
The ideals that held up the traditional system of meritocracy are gone .
You can buy your way into power .
The classic yakuza life scheme used to be that you started at the bottom doing whatever enterprises , loan - sharking or prostituion or drug - running or extortion blackmail , pretty standard yakuza stuff .
Eventually there would be a gang war and you 'd shoot up a member of a rival gang , go to jail , and come out after 10 years to a higher position with a better salary .
But as gang wars have declined and the organizations have moved into financial crimes like stock market manipulation or running front companies that are listed companies , capital has become more valuable than honor .
There used to be a premium paid on upholding codes of what was proper yakuza living , but nobody pays attention to them anymore .
How involved are the yakuza in the way business in Japan is run today ?
In the financial markets , I 'd say about 20 % of listed companies are heavily connected to the yakuza .
There 's a hell of a lot more money to be made moving a million shares of stock than a hundred bags of speed on the streets .
How about in politics ?
The Liberal Democratic Party was founded on yakuza money .
Former prime minister Koizumi's grandfather was a member of the Inagawa - kai ; he was tattooed all the way down to his wrists .
According to magazine articles written in the nineties , the current minister of finance Kamei Shizuka received $ 400,000 from a yakuza stock speculator and certainly received donations from the emperor of loan sharks .
What about in pop culture ?
A huge part of the entertainment industry is run by the yakuza .
When a rather dumb cop accidentally leaked all the Metropolitan Police Department files on Goto - gumi in 2007 , a company called Burning Productions — one of the most powerful production companies in the country — was listed as an organized crime front company .
Nobody in the Japanese media will write that , though , because they 'll lose have access to their stars .
It 's like Hollywood in the 50s when the mafia had a big share in everything .
Do you think that will ever change ?
Will Japan ever run as a non-yakuza society ?
For this to happen , Japan needs a few things .
There would have to be a criminal conspiracy law so you can prosecute people at the top for crimes committed by people below them .
There would have to be plea bargaining so people at the bottom would rat out people above them , and a witness protection program so that the people who make plea bargains are n't killed as soon as they get out of jail .
You need wiretapping laws that allow you to wiretap — the laws are so stringent now that they 're almost never used .
If you put all those things into place , then Japan could get rid of the yakuza groups .
They 'd probably go underground but they would never be this powerful again .
Part of the reason they are so powerful now is that they 're so out in the open .
You can look at the Yamaguchi - gumi headquarters on Google Maps .
The Inagawa - kai office is across from the Ritz Carlton .
Every year , the NPA releases a list of the 22 organized crime groups with their names and addresses .
It 's not a mystery who they are or where they are .
What 's preventing change from taking place ?
Polticians .
They do n't want a criminal conspiracy law in the books .
I do n't think there are any politicians who do n't have any dirt of them .
And if any politician starts coming down hard on organized crime — if they do n't physcially kill him like they did the mayor of Nagasaki — they 'll ruin his reputation .
Here 's the thing : Japanese people kind of like the yakuza .
They admire them .
There are movies about them , comic books about them , there are fan magazines … they 're part of the culture .
They promote traditional values .
One of the reasons Japan has low street crime rates is because these guys are very good enforcers .
In the neighborhoods where they 're running businesses or collecting protection money , you wo n't see people getting mugged because the yakuza do n't want people to be afraid to come there and spend money .
They are a second police force and in that sense , and perform a valuable role in Japanese society .
Over the next few months , we 'll be collaborating with Jake Adelstein to bring you a series of Boing Boing exclusive yakuza stories .
In a few weeks , we 'll go behind - the - scenes with Adelstein and his yakuza buddies to watch how they do ordinary things like play video games , use the computer , and chop off body parts .

“ We intended to raise those children and be with them their entire lives , if necessary , ” she said , standing behind a door of thick metal bars in pedal pushers , sandals and a blouse printed with palm trees .
“ These kind of children are sold across the border for the price of a chicken .
We wanted to give them lives of joy and dignity in God ’s love . ”
But SOS Children ’s Villages , an Austrian organization that runs the orphanage in Port - au - Prince where the children have been temporarily placed , said at least one of the children , an 8 - year - old girl , told workers , “ I am not an orphan , ” according to the group ’s Web site .
The girl said she thought her mother had arranged a short vacation for her .
Haitian officials said that several of the children had parents , and that , unfortunately , this turn of events was one they had anticipated .
Fearful of the possibility that unscrupulous traffickers would take advantage of Haiti ’s sundered justice system to take children from poor families for illegal adoptions , prostitution or slavery , the government had halted all adoptions except those already in motion before the earthquake .
Mr. Bellerive ’s signature is now required for the departure of any child .
For the government , the arrests provided an opportunity to send a strong message , and the message was outrage .
“ If people want to help children of Haiti , ” said Marie - Laurence Jocelin Lassègue , a government spokeswoman , “ this is not the way to do it .
“ There can be no questions about taking our children off the streets , ” she added .
“ It is wrong .
And those who do so will be judged . ”
Although many of the country ’s judicial and law enforcement structures , including the Ministry of Justice , the Supreme Court and numerous police stations , lie in ruins , Haitian officials said they were exploring options for prosecuting the Americans in Haiti .
But several officials acknowledged that if there was to be any trial at all , it would probably be in the United States .

Communications Minister Stephen Conroy tonight said he had not had any direct contact with US Government officials over Australia ’s controversial internet filtering plans , despite reports the US had raised the issue directly with the Federal Government .
News Ltd blog
The Punch has reported that US State Department spokesman Noel Clay said the US has raised concerns on the matter with Australian officials .
The US has been broadly critical of countries implementing internet censorship regimes .
“ Well , I ’ve seen those concerns , [ but ] I have n’t had any direct contact with the US State Department , ” Conroy said on the ABC ’s Radio National Australia Talks program tonight .
“ I saw the reports in the morning papers .
My department I do n’t believe has been directly contacted .
They maybe are speaking to the Department of Foreign Affairs — but I was unaware until I saw this morning ’s news reports of any approaches at all at this stage . ”
Conroy said Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen Smith had n’t raised the issue with him .
“ It could be that it just has n’t been passed through , ” he said .
“ I have n’t had a briefing from the Department of Foreign Affairs . ”
The news comes as Conroy has increasingly appeared in the media — on TV and radio shows particularly — in recent weeks to talk about the filter issue .
Legislation on the matter has been postponed , and some , such as Greens Senator Scott Ludlam , believe the associated bill will not be introduced into Parliament until the next Federal election .
Labor Senator Kate Lundy has been attempting to convince Labor figures to back an amendment to the bill that would make the filter opt - in instead of mandatory .
However , Conroy appeared to pour cold water on the idea tonight , saying the Government did n’t provide opt - in measures to other forms of media , and that the internet was not a special medium .

RIO DE JANEIRO ( Reuters ) - Almost a quarter of a billion people moved out of slum conditions in the past decade , driven by rapid economic growth in emerging giants India and China , but the number of people living in them continues to rise , the United Nations housing agency said on Friday .

The number of people living in shantytowns increased by 55 million to 827.6 million as population growth and migration from the countryside outstripped the effect of upward mobility in cities , the U.N. ’s biennial report on cities found .
“ The situation has improved over 10 years , but alas over the same period , the net increase of the urban poor is 55 million , ” Anna Tibaijuka , the executive director of the U.N. Habitat program , said in Rio de Janeiro .
The Brazilian city will next week host the World Urban Forum , a five - day U.N. conference on the state of the world ’s cities , where more than half the global population now lives .
Some 227 million people escaped slum conditions from 2000 to 2010 , meaning that countries easily surpassed their collective target under the U.N. Millennium Development target , the report said .
Tibaijuka played down the achievement of beating the Millennium goal of pulling 100 million people out of poverty , calling it “ totally inadequate . ”
The Millennium goals include cutting extreme poverty , reducing child mortality and fighting epidemics by 2015 .
Barring “ drastic ” action , the number of slum dwellers in the world ’s cities is expected to grow by 6 million a year over the next decade to hit 889 million by 2020 , the report said .
China ’s pro-growth policies had helped to cut the number of slum dwellers there by a quarter over the decade , while India achieved a reduction of a third .
Together , at least 125 million people were lifted out of poverty in the two emerging giants , the report found .
In Latin America , Brazil led the way in absolute poverty reduction as 10.4 million people left slum conditions .
“ In the Brazilian case , the main factor above all was basic sanitation , and above all in the northeast where the most significant advances occurred , ” said Eduardo Lopez - Moreno , one of the report ’s authors .
1. Monbiot argues that " either solar photovoltaic ( PV ) power in the United Kingdom is , as ( Leggett ) claims , a cheap , efficient technology , or it is n't .
If it is , why should we be subsidising it to the tune of 41 p per kilowatt hour ?
If it needs this subsidy , it is neither cheap nor efficient .
If it does n't need it , the feed - in tariffs are even more of a swindle than I thought . "
This view takes a snapshot in time that is a flawed basis for analysis because it ignores both the past and the future , in terms of cost , plus the strategic context of the discussion .
I do n't claim PV is " cheap " today – I never have .
PV is on a descending cost trajectory because economies of scale are at work in both manufacturing and installation , and costs and prices of conventional electricity are rising fast .
The feed - in tariff is a market - building mechanism .
It is designed to create sufficient demand for PV systems to trigger two benefits : first , falling cost and price of solar electricity , and second , growth of a proper UK - based solar PV industry that can compete with the fast - growing industries in Germany , China , the US , Japan and many other countries .
More than 40 governments now have feed - in tariffs , and it is clear that many people believe them to be the best way to make grow renewables markets fast .
2. Monbiot bets me £ 100 that my prediction that solar PV electricity in homes will be no more pricey in 2013 than conventional electricity will be wrong .
I accept Monbiot 's bet .
But I have a proviso : that the winner donates the £ 100 to the charity SolarAid , set up by my company , for the training and equipping of solar PV lighting entrepreneurs in Africa .
This seems appropriate because of another sad aspect of Monbiot 's assault on PV .
He does not mention the strategic importance of providing channels of distribution and credit for mobilising solar PV in the developing world , where solar PV electricity is already economic in competition with kerosene and other alternatives .
As even the World Bank has admitted , solar PV is a better bet than conventional power plants for the hundreds of millions of developing - world households currently without electricity .
If I lose the bet on timing of UK grid parity , it would only be by a few years at most , and by 2013 I am confident that people will be able to see the writing on the wall with respect to grid parity .
And herein lies my return bet with Monbiot .
I bet that if we are near or at grid parity by 2013 , that we wo n't see a column of his admitting to how wrong he was .
If he does , I 'd gladly donate another £ 100 to SolarAid .
3. Monbiot suggests that if I " really believed " my sales pitch , I would be calling for the feed - in tariff for new installations to be scrapped in 2013 , as it would then be redundant : " He can't have it both ways : defending the tariff while suggesting that the tariff wo n't be necessary . "
I have never suggested that the " tariff wo n't be necessary . "
The government does not share my view of when grid parity will be delivered , but nor do they believe as Monbiot appears to that new industries and new installer capacity can just be turned on overnight .
By 2013 , just three short years from now , the UK will still be endeavouring to build a domestic PV industry that can compete globally .
To do that we will need a strong domestic market .
To build that we will need a continuing market - enablement regime .
The feed - in tariffs can and will be lower by then , but we will still need them .
Otherwise , with a low - growth domestic market in an explosively growing global market , we will be importing almost all the solar technology we useand we will have further undermined our chances of energy independence down the track .
4. Monbiot asserts : " Every pound spent on PV is a pound not spent on a more effective technology . "
This is another use of the flawed snapshot argument devoid of strategic considerations .
If we were to use only the current price of energy technologies as a yardstick , and discount all trends and strategic considerations , we would allocate all our money to energy efficiency , where we get the quickest paybacks and carbon " bang for the buck . "
But this not an either - or : we can't solve all our energy problems with energy efficiency .
We will need plenty of new generation to replace aging coal and nuclear plants , and this will have to mean a range of generation by renewables , alongside as much gas as Vladimir Putin and others overseas will allow us .
We would be crazy just to go for the technologies that happen to be the cheapest in March 2010 , and it is extraordinary that an advocate of expensive nuclear like Monbiot can argue this .
5. Monbiot says of the German feed - in tariff : " The realisation in Germany , after 10 years of minimal returns , that they have been getting shockingly bad value for money from their scheme coincides with the launching of the same fiasco in the UK " .
It is untrue to suggest that the returns are minimal .
Consider just taxation .
In 2008 , the German government gained almost €3bn from the direct and indirect taxation of German solar power companies and their employees .
In the same year , feed - in tariff investments amounted to about € 2bn .
6. Monbiot questions the jobs the German feed - in tariff has created .
He says : " Leggett goes on to claim , again without attribution , that the Germans have " created over 50,000 jobs in solar PV alone . "
The 50,000 German employees are counted by the Federal Solar Industry Association .
Monbiot 's questioning of even this statistic introduces another relevant issue .
I have invited him in to Solarcentury several times to discuss the detail of our story and have a go at calibrating numbers ahead of any epistolary exchanges .
I have had no success .
He seems to prefer unrooted conflict from afar .
7. Monbiot also questions the location of jobs created .
He says : " The electricity users who have to pay for the tariff would be rather put out to discover that the jobs the government says it will create are actually on the other side of the world . "
How many mistakes can you make in one article ?
The Federal Solar Industry Association count over 100 factories in Germany in the industry built to date by the feed - in tariffs .
Then there are all the installer companies .
Certainly modules are also imported from China and Japan as well .
The global PV market is one of the fastest growing markets in the world ( 87 % in 2008 ) .
That is why UK plc needs to be a part of it .
Feed - in tariffs in the UK will lead to many jobs in the UK .
Solar companies estimate that around 100,000 new jobs could be created in the UK by 2020 .
And they will be skilled and fulfilling jobs .
8. Monbiot persists with the argument from his first article : that the British poor will subsidise the solar roofs of the middle class .
He says : " Their bills will rise just like everyone else 's to pay for a scheme which will mostly benefit the middle classes .
This is why it is deeply regressive . "
First , it is necessary to be clear about the numbers and the likely impact on average household bills as a result of this scheme .
The average yearly cost of the feed - in tariff scheme to household levy payers is projected to be £ 8.50 per year to 2030 .
The average annual household levy in 2013 when tariff rates are all up for review is likely to be £ 3 .
And those are the costs for all technologies not just solar PV .
So the question is whether an average household levy of just £ 8.50 per year makes the feed - in tariff scheme regressive or not ?
Furthermore , the government has already committed to make the scheme revenue natural by offering loans whereby households can borrow the capital cost of energy efficiency and renewable technologies and repay them over time using the money saved as a result of installation .
And if PV was so regressive , how come housing associations are so keen on PV as a tool for addressing fuel poverty ?
9 . Lastly , Monbiot accuses me of ignoring a " killer fact " .
He says : " Feed - in tariffs cannot reduce our carbon emissions by 1g while the UK remains within the European emissions trading scheme ( ETS ) .
Monbiot and I might find things to agree on , when it comes to scope for nonsense in the European emission trading scheme , as it stands .
But climate policymaking requires many tools in the toolkit , and there is no reason to throw feed - in tariffs out just because politicians have historically granted heavy industry emissions allocations that are too high to deliver an effective carbon price .
Monbiot 's " killer fact " taken to its logical conclusion would mean no support for any low or zero carbon technology outside the EU ETS .
• Jeremy Leggett is founder and chairman of Solarcentury , the UK 's largest solar solutions company .
A while back I commented on the government 's dismissal of a misdemeanor charge of possessing marijuana on national forest lands due to the Attorney General 's new policy not to prosecute in federal court medical marijuana cases that are consistent with state law .
See my 8/20/09 , 8/23/09 , and 10/20/09 posts .
Recently , I learned the parties have continued to litigate over the defendant 's request for return of his property .
In its Opposition To The Mtn For Return of Property , the government objected to the return of a few small containers and a water pipe , commonly known as a bong , on the ground that the items contain contraband , namely marijuana residue .
Last week , U.S. Magistrate Judge Hollows ordered the property returned , noting that the government may wash the items in a " non-destructive " manner to remove any contraband before returning them .
2-26-10 Order Re Return of Property .
P.S. For full disclosure , the motion for return of property includes as an attachment a blurry photo of the bong and other items sought to be returned .
But I exercised journalistic liberties and got the photo used here from the internet .
Futuristic militaries are a staple in science fiction .
With their powered armor and laser guns , military science fiction novels are among the most exciting reads out there .
Except for one problem .
Most are not really about warfare .
Advertisement
While military SF involves military personnel and technology , the cores of the stories tend to focus on elements other than warfare .
Before I 'm tracked down and shot for saying that , let me qualify that statement .
Military SF novels are n't about the institution of warfare ; they focus on the effects of war , on the soldiers , on the morality of an organization , and on what humanity will do to survive .
But warfare is much more than just its destructive effects :
It is an institution with its own theories and reasoning .
It represents significant strategic , economic and political events , all coming together in a destructive crescendo .
When military science fiction focuses on people , there is very little about warfare , and how it is conducted .
In these tales , futuristic warfare is often incredibly simplified , on both the storytelling level , as well as the actual elements that make up the story .
Here are some of the biggest problems with representations of war in most military SF .

Military Science Fiction Needs to Forget About World War II
Robert Heinlein opens up his book Starship Troopers as the soldiers are about to jump right into a mission on an alien world .
He writes :
You 'll be dropped in two skirmish lines , calculated two thousand intervals .
Get your bearings on me as soon as you hit , get your bearing and distance on your squad mates , both sides , while you take cover .
You 've wasted ten seconds already , so you smash and destroy whatever 's at hand until the flankers hit dirt .

Essentially , he 's describing airborne small unit tactics , developed early on in the Second World War by both the United States and Germany , and used in several dramatic instances throughout the war .
The idea of airborne soldiers is an interesting novelty , to say the least , and on numerous occasions they have been incredibly useful units to be able to field .
At the same time they are incredibly limited in what they can achieve on the battlefield .
Adapting futuristic scenarios from real - life military operations is certainly not limited to Starship Troopers .
Timothy Zahn 's Cobra trilogy follows a group of enhanced soldiers on the battlefield , the Halo video games portray a highly mobile military force landing on a small ringworld , and John Scalzi's Old Man's
War sends genetically enhanced soldiers onto other hostile planets , where they all face alien forces on the ground .
While exciting , interesting and a lot of fun to read , a lot of these stories pull their inspiration from the idea that individual soldiers , enhanced through various means , are able to operate in smaller units that replace a comparable amount of offensive force .
In a number of these futures , small unit tactics become the norm .

In military strategy , this is n't really a good idea .
Shifting one 's entire military capabilities over to an airborne - style military is just crazy .
While it makes for good storytelling , and it's a very dramatic style of warfare , there are a number of problems with airborne tactics .
That 's why large - scale airborne drops on the scale of Operation Overlord in 1944 simply are n't done any more .
Soldiers tend to scatter ; soldiers find themselves in enemy territory by themselves ; and airborne units are generally unable to operate effectively against an enemy 's heavy units , such as armor .
While science fictional soldiers are generally enhanced , such as in Starship Troopers , Armor , The Forever War and so forth , they 're still fundamentally individual soldiers operating without support .
Advertisement
Airborne units in the Second World War , such as the 101st and 82nd Airborne divisions , had a vital , but limited effect during Operation Overlord and later on during Operation Market - Garden .
Airborne troopers found themselves outmanned and outgunned by the people whose territory they were invading .
Because of physical limitations , soldiers carried upwards of a hundred pounds of gear : guns , rations , ammunition and survival items , in addition to any specialized tools that they might have carried ( mortars , ammunition , bazookas , and so on ) and that was it .
Due to the nature of their mission , resupplying these soldiers was a difficult task , and oftentimes , while they had some supplies , units were far better at taking on their targets by sabotage and unconventional tactics , rather than a frontal or flanking attack , shortly after they dropped .
After that point , they were reinforced by heavier forces coming in by more conventional means .
Largely , SF seems to ignore the practical elements involved with this style of warfare .
In John Scalzi's Old Man's War , soldiers are enhanced , and then sent out onto the battlefield with conventional weapons , and that 's it .
The same thing goes for Heinlein and Halderman 's troopers .
While enhanced , these soldiers are essentially treated as conventional forces , attacking positions as regular airborne soldiers might - individually or in small numbers - undertaking entire campaigns without any mention of heavier support from other forces .
The shortfall here is that there seems to be no thought put into some of the tactics that new technologies might bring with them .
Power - suited soldiers are a great idea , and something that the US Army has already thought about , but you can be sure that these soldiers will be used very differently from others out in the field .

There is a single book that I 've come across that actually incorporates a number of these missing elements : Glen Cook 's Shadowline , the first book of his Starfishers trilogy .
In it , military actions , on the part of mercenary outfits , include detailed talk about terrain impacting movements , artillery and logistical forces to support front - line units and longer strategical moves to outwit and ultimately defeat an enemy force .
Ultimately , however , Shadowline is n't a military science fiction novel , falling more towards the Space Opera side of the house , where it works extremely well .
What is does show , however , that this sort of story element can be put to use .
However , there is a tradeoff between the strategic elements and the hardware used in warfare for stories .
It does n't have to be .

Military Thought and Theory
Tactics , strategy and doctrine are all products of military experience and theory .
There are reasons why Roman soldiers massed in large units .
Used properly , this was an effective defense against enemy formations and counter - infantry measures , such as cavalry , and allowed for the best chances of success .
While unit layouts are the products of war , so too are unit discipline and cohesion in the midst of fighting .
With the introduction of gunpowder weapons hundreds of years later , the rise of artillery forces prompted the introduction of new designs for fortifications , and counter - artillery batteries that specifically existed to nullify an enemy 's advantage on the battlefield .
The end of World War I brought about the introduction of maneuver warfare , which was later perfected by the Germans at the beginnings of World War II , and is still used to an extent by US forces .
Add science fiction writers to the mix , and suddenly , powered armor and space cruisers take the center stage ; but authors keep drawing upon examples from the past to create stories .
Advertisement
To date , I 've yet to see a science fiction novel that really puts combat and warfare into this context of armed evolution .
Concepts are crudely dropped into the future with little explanation as to how they got there , which complicates the problem .
While powered armor and space cruisers potentially might become standard doctrine in the future , they will be the product of warfare , with specific uses and a body of tactics all to their own .
It will be very , very different from the larger unit tactics that are generally portrayed in any number of books .
Starship Troopers saw massed units of soldiers working largely in concert with one another , Old Man's War 's unit tactics were something similar to tactics used in the Second World War and Vietnam , and the soldiers of The Forever War found themselves in loose formations in fields and open areas .
These ideas certainly work in the stories , but these units are n't utilizing tactics that are the product of theory with their specific hardware .
Taking a Planet , with Small Units
While small unit tactics can cover small engagements and individual battles , combat extends to encompass larger strategy .
It follows different theories on the conduct of war as the situation allows , while also branching out to different areas of society , namely the political sphere .
Most military SF looks exclusively at battlefield tactics , ignoring that these are contained within a greater plan for the military direction : war strategy .
Advertisement
The Napoleonic theorist Carl von Clausewitz has been a mainstay for tacticians throughout the era of modern warfare , with his book On War , and there is no reason to believe that his lessons and theories wo n't apply to engagements and strategy in the far future .
Advertisement
Clausewitz 's basic finding is this :
War therefore is an act of violence to compel our opponent to fulfill our will .
He defines this will as politically motivated , based on the individual policies of any given governmental body .
In a number of military SF books , Earth is attacked and the protagonists are part of an Earth government that is fighting a holding action or retaliating against an enemy .
While the will in this case is usually survival , the typical storyline involves the complete destruction of an alien home world or species ( such as in Ender 's Game ) , presented as the only option for humanity .

Old Man's
War goes a bit further by explaining the living space situation in the galaxy as being fairly limited , and as a result , wars are fought to find places to live .
While military SF books tend to get the overall governance of strategy right on some very basic levels , there is an immediate leap from the motivations behind strategy to direct battlefield tactics .
This is the ‘ broken ' element in military science fiction .
Warfare , especially in its modern form , is an incredibly complex beast , and that 's just dealing with a single planet .
In numerous books , planets are approached as if they were countries , with warfare being conducted as small scale tactical assaults that are over by the end of the day .
Not only is this unrealistic to the nth degree , it 's an incredible oversimplification and abridgment of how warfare is actually conducted .
Furthermore , with many of the aforementioned books using units that focus on highly mobile , unsupported tactics , the idea of capturing a planet becomes flat out unrealistic .
( Well , more so than military units fighting on other planets . )
Advertisement
A large gap in a lot of military science fiction stories that 's never really been filled adequately is wartime strategy , or the connection between each tactical step in battle and an overarching plan that fulfills the political goal of bending an enemy to one 's will .
To my knowledge , there are n't any good military science fiction books out there that really cover this step , and it is a vital aspect of the nature of warfare .
There 's a very good reason for this pedantic and fairly narrow argument :
None of these books are about warfare .
Starship Troopers looks to the political spectrum , Ender 's Game looks to a soldier 's morality , Old Man's War is about the stresses of combat and The Forever War is about how society changes over long periods of time .
Advertisement
While these books all heavily involve warfare , none are about warfare .
And although there are many works that depict futuristic battles , there 's virtually nothing about the actual evolution and usage of warfare .
At the end of the day , we have science fiction novels that use the military as a setting .
But I would argue this is not military science fiction , which should examine warfare on a theoretical level too .
I am still waiting for a Clausewitz of the genre .
Virginia ’s McDonnell Reverses Gay Protections
James Joyner · · 7 comments
Virginia ’s new Republican governor , Bob McDonnell , reversed his predecessor ’s order prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation .
It happened twelve days ago but no one apparently noticed until TPM ’s Christina Bellantoni broke the story :
Gay and lesbian state workers in Virginia are no longer specifically protected against discrimination , thanks to a little - noticed change made by new Gov. Bob McDonnell .
McDonnell ( R ) on Feb .
5 signed an executive order that prohibits discrimination “ on the basis of race , sex , color , national origin , religion , age , political affiliation , or against otherwise qualified persons with disabilities , ” as well as veterans .
It rescinds the order that Gov. Tim Kaine signed Jan. 14 , 2006 as one of his first actions .
After promising a “ fair and inclusive ” administration in his inaugural address , Kaine ( D ) added veterans to the non-discrimination policy – and sexual orientation . [… ]
In another development , the Washington Post reported that a measure passed the Democratic - controlled state Senate that would protect state workers from discrimination due to sexual orientation and gender identity or expression .
The bill is all - but - certain to fail in the Republican - controlled House of Delegates .
Not a particularly surprising development .
McDonnell is an unabashed evangelical and social conservative and Virginia is , outside the DC suburbs where I live , a staunchly conservative state .
Further , McDonnell ’s office issued a statement saying , “ It shall be the policy of the office of the Governor to ensure equal opportunity in the workplace , encourage excellence by rewarding achievement based on merit , and prohibit discrimination for any reason .
Hiring , promotion , discipline and termination of employees shall be based on qualifications , performance and results . ”
One presumes that will in fact be the case .
Indeed , it ’s difficult to see how the state government could win a suit in which there was blatant discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation regardless of the state of this executive order .
My sense , then , is that this is a sop to the base with no meaning .
It ’s interesting , though , that this was done with so little fanfare that we ’re just now hearing about it .
Pluto was discovered 80 years ago today , and astronomers are still arguing over what it is .
The oddball world , downgraded from planet to dwarf planet status in 2006 and then later reclassified , is really out there .
Scientists are n't sure exactly what Pluto 's made of , how it formed , or why it orbits so oddly compared to the eight primary planets .
And there are at least two camps of astronomers when it comes to defining Pluto .
Some just think of it as a planet , others call it a dwarf planet or a plutoid .
While NASA has a spacecraft en route to Pluto and slated to make close - up images in 2015 , the best images of Pluto so far , taken this year by the Hubble Space Telescope , are mere smudges .
Pluto 's discovery
The hunt for Pluto began in 1905 when Percival Lowell ( of Martian Canal infamy ) hypothesized about the possibility of a Planet X in the outer solar system .
Lowell died before Pluto was discovered .
Clyde Tombaugh found it on Feb. 18 , 1930 in a concerted scan of the sky .
Tombaugh compared two photographs taken at the Lowell Observatory and noted the object 's movement against the background of stars .
Most of Pluto 's orbit is out beyond that of Neptune .
But the path is oblong , so Pluto spends part of its 248 - year orbit – the time it takes to make one circle around the Sun – inside the track of Neptune .
Pluto 's path is also extremely inclined , by 17.1 degrees , to the main plane of the solar system where the other planets travel .
Asteroids also circle the Sun in the solar system 's main plane .
So do some comets .
But many comets , like Pluto , have highly inclined orbits .
This similarity , plus Pluto 's small size – smaller than Earth 's Moon – led to its demotion .
Mysterious Pluto
Studies in 2003 showed that despite an almost nonexistent atmosphere , Pluto has wind and seasons and appears to have recently gone through a phase of global warming .
The leading theory for the formation of Pluto and its largest moon , Charon , is a wild one : A nascent Pluto was struck by another Pluto - sized object .
Imagine a glancing blow and a lot of cosmic Silly Putty getting stretched and repacked into new spheres with new rotations .
Observational evidence for this collision theory remain thin , however .
Charon is much bigger than any other moon in relation to the size of its host planet , further muddying Pluto 's status .
Some astronomers think of the setup as a double planet .
If you thought Valve 's switch from Internet Explorer to WebKit for its new beta version of digital distribution platform Steam — or the semi-irrefutable hints of OSX compatibility within — were just coincidence , this morning 's latest viral blast should seal the deal .
Just days after ramping up a fantastic campaign hinting at new developments with their Portal , the developer let loose a set of images sent not only to games press like RockPaperShotgun and Eurogamer , but MacRumors , as well .
With an Apple - logo - emblazoned Gordon Freeman , iPod-ad - silhouetted Team Fortress 2 Heavy , and John Hodgman / Justin Long dual - turret montage , the message is pretty clear .
Below is a hi-res collection of all the images released thus far .
With their iPhone - esque " dot " navigation at the bottom of each image , there seems to be just one more to go [ UPDATE : MacWorld got the final image of Half - Life 's Alyx disrupting a version of Apple 's classic 1984 ad ] , and with just days to go to the 2010 Game Developers Conference , we 're likely less than a week away from their grand finale .
New York ( CNN ) -- Spider - Man's alter ego cannot escape the harsh realities of the current economic times and will lose his job in an issue of the Amazing Spider - Man hitting stores this week .
Peter Parker , official photographer of the mayor by day and New York City crime fighter by night , is going to face new challenges , including unemployment .
" He 's going to struggle with unemployment and trying to save the city while he can barely afford to keep a roof over his head , " said Steve Wacker , Marvel Comics senior editor .
Parker has always been a grounded character with real - world problems , Wacker said .
His aunt is frequently sick , he has girlfriend troubles , and he sometimes struggles to find work .
In addition , Spider - Man story lines are often set against a backdrop of current events .
In the near future , Parker will have to juggle paying bills and buying " web- fluid " and other materials to fix his superhero costume in addition to keeping his dual identities under wraps .
Parker 's work history includes photographer , assistant high school coach , science teacher and scientific researcher , according to his biography on the Marvel Web site .
His education includes a college degree in biophysics and some postgraduate work in biochemistry .
It was at a science exhibit he attended as a teenager that he was bitten by a radioactive spider and acquired the creature 's strength , agility and weaving ability , says Marvel Comics .
And although Parker has skills few other others can claim , he probably wo n't list these on his resume : superhuman strength , ability to cling to most surfaces , fast traveling ability aided by web - slinging and spider - sense danger avoidance system .
The Amazing Spider - Man comic was first published in 1963 .

Former Bush speechwriter David Frum says that while he opposes the health care reform plan , its passage will represent a major defeat for the Republican Party .
In his words , it will be the GOP ’s " Waterloo . "
Frum ’s key point :
Those of us who said there was a deal to be done , that there are a lot of parts of this bill that look familiar , that look like Mitt Romney ’s plan , that look like plans Republicans proposed in 1993 and 1994 , they look like things that were drafted at the Heritage foundation in 1990 and 1991 , we can work with this , there are things we do n’t like , [ but ]
President Obama will pay a lot maybe for 20 or 30 Republican votes , let ’s deal — that was shut down , we went the radical way , looking for Waterloo , and it looks like we arrived at Waterloo .
... Some of the Republican leadership like Jim DeMint , I think did play a very hard - line role .
Some of our leaders were trapped .
They were trapped by voices in the media that revved the Republican base into a frenzy that made dealing impossible .
I mean , you ca n’t negotiate with Adolf Hitler , and if the President is Adolf Hitler , then obviously you ca n’t negotiate with him .
So some of the blame has has got to go to those who said , who got the psychology of the party to a point where a lot of good people , reasonable people were trapped .
... We are encouraging a mood of radicalism in the party that is not just uncivil , that ’s not the problem , the problem is it makes you stupid .
It makes you make bad decisions , it leads you to think that President Obama with 53 % of the vote is as beatable in 2009 as President Clinton with 42 % of the vote in 1993 , and that ’s obviously not true .
Frum points the finger squarely at " radical " Republicans like Jim DeMint who made the decision to not negotiate with President Obama , instead betting all their chips on a failed strategy of obstruction .
Frum says that within the bill there are many provisions that conservatives should be able to support , and that it was a huge mistake for them to say " no " instead of seeking common ground .
As a result , Frum says , Democrats will be able to claim full credit for passing a bill with many popular provisions , leaving the GOP out in the cold .
Frum ’s argument relies on a difficult juggling act , simultaneously saying he does n’t like the bill and blaming blaming conservatives for having negotiated with Obama on it , but his basic argument was that Republicans never had a chance of defeating reform , and should have tried to get as much as they could given that it would pass .
By standing on the sidelines , he says , Republicans missed an opportunity to at least achieve some conservative goals , and he places the blame for that squarely on the most extreme elements of the GOP .
Whether or not you agree with everything Frum has to say , it ’s a very clear example of kind of self - examination and finger pointing that will dominate the discussion inside the GOP in the wake of their defeat on health care reform .
Update ( 1:55 PM ) : KingofSpades notes this tweet from Frum :
Okay , honestly ?
Sex IS kind of trivial .
The facts that a .
we get pleasure out of it and b. are down to do it at any time in the menstrual cycle are evolutionary evidence for the argument that sex is not just for procreation , and is therefore just another crazy human trait like wearing clothes or counting calories .
Oh wait , they stopped listening to me at " evolutionary " , did n't they .
The two mommies of the two children being forced out of Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic School in Boulder are n’t some publicity - crazed parents , as some ridiculous people have suggested .
Nor are they bad Catholics , in so much as gays can be good Catholics .
In a lengthy statement released by the lesbian parents of the two kids , they would like to remind everyone that they do n’t march in those gay parades , they are n’t some political martyrs , and dammit , how come their kids are n’t allowed in the school when “ divorced parents , children of parents born out of wedlock , non-Catholics , and non-practicing Catholics ” are allowed to enroll their offspring ?
“ Their eligibility has not been questioned .
There seems to be a subjective rating system of which sins are more unacceptable . ”
FULL STATEMENT :
We are normal people .
We have two children , a nice house , and a dog .
We both hold professional jobs in the community .
You would likely pass us on the street and not take much notice .
We work hard , and enjoy spending time with our family , traveling , and being outdoors .
What makes us different is that we are a lesbian couple .
We are not activists by nature .
You have never seen us at protests or marching in parades .
Up until this point , we have taken the typical passive approach of voting for candidates that represent our viewpoints and directing our charitable donations to organizations whose missions we support .
We live in a liberal community , where we have always felt safe , comfortable , and accepted .
Certainly over the years there have been times when our sexuality has been an issue , but they have been relatively minor .
We had to hire a lawyer to ensure both of our names were on our children ’s birth certificates , to protect our rights to inherit each others assets , and establish medical durable power of attorney .
Luckily , we had the financial means to pay the thousands of dollars to do all of this .
In the years that we have been in Colorado , laws have since been changed to protect some of these basic rights .
We file our taxes as single .
We filled out our census as ‘ unmarried partners living together ’ since we are not able to legally marry .
Upon returning from vacation , US Customs would not process us together because we ‘ did not qualify as a family ’ .
These are things that gay and lesbian people deal with every day .
Recently , we found ourselves in the middle of a political firestorm .
We went to enroll our oldest child in kindergarten at Sacred Heart of Jesus School , and were told that our children would not be welcome to continue their education there long term because of our sexual orientation .
This came as a shock to us because our children had been attending preschool at Sacred Heart for three years .
We had been open about our family situation from the start , and had always felt welcomed by parents and teachers .
The past weeks have been very difficult for our family .
We were initially very hurt and angry .
We met with school and church administrators to discuss the situation .
We were told that families and students need to uphold church doctrine in order for children to be admitted .
We were also told that our children would feel uncomfortable when taught about the “ family unit ” , and teachers might feel too intimidated by their presence to teach church beliefs .
Our answer to this is that there are many families that do not live their lives according to church doctrine .
There are divorced parents , children of parents born out of wedlock , non-Catholics , and non-practicing Catholics .
Their eligibility has not been questioned .
There seems to be a subjective rating system of which sins are more unacceptable .
Regarding the school ’s teaching about the ‘ family unit ’ , we are unconcerned .
Our children know that their family is different than most .
They are well aware that many families have a mom and a dad , and we discuss different family models openly .
We have a good understanding of the church ’s position on gay and lesbian people .
We have never sought approval from the church of our relationship and we would never ask that the school modify its teachings to accommodate our family .
We are not threatened by our children hearing different points of view on any issues .
Perhaps our biggest objection to the School ’s decision is that we think that it is wrong to punish a child for who the child ’s parents are .
We do not think that this reflects what Jesus would have done .
Jesus said , “ bring the children to me . ”
Our initial thought was that it would be least disruptive for our children to deal with this privately , and focus our energy on securing other educational options for them .
However , word of our situation got out to the Sacred Heart community at a teacher staff meeting and quickly spread .
Many people at Sacred Heart were outraged with the decision .
A teacher reported it to the local news outlets .
We found our story on the front page of the paper and in the headlines of the local news .
It quickly spread nationally and has been the subject of many online blogs .
We have chosen to speak up at this time to clarify many misconceptions .
Some have suggested that we enrolled our children at Sacred Heart to make a political point .
This could not be further from the truth .
We were both born and raised in the Catholic faith .
One of us went to Catholic school from preschool through high school , and the other attended a prestigious Catholic University .
Our children ’s grandmother and aunt were catholic school teachers for many years .
Furthermore , our children are Catholics .
They have both been baptized , and we take them to church regularly at Sacred Heart .
When we were allowed to have our children baptized ( as recommended by the 2006 document ‘ Ministry to Persons with a Homosexual Inclination : Guidelines for Pastoral Care ’ ) , we made a promise to raise our children in the Catholic faith .
We now feel like our attempts at fulfilling this promise are being undermined by the Church itself .
Although we do not see eye to eye with the Catholic Church on the issue of gay and lesbian relationships , we value what a Catholic education can offer our children from an academic , religious , and moral standpoint .
As parents , our number one priority is and always has been the well - being of our children .
We would never intentionally seek to further our own political beliefs at their expense .
Clearly this is an issue that strikes a nerve for many people .
If any good can come out of all of this , perhaps it is getting people thinking and discussing issues of faith and sexual orientation .
Our case is not unique .
There are many other gay couples who have families and are struggling to reconcile their sexual orientation with their religious beliefs .
We do not believe that homosexuality and organized religion need to be mutually exclusive .
We have been touched by the outpouring of support from the Sacred Heart community and the community at large .
Many of the people who stood up for us publicly did so at some risk to themselves and their families .
We are humbled by their courage .
We hope that in the future when we witness an injustice , we are brave enough to stand up to it like so many people did for us .
Our family will persevere .
We have well - adjusted , intelligent , beautiful children who are deeply loved .
We have chosen to move forward with our lives , not with hearts filled with hate and bitterness , but with hope that in part due to this controversy there might be some positive changes in the hearts and minds of others .
It is easy to have ideas and opinions when they are abstract .
When you meet the real people you are judging , you sometimes see things differently .
We never intended consciously for our family to be active gay rights advocates , but by living happy , successful lives it appears that is what we have become .
We will continue to raise our children with strong Catholic values and hold faith that through our actions , we are doing our part to create a more loving , inclusive world .
From The Rachel Maddow Show Dec. 30 , 2009 .
Rachel vows to keep covering the right wing extremists that her show has done such a wonderful job of going after all year in 2009 .
So all you astroturf groups , tea baggers , religious zealots , gay bashers and C - Street Family members , you 're not going to get a break in 2010 .
Good for Rachel .
Anyone else think they ought to have her on earlier instead of giving Tweety two hours -- one a reair most of the time -- to pollute the airways for the most part before her show comes on ?
She 's got the best news show on cable television , hands down IMHO .
After the lame duck period was over and the inauguration happened , this new young show of ours , along with everybody else in the media , settled into a year of covering this new presidency and the news and politics of our country this year .
I live and hope for there to be another duck - related presidential news item that would justify us using " Hail to the Chief " with the quack at the end of it .
We do have it on file in case that ever happens .
And we here at MSNBC and at this show , specifically , covered that election wall to wall for what sometimes felt like 25 hours a day .
There was election night coverage itself .
And then after Obama won but Bush and Cheney were still in office , there was the " Lame Duck Watch " to attend to .
Remember the " Lame Duck Watch " intro ?
MADDOW : So , happy new year .
When this show launched in September of last year , there was absolutely no ambiguity about what we would be spending most of our time covering .
We started the show during the very last lap of the presidential election .
And we , pretty soon , found a very specific " RACHEL MADDOW SHOW " niche .
We found what it is in news and politics that this show specializes in .

( on camera ) : Tonight , more in our continuing investigation into the witch hunt against the community activist group ACORN , the corporate roots of that witch hunt , its baldly dishonest tactics , and its ultimate dislocation from the warranted facts .
The same public relations firm that brought you the sleaziest , lying - est , most memorable , most parody - ready attack ads of the whole 2004 election is coordinating a new multi-million - dollar " Don`t Fix the Health Care System " campaign .
These guys are the pros .
This is an industry .
Americans are showing up at these events to shout down the discussion and to chase their congressmen , and they are enraged .
And they`re enraged , at least in part , because they`re being riled up by over - the - top , fabricated conspiracy theories about health care .
And they`re being directed and orchestrated by the corporate interests that do this for a living and do it very well .
You may wish you hadn`t said that fluoridation was a secret communist plot , but you did , in writing , and we have a library card .

Over the course of 2009 , my hair has gone up and down and up and down .
And we`ve spent a lot of time on this show talking about folks who were probably surprised to see themselves talked about on cable news .
People like The Family , the theologically extreme religious group that runs the C Street house , where conservative lawmakers live in Washington .
It turns out The Family loves its secretive power and influence almost as much as it hates publicity about its secretive power and influence .
We covered the PR firms and Republican operatives and corporate - funded , so - called nonprofits organizing the recess rallies against health reform back in August , which led to a lot of coverage about the corporate and Republican and professional PR outfits behind other anti-health reform efforts and behind the tea party movement .
By the time the group Freedom Works was charging $ 10,000 for speaking slots from the stage of the supposedly grassroots 9/12 march , we sort of knew we were on to something with that .
And then , when the head of Freedom Works , former Republican majority leader Dick Armey , got fired from the lobbying job he was maintaining while he was still running Freedom Works , we started to sense that we were really on to something .
We covered the PR firm for evil , Burson Marsteller , after AIG hired them with public money to try to improve how we , the public , view them .
Hey , we`re paying the bill for PR firms to spin us .
We covered the spin doctor so evil he likes to be called Dr. Evil .
Rick Berman - remember him ?
We started covering him after we figured out he was part of the absurd right - wing outrage scam against the community organizing group , ACORN .
And we found out that American religious leaders and politicians , including The Family , were involved in proposed legislation in Uganda to execute people for being gay .
We investigated the predatory anti-gay quack industry in America that claims to be able to cure people of the gay .
We looked into the huckster get - rich - quick high sales pressure revival meeting , motivational seminars that George W. Bush and Laura Bush decided to speak at in the former president and first lady`s first year out of the White House .
The most recent coverage like this that we`ve done is about the John Birch Society .
When we found out that the John Birch Society would be cosponsoring the marquee conservative conference of the year , the CPAC conference , the Conservative Political Action Conference this year in Washington , we decided it would be useful to talk about who exactly the John Birch Society is .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
( on camera ) :
So imagine that the right wing is - it`s like a rug , right ?
And on the far edge of that rug is fringe .
Now , imagine that that fringe also has fringe .
The fringe on the fringe of the right wing of the American conservative movement , that`s the John Birch Society .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
I have been thinking about this year of coverage that we`ve done , this mini mission we`ve taken on of talking about forces on the fringe of American politics , while we have been doing our latest batch of that coverage .
And it turns out that the historical record we`ve been looking into anyway in order to talk about the John Birch Society ended up being really clarifying for us , in terms of the value of doing this type of coverage as a show .
Back in 1961 , when the John Birch Society was probably at the height of its McCarthy - ite powers , the governor of California at the time tasked that state`s attorney general to report on the John Birch Society and what kind of effect it was having on American life and politics .
And the report turned out to sound like it came from the minutes of a " RACHEL MADDOW SHOW " editorial meeting 48 years too soon .
Check this out , " The cadre of the John Birch Society seems to be formed primarily of wealthy businessmen , retired military officers and little old ladies in tennis shoes . "
This is the actual California state government report on them .
It continues , " They are bound together by an obsessive fear of `communism , ` a word which they define to include any ideas differing from their own , even though these ideas may differ even more markedly from the ideas of Marx , Engels , Lenin , and Khrushchev . "
" In response to this fear , they are willing to give up large measures of the freedoms guaranteed them by the United States Constitution in favor of accepting the dictates of their founder .
They seek by fair means or foul to force the rest of us to follow their example .
They are pathetic . "
And if this TV show existed in 1961 , I can tell you , we would be trying to hire away whoever it was in the office of the California State Attorney General who was tasked with writing this report so that that person could work on this program .
It would be a natural fit .
This report went on to note some of the kookiest stuff about the John Birch Society , like accusing President Eisenhower of treason and the society`s founder saying that the U.S. had only a few short years left before we , quote , " became four separate provinces in a worldwide communist dominion ruled by police - state methods from the Kremlin . "
Only a few years left .
Remember when that happened ?
So the big question is why talk about the nonsense being spewed by these folks , either today or then ?
Back in 1961 , the California attorney general thought that it was worth it for this reason , quote , " The Birchers have an equal right with the prohibitionists , the vegetarians , the Republicans , the Democrats , or for that matter , with any Americans acting singly or in a group , to an expression of their views .
And no official , no matter how highly placed can say them nay .
In America , preposterousness prevents the acceptance , but not the expression of ideas . "
Isn`t that perfect ?
In America , preposterousness prevents the acceptance , but not the expression of ideas .
Exactly .
You have the right to say anything you want to say or espouse anything you want to espouse .
But we also have the right to report on it .
And if what you`re espousing is - we`re going to report that what you`re espousing is -.
In 1962 , the editor of the " Santa Barbara News Press " won the Pulitzer Prize for editorials that he wrote against the John Birch Society after his paper did an expose of that group`s disruptive would - be secretive efforts to find commies under every rock in Santa Barbara .
Thomas M. Stork wrote about his editorials and his local paper`s decision to give exposure to them by saying this , quote , " In the end , the only protection against such aberrations as the John Birch Society and such ridiculous leaders as Robert Welch lies in the informed good sense of the people .
Air the ideas of the radical extremists and you will find in a hurry , as we did in Santa Barbara , that the moderates - conservative and liberal - are in control . "
What`s happened on the far right fringe of American politics in 2009 has a lot of parallels to the paranoid tennis shoe tyrants that Thomas Stork won the Pulitzer for expose back in 1962 .
Calling people communists and socialists and Marxists , no matter what those people actually believed , just as a handy catchall insult .
The deliberate planned MO of disrupting public meetings , of preventing civil discourse , even the deliberate obfuscation of funding sources and the use of front groups , Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Works and all the Rick Berman front groups , they don`t disclose their funding today .
Back in the day , the John Birch Society was even proud about that .
They used to publish in their monthly bulletin at the time , quote , " We shall not go into any detailed accounting about the funds . "
These tactics don`t go away .
The fringe doesn`t go away in American politics .
American politics have always run all the way through the margins , right to the edge of the page and beyond .
We always have been like that as a country .
And bully for us .
2009 proved that as the Republican Party sought its path out of the political wilderness , the Republican Party was going to look to the right - wing fringe for help .
And we decided on this show to help America take a good look at that fringe .
And we have had a really good time doing it .
When then 85 - year - old Thomas Stork , the Pulitzer Prize winner , wrote about this 50 years ago , he captured my feelings about this exactly .
He said , quote , " Merely exposing such monstrous ideas , merely ventilating them in the public breeze is enough to bring sanity , and sometimes laughter , to be sure , into the discussion of political issues .
The absurdities fall of their own weight , or continue to be held dear by a minority so minute that it is more troublesome than dangerous . "
That`s the hope at least , right ?
It`s optimistic .
It`s born of a faith in the fundamental reasonableness of the vast majority of the American people .
In my case , it`s also born of the desire to have a really good time on television .

( on camera ) : Having Rick Scott as your spokesman against health care reform is like having an E. coli bacterium as your spokesman against hand washing .
When evil needs public relations , evil has Burson - Marsteller on speed dial .
I don`t want to help promote you , Tim .
I don`t .
I think what you`re doing is you`re getting fat , literally , financially fat on Americans` fears .
I`ve got to ask you , every single one of those ideas is insane to me .
I mean , the idea of the divorce mix you gave , for example , is insane to me .
You`ve described it as a factor that contributes to homosexuality desire , OK ?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : You`re taking it out of context , Rachel .
MADDOW : No , I`m reading it from your book , dude .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : I`m proud of the investigatory work that we have done on this show and the great producers and staff here who work their butts off that allow us to do it .
In 2010 , we`re going to keep shining a light on the preposterousness in our political mix because we think it`s the right thing to do for the country .
And because it`s really , really fun .
We hope you`ll keep enjoying it , too .
And we will be right back .
It will be harder to lie about your age or your poker hand after new research by the University of Melbourne , Australia has revealed that our eye position betrays the numbers we are thinking about .
In the study , participants were asked to state a series of random numbers .
By measuring their vertical and horizontal eye position , researchers were able to predict with reliable confidence the next chosen number - before it was spoken .
Specifically , a leftward and downward change in eye position announced that the next number would be smaller than the last .
Correspondingly , if the eyes changed position to the right and upward , it forecast that the next number would be larger .
The degree of eye movement reflected the size of the numerical shift .
The paper was published today online in the prestigious journal Current Biology .
First author , Dr Tobias Loetscher of the University of Melbourne 's School of Behavioural Sciences and previously of the Department of Neurology , University Hospital Zurich , Switzerland says the research demonstrates how the eyes and their position give insight into the nature of the systematic choices made by the brain 's random number generator .
" When we think of numbers we automatically code them in space , with smaller number falling to the left and larger numbers to the right .
That is , we think of them along a left - to - right oriented mental number line - often without even noticing this number - space association ourselves . "
" This study shows that shifts along the mental number line are accompanied by systematic eye movements .
We suggest that when we navigate through mental representations - as for example numbers - we re-use brain processes that primarily evolved for interacting and navigating in the outside world . "
Dr Michael Nicholls also of the School of Behavioural Sciences adds , " Clearly , the eyes not only allow us to see the world around us , but they also present a window to the working of our mind , as this study shows . "
" This study will hopefully provide a template to investigate how the human mind works via a connection with the space and world around us , " he says .
The study involved asking twelve right - handed men to select from a set of random numbers .
Paced by an electronic metronome they named 40 numbers between 1 and 30 in a sequence as random as possible .
For each number , the researchers measured the average eye position during the 500 millisecond interval before the numbers were stated .

Hi all , this is mostly in response to steev ’s query in my last post … been meaning to post this up for a while now .
CodeSourcery have done some excellent work maintaining the GNU toolchain for the ARM EABI target , among others .
They make their money selling and supporting precompiled versions for Win32/i386 and Linux / i386 , and do publish their sources for others to download .
That said , it is not easy to reproduce the toolchain using the supplied build script .
I think the idea is one is meant to purchase a prebuilt toolchain , which certainly has its advantages … and one should consider doing so anyway even if they get a homebrew one to work — just as a thank - you for providing the patched sources ( I would if I could ) … but there are numerous reasons why the prebuilt toolchains may not be ideal .
In my case , it happens to be that my host platform is Gentoo / MIPS running on my Yeeloong … I can run i386 code thanks to Bochs … very slowly .
( I also plan to do bare - iron i386 coding on the same machine … and yes , I ’ve installed a hand - built toolchain for that too . )
Native code however is far more favourable .
Disclaimer :
The methods and code presented here are in no way supported by myself , CodeSourcery , or Gentoo .
Some assistance may be sought on the CodeSourcery GNU - ARM mailing list , but in essence there ’s no warranty given whatsoever .
Okay , with that over with … the first thing to do is download CodeSourcery ’s sources .
Head over to the G++
Lite download page and select the latest release … then look for the source tarball .
It ’ll be big , in the order of 120MB .
Unpack this in a directory of your choice that ’s got plenty of space .
The sources are packaged Russian - doll style , that is compressed tarballs within an arm - RELEASE - arm - none - eabi directory .
In my case , I used release 2009q3 - 68 .
Now , in there is a build script …
Have a squiz at that , as there may be changes needed .
I ’ve tried to distill these into a Makefile which I have attached here .
Decompress it then drop it in the source build directory created when you unpacked the CodeSourcery source tarball .
Give it a quick check over , comparing it against the build script to ensure things have n’t changed too drastically … if parameters have changed in the build script , you ’ll need to change them in the Makefile .
In addition , the TARGET will need to match your desired toolchain target ( I used arm - stellaris - eabi ) and CS_VER , the version of CodeSourcery downloaded .
Some of the embedded packages may have changed version numbers too — these may need tweaking .
When happy , run make .
It should go ahead and build you a toolchain .
It ’ll get installed to whereever your PREFIX was set to .
Other tools of the trade :
The above gives you a working toolchain for compiling , and a command line debugger ( gdb ) .
Two additional tools that I find useful :
OpenOCD which is available in Gentoo as dev-util / openocd … will let you program and debug your application via JTAG .
… will let you program and debug your application via JTAG .
Insight debugger … a frontend to gdb .
The Gentoo ebuild is out of date , and it ’s a pain to write an ebuild for , as evidently the Insight team have never heard of DESTDIR .
( How do they write their RPM specs ? )
The latter is pretty straightforward to do by hand … just remember to use the same target as your toolchain .
Versions prior to 6.8 - 1 will fail to run on modern X .
This post covers a very important topic which is a new interest of mine .
Understanding how climate works is a series of layers , in this case DeWitt discovered some interesting discrepancies between atmospheric carbon models and measured results .

Where Has All the Carbon Gone ?
( Sung to the tune of Where Have All the Flowers Gone ? )
Introduction
I want to thank Harry ( comments # 22 # 39 in the Mike Hulme – Consensus Science thread ) for getting me started on this .
This was going to be a short post , but the more I thought about it , the more I needed to explain .
Carbon is going missing .
We know to a reasonable approximation how much carbon is being emitted to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuel and land use changes .
But the concentration in the atmosphere is n’t going up as fast as expected .
Where is it going and what will be the long term effect ?
I do n’t have the answer , but I ’ve learned some things by looking at the data that were n’t obvious in relation to what I ’ve previously read about the carbon cycle .
This is important , because any strategy for stabilization of atmospheric CO 2 is completely dependent on our understanding of the carbon cycle .
What is the carbon cycle ?
Carbon exists in various forms and reservoirs .
Many of these exchange carbon with each other at different rates .
The major reservoirs are , in no particular order , carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , carbonate rocks ( limestone and dolomite , e.g. ) dissolved inorganic carbon in surface water and the ocean ( carbonic acid , bicarbonate and carbonate ions and suspended calcium carbonate ) , fossil fuels ( various forms of coal , oil shale , tar sands , petroleum and natural gas ) and organic carbon in the biosphere on land and in the ocean .
The seasonal , annual and centennial scale exchanges between these reservoirs are components of the carbon cycle that are of interest .
Millennial scale or longer exchange times are too slow to be of interest for modeling the effect of fossil fuel combustion and land use changes on atmospheric carbon dioxide and its potential effect on climate .
IPCC Carbon Cycle Model
The IPCC AR4 WG1 report uses the following model of the carbon cycle to determine the effect of carbon emissions on atmospheric CO2 concentration :
The CO 2 response function used in this report is based on the revised version of the Bern Carbon cycle model used in Chapter 10 of this report ( Bern2.5CC ; Joos et al. 2001 ) using a background CO 2 concentration value of 378 ppm .
The decay of a pulse of CO 2 with time t is given by
ao = sum [ i = 1,2,3 ] ( ai e - t / Tau i ) —
Sorry for the nomenclature , my screen capture is n’t set up since the hd kicked the bucket – Jeff
Where a 0 = 0.217 , a 1 = 0.259 , a 2 = 0.338 , a 3 = 0.186 , τ 1 = 172.9 years , τ 2 = 18.51 years , and τ 3 = 1.186 years .
So what does that mean ?
There are three reservoirs other than the atmosphere where carbon can go .
They equilibrate at different rates .
At equilibrium after an addition of CO 2 , 21.7 % will remain in the atmosphere , 25.9 % will be in a reservoir with a time constant of 172.9 years , probably intermediate depth in the ocean , 33.8 % will be in a reservoir with a time constant of 18.51 years , probably the near surface ocean , and 18.6 % will be in a reservoir with a time constant of 1.186 years , probably the ocean surface layer .
I ’ll need to introduce the concept of a continuous flow stirred reactor to show how the math applies .
Take two tanks each containing 100 kg of water .
Each tank is well stirred .
If I replace 1 kg of water with 1 kg of sodium chloride in tank 1 , then the concentration of salt will be 1 % in tank 1 and 0 % in tank 2 .
Now I take 10 kg of solution from each tank and place it in the other .
The concentration of NaCl in tank 1 is 0.9 % and 0.1 % in tank 2 .
If I keep doing this once an hour , the concentration with time looks like this :
If I subtract the equilibrium concentration of 0.5 from the tank 1 results , I can fit the data with an exponential function .
That makes the equation describing the concentration with time in tank 1 equal to :
Or , to put the exponent in the same form as the IPCC equation , it would equal –t / 4.482 .
So the equation constant represents the ratio of the volumes of the tanks and the time constant is proportional to the residence time , a function of the flow rate between the two tanks and the volumes of the tanks .
If I continuously pump between the tanks at a flow rate of 10kg / hour , the time constant becomes equal to half the time necessary to completely replace the tank volume or 5 hours .
So the IPCC model has four tanks and the flows are only between tank 1 , the atmosphere , and each of the other tanks with no flow between the other tanks .
Does it work ?
Well , it turns out that there is test data available .
The Law Dome ice core has annual CO 2 concentration from 1832 to 1978 and Mauna Loa CO 2 data runs from 1959 to the present .
Total fossil fuel and cement production and land use CO 2 emissions data are also available from 1850 to 2005 .
I can treat each year as a separate pulse of CO2 and let it decay over time then sum the total concentration for each year .
I can use Trenberth ’s conversion factor for Mt carbon to ppmv CO 2 of 2130 MtC / ppmv .
Then I can plot the Law Dome and Mauna Loa data on the same graph using a secondary y axis to correct for the initial offset .
When I do that I get this graph :
I was quite surprised that the fit from 1850 to about 1940 was so good .
But then see what happens .
To show in more detail , I can subtract offset adjusted model concentration from the measured concentration here ;

Venezuela has made headlines recently in international media for alleged threats to freedom of expression , this time directed at the Internet .
But as in the past , many of these accusations against the Chavez administration that spread contagiously throughout mass media outlets and are tweeted and blogged in cyberspace at the speed of light , are just not true .
Press agencies and major world newspapers , such as the New York Times , El País and The Guardian , were quick to react to statements made by President Hugo Chavez two weeks ago regarding a website that had maliciously reported the murders of two prominent government figures .
“ Venezuela ’s Chavez calls for internet controls ” , headlined a Reuters release , which went on to claim that “ Chavez is angry with Venezuelan political opinion and gossip website NoticieroDigital , which he said had falsely written that Diosdado Cabello , a senior minister and close aide , had been assassinated ” .
By referring to Chavez ’s reaction to the website ’s dangerous and false reporting as a personal issue , i.e . “ Chavez is angry ” , Reuters downplayed and ridiculed very serious crimes : inciting violence and knowingly and maliciously reporting false information to further criminal acts .
Additionally , contrary to Reuters ’ brushing aside the content of the posts as something that President Chavez “ said ” , and therefore questioning the veracity of the charge , the Venezuelan website NoticieroDigital actually had posted false reports on Diosdado Cabello ’s assassination by armed attackers , alongside another post claiming that pro-Chavez television host Mario Silva had been “ gunned down ” the following day .
Both stories remained on the website for at least two days , and were only taken down after government supporters publicly denounced the website for the malicious posts .
The Internet Is Not A Free - for - All
President Chavez did state that “ the Internet can not be something open where anything is said and done ” , a notion shared by governments and societies around the world .
In the United States , controls on Internet content are frequent .
Content such as pornography is strictly regulated , and criminal acts or incitement to commit such acts is outright prohibited , even on blogs , chats and informal , anonymous forums .
In early 2009 , Steven Joseph Cristopher , a 42 year - old resident of Wisconsin , was arrested by the US Secret Service for threatening to assassinate President Obama in a chat forum on a website about UFOs and aliens .
Christopher was charged with violating a US law that prohibits threatening to kill a president or president - elect of the United States , carrying a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 USD fine .
In late December 2009 , President Obama named Howard Schmidt , a former White House security advisor to George W. Bush , as Cybersecurity Chief , to oversee Washington ’s Internet policies and regulations , as well as aid in the protection of US cyber assets .
The US Congress has also debated a law that would give the US President emergency control over the Internet and permit a seizure of “ private - sector networks ” during a so - called cybersecurity emergency .
That type of regulation goes well beyond what is presently being discussed in Venezuela .
At most , the Venezuelan government – legislative and executive branches alike – are debating extending current penal codes to cyberspace .
Rumors spread internationally , probably via twitter , which is used by more than 160,000 Venezuelan residents , that Venezuela ’s National Assembly was debating a law to regulate Internet content .
But members of the Venezuelan legislature were quick to deny those rumors and clarify that current laws should merely be applied to crimes committed over the Internet , as is common in most countries .
Germany has also been considering creating a government agency to specifically regulate and create policy regarding cyberspace , one of the most rapidly growing industries and business fields around the world .
Free , Universal Access to Internet
Dispelling critics and so - called international defenders of freedom of expression who claimed President Chavez was shutting down Venezuelans ’ access to Internet , the Venezuelan head of state declared on television on Sunday , “ A false rumor is spreading , and it ’s wrong , saying that we are going to limit Internet access , that we are going to control it .
It ’s false .
We have a central strategy and it ’s none other than transferring power to the people , and the first and most important power is knowledge ” .
In that context , President Chavez inaugurated twenty - four new infocenters last Sunday during his program , Alo Presidente , bringing the total to 668 nationwide .
He also approved more than $ 10 million USD for the creation of 200 more of these community - based free cybercenters to be built during 2010 .
Infocenters are a project of the Ministry of Science and Technology , and are government - sponsored and funded computer centers built in communities throughout the nation that provide free Internet and technological access and services to all Venezuelans .
Twenty - seven mobile Infocenters were also launched this week , which will travel across the nation to remote areas in the Amazon , Andean and rural regions , guaranteeing free Internet services and computer training to citizens with little or no access to technology .
At present , the infocenters have the capacity to provide Internet and computer services to more than 2.5 million permanent users and up to 10 million visitors annually .
The government ’s goal is to transfer the operations and administration of the infocenters to organized community groups , such as Community Councils , that can collectively determine the use and technological needs of their residents , neighborhoods and regions .
“ The transfer of the management and administration of the infocenters and technological spaces built by the Revolution will permit organized communities to collectively make decisions regarding the use of these spaces .
Our strategic objective is to advance the technological growth and communications access to aid in the creation of the communal state ” , explained President Chavez .
“ Technology will be assumed as a form of communication of the People ’s Power , to capacitate and articulate communities ” , added Chavez .
“ The people should have the responsibility to maintain and operate the infocenters and to conserve their equipment , as well as guarantee the functioning of each center ” said the Venezuelan President , emphasizing that the Internet is a “ tool of the Revolution ” and should aid in the creation and expansion of Venezuela ’s alternative press .
“ Each community can create a network and we can communicate with one another to inform each other of developments ” , exclaimed Chavez , also announcing the creation of his own blog .
“ I am starting my own battleground in the Internet with a blog .
It ’s going to be full of different information , and we will be ready for the bombardment of responses we will surely receive .
Even from the enemy , they will attack me with fire and I will respond .
Battle is battle , assault is assault ” , he warned .
Technology for the People
President Chavez also announced that in Venezuela , only 273,537 Internet subscribers existed in the year 2000 .
But by the first trimester of 2009 , more than 1,585,497 Internet subscribers were registered , an increase of 600 % .
“ And the number of Internet users in 2000 was only 820,000 in Venezuela .
Nine years later , that number has risen to 7,552,570 users , an increase of more than 900 % ” , indicated President Chavez .
In the year 2000 , only 3.4 % of the Venezuelan population had access to Internet , while statistics show that by the end of 2009 , 30 % of Venezuelans had Internet access , a huge increase in large part made possible by government programs .
The Infocenter project not only provides computers and Internet access to communities nationwide , but also trains users in computer literacy .
Brigades of computer and Internet educators , sponsored by the Science and Technology Ministry , have trained thousands of Venezuelans in the basics of computer usage , ranging from simply how to use a computer to advanced Internet searches and blogging .
Media Battleground – Internet as A Weapon
While the Venezuelan state has been empowering its own citizens to enter the world of cyberspace in a conscientious and responsible way , another government has been training and funding a select group of Venezuelans to destabilize their nation and promote regime change using the Internet as a weapon .
During the last few years , more than $ 7 million USD have been channeled from the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) to anti-Chavez youth and student groups in Venezuela to “ strengthen new media tools that can improve access to information and allow open and productive debate on the Internet ” .
Since 2002 , USAID has funded hundreds of opposition organizations and political parties in Venezuela with over $ 50 million USD in an ongoing effort to promote the overthrow of the Chavez administration .

The millions invested in Internet “ strengthening ” for opposition youth groups have accounted for the proliferation of anti-Chavez websites , blogs and propaganda online , aiding in the mass media offensive against the Venezuelan government .
New media tools such as Twitter and Facebook are also overridden with anti-Chavez users .
And it ’s no surprise .
In October 2009 , the US State Department sponsored the 2nd Annual Summit of the Alliance of Youth Movements ( AYM ) in Mexico City , bringing together the founders and representatives of new media companies , such as Twitter , Facebook , Youtube , Myspace , Google , Meetup and others , along with a selection of handpicked student and youth leaders from around the world .
Representatives from US government agencies , including the State Department , USAID , Freedom House , International Republican Institute ( IRI ) , National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) , Cato Institute , Cuba Development Initiative , and others , were also present at the event , which included a welcome speech from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
Forty - three young political activists funded by the State Department were brought to the AYM Summit from nations such as Sri Lanka , Colombia , Brazil , Saudi Arabia , Lebanon , Turkey , Moldovia , Malaysia , Mexico , Ecuador and Venezuela .
The Venezuelan attendees were Yon Goicochea , current leader of the ultra - conservative Primero Justicia party , and winner of Cato Institute ’s Milton Friedman Award for promoting neoliberal politics ; Geraldine Alvarez , member of Goicochea ’s foundation Futuro Presente , created with funding from US agencies ; and Rafael Delgado , another former student leader associated with the opposition .
The goal of the State Department event was to capacitate selected youth with the knowledge , technology and funding to promote “ Twitter Revolutions ” in their countries , citing the examples of Iran , Moldovia and the anti-FARC and anti-Chavez marches promoted in Colombia via Facebook and Twitter .
Balancing the Battleground
Nevertheless , pro-Chavez groups and activists in Venezuela are now flooding those same new media technologies used by Washington to promote the imperial agenda .
Facebook and Twitter accounts have recently been opened by prominent figures connected to the Bolivarian Revolution , and new blogs , websites and email lists are growing fast , in an attempt to gain ground in the information battlefield in cyberspace .
While the Internet is still dominated by those forces working to destabilize and discredit the Chavez administration and the Bolivarian Revolution , chavistas are catching up fast .
The hundreds of new infocenters throughout the nation , guaranteeing free access to all Venezuelans , will enable millions to share their stories and voices – previously ignored and invisible – with the international community .
A blog written by President Hugo Chavez himself will surely serve as major ammunition for the Bolivarian Revolution and counteract many of the lies and myths spread about him and his government around the world .
Listening to music properly has a lot to do with having the right environment .
A place that ’s all your own .
I like the warm glow from the perfect level of indirect , low lighting .
I want to be surrounded by my favorite things to look at .
And I long for seating that you just melt into and disappear in .
And another thing– I love my iPod as much as the next guy– but sometimes there are those moments when you need to break out the turntable and throw on some old records .
The warm hiss and crackle of needle on vinyl is like hearing your mother ’s voice in the womb .
Which is what a man cave really is– a dark , personal , intimate womb .
When we first moved to New Jersey , we bought a great old Dutch Colonial home previously owned by an Italian family – the guy ’s name was Nick .
The basement he built - out was the clincher .
It was like a retro 60s gentleman ’s club– red and black lacquer paneled walls , mirrors , a full bar with turntable , and even a pool table which they were good enough to leave behind .
I ’ll never forget the two framed portraits hanging side by side behind the bar– The Pope & Frank Sinatra .
Welcome to Jersey – I loved it .
I spent many an evening down there with lights down low , the sound of billiard balls slamming hard into a corner pocket , always perfect tunes in the background , and a cold one .
Now I ’m in a house with no man cave and going insane …

Also , if you have not heard about about the role Steve Benen played in keeping HCR momentum alive after the Brown panic , take a minute to read Andrew Sabl ’s write - up here at SameFacts .
In fact if anything Sabl ’s piece , which does not mention the influential strategy memo that Benen wrote , understates the contribution that Benen made .
Staffers have told me that Benen ’s memo crossed the desk of a number of influential Representatives , so it is perhaps not a coincidence that the memo eerily predicted the pass - and - amend strategy that Pelosi successfully adopted .
Major kudos to Steve .
I knew I had to make a comic about Ubisoft 's astounding new supremacy in the world of Obviously Horrible Ideas .
Their mastery of this is now absolute .
You can look at Daikatana and see that there was the possibility that this could have been a good game .
There was doubt , at some point before release .
But you could see the Ubisoft failure coming from miles away .
Ion Storm attempted to set the world record at diving and failed when they smacked their face off the diving board .
Ubisoft set out to hit their face on the diving board , and succeeded .
It was frightening and yet somehow awe - inspiring to watch them march off of this conceptual cliff with such steadfast confidence .
It 's like a menacing and Kafkaesque version of the Emperor 's New Clothes where all of the people are screaming , " Dude , you are naked ! " to the heedless king .
The lemming comparison ceases to be adequate .
Lemmings go over cliffs because they are oblivious .
Ubisoft went over this cliff because they decided that going over a cliff was a now a core part of their business plan .
I struggled with this comic for a long time .
I eventually realized I would n't be able to make fun of this in any traditional way because Ubisoft was already a joke .

Beck on Brown : ' Could end with a dead intern '
Glenn Beck took serious exception to Scott Brown 's cringe - inducing announcement that his daughters were " available " in the middle of an otherwise well - received victory speech .
“ Bad enough , ” said Beck on his radio show after playing Brown 's initial comment .
“ Hey. my two daughters on the meat market ! ”
If Beck had said that , his daughters would “ never have spoken to me again , ” he said , and his wife would have left a " collection of my parts in drawers scattered throughout my house . ”
“ I want a chastity belt on this man , ” he said , after mentioning Brown 's Cosmo spread .
“ I want his every move watched in Washington .
I do n’t trust this guy .
...
This one could end with a dead intern .
I ’m just saying , it could end with a dead intern . ”
UPDATE : Fellow talker Mark Levin calls
Beck 's riff " very weird . "

One of my pet peeves with Paul Krugman is his constant rewriting of history , a rewriting that just happens to coincide with left - wing political talking points .
For example , we hear that the Great Depression occurred because Herbert Hoover was a staunch believer in laissez - faire and took the advice of Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon , who called for liquidation of bad assets to " purge " the economy of whatever was " rotten " in the system .
However , even a cursory reading of the history demonstrates that Hoover openly rejected Mellon 's advice and tried stimulus after stimulus , only to see the economy crumble .
( Krugman 's response is always the same : Hoover tried " too little , too late . "
So , whenever any so - called stimulus does not work , the standard Krugman - Keynesian response is that the stimulus was " too small . " )
Thus , he takes issue with a paper by Alberto F. Alesina and Silvia Ardagna in which the authors claim that tax cuts , as opposed to increases in government spending , provide a better " stimulus " for a moribund economy .
Of course , the issue at hand ultimately is not " stimulus " at all ; it is the presence of malinvestments , which must be liquidated in order for the economy to recover .
Krugman , however , goes on to criticize the paper on two points :
the presence of a " liquidity trap " in which monetary expansion by the central bank can no longer " stimulate " anything , and the record of Japan 's expansionary policy during its decade - long recession of the 1990s .
Let me begin with the " liquidity trap " arguments .
Murray Rothbard , in his classic America 's Great Depression , devastates the Keynesian " liquidity trap " :
The Keynesians are here misled by their superficial treatment of the interest rate as simply the price of loan contracts .
The crucial interest rate , as we have indicated , is the natural rate — the " profit spread " on the market .
Since loans are simply a form of investment , the rate on loans is but a pale reflection of the natural rate .
Keep in mind that Keynesians hold that " real rates " do n't mean much , just as Keynes advocated inflation to cut real wages as a means to increase employment .
His response was to declare that workers are only interested " in their money wage . "
History tells us something different , does it not ?
On the Japanese recession , Krugman differs with Alesina and Ardagna on the timing and forcefulness of the government 's " stimulus " actions :
They use a statistical method to identify fiscal expansions — trying to identify large changes in the structural balance .
But how well does that technique work ?
When I want to think about Japan , I go to the work of Adam Posen , who tells me that Japan 's only really serious stimulus plan came in 1995 .
So I turn to the appendix table in Alesina / Ardagna , and find that 1995 is n't there — whereas 2005 and 2007 , which I 've never heard of as stimulus years , are .
However , as Doug French recently wrote , the Japanese government took a number of spending and interest - rate - cutting actions during the 1990s , none of which worked .
True to form , Krugman claimed several years ago that had Japan 's government not engaged in such actions , the Japanese economy would have fallen into depression — this is another of the " Heads I win , tails you lose " propositions we often see from Krugman .
" Whenever any so - called stimulus does not work , the standard Krugman - Keynesian response is that the stimulus was ' too small ' . "
Interestingly , Krugman has always approached the Japanese recession as having come from Japan 's high savings rate or simply out of nowhere .
French , however , notes that Japan had a huge and unsustainable boom that turned into a stock and real - estate bubble , which in turn popped :
For a brief moment in 1990 , the Japanese stock market was bigger than the US market .
The Nikkei - 225 reached a peak of 38,916 in December of 1989 with a price - earnings ratio of around 80 times .
At the bubble 's height , the capitalized value of the Tokyo Stock Exchange stood at 42 percent of the entire world 's stock - market value and Japanese real estate accounted for half the value of all land on earth , while only representing less than 3 percent of the total area .
In 1989 all of Japan 's real estate was valued at US $ 24 trillion which was four times the value of all real estate in the United States , despite Japan having just half the population and 60 percent of US GDP .
Bubbles , as we have seen , result from deliberate " expansionary " policies by government authorities , yet Krugman always seems to treat them as being solely the products of private enterprise .
It never occurs to him that the policies of high leverage and of gambling on inflated asset values would not happen systematically if government were not acting behind the scenes .
Instead , he tells us that the only thing that can rescue a financial system is a new round of government regulations .
BRUSSELS ( AP )  Russia 's envoy to NATO has sharply criticized the alliance 's shift away from fighting drug trafficking in Afghanistan , saying the resulting surge in heroin smuggling is endangering Russia 's national security .
In an interview late Thursday , Dmitry Rogozin also highlighted the lack of cohesion within NATO , saying Moscow is worried about declining public support in Europe for the war .
" ( Russia ) is losing 30,000 lives a year to the Afghan drug trade , and a million people are addicts , " Rogozin said .
" This is an undeclared war against our country . "
" We are obviously very dissatisfied with the lack of attention from NATO and the United States to our complaints about this problem . "
For years , the allies tried to eradicate poppy crops , but that resulted in a boost to the insurgency as impoverished poppy farmers joined the Taliban .
Gen . Stanley McChrystal 's new policy of trying to win the support of the population means that these farmers are now left alone , enabling them to tend crops that produce 90 % of the world 's heroin .
Russia says that drug production in Afghanistan has increased tenfold since the U.S. - led invasion that ousted the Taliban regime in 2001 .
Smugglers freely transport Afghan heroin and opium north into Central Asia and Russia , and also on to Western Europe .
Rogozin pointed to Washington 's inconsistency in its attitude to international drug trafficking saying that in contrast to Afghanistan , it was waging a drug war in Colombia because that was the primary source of cocaine that goes to America .
" But in the case of the heroin which goes to Russia , they are doing practically nothing , " he said .
" This is not how you treat your friends and partners . "
NATO spokesman James Appathurai said the alliance understands Russian concerns , and that the problem affects Europe as well .
The most important part of solving the drug trade was helping to defeat the insurgency , and NATO has 120,000 troops trying to do just that , he said .
Appathurai noted that the U.N. cites the Marjah region , where NATO has just completed a large - scale offensive , as one of the world 's foremost opium - producing areas .
" By helping re-establish government control there , we are making a substantial contribution to the counter - narcotics effort , " he said .
" We would welcome increased support from Russia for our overall effort and ( NATO ) has made very specific requests to Moscow which they are considering , " Appathurai said .
Russia contributes logistical support for NATO - and U.S. - led operations by providing a vital land and air transit corridor for the shipment of supplies to the international force .
It also services Soviet helicopters and organizes training for the Afghan anti-drug police .
But Moscow has always ruled out sending ground troops .
During the Cold War , the Soviets provided military support for the secular Afghan government , and sent over 100,000 troops to defend it against religious fundamentalists being financed by the United States , Saudi Arabia , Britain , and other Western nations .
More than 9,000 Soviet soldiers were killed in the 10 - year war in the 1980s .
" Today we are helping them fight the same fanatics whom they supported against us 20 years ago , " Rogozin noted .
He expressed concern over weakening support for the nine - year war from America 's European allies , " who ended up in Afghanistan without really knowing what they were doing there . "
" The result is falling public commitment to the war , " he said .
Last month , the Dutch government collapsed because it tried to comply with a NATO request to keep its 2,000 - strong contingent in Afghanistan .
The Dutch crisis , and growing public opposition in other European countries to further involvement in Afghanistan , has sparked fears that other NATO nations might also pull out their troops .
" NATO is still dominated by the United States , and European allies still fall in line just to keep the alliance going , ( by ) participating in U.S. - initiated military adventures , even though their national interests in doing so are far from clear , " said Ian Buruma , a professor of democracy at Bard College in New York .
" It is hard to see how this can continue for much longer . "

Later this year , Intel will introduce its Light Peak fiber optic link , in a bid to replace U.S.B. and other electrical cables that now connect computers with digital cameras , music players , smartphones and dozens of other devices , said Jason Ziller , Intel ’s director for the optical input - output program office .
Light Peak optical cable technology , which includes computer chips and miniature lasers , will be available to manufacturers later this year , he said , for installation in products next year .
Prices are not yet available from Intel .
Image Optical boosts :

The first version of the optical cable will transmit 10 gigabits per second of data both ways , and is expected to scale to 100 gigabits a second in the next decade , Mr. Ziller said .
By contrast , the high - bandwidth U.S.B. 2.0 cables now in wide use have a rate of 480 megabits a second .
The new U.S.B. 3.0 specification now in development has a theoretical maximum data rate of up to 5 gigabits a second , said Richard Brown , vice president for marketing at VIA Technologies , a semiconductor design house in Taiwan that is using the U.S.B. 3.0 standard in two new chips .
He said the chips would soon be available in consumer products .
Optics may also get a boost from new technology that is still in the laboratory and is intended to integrate lasers directly into silicon chips as they are manufactured .
Typically , lasers must be either packaged separately , or grafted onto a chip after it is formed , a relatively expensive procedure .
But at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , a research group has achieved a breakthrough , creating lasers directly on silicon chips as part of their manufacturing , said Lionel C. Kimerling , a professor of materials science and engineering and director of the MIT Microphotonics Center .
Dr. Kimerling and colleagues , including Jurgen Michel and Jifeng Liu , have developed and demonstrated lasers made from germanium , a material used in advanced silicon chip manufacturing processes .
Chips are made in layers , and the germanium lasers are built into the chip during the layering process .

Overpopulation occurs when an area is populated too heavily for the available resources and the capacity of the environment .
When an area is overpopulated , its population cannot be maintained without destroying nonrenewable resources and without affecting the carrying capacity of the environment ( the earth 's ability to support current and future inhabitants ) .
The US is the only major industrialized country still growing , and we show no signs of stopping .
The Census shows we grew by thirteen percent between 1990 and 2000 - and by 83 percent the last fifty years !
You can see evidence of the problem all around you - vanishing open spaces , water and energy shortages , soil erosion , and air pollution , as well as overcrowded schools , urban sprawl , and traffic congestion .
At 292 million Americans , we 're already well over our carrying capacity , and Census projections say we could grow to over 400 million by 2050 - that 's another 100 million people to feed , clothe , educate , and house .
Overpopulation is indeed a problem around the globe , but population issues must be solved at the national level , as global agreements are largely unenforceable and fail to recognize the unique history , customs , and challenges of each country .
From an environmental standpoint , US overpopulation is far worse for the environment than overpopulation anywhere else , because of our inordinately high use of resources .
And of course , we have the most power to effect change right here at home .
NPG has surveyed scientists over thirty years and asked :
What 's the optimum population size before you start exceeding an area 's carrying capacity and harming the environment ?
The scientific consensus is that 150 to 200 million is the ideal population size for the United States .
That 's about the size of the US fifty years ago .
Considering food production , the load that human activities are imposing on the biosphere , global warming , chemicals and pollution , labor and wages , issues of social equity , and the problems of crowding , disease , and misery , NPG believes that a world population size of two to three billion would be optimal .
People need more land than just the land they 're standing on - they need land for raising food , producing their oil and water , recreation and entertainment , shopping , transportation , waste handling , and much more .
And overpopulation is n't about how many people you can jam into a given area ; it 's about what the optimum population size is before you start destroying resources and quality of life .
Although an increase of one percent may sound small , such a rate is monumental when talking about a population the size of the United States .
A one percent increase means 2.9 million new people in a year and 29 million in a decade .
You 're thinking of Europe and Japan , which comprise a very small fraction of world population - about fourteen percent .
There , fertility decline is leading to a reversal of population growth .
This offers those countries the opportunity to decide what population size is best for them .
If they decide a larger size is better suited for them , they can raise their fertility back to replacement level or increase immigration .
Worldwide , however , population is still rising quickly .
The United Nation 's medium projection is for an increase of more than fifty percent by 2050 .
Population growth benefits business interests , since it means more development .
But as an area becomes more populated , its infrastructure starts straining under the weight of all the new people who must be served .
Police forces , roads , and schools no longer satisfy the demands of a growing population .
Farmland and forests are sacrificed to strip malls and housing developments .
And as more and more schools , sanitary systems , roads , libraries , and water services must be built , eventually growth no longer lowers the average cost of services , but instead raises it .
When this point is reached , growth increases the tax burden on communities ; the revenue brought in by new growth is outweighed by the costs it creates .
Meanwhile , congestion increases , schools become more crowded , and pollution levels rise .
There is no denying that Social Security 's viability requires some tough decisions .
But adding scores of millions of new workers would at best postpone , not solve , the Social Security problem - and at an enormous cost in resource depletion and environmental damage .
Rather , we should see the aging of America as an opportunity to begin transitioning to sustainability .
In order to produce the greater and greater quantities of food needed to satisfy an expanding population , our lands have been deforested and overgrazed and our soil eroded .
And do n't forget the quality of life issues associated with population growth : more pollution , more sprawl , tighter housing markets , overcrowded schools , traffic congestion , and vanishing open spaces .
Three factors influence population : births , deaths , and migration .
We can reduce population by lowering our fertility rate ( the average number of children per woman ) and reducing immigration .
If almost all women had no more than two children , our fertility rate would drop to 1.5 , because many women choose to have just one or none .
Immigration levels are currently over one million a year - five times traditional averages - and should be returned to more traditional levels of 100,000 to 200,000 annually .
We believe people should be educated about how overpopulation affects the environment and everyone 's quality of life and have access to family planning , and then - on their own - make responsible family planning decisions .
We could achieve a smaller , more sustainable fertility rate through a combination of social leadership , non-coercive incentives to stop at one or two children ( such as tax incentives ) , free access to family planning education and contraceptives to anyone who wants it , and education .
Studies show that as education level goes up , fertility ( particularly early fertility ) goes down .
We believe that anyone who wants it should have access to family planning education and contraceptives .
It 's essential that we raise awareness about family planning and not allow taboos to prevent open discussion about issues so vital to our nation 's health .
We support Roe versus Wade and subsequent Supreme Court interpretations that affirm but limit women 's right to abortion and protect the fetus if it has arrived at a viable stage .
There is still a debate about regulating human fertility , because those who oppose it have not yet come to understand what the theory of evolution tells us about human behavior .
Charles Darwin had a titanic role in the history of human thought .
Out of his observations of finches in the Galapagos Islands came the theory of evolution , which explained things that had never been explainable before about population .
All successful species , he said , have the ability to bear more young than their environment can support .
This enables species to recover from food - short periods and it enables the best adapted to expand and fill new environmental niches when the opportunity presents .
It also leads to overpopulation .
The successful survive .
The others die off .
That excess fecundity is central to the population dynamics of living creatures .
It was true of human populations until we learned to practice fertility regulation by family planning .
Like other animals , our population growth was limited by high mortality , particularly of the young .
Medical and public health advances , sanitation and the growth of agricultural yields saved us for a time from that fate , but the process goes on .
As human populations continue to grow , they are meeting those limits .
The Darwinian controls , imposed in part by our destruction of the ecosystem , will stop the growth .
Seen in that light , family planning is perhaps the most fundamental advance in the human condition .
It permits the human species to control its growth by regulating fertility , rather than waiting for the control to come from misery and rising mortality .
Family planning is not just something that we are entitled to practice for our own purposes .
It is something that the Earth itself badly needs , to escape the damage of continued human population growth .
It is essential to the preservation of ecological balance in the face of a species grown far too successful .
Within our species , it is desperately needed by the poor and fertile of the world so they can escape the evolutionary curse of excess fecundity and so their children will not be trapped in high mortality .
Such foresight is good in theory , but it may not be sufficient in practice .
The common good is probably the last thing on people 's minds when they are making love , and abortion may be necessary , for the good of the woman and of society , when contraception is not practiced .
In the United States , there is one induced abortion for every three live births .
If many of those pregnancies had come to term , fertility and population growth would be much higher than they are .
Without legal abortions , there would be ( 1 ) more illegal abortions , which are usually septic and dangerous , and ( 2 ) more unwanted children , many of them presumably to single mothers less responsible than other women - and they are hardly ideal parents .
Abortion is the least attractive means of managing birth rates .
It has been declining with the widespread availability of contraceptive techniques .
It would probably decline further if the other measures were in effect - including over - the - counter availability of morning after pills .
The medical profession , including the scientific advisory council to the Food and Drug Administration , has recommended that they be made available , but the FDA has deferred a decision .
The very idea of family planning is not very old , and the idea of tying it to social ends is a new one in human experience .
We are far from knowing how to do it .
Until we have learned , abortion plays a role as the final resort for women who do n't want children or can't raise them .
And Roe versus
Wade provides the legal framework to reconcile it with other societal goals .
Despite technological advancements , human numbers will ultimately overwhelm our ecosystems .
We will eventually run out of finite resources , such as space and water .
Even the CIA has weighed in on the issue , predicting in its " Global Trends 2015 " report that parts of the US will experience water shortages by 2015 {*} .
The report stated that water conservation , expanded use of desalinization , developing genetically modified crops that use less water or more saline water , and importing water " will not be sufficient to substantially change the outlook for water shortages in 2015 " .{*} http://fas.org/irp/cia/product/globaltrends2015/index.html
Increasing our population means increasing consumption .
Every new person consumes resources , takes up space , and disposes of waste products .
Even if we can reduce consumption by half , no progress can be achieved if we allow the population to double .
Rather than packing more and more people into more and more crowded areas , we need to tackle the problem at its source : an ever - growing population .
When populations continue to expand , communities must find places to house , educate , and employ new residents and thus , even the best - intentioned smart growth efforts will eventually run up against population pressures .
From the earth 's perspective , population growth is particularly significant in the affluent US , where even the environmentally conscious have levels of consumption far exceeding the rest of the world .
The US has five percent of the world 's population but consumes 25 percent of its resources .
When immigrants come here , they adopt our lifestyle and ultimately have a far worse impact on the earth than they would have had in their home country .
Immigration levels today are far higher than traditional levels ; in the mid 1950s , our immigration was less than one - third what it is today .
Additionally , the US today is a very different country than in years past .
We 've settled the last frontiers and open space is no longer a commodity .
Further population growth now means diminishing farmlands and otherwise harming our environment .
Immigration , as it relates to population , is not a racial issue ; it 's about numbers , not race , ethnicity or skin color .
It is not racist to consider what doubling or tripling our population would require of our resources and environment .
NPG condemns racism in all its forms .
But we also condemn taboos that prevent open , honest public discussion about issues so vital to all of us .
With two - thirds of our population growth a direct result of immigration , the American people deserve some say in whether this kind of staggering increase is desirable .
Immigration policy must be designed within the framework of overall US population goals .

Arctic reindeer live in the near perpetual night and then endless daytime that seasonally occur at the top of the world .
These extreme conditions seem to have led the reindeer to abandon the internal clocks that drive the daily biological rhythms of mammals at lower latitudes , a new study finds .
In mammals , including humans , some hormone levels rise and ebb on a rhythmic daily cycle .
This circadian rhythm influences various processes in the body , from the sleep / wake cycle to reproduction .
The light - dark signals of day and night help drive these cycles , as does an internal body clock that works on a 24 - hour cycle even in the absence of a light - dark switch .
But in reindeer , “ it is this clock element that seems to be missing , " said study author Andrew Loudon of the University of Manchester in England , referring to the internal ticker .
The missing clock does n't have any effect on the sleep patterns of the reindeer , as they sleep after they eat , and tend to eat some 8 to 10 times a day , as is the case for all ruminant animals .
Loudon and his colleagues looked at levels of melatonin ( a hormone that responds to the circadian cycle ) in Arctic reindeer and found that they showed no natural internal rhythm of melatonin secretion .
Instead , their hormone levels rise and fall in direct response to light and dark .
And studies of reindeer skin cells showed that two well - known clock genes do n't oscillate the way they do in other organisms as a way of keeping time .
" We suspect that they have the full range of normal clock genes , but these are regulated in a different way in reindeer , " Loudon said .
The findings of the study , detailed online on March 11 in the journal Current Biology , initially came as a surprise , but the researchers now suspect that similar patterns could be seen in other Arctic animals .
" Our findings imply that evolution has come up with a means of switching off the cellular clockwork , " Loudon said .
" Such daily clocks may be positively a hindrance in environments where there is no reliable light - dark cycle for much of the year . "
Because the Earth is tilted on its axis , the Arctic is pointed toward the sun during the summer months , which keeps the sun perpetually above the horizon during this time .
During the winter , the opposite is true , and the Arctic is plunged into months of darkness .
The same is true of the Antarctic .
Instead , light and dark signals that come during the year 's two equinoxes ( fall and spring ) could be enough to jumpstart certain processes in the reindeer , such as the annual reproductive cycle , the researchers say .
Just how many body processes are affected by this unusual development is n't certain .
" We do not know how extensive the loss of clockwork is in reindeer , " Loudon told LiveScience .
" There may still be a clock in there ticking away , but we have not been able to find it .
It looks like the molecular clock is switched off at least in skin cells ( and frankly I suspect elsewhere as well ) . "

After Sunday Justice left the Air Force , he returned to the valley , where , he said , he met a hardened Mark Owens .
At first , he said , “ Mark was interested in science . ”
But over time his focus changed .
“ He was very angry with poaching .
He loves the elephants , so all the killing made him very upset . ”
As Mark Owens assumed more authority over the valley and the game scouts , he extended his campaign against poachers beyond the borders of the national park .
The Owenses now had a Bell helicopter as well as the Cessna , and the scouts were highly mobile , thanks to trucks provided to them by the Owenses ’ conservation project .
In “ The Eye of the Elephant , ” Delia described the first of a regular series of “ village sweeps ” : “ The scouts raid villages all night — bursting into poachers ’ huts while they sleep — and drive back to Mano in the morning , their truck loaded with suspects . ”
The Owenses at one point asked the U.S. government to provide financial support for their village sweeps .
In a proposal for funding submitted to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1994 , they described their tactics : “ Wildlife officers sweep into villages at night to seize poachers and their weapons before they can be used to kill elephants .
More than fifty firearms were confiscated during a single sweep in August of 1993 . ”
The proposal , which was unsuccessful , also refers to “ Airborne Quick Response and Special Unit Scouts ( trained in paramilitary tactics and to work with aircraft ) . ”
“ The Eye of the Elephant ” does not provide many details about these raids , but , in villages around the park , residents told me that the scouts beat men they suspected of poaching .
In a village near Mpika called Chita , residents awoke one night to the sound of truck engines .
Scouts swarmed the village .
They were armed with rifles .
One villager , who asked to be identified only as Mutolo , described what happened : “ The scouts took the men to one side of the village and they began to beat the ones they said were poachers .
They beat them hard with their hands and rifles . ”
Some of the villagers told me that scouts turned their houses upside down , searching under beds and sleeping mats for weapons and in the rafters for dried meat .
( It is against the law in Zambia to raid a house without a warrant , but the villagers I spoke with said the scouts offered no documents that would have justified the raid . )
Another witness , Agatha Chipole , said that her son was among the men the scouts were looking for .
She admitted that he had poached in the North Luangwa park , but only to provide meat for his family .
One man , who also asked not to be identified , said , “ Two scouts held me up and a third one hit me in my penis area with his rifle .
They were asking me , ‘ Where are the guns ? ’ ” The villagers I interviewed said the scouts collected between ten and fifteen weapons that night .
Four men , a villager told me , were taken to the hospital in Mpika for treatment after the raid .
The Owenses have denied harming poachers , or encouraging scouts to do so .
Mary Dykes , of the Owens Foundation , wrote , “ Had the Owenses adopted any policy that supported the abuse of poachers and poaching suspects , the many villages and their tribal leaders , not to mention corrupt officials needing an excuse to get rid of them , would have immediately had them arrested . ”
But many scouts told me that poachers captured in the park , often local residents who were working as meat carriers , were taken to the Mano compound , or on occasion to Marula - Puku , for detention and questioning .
One man , who described himself as an Owens scout and asked to be identified only as Mvulu , said that prisoners were sometimes brought to Marula - Puku , tied to a stake , and left out in the sun .
“ We would make them understand that poaching was not a good job for them , ” he said .
Another scout who worked in the park in this period , Henry Kampamba , said , “ Mark Owens told us that anyone with meat or a weapon should have a beating . ”
In interviews , scouts who say they once reported to Mark Owens , as well as former employees of the Owenses ’ North Luangwa Conservation Project , defended the tactics used to suppress poaching .
I asked Mutale Kasokola , who is depicted in “ The Eye of the Elephant ” firing cherry bombs at poachers , if he thought the rough methods were justified .
“ These poachers were very bad , ” he said .
“ They were very dangerous people .
They had to be stopped .
Mark Owens said we had to do anything to stop them , or else the elephants would all die . ”
In letters and e-mails to me , the Owenses and their advocates argued that Mark Owens ’s militant persona in Zambia — as portrayed in “ The Eye of the Elephant ” and in the ABC documentary — was simply a performance designed to make poachers believe that he was dangerous .
Owens says that during his cherry - bomb campaign he spread rumors in the valley that he was firing live ammunition .
“ I actively promoted the idea that these were more than firecrackers , with people I know who would leak this information to the poaching community , ” he said .
“ I wanted them to think that these were RPGs or something more formidable because I thought we were on the verge of being killed . ”
But Kasokola , who described the Owenses as generous benefactors , told me that on occasion scouts fired live ammunition .
“ We only threw cherry bombs on the poachers from the airplane , ” he said .
“ When we got the helicopter , the scouts would fire bullets at the poachers from the helicopter . ”
He explained , “ The poachers had AK - 47s and would fire at the plane and the helicopter . ”
The Owenses also denied that poachers were held under arrest or questioned at Marula - Puku , or that anyone was tied to a stake in the sun or beaten .
In a letter to me , Donald Zachary , one of their attorneys , wrote , “ Scouts occasionally passed through or near their camp with captured poachers , and they would stop for water or a brief rest . ”
During those times , the scouts would handcuff prisoners to a tree , but only for a few minutes and “ in the shade . ”
But another former employee of the Owenses , Hammer Simwinga , who now heads a community - development program in Mpika , said that on occasion captured poachers were held temporarily in a small building in Marula - Puku , where , he said , scouts would “ get information about who was coming into the park . ”
In his view , the antipoaching techniques of the scouts were necessary , even if they sometimes became “ rough . ”
“ The important thing is to extract information , ” Simwinga said .
And though the scouts ’ work could cause controversy , “ there is sympathy for the methods because they worked . ”
He said he heard of villagers having disappeared inside the park , but had no knowledge of killings .
Simwinga later recanted much of what he had told me , and in an e-mail to Mark Owens , whom he refers to as “ Dad , ” he promised his continued support .
Like other supporters of the Owenses , Simwinga said that the couple ’s achievements in the valley — the introduction of effective tactics to wildlife protection , and the projects in the villages that brought health care to people who previously had none — outweighed whatever harm may have come to subsistence poachers and their families .
In an e-mail to a Zambian critic of the Owenses , Alexandra Fuller wrote , “ Yes , people went missing while poaching when the Owenses were in Zambia and they still do — why do you think the Owenses have become a scapegoat for this ?
Poaching is , was and always will be a risky business . ”
She went on , “ It ’s a high - risk game and the Owenses cannot possibly take the heat for all the bodies left in that valley ! ”
Fuller told me that she had investigated the various allegations against the Owenses while writing an article about Zambia , which was published in National Geographic in 2005 , and had been unable to substantiate any of them .
The Owenses , through their attorneys , said that Mark Owens could not be responsible for what the scouts did , because he did not command them .
“ Once Mark transported the scouts to a poaching area , he flew away , ” Zachary wrote .
“ What the scouts did on the ground with poachers was simply not Mark ’s business . ”
Neither Mark Owens nor anyone associated with his project , they said , “ ever recruited , commanded or paid salaries to any government game scout . ”
Malcolm Boulton , who worked for the North Luangwa Conservation Project , largely in the Mpika office , also says that Mark did not lead the scouts .
But scouts I spoke to in a number of villages in the Luangwa Valley told me that Mark Owens had clearly been their commander .
And in “ The Eye of the Elephant ” Delia Owens wrote , of the scouts , “ Mark creates special units for those who perform well , and they are issued extra equipment — new guns , jungle knives , binoculars , compasses . ”
Mark writes that though he would prefer not to assert his rank , “ I have full authority over the scouts . ”
In a scene from Maryanne Vollers ’s Sports Illustrated profile of the Owenses , Mark spots a poaching camp from the air .
“ Mark spends the next days orchestrating a manhunt , ” she wrote .
“ He dispatches two patrols of eight scouts apiece to the site of the poachers ’ camp .
The scouts capture three poachers , but the main gang splits up and heads for the escarpment .
Mark radios headquarters to set up ambushes along the exit routes from the park , but it is too late . ”
On my three trips to North Luangwa , I made several visits to the Mano camp and interviewed a dozen veteran scouts about Mark Owens .
They were complimentary , in part because the Owenses had outfitted them with superior equipment and rations .
John Chibeza , an Owens scout , told me his fellow - scouts felt that they were élite soldiers .
“ He would call us shock troops , ” Chibeza said .
“ The other scouts were jealous of us because Mark Owens was our commander .
He was an expert in combat . ”
( Chibeza retracted this after speaking with Hammer Simwinga . )
Although Owens did not serve in the U.S. military , several of the scouts I interviewed believed that he was a Vietnam veteran ; in the “ Turning Point ” documentary , Owens says , in reference to North Luangwa ’s troubles , “ Frankly , it reminds me of — a little bit of Vietnam . ”
P. J. Fouche , the hunter who manages a concession on the edge of the park , told me that scouts would salute Owens when he appeared .
“ Something happened to him over the years , ” Fouche said .
“ He would be more threatening in person .
He was always armed , and he always seemed ready to fight . ”
Fouche and Owens were once allies in the fight against poachers , but fell out over what Fouche said were disagreements about tactics .
The Owenses maintain that Fouche was upset with them because their U.S. Fish and Wildlife grant application competed with his .
“ They thought they were kings , ” Fouche said of the Owenses .
“ He made himself the law , and his law was that he could do anything he wanted . ”
Fouche said that , before his disagreement with Mark Owens , scouts under Owens ’s command would patrol Fouche ’s concession .
I asked him if the scouts killed suspected poachers in his area .
“ Of course , ” Fouche said .
“ Did Mark Owens know that the scouts were killing people ? ” I asked .
Fouche handed me a letter that he said Owens had faxed him in 1994 .
It was written in part as a plea to Fouche to help raise funds for the Owenses ’ project , and it listed some of Mark Owens ’s antipoaching accomplishments .
“ To date I have flown eight airborne antipoaching operations over your area , including four in which I inserted scouts on ambush , ” Owens wrote .
“ Two poachers have been killed and one wounded that I know of thus far , and we are just getting warmed up . ”
In the letter , Owens described his plans to recruit more scouts for his “ Airborne Special Operations . ”
“ These officers will be used with the chopper on shock operations , in which we hit the worst poachers very hard and with lasting effect .
This has worked to such a degree in the park that we have recorded only a single elephant poached in North Luangwa Park since the beginning of the year , and a buffalo and warthog as part of the same incident . ”
He went on , “ Now that we have secured the park , our strategic plan is to keep pushing the poachers back until we have created a broad safety zone or buffer area on all sides of North Luangwa .
In this way we not only take care of poachers attacking the park , but also the ones who are punishing the [ game - management areas ] .
Believe me it is already working . ”
He complained that he was being “ stigmatized ” as a preservationist — someone opposed to legal hunting .
“ We have secured , and are busy securing not only your hunting area , but that of Jones , and others as well , ” he wrote , referring to Paul Tudor Jones , the hedge - fund manager .
( Jones would not comment for this article , but his spokesman Steven Bruce said , “ At the time , Mr. Jones had no knowledge of these activities .
He abhors murder and would never condone such actions . ” )
At the end of the letter , Owens asked Fouche , who was then in America , for help in equipping his scouts : “ Anything you can do to help keep our anti-poaching efforts alive in your area will , I guarantee , pay big dividends for your safari business , and very soon , ” he wrote .
“ On that note , would it be possible for you to bring back as much ammo as you can : 12 gauge 00B , 30.06 , 300 , 7.62 short ( AK ) , and some cracker shells ( for pest control ) ? ”
Over the past several years , the Owenses and their attorney Robert Ivey have threatened legal action against a number of people in the U.S. and in Zambia who raised questions about their behavior in Africa .
Mark Owens ’s letter to Fouche has been a particular point of contention .
Ten years ago , Sharon Healey , a graduate student at the University of Denver ’s International Human Rights Advocacy Center , got a copy of the letter .
She contacted the Owens Foundation about it , and said that Mary Dykes “ justified the contents on the grounds that it was a war zone , that Fouche was being overrun with poachers and was begging Mark for help . ”
Some years later , Dykes resumed contact , Healey said , and told her that the letter was “ dictated by Mark when he was out in the bush to an Owens employee ” and that the contents might have been garbled in transmission .
In 2005 , Robert Ivey wrote Healey and claimed that the letter had in fact been written by an employee named Malcolm , under Mark ’s name and in his voice .
( This is an apparent reference to Malcolm Boulton , who has denied any knowledge of this letter or involvement in its writing . )
Ivey sent a document from the Owens Foundation that argued that the Fouche letter contained “ certain words such as ‘ messieurs ’ . . . that Mark Owens does not use . ”
Further , it said , “ Mark has never used the phrase ‘ all grin from ear to ear , ’ ” which occurred in the letter .
Donald Zachary , another of the Owenses ’ lawyers , recently gave me a slightly different explanation .
He wrote , “ We believe someone took bits out of a typed letter Mark actually did write but added some aggressive language and faxed it , possibly from the Owenses ’ machine in Mpika when no one was in the office . ”
Zachary suggested that the person who sent the fax was involved in a conspiracy , orchestrated by officials opposed to the ban on ivory trading .
Then , last week , Mark Owens wrote to say that he might have written the letter after all .
Although he had no specific memory of the fax , he recalled that around the time it was sent he had talked to a group of scouts who had been fired on by poachers , and he surmised from their behavior that they had shot back .
Not long after , he said , Fouche was frightened by an attack on his camp .
“ When drafting the fax to Fouche , if in fact I did so , my experience with the scouts on the Luangwa River must have been fresh in my mind , ” Owens wrote .
“ Knowing Fouche ’s very real fear that his concession area was under threat , I likely wanted to reassure him that we had done something significant to defend his camp and personnel . ”
He went on , “ It appears that this fax states something that I did not know for certain — that two poachers had been killed and one wounded when scouts returned their fire while crossing the river .
. . .
I may have decided that it would be more satisfying to Mr. Fouche if I tried to ‘ quantify ’ the episode , or perhaps I simply stated my conclusion to a staffer who chose those words .
I do not know .
In any case , the ambiguous statement that ‘ we are just getting started ’ did not mean that anyone was just getting started shooting poachers , but only that we had just begun fielding antipoaching patrols in that area . ”
There were three sets of gunshots in the killing shown in “ Deadly Game . ”
The first shot , the one that knocked the alleged poacher down , was fired before the camera began rolling , according to Meredith Vieira ’s narration .
The second shot — the first to be heard in the video — came from a thin black man in a green uniform .
The third came from offscreen , fired by an unidentified shooter .
On my visits to the North Luangwa region , I had asked about the scout in the video , a man I eventually learned was named London Kawele , but I was told that he had been transferred to another part of Zambia , or that he was dead .
The ABC documentary does n’t indicate who fired the first and last sets of shots .
In the absence of a witness ’s testimony , there has been a persistent controversy about what actually happened on the video — who the other shooter was and , in some quarters , whether a killing happened at all .
Owens gives his interpretation of the shooting in his letter to the Zambian attorney general : “ I have no direct evidence of what I am about to suggest , however , based on what I have been told by others , I believe that the following may describe what actually happened : I believe that one or more game scouts , excited by being filmed for international television , shot a poacher in front of the camera . ”
In the intervening years , supporters of the Owenses have put forth various other explanations .
Mary
Dykes told me that the scene might have been filmed in Zimbabwe ; she also suggested that ABC News could have staged the shooting with actors .
Gordon Streeb , the former U.S. Ambassador to Zambia , also said that this was possible .
“ My judgment is that they more likely staged something that was fake for visual effect , and no one was killed , ” Streeb said , adding that ABC “ could have been in Zimbabwe . ”
Streeb said he found the film suspicious because “ when you hear the gunshot go off , the body twitches , but you do n’t see blood spattering .
Beyond that gunshot , there ’s no evidence . ”
Andrew Tkach , the field producer of “ Deadly Game , ” who spent a month in North Luangwa in the late summer of 1994 and visited again in the summer of 1995 , said that the documentary accurately portrayed events in the park .
Janice Tomlin , who is now a freelance producer in Texas but was then serving as the senior broadcast producer of “ Turning Point , ” said , “ I can categorically tell you that any project I ’ve ever been involved with , any program — ‘ 60 Minutes , ’ any program — that there has been no staging of any event . ”
She was adamant that the killing was videotaped by a cameraman named Chris Everson as he accompanied scouts on patrol in the park .
The executive producer of “ Turning Point , ” Betsy West , who became a top executive at CBS News ( and who later resigned , with others , in the wake of the controversy that cost Dan Rather his job ) , told me that she had “ the utmost confidence ” in Tkach and Everson .
“ Andrew is very good , especially in Africa and other far - gone places , he ’s very rough and ready , extremely reliable and honest , so I totally believe him , ” she said .
West , who now teaches at the Columbia School of Journalism , went on , “ Chris Everson is one of the great cameramen based in Africa .
I ca n’t imagine that anything they reported would be amiss . ”
Methane is like the radical wing of the carbon cycle , in today ’s atmosphere a stronger greenhouse gas per molecule than CO 2 , and an atmospheric concentration that can change more quickly than CO 2 can .
There has been a lot of press coverage of a new paper in Science this week called “ Extensive methane venting to the atmosphere from sediments of the East Siberian Arctic Shelf ” , which comes on the heels of a handful of interrelated methane papers in the last year or so .
Is now the time to get frightened ?
No .
CO 2 is plenty to be frightened of , while methane is frosting on the cake .
Imagine you are in a Toyota on the highway at 60 miles per hour approaching stopped traffic , and you find that the brake pedal is broken .
This is CO 2 .
Then you figure out that the accelerator has also jammed , so that by the time you hit the truck in front of you , you will be going 90 miles per hour instead of 60 .
This is methane .
Is now the time to get worried ?
No , you should already have been worried by the broken brake pedal .
Methane sells newspapers , but it ’s not the big story , nor does it look to be a game changer to the big story , which is CO 2 .

For some background on methane hydrates we can refer you here .
This weeks ’
Science paper is by Shakhova et al , a follow on to a 2005 GRL paper .
The observation in 2005 was elevated concentrations of methane in ocean waters on the Siberian shelf , presumably driven by outgassing from the sediments and driving excess methane to the atmosphere .
The new paper adds observations of methane spikes in the air over the water , confirming the methane ’s escape from the water column , instead of it being oxidized to CO 2 in the water , for example .
The new data enable the methane flux from this region to the atmosphere to be quantified , and they find that this region rivals the methane flux from the whole rest of the ocean .
What ’s missing from these studies themselves is evidence that the Siberian shelf degassing is new , a climate feedback , rather than simply nature - as - usual , driven by the retreat of submerged permafrost left over from the last ice age .
However , other recent papers speak to this question .
Westbrook et al 2009 , published stunning sonar images of bubble plumes rising from sediments off Spitzbergen , Norway .
The bubbles are rising from a line on the sea floor that corresponds to the boundary of methane hydrate stability , a boundary that would retreat in a warming water column .
A modeling study by Reagan and Moridis 2009 supports the idea that the observed bubbles could be in response to observed warming of the water column driven by anthropogenic warming .
Another recent paper , from Dlugokencky et al.
2009 , describes an uptick in the methane concentration in the air in 2007 , and tries to figure out where it ’s coming from .
The atmospheric methane concentration rose from the preanthropogenic until about the year 1993 , at which point it rather abruptly plateaued .
Methane is a transient gas in the atmosphere , so it ought to plateau if the emission flux is steady , but the shape of the concentration curve suggested some sudden decrease in the emission rate , stemming from the collapse of economic activity in the former Soviet bloc , or by drying of wetlands , or any of several other proposed and unresolved explanations .
( Maybe the legislature in South Dakota should pass a law that methane is driven by astrology ! )
A previous uptick in the methane concentration in 1998 could be explained in terms of the effect of El Niño on wetlands , but the uptick in 2007 is not so simple to explain .
The concentration held steady in 2008 , meaning at least that interannual variability is important in the methane cycle , and making it hard to say if the long - term average emission rate is rising in a way that would be consistent with a new carbon feedback .
Anyway , so far it is at most a very small feedback .
The Siberian Margin might rival the whole rest of the world ocean as a methane source , but the ocean source overall is much smaller than the land source .
Most of the methane in the atmosphere comes from wetlands , natural and artificial associated with rice agriculture .
The ocean is small potatoes , and there is enough uncertainty in the methane budget to accommodate adjustments in the sources without too much overturning of apple carts .
Could this be the first modest sprout of what will grow into a huge carbon feedback in the future ?
It is possible , but two things should be kept in mind .
One is that there ’s no reason to fixate on methane in particular .
Methane is a transient gas in the atmosphere , while CO 2 essentially accumulates in the atmosphere / ocean carbon cycle , so in the end the climate forcing from the accumulating CO 2 that methane oxidizes into may be as important as the transient concentration of methane itself .
The other thing to remember is that there ’s no reason to fixate on methane hydrates in particular , as opposed to the carbon stored in peats in Arctic permafrosts for example .
Peats take time to degrade but hydrate also takes time to melt , limited by heat transport .
They do n’t generally explode instantaneously .
For methane to be a game - changer in the future of Earth ’s climate , it would have to degas to the atmosphere catastrophically , on a time scale that is faster than the decadal lifetime of methane in the air .
So far no one has seen or proposed a mechanism to make that happen .

He appears to have misheard or misunderstood .
( I often wonder what goes through peoples ’ minds in that split second ; what do they think they heard me say : “ I ’m a peep doctor ” ? )
I repeat and explain that I do sleep medicine , “ you know , insomnia , sleep apnea , that sort of thing . ”
“ Oh , yes .
I see . ”
His eyes widen with interest ; now he steps really close , and a trembling hand lightly lays itself on my forearm .
Doctors preach the importance of sleep , yet medical students and residents are trained to be sleep - deprived .
I know that if I am not extremely creative and diplomatic , I will be stuck in the corner all night doing what I do all day — listening to some sad soul pour out his story of tortured , restless sleep .
At a party , I am right up there in popularity with the dermatologist and plastic surgeon .
Everyone needs our help and no one is embarrassed to say so .
Do n’t get me wrong ; I feel for this sleep - deprived , soiled and seemingly desperate man , but not much can be solved in a few minutes over canapés and gin .
I am happy to help out and give useful advice where I can ; it ’s just that most people want to talk to me about their insomnia , and insomnia is the “ dreaded disease ” of sleep medicine .
Every medical specialty has the one patient complaint that makes the doctors groan .
For neurologists , it is headache ; for rheumatologists , chronic fatigue ; and for gastrointestinal docs , it is irritable bowel .
What these all have in common is that we doctors do n’t know how to treat them very well .
One reason is that they are disorders , which means they are sets of symptoms , rather than one clear - cut , pathologically definable disease , and in their complexities , they are often not well understood and consequently not well treated using Western medical paradigms .
If there were a medical solution to sleeplessness , there would not be this need for sharing stories of nocturnal misery and outlining strategies for persevering .
There have , however , been advances in our understanding of the disorder .
The latest biomedical explanation for insomnia is much like the one for depression :
There is an imbalance in the neurotransmitters in the brain , in this case , the ones that control the sleep / wake cycle .
However , mapping out exactly what the problem is in which part of the brain remains the challenge for medical scientists .
One piece of advice I have to give to all insomnia suffers is to beware of the word “ insomnia . ”
The problem is that the word is used by patients and doctors to describe the symptom of not being able to initiate sleep or maintain sleep or having persistent early morning awakenings .
But it is also the word used for the final diagnosis .
Patients walk into their primary care doctor and say : “ Hey doc , I ca n’t sleep .
I have insomnia . ”
And they are getting into their car before the ink has dried on the prescription for Ambien .
People do n’t walk into their internist ’s office and say , “ I ’m having appendicitis . ”
They tell the doctor about the horrible pain in their “ stomach , ” and it is the doctor ’s job to think of all the problems this might represent and to narrow the possibilities by asking further questions , doing a physical exam and running tests .
Insomnia is not that easy to work up , and it takes the one thing that doctors have so little of : time for questions and discussion with the patient .
So be a proactive patient and do not easily accept chronic insomnia as your final diagnosis .
There are , after all , so many medical problems that can masquerade as insomnia .
Sleep disorders like sleep apnea and delayed sleep phase disorder can mislead patients and non-sleep doctors .
Psychiatric disorders , cardiovascular disease , lung disease and rheumatologic and endocrine disorders ( as well as the medications used to treat them ) can all disrupt sleep and lead people to think that they suffer from insomnia .
The gentleman with the crumb problem ( which is likely secondary to being sleep deprived and living without a wife as most phenomena are multifactorial ) wanted to know what got me interested in the area of sleep medicine .
I answered : “ Because it is an oxymoron — sleep and medicine do not go together at all . ”
Doctors preach to patients how important sleep is to lower their risk of all sorts of diseases : high blood pressure , heart disease , stroke , diabetes , weight gain and obesity , depression and dementia .
Yet the institution of medical training in this country practices systematized sleep deprivation of medical students and residents .
By the way , we use the term “ resident ” because junior doctors used to live in the hospitals .
Driving while sleep deprived can be just as dangerous as driving drunk .
For the majority of the three years I trained in internal medicine ( and during the two years before that when I did clinical rotations as a medical student ) , I would work 30 to 36 hour shifts every fourth night with no guarantee of sleep .
Why , you might wonder , are students and residents pushed so hard , for so long ?
One reason is that medicine is a very tradition - bound profession and this is just the way “ things have always been done . ”
But there are myriad other reasons : a culture of hard work that tests the mental stability and physical stamina of these brave young men and women ; a belief held by many doctors that residency training is simply too short to teach doctors all they need to know unless they are pretty much working non-stop during that period seeing all the “ interesting cases ” that come through ; and the simple economic fact that residents are a cheap way to man the hospital around the clock .
After 24 hours on duty , I would crave sleep like other people desire food or sex .
And like an addict , I would plot and plan and structure my activity around getting the balm I so desperately needed .
I would try to squeeze some sleep in , no matter how short the time allotted , no matter the location .
I have slept in wheel chairs and on a patient gurney ; I have dozed in stairwells and while riding on elevators .
I , like almost every resident physician I know , would routinely fall asleep during the morning and noontime lectures that were meant to teach me how to be a decent doctor .
Every woman doctor I know , and quite a few men , have wept from sheer exhaustion .
The question is not only how did I live through this , but how did my patients ?
I have a friend who wrecked her car three times in the first two months of her surgery internship .
The same surgeon fell asleep with a needle - driver in her hand .
Luckily , a senior attending caught her before she fell into the open wound .
I was so tired driving home one afternoon after a call , that I had to roll down the window in the middle of Chicago winter , blast the radio and light a cigarette .
I was shifting in my seat and flailing my arms so erratically that I thought other drivers on the road would think that I was having an epileptic fit .
I did n’t worry about being mistaken for a drunk driver because even a drunk would n’t have acted as crazy as that .
( Years later , in my training as a sleep medicine doctor , I learned that driving while sleep deprived can be just as dangerous as driving drunk . )
It may assuage the reader ’s fears to know that there are new regulations prohibiting resident physicians from working more than 80 hours per week , not to relieve the residents so much as to protect the patients because there was mounting evidence that many medical errors are attributable to physician fatigue .
Now I get my 7 to 8 hours without fail .
Although I have not suffered much from insomnia , that inner , unwanted drive to wakefulness , I do know sleeplessness driven by external exigencies .
I have a lot of sympathy and not a small amount of empathy for those sleepless souls who bleary - eyed and sallow - skinned must go forth into “ the desolation of reality , ” in Yeats ’s memorable phrase .
Day after day , they drag themselves into my office .
Their minds are muddled ; their hearts are heavy ; and many are just plain angry .
So I tell them : “ I have no quick fix , no miracle pill , but I will listen long and hard to your story of chasing the elusive elixir of sleep .
Although I might not cure you , I ’ll go through this with you , as your witness , your night watchman , as someone who knows how long one night can seem . ”

ScribblerToo is an update to
I started hacking together the first version of this to see how much faster I could get this to work with the lastest version of Flash , compared to the way more limited possibilities of Flash in 2004 that Ze had when he built the original version .
After seeing that this works really well Ze Frank and I will be collaborating on extending the features and functionality .
A few notes :
Radius : sets the maximum radius at which strokes will connect to the brush
Connections : sets the maximum amount of connection attempts per frame
Density : sets how tight together connections are made on neighboring strokes
Intensity : sets the maximum opacity for connections
Stroke Alpha : sets the opacity of the drawn stroke
Stroke Size : sets the size of the drawn stroke
Connect Stroke : decides if the currently drawn stroke will also connect to itself
Distance Mode : if set closer neighbors will have a higher probability to be connected than those that are further away , if not set the distance does not matter .
Curves : if set connections are made with curves instead of lines
SPACE BAR allows to draw in a spot without moving the mouse .
The mouse wheel changes the radius
SHIFT + mouse wheel changes the amount of connections
CTRL + mouse wheel changes the density
SHIFT + CTRL + mouse wheel changes the intensity
CTRL-Z : Undo .
There is only one undo step .
You can remove the last stroke and all its connections .
If the drawing is not running fluid on your computer reducing the radius , the amount of connections and / or the density should speed things up .
In case you are running Flash Player 10.1 beta you should check if you have the debug player installed since the release player will be about 2 times faster .

newsflash : most of missing universe found
Some 90 % of the visible universe appeared to be missing .
We finally found the right tools to see it ...
The universe as we know it is mostly empty , with light years separating most stars and great voids stretching for millions of light years between large galaxies .
But there was also a major chunk of the universe missing , a chunk to the tune of 90 % which physics said should be there and yet , no telescope could track it down .
That is until the ESO ’s giant telescope array in the Atacama desert of Chile flexed its 8.2 meter mirrors and found the swaths of missing galaxies about 10 billion light years away just by using a different wavelength .
The problem was the gas composing the galaxies in question .
Instead of just letting the light escape , it was absorbing the emissions for which astronomers look : the Lyman alpha lines generated when electrons shed some energy , emitting ultraviolet light in the process .
When the first surveys of galaxies emitting Lyman alpha lines began , they were based on the idea that ionized hydrogen gas from new stars should be shining bright with a certain frequency of ultraviolet light and found that it was indeed the case .
For just 10 % of the galaxies they saw …
However , giant chunks of the universe do n’t just go missing for no good reason , at least not as far as science is concerned .
The problem was that survey teams before were looking for a hydrogen transition line between an electron ’s second and first quantum states , or as the electrons were essentially grounding themselves .
In the successful attempt to find the missing galaxies , astronomers looked for the Hα line , one energetic order higher .
The light they observed came from electrons moving from their third energetic state to its second with quantum energies of approximately 1.9 electron volts from a very well studied area of the sky in which a swath of never before seen galaxies would be very obvious .
When the sky lit up with galactic archipelagos , it was a pretty safe bet that the missing galaxies were n’t really missing or hidden behind some space - time manifold , but were out in plain sight .
All we had to do was look with a different eye …

Patients who received the antidepressant escitalopram following a stroke appeared to recover more of their thinking , learning and memory skills than those taking placebo or participating in problem - solving therapy , according to a report in the February issue of Archives of General Psychiatry , one of the JAMA / Archives journals .
Stroke remains a major health care problem and a significant cause of death and disability around the world , according to background information in the article .
Significant recent advances in the treatment of stroke include the administration of clot - dissolving therapy , which needs to be administered within the first few hours after symptoms begin .
" Consequently , besides the efforts currently undertaken to increase the number of patients treated with thrombolytic agents , there is growing interest in restorative therapies that can be administered during the first few months after stroke , the period within which we observe the greatest degree of spontaneous recovery of initial motor and cognitive deficits , " the authors write .
One line of research has focused on antidepressants , which may be effective in part because of their ability to stimulate production of compounds essential for nerve cell growth .
Ricardo E. Jorge , M.D. , and colleagues at the University of Iowa , Iowa City , studied the effects of one antidepressant -- a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , escitalopram -- among 129 stroke patients .
Within three months of their stroke , 43 patients were randomly assigned to take 5 to 10 milligrams of escitalopram daily , 45 to take a placebo daily and 41 to participate in a problem - solving therapy program developed for treating patients with depression .
After 12 weeks of treatment , patients taking escitalopram had higher scores on neuropsychological tests assessing overall cognitive ( thinking , learning and memory ) function and on those measuring verbal and visual memory .
" Importantly , the reported changes in neuropsychological performance resulted in an improvement in related activities of daily living , " the authors write .
" The beneficial effect of escitalopram on cognitive recovery was independent of its effect on depressive symptoms and was not influenced by stroke type or mechanism of ischemic stroke , " they continue .
" In addition , escitalopram was well tolerated and the frequency of adverse effects related to its administration was not different than that observed among patients receiving placebo . "
Increasing evidence suggests that antidepressants cause changes in brain structure , including the visual cortex , hippocampus and cerebral cortex .
These structural changes , although not yet proven to affect behavioral performance , may underlie the improvements in verbal and visual memory observed in this trial , the authors note .
" Overall , whatever may be the mechanism of improved cognitive recovery , this study has shown , for the first time , that escitalopram , an SSRI , is associated with improved cognitive recovery following stroke compared with placebo and Problem - Solving Therapy , " they conclude .
" The utility of antidepressants in the process of post - stroke recovery deserves to be further investigated . "

Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur that was closely related to the Velociraptor .
The 1.8 m - long predator was a dromaeosaurid - a family of theropod dinosaurs from which modern birds descended .
The researchers discovered its exquisitely well preserved skeleton in sediments dating from the Upper Cretaceous period in Inner Mongolia .
They describe the find in the journal Zootaxa .
The fossilised skeleton was in almost perfect condition - with complete claws and teeth - despite being between 145 and 65 million years old .
Its examination was led by Xing Xu from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing .
He and his colleagues described several distinguishing features , particularly of its jaw and feet , that enabled them to identify it as a dromaeosaurid - a name that means " running lizard " .
It had , for example , what the researchers described as " raptorial claws " on its feet .
The highly evolved predator , which has been named Linheraptor exquisitus represents an entirely new genus within that family .
" Linheraptor is similar to Velociraptor in many features , " wrote the scientists .
They pointed out , however , that it was not Velociraptor 's closest relative within the dromaeosaurid family .
Packard has a long feud with GOP senate candidate Carly Fiorina , pictured here .
Packard : Fiorina almost destroyed HP
The granddaughter of one of Hewlett - Packard ’s founders wrote a letter Monday trashing California GOP Senate candidate Carly Fiorina ’s leadership of the company .
Arianna Packard , the granddaughter of HP co-founder David Packard , wrote the letter to the three Republican senators who recently endorsed Fiorina – James Inhofe and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma as well as Jon Kyl of Arizona – over former Rep. Tom Campbell and state Assemblyman Chuck DeVore .

Packard has a long feud with Fiorina , publicly criticizing her leadership of the company and pushing for her ouster in 2005 .
In 2002 , Packard teamed with Bill Hewlett – son of co-founder Walter Hewlett – in an attempt to kill Fiorina ’s planned merger with Compaq .
“ As I 'm sure you 've seen over the past year , voters do n't like Senators who do n't read bills before they vote on them , ” Packard wrote in a letter first posted on the conservative blog RedState .
“ Voters ( and donors ) also do n't like Senators who get involved in contested primaries , especially without having done their homework .
I would respectfully suggest that in the future you conduct more detailed research on candidates before endorsing them . ”
Packard then went through each of the reason the senators gave for endorsing Fiorina to rebut their claims , especially that she is a “ proven business leader . ”
“ I know a little bit about Carly Fiorina , having watched her almost destroy the company my grandfather founded .
So , allow me to disillusion you of a few of your stated reasons for supporting her , ” Packard wrote .
“ Most business commentators consider Fiorina 's tenure at HP to be a disaster , ” Packard continued .
“ The stock price dropped by 50 % only to rally 10 % on the announcement of her firing .
She fired 28,000 people before she herself was fired , departing with the 21 million dollar golden parachute that is financing her campaign . ”
Packard has contributed $ 2,400 to DeVore ’s campaign , according to FEC filings .
Responding , Fiorina spokeswoman Julie Soderlund , said , " It is unfortunate that Ms. Packard very clearly has been given a long list of false information and baseless attacks by Carly ’s opponents . ”
“ It is important that California voters understand the success of Carly ’s tenure at HP and her credentials as a fiscal conservative .
This is particularly important since her opponents in this race are perennial candidates and career politicians , and have been working overtime to invent falsehoods about Carly in order to get elected to their next job , ” Soderlund added .
“ Carly welcomes an examination of her record .
It is a record that will stand the test of scrutiny , particularly against Barbara Boxer ’s record of failure for the last 18 years in the Senate . ”

A U.S. Department of Justice section chief on Friday chastised a lawyer for the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office for giving the impression that federal agents would likely assume the sheriff 's investigations into corruption in Maricopa County .
In a strongly worded letter , Raymond Hulser , acting chief of the Public Integrity Section at the Department of Justice , wrote that he was " dismayed to learn that your mere referral of information to the Public Integrity Section was cited and relied upon in a pleading in federal court , and then used as a platform for a press conference . "
Read the letter
On Thursday , Sheriff Joe Arpaio and County Attorney Andrew Thomas held a press conference to announce that a federal racketeering lawsuit against county officials , Superior Court judges and private attorneys was " moot " because it had been referred to the Department of Justice .
A motion for voluntary dismissal filed in the case Thursday said Thomas and Arpaio had " received their assurances that PIN ( the Public Integrity Section ) will review the matter . "
The section focuses primarily on high - profile cases of extortion , bribery and election crimes .
At their press conference , it was explained that Arpaio attorney Robert Driscoll , a former Justice Department employee , had used his connections to get a review of investigative files on the judges , attorneys , county supervisors and the Attorney General 's Office .
But Hulser 's letter to Driscoll said otherwise .
" Based on our conversation on March 1 , it was my expectation that you would provide a written summary of the alleged federal criminal violations so that we could , in consultation with the United States Attorney , determine how the information should best be handled , and by whom , " he wrote .
" You did not indicate , nor did I expect , that you would provide virtually the entire file from the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office , consisting of thousands of pages of documents and electronic media .
That production was not called for , and we do not intend to review the entire file from the Sheriff 's Office . "
The federal racketeering lawsuit was filed in December .
In it , Thomas and Arpaio alleged that judges and county officials had conspired to take resources from the Sheriff 's and County Attorney 's offices and hindered prosecutions .
But a Superior Court judge cited the suit as creating a conflict of interest for several other prosecutions by Thomas .
As a result , the judge threw out a criminal case against Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox , prompting Thomas to then dismiss cases against Supervisor Don Stapley and Superior Court Judge Gary Donahoe .
Files in some of those cases were passed to the Department of Justice , sparking Hulser 's letter .
Hulser pointed out in his letter that some of the information handed over could , in fact , end up in the hands of the U.S. Attorney 's Office in Phoenix , which is looking into some of Thomas and Arpaio 's actions .
Neither the Department of Justice nor the U.S. Attorney 's Office would comment .
The Sheriff 's Office also declined comment .
( Newser ) – Mikhail Gorbachev warns that Russia is in danger of backsliding into the dark days of the Soviet Union in a critical op - ed piece that seems aimed directly at Vladimir Putin .
The country 's parliament is no better than a rubber stamp , its courts lack independence , and there 's still no real party system .
" There is a growing feeling that the government is afraid of civil society and would like to control everything , " Gorbachev writes on the 25th anniversary of his perestroika reforms .
" I sense alarm in the words of President Dmitri Medvedev , " who warned of a " primitive economy " and a society grown complacent because the government runs everything .
" I agree with the president , " Gorbachev writes in the New York Times .
" I agree with his goal of modernization .
But it will not happen if people are sidelined , if they are just pawns .
If the people are to feel and act like citizens , there is only one prescription : democracy , including the rule of law and an open and honest dialogue between the government and the people . "

NEAL DOUBTER OUT
A month ago , Norm Hanscombe was one of the men encouraging Gosford 's federal iguana , Belinda Neal , not to seek preselection in the seat of Robertson on Saturday .
He said everyone would like to see her stand down , '' except of course the Liberals ' ' .
But on Monday it was Hanscome standing down , withdrawing his name from the re-election ballot for president of the Labor Party 's Ourimbah branch .
He has held the position on and off since 1972 - and probably with more than the 0.1 per cent margin with which Neal clings to her seat .
'' I only took the job on for a purpose and the purpose is fulfilled , '' he told the Herald in somewhat worn - out tones .
'' I was there to service the nation 's interest .
Does that sound pompous enough ? ''
Hanscombe says he was not pushed out of the position by Neal and nor was she at the meeting .
VIVID VIRAL JARGON
The genial chief executive of Events NSW , Geoff Parmenter , might know how to put on a good festival , but when it comes to separating the artistic content from the business side of things he appears to be struggling .
At yesterday 's announcement that Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson would curate the next Vivid Festival in Sydney , Parmenter chose to describe how the different parts of the festival have come together thus : '' There 's been a massive leap forward in the collaboration between the partners , '' he said .
'' This year we really have got a completely synergised brand presentation . ''
One onlooker noted that Parmenter 's corporatised language was oddly appropriate : one of Anderson 's well known songs is Language Is a Virus , from her album Home of the Brave .
$ 330 METRO TICKET
The state government 's announcement that it will scrap the metro is at least keeping the NSW Liberal Party spin machine gainfully employed .
It has already produced a fake CityRail station announcement detailing a litany of rail policy backflips and stuff - ups , finishing with : '' Thank you for your attention and enjoy another day on the overcrowded , outdated and always late Labor - run public transport network . ''
Yesterday , party operatives were spotted handing out mocked - up weekly train tickets at Wynyard station .
The cost of the ticket , $ 330 , represents ''$ 330 million = the bill for cancelling Labor 's Rozelle metro or $ 330 for each each commuter = the NSW taxpayer forced to pay ' ' .
A BIG DAY FOR MEAT LOAF THERE'S one way to ensure someone will bother to listen to your new concept album , and Meat Loaf demonstrated it yesterday .
Any Sydney media wishing to speak to the US singer of such hits as 1977's You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth and 1994's I 'd Do Anything for Love ( But I Wo n't Do That ) had a mandatory hour wait - in which time they had to attend a ' ' listening session ' ' of his new album , Hang Cool Teddy Bear .
Those joining Teddy might have found it worth the chill time .
The Herald 's Rachael Jones certainly found herself getting some bigger answers than expected in the one - on - one interview .
'' The secret of life is this , '' he said .
'' You want to improve every day , you want to learn every day and you need to know how to love . ''
If not , you at least need to know how to call in a favour .

STAY IN TOUCH ... ... WITH PACIFIC PORTRAYAL
AUSTRALIA , but not as we know it , is continuing its roll out across the US .
While there was no Baz and no Nicole , the executive producer Tom Hanks and his cast made it to New Orleans this week for another premiere screening of The Pacific .
The HBO series tells the story of three US marines fighting in the Pacific theatre during World War II - depicting some of the war 's bloodiest battles including Guadalcanal , Iwo Jima and Okinawa , the Associated Press reports .
Filmed in locations across Melbourne , Geelong and Port Douglas in 2007 and 2008 , the mini-series was estimated to cost as much as $ 223 million - making it perhaps the most expensive of its kind ever made in Australia .
Not that it is Hanks 's first dabble in the genre .
The star of Saving Private Ryan teamed up with the series ' fellow executive producers , Steven Spielberg and Gary Goetzman , for Band of Brothers in 2001 , a war mini-series set in Europe during the same period .
The Pacific will screen in the US on March 14 , and is expected to be seen here on the Seven Network in April .
... WITH FASHION POLICE IT SEEMS the temperamental Naomi Campbell has struck again .
A man hired as the British model 's chauffeur in Manhattan for the day alleges that she hit him so hard on the back of the head that his head slammed into the steering wheel of the moving car , bruising him beneath the eye .
He pulled over and got out to speak to a traffic officer , who alerted police , but by the time they arrived Campbell had catwalked , sauntered or otherwise left .
'' The driver said Miss Campbell had fled the scene on foot , '' a police spokesman said .
The driver has since decided not to pursue the matter , but it is not the first time Campbell has been accused of violent tendencies .
The 39 - year - old pleaded guilty to assaulting an assistant with a phone in 2000 , throwing her phone at her housekeeper in 2007 , and chucking a hissy and attacking police at London 's Heathrow Airport after a piece of luggage went missing in 2008 .
As for the incident this week , her spokesman , Jeff Raymond , said she would co-operate with police and there was '' more to the story than meets the eye ' ' .
Whether he meant the driver 's eye is unclear .
... WITH THAT SUIT THE agreement to donate the suit worn by O.J. Simpson when acquitted of the 1994 murders of Ron Goldman and ex-wife Nicole was almost in tatters yesterday after the recipient declared it did n't want it .
Goldman 's father , Fred , dropped his claim for the camel suit after a settlement meeting where it was agreed it should be given to the Smithsonian Institution instead .
Even the now - jailed Simpson agreed to wear the decision , but the museum 's curators and director did n't .
'' The Smithsonian 's National Museum of American History will not be collecting O.J. Simpson 's suit , '' the museum told the Los Angeles Times in a statement .
Goldman sought the suit as a means to recoup some of the $ 33.5 million Simpson was ordered to pay in a civil suit in 1997 .

The American financial press cheered on Friday when “ only ” 36,000 jobs were lost in February .
This if you have n’t noticed now passes for good economic news .
The unemployment rate remained unchanged because the actual workforce continued to show a decline yet Wall Street somehow viewed this as positive developments .
And why not ?
The middle class is under assault from every angle .
Things are so twisted with propaganda that many Americans now believe that the banking elite are actually looking out for the well being of American workers .
As news of the job losses somehow echoed as positive developments , more and more Americans are continually being kicked out of their homes from banks they helped to bail out .
Irony has no meaning to Wall Street .
And if we look at the details of the jobs report , it turns out that 17.9 percent of Americans are either unemployed or underemployed or flat out have stopped looking for work :
Source : BLS
This was n’t the only spin going on in the media .
Before the jobs report came out there was a preemptive flow of information trying to justify the job cuts by blaming it on the weather .
Yes , now instead of blaming the financial catastrophe on the actual perpetrators in Wall Street who systematically looted the American system and turned our economy into a giant casino that they leeched onto , we are now to believe people are losing their jobs because of the weather :
“ ( CNSnews ) Ahead of Friday ’s announcement , Goldman Sachs predicted that the storm might skew the job loss number by as much as 100,000 – a prediction that was embraced by officials in the Obama administration .
“ The blizzards that affected much of the country during the last month are likely to distort the statistics , ” Larry Summers , director of the White House ’s National Economic Council , said in an interview with CNBC .
“ So it ’s going to be very important … to look past whatever the next figures are to gauge the underlying trends . ”
If the storm caused a skewing of job loss numbers I wonder how many job losses can be linked to Goldman Sachs and their casino style gambling in the derivatives markets and mortgage backed securities ?
Then again , people should be happy that the unemployment rate remained steady at 9.7 percent even though more Americans are working part - time with no benefits and many others have simply fallen off the payrolls .
This is supposedly the new American dream for the middle class through the eyes of Wall Street who are selling capitalism but living in a world of corporate handout socialism .
There is a new show called Undercover Boss where a CEO goes undercover to work in the trenches with the proletariat .
As it turns out , the middle class is being worked to death and as we all know , the CEO ca n’t even do the job most workers do on a daily basis .
Even Henry Ford understood the interworking of the cars he was putting out .
In the end the CEO reveals his identity and gives a nice little handout to the worker and all is well in TV land .
The check is a token of what CEOs actually make .
This is the ultimate reflection of our trickle down economy where those at the top act like sociopaths and rulers of the universe but when it comes to doing the daily tasks of their company , they have no clue .
This is the de facto rule running on Wall Street .
In fact , CEO pay has grown outrageously over the past few decades as the middle class has gotten poorer :
Source : American Progress
In reality , part - time employment has spread even to poor CEOs making 300 to 400 times the average American worker salary .
Poor CEOs and Wall Street executives need time off to enjoy their tax payer funded yachts and all expense hedonism trips to the Caribbean .
They would like to convince each other that the money they have is all through their will power and market prowess but in reality it is nothing more than being part of a corporatocracy and buying out the government with an army of lobbyist and insiders .
You have to be a self indulgent narcissist to take the economy to the brink of financial destruction in the case of many Wall Street firms and still reward yourself with outrageous bailouts .
The fact that average Americans are still not protesting in mass about this tells me that many actually believe what Wall Street is saying .
You see this when many would rather blame the working class for the ills of today than focus their energy where it really needs to go .
Wall Street loves this economic crisis .
They receive trillions in bailouts yet convince the public that what is occurring today is merely the “ market ” correcting itself .
So as most Americans have more and more troubles keeping up with their daily bills , companies are squeezing every little excess from those currently working .
Those that have jobs out of fear will work harder and probably demand less merit increases in the current economy .
After all , the head guy is only making 300 times what you make even though he can’t even understand the main function of the organization .
So what if the low level guy is selling toxic crap to some homeless person with no income and giving him access to a $ 500,000 loan .
These Wall Street tycoons are big picture thinkers and ca n’t be worried with the day to day operations of the proletariat unless it means turning it into a caricature for mass viewing and quick TIVO access .
You do n’t think productivity actually increased ?
Take a look at this :
Source : BLS
This recession has been fantastic for productivity .
Just look at the above chart .
American workers have been doing their part during this recession .
After all , now you can hire a cadre of “ contract ” workers and not have to pay them one cent in healthcare support or even contribute to their pension .
Once the job is done you can kick them to the curb .
After all , this is capitalism so long as those at the top have managed to setup sweetheart deals and golden parachutes .
This is how the top 1 percent makes sure their hold on 40 percent of the nation ’s wealth is n’t damaged .
And if you think financial institutions deserve this bailout money and their outrageous bonuses then companies like Circuit City or Mervyns would still be around today if that model applied across the board .
But this does n’t apply to the general economy .
This applies to Wall Street and somehow the absurdity of it all still goes on .
The worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and not one solid reform has been enacted .
26 months of job losses and nothing .
Who is running the show ?
The rise of the part - time work force is nothing new as we become more and more like Japan .
Japan bailed out their financial institutions after their failed stock market and real estate bubbles popped and today , their working class is made up of one - third part - time workers :
“ ( LA Times )
In the world ’s second - largest economy , the global financial crisis has forced part - time workers such as Kudo to face a harsh new reality .
Over the last few years , temporary employees have gone from being a rarity in Japan to accounting for one - third of the workforce of 67 million .
They enjoy far fewer protections than full - time workers — placing their necks squarely on the layoff chopping block .
By March , the government predicts , 85,000 part - timers will fall prey to haken - giri , or temporary - worker cutbacks — a relatively small number compared with U.S. layoffs but high for a nation where job security has long been a staple .
On Wednesday , embattled Prime Minister Taro Aso made the plight of part - timers a major piece of a proposed stimulus package .
Aso pledged to create 1.6 million jobs , partly by turning part - time jobs into full - time ones . ”
Japan ’s headline unemployment rate is 4.9 percent .
Just like our headline unemployment rate , the devil is really in the details .
If we continue on this path part - time work may be all that is left .

He said he plans to file legislation to get rid of the 15 - member elected board when the Legislature returns to its regular session in January .
The panel currently has seven Republican social conservatives , three moderate - to - conservative Republicans and five Democrats .
They argued over the teaching of evolution last year when adopting new biology curriculum standards and now are hotly divided over new social studies and history standards .
Four of the Democrats , disgusted with the process , walked out of a board meeting two weeks ago .
Hinojosa took exception to the board 's vote to limit or outright exclude mention of central figures in U.S. , Texas and world history , including important figures in the 1960s civil rights movement .
The social conservatives on the board “ seem to be more focused on cultural wars and on their own personal biases than they are on the education of our kids , ” he said .
“ In one breath , this faction will speak of a need to return to a more fundamental understanding of freedoms based in , say , the Declaration of Independence .
Then , they work to revise Thomas Jefferson 's views on separation of church and state . ”
15 earlier attempts
David Bradley , R- Beaumont , one of the board 's social conservative leaders , noted that 15 bills aimed at stripping the board of its influence went nowhere in the Legislature last year .
The only bill signed into law required State Board of Education meetings to be broadcast via the Internet .
“ The Democrats never complained when the liberals ran the public education system into the ground over the last several decades , ” Bradley said .
The board 's actions have drawn national media attention .
“ They are ridiculed and criticized , not only by Democrats , but also by Republicans , ” Hinojosa said .
“ It 's not a Democrat or Republican issue .
It 's an issue of what 's best for our educational system . ”
Legislative hearings will put a spotlight on the problem , he said , adding , “ We really need to have hearings and have people come to testify . ”
Board Chairwoman Gail Lowe said the board 's work has been distorted by “ far left ” critics and said the board 's recent votes corrected significant omissions by the experts it consulted , resulting in “ the type of well - balanced history curriculum the majority of Texas parents want for their children . ”

A human - portable hydroelectric generator that weighs about 30 pounds and generates 500 watts of power may soon be a new option for off - grid power .
Developed by Bourne Energy of Mailbu , California , the Backpack Power Plant can create clean , quiet power from any stream deeper than 4 feet .
The company showed off its more - rugged , militarized version of the Backpack Power Plant at the Cleantech Forum in San Francisco last week .
Bourne Energy CEO
Chris Catlin estimates the system will cost $ 3,000 after it goes into production .
" The BPP - 2 , which operates silently with no heat or exhaust emissions , is 40 percent less visible during operation and can also be bottom mounted to be totally invisible , " the company maintains .
Off - grid solar cells are also quiet , but they do n't make much power relative to the mini-turbine .
For example , one commercially available foldable solar panelmeasures about 12 square feet and produces 62 watts of peak power .
You 'd need 60 square feet of panels to get the same peak power as the BPP - 2 , and the panels would only generate electricity while the sun was shining .
To install the civilian BPP , you would dig two trenches on opposite sides of a river and insert a lightweight anchor into each .
Then , you 'd run a synthetic rope between the anchors and the BPP .
Catlin said his company designed the system to work like the high - tension mooring systems that hold up floating oil rigs .
The military version of the BPP has been designed to work with a variety of flow rates .
The civilian version was designed to function best in streams moving at 2.3 meters ( 7.5 feet ) per second .
The civilian market for a $ 3,000 mini hydro system might not be huge in the industrialized world , but Catlin hopes the plant will find willing customers in developing nations and the military .
" This can bring a cheap , highly portable energy technology to remote areas and remote villages , " Catlin told Wired.com .
Bourne is currently looking for $ 4 million in venture capital to take the BPP from prototype to production .

This week , BBC News is running a series of articles about pioneering British computers and British computer pioneers .
The series begins with a look at research into computers developed at GCHQ after the Second World War .
The influence of the 1939 - 45 war on the development of computers is well known .
That conflict spurred the creation of pioneering machines such as Colossus at Bletchley Park and Eniac in the US .
Also , many of the engineers who contributed to wartime inventions such as radar went on to develop other influential machines at Cambridge and Manchester , and at companies such as Elliott and Ferranti .
Research by computer historian Simon Lavington has shown that efforts to produce special purpose code - cracking machines , such as Colossus , did not stop when hostilities were over .
Speed king Professor Lavington said the General Communication Head Quarters ( GCHQ ) in Cheltenham built up its own team after the war for specific projects .
What those machines were used for is still covered by the Official Secrets Act , but Prof Lavington obtained permission to talk to some of the engineers behind them about their technical details .
Of most interest , he said , was a machine called Oedipus that was almost unmatched by any other machine when it went into service in 1954 .
" Oedipus certainly outperformed all other available general purpose computers both in its processing speed and online storage , " he said .
" For particular tasks it was about 10,000 times faster than the fastest commercially - available computer at that time - an IBM 704 , " he told BBC News .
" In those terms Oedipus was a supercomputer . "
It was not until the 1990s that general purpose machines could match Oedipus for searching through a database and finding a particular term , said Prof Lavington .
The machine had three separate memory stores for the data : a magnetic drum , a large semiconductor associative ( ie content - addressable ) store and a RAM cache .
In total , this amounted to more than 200 kilobytes of on - line memory .
This was huge in comparison to other machines at the time , which rarely mustered half as much .
" From an engineering point of view it was a most interesting piece of apparatus , " he said .
In particular , he said , the way its memory was organised was unique for the time .
Total recall
With general purpose computers in the 1950s , values were typically stored at addressable locations in memory .
The instructions those computers could carry out were typically limited to simple arithmetic functions such as addition and comparison , on one pair of values at a time , he said .
Oedipus ' capabilities went unmatched until the early 1990s
By contrast , Oedipus had an associative memory that stored coded words and phrases that could be searched by value , rather than by address .
This associative store was used to compare large amounts of characters in parallel , as quickly as possible .
Oedipus could hold 160,000 characters of particular phrases on its magnetic drum memory and a further 60,000 characters in its read - only associative store , which consisted of huge numbers of semiconductor diodes .
Modern computers can do something similar in serial fashion , said Prof Lavington , when they are asked to search for all instances of a word in a document .
Oedipius stayed in use until 1959 and was finally dismantled in 1962 .
Its name derived from the fact that it had a large dictionary at its heart .
Although permission was given to talk to some of the men who worked on Oedipus , and some of the circuit diagrams have been declassified , Prof Lavington said that GCHQ has not yet been able to find any physical remains of the machine at Cheltenham .
" After a lapse of about 50 years , GCHQ could not find photographs or any bits of hardware , " he said .
The secrecy surrounding its design and operation means that Oedipus has had little impact on computer history .
Prof Lavington said he will reveal more of its history in a book he is writing about Elliott Computers - one of the firms that aided its development .
The book , called Moving targets : Elliott - Automation and the dawn of the computer age in Britain , is due out in late 2010 .

Articles : First Follower : Leadership Lessons from a Dancing Guy 2010-02-11
( I gave this short 3 - minute talk at the TED Conference yesterday and got a standing ovation !
They call it “ How to Start a Movement ” )
Click here to download the video .
Transcript :
If you ’ve learned a lot about leadership and making a movement , then let ’s watch a movement happen , start to finish , in under 3 minutes , and dissect some lessons :
A leader needs the guts to stand alone and look ridiculous .
But what he ’s doing is so simple , it ’s almost instructional .
This is key .
You must be easy to follow !
Now comes the first follower with a crucial role : he publicly shows everyone how to follow .
Notice the leader embraces him as an equal , so it ’s not about the leader anymore — it ’s about them , plural .
Notice he ’s calling to his friends to join in .
It takes guts to be a first follower !
You stand out and brave ridicule , yourself .
Being a first follower is an under - appreciated form of leadership .
The first follower transforms a lone nut into a leader .
If the leader is the flint , the first follower is the spark that makes the fire .
The second follower is a turning point : it ’s proof the first has done well .
Now it ’s not a lone nut , and it ’s not two nuts .
Three is a crowd and a crowd is news .
A movement must be public .
Make sure outsiders see more than just the leader .
Everyone needs to see the followers , because new followers emulate followers — not the leader .
Now here come two more , then three more .
Now we ’ve got momentum .
This is the tipping point !
Now we ’ve got a movement !
As more people jump in , it ’s no longer risky .
If they were on the fence before , there ’s no reason not to join now .
They wo n’t be ridiculed , they wo n’t stand out , and they will be part of the in - crowd , if they hurry .
Over the next minute you ’ll see the rest who prefer to be part of the crowd , because eventually they ’d be ridiculed for not joining .
And ladies and gentlemen that is how a movement is made !
Let ’s recap what we learned :
If you are a version of the shirtless dancing guy , all alone , remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals , making everything clearly about the movement , not you .
Be public .
Be easy to follow !
But the biggest lesson here — did you catch it ?
Leadership is over - glorified .
Yes it started with the shirtless guy , and he ’ll get all the credit , but you saw what really happened :
It was the first follower that transformed a lone nut into a leader .
There is no movement without the first follower .
We ’re told we all need to be leaders , but that would be really ineffective .
The best way to make a movement , if you really care , is to courageously follow and show others how to follow .
When you find a lone nut doing something great , have the guts to be the first person to stand up and join in .
The main lesson to draw from Thursday ’s health care forum is that differences between Democrats and Republicans are too profound to be bridged .
That means that it is up to the Democrats to fix the country ’s dysfunctional and hugely costly health care system .
At the meeting , President Obama laid out his case for sweeping reform that would provide coverage to 30 million uninsured Americans and begin to wrestle down the rising cost of medical care and future deficits .
The Republicans insisted that the country cannot afford that  and does n’t need it .
The House Republican leader , John Boehner , trotted out the old chestnut that the United States has the “ best health care system in the world . ”
This is n’t a question of boosterism or patriotism .
If there ’s any doubt about whether to stick with the status quo , Americans just need to look at their relentlessly rising premiums or think about where  or even whether  they can get coverage if they lose their jobs .
Thursday ’s meeting  more than seven hours broadcast for the hardy  was billed as a last - ditch effort to try to find common ground .
There was plenty of wonkish discussion .
Each party put its best face forward in a mostly civil exchange of ideas , and both professed to see some areas of potential agreement .
The new identity card is n’t just to verify who a person is .
It ’s now a matter of personal security , according to German officials who showed off the country ’s newest ID technology at this year ’s CeBIT conference .
According to reports from CeBIT , the new identity card will go into circulation for the first time in November 2010 .
It features an advanced biometric identification system and users have the option of associating a finger print with the card .
ADVERTISEMENT
The user ’s identity information and electronic signature is encrypted and broadcast by the card via radio frequency identity ( RFID ) , which its creators believe will help facilitate e-commerce and e-government .
The card could even be used to remember passwords on the Internet , according to a product description on the CeBIT Web site .
Lost or stolen cards would be treated like credit cards today : once reported missing , they would no longer be accepted .
“ In order for the new electronic ID card to be accepted by Germans , the federal , state and municipal administration , as well as independent businesses and banks , must develop solutions on their side that enable the smooth running of business processes with the new electronic ID card , ” the CeBIT page claims .
“ With the new electronic procedures for filing taxes , the changeover to the new ID system is already underway . ”
The group calls its new ID standard a “ personal security card ” that will “ improve practical life . ”
The RFID medium is an especially controversial choice for an ID standard technology , given its seeming disposition to being hacked .
Tales of RFID ’s insecurity dot the Web and popular blog BoingBoing memorably promoted a video in March 2009 showing how RFID - enabled credit cards could be hacked for less than $ 8 and some basic tech skills .
With over 1 billion RFID - enabled cards already in circulation , it would appear that business has settled on a new standard for wireless verification systems .
Whether that standard ’s safety and reliability as an identity technology will be proven remains to be seen .
The brother of the White House chief of staff is engaged in a campaign to have a “ three - strikes ” law against illegal file - sharers passed in the United States .
Modeled on a similar law enacted recently in France , a “ three strikes ” law would force Internet service providers to cut off Internet access to any users accused three times of downloading or sharing copyrighted material without permission .

Ari Emanuel , the brother of Rahm Emanuel , told the Abu Dhabi Media Summit last week that he is engaged in a lobbying effort to have such a law put on the books in the United States .
“ We are in the midst of talking to the president and some attorney generals and [ we are ] trying to implement a three strikes and you ’re out rule , ” Emanuel said , as quoted at The Guardian .
Ari Emanuel is the CEO of William Morris , the US ’s largest and most prominent talent agency .
Opponents of three - strikes laws say there are significant problems with the policy .
For one , it would cut off Internet access to entire households , not just individuals accused of illegal file - sharing .
For another , the law , as laid out in French legislation , does not require a court to rule on the denial of access — the individual need only be accused three times .
Opposition to the proposal could further be hindered by the fact the public increasingly views Internet access as a human right .
In a recent poll , nearly 80 percent of people surveyed in 26 countries agreed that the Internet is a “ fundamental human right . ”

The US is among ten countries , plus the EU , currently negotiating the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , a broad international proposal that would bring copyright laws across many developed nations into sync with each other .
According to documents obtained by privacy and security expert Michael Geist , a “ three strikes ” law has been included in drafts of the proposed treaty .
But , months before any decisions on ACTA are expected to be made public , some governments have already rebelled against the three - strikes idea .
Last week , by a vote of 663 to 13 , the European Parliament condemned the secretive ACTA negotiations and forbade member countries from passing “ three strikes ” laws .
ADVERTISEMENT
But , as Nate Anderson at Ars Technica points out , the Obama administration appears to be taking a different view .
In a speech at the US Export - Import Bank last week , President Obama pointed to ACTA as a cornerstone of the White House ’s intellectual property strategy .
“ We ’re going to aggressively protect our intellectual property , ” Obama said .
“ That ’s why [ the Office of the US Trade Representative ] is using the full arsenal of tools available to crack down on practices that blatantly harm our businesses , and that includes negotiating proper protections and enforcing our existing agreements , and moving forward on new agreements , including the proposed Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement . ”
Roto Mortar was written for the 2010 LISP Game Design Challenge .
The challenge was to design and implement a game in seven days using some LISP dialect .
The KPs have been beating on your base all week .
Your defenses are just about to collapse .
In fact , your mortar cannons are both on the fritz .
Billy Bob , the ACME Repair Guy , has just gotten one of your mortar cannons back online .
Unfortunately , he had to wire things a little wonky .
Your cannon is spinning all on its own .
You ’ve only got one button to control both the elevation of the cannon and when to fire it .
And , you better fire it , because the KPs are still coming at you .
Inspiration
A few years ago , I read the book Game Design Workshop : Designing , Prototyping , and Playtesting Games .
One of the exercises in the first chapter is to design a game with a “ one- button interface ” .
At the time , I did n’t come up with anything particularly thrilling .
When I started brainstorming what to do for this Game Challenge , I remembered that exercise .
I came up with this concept just under ( as in 3.5 hours under ) seven days ago .
The game is nowhere near as polished as I ’d like … but it was a 7 - day thing .
And , it was fun to take a break from Objective C to get back to some Lisp programming .
Obtaining It
You can find out more about the game , including where to get the source and a Mac OS X binary , on the game ’s web page .
As strike action looms at British Airways , many are outraged at the prospect of disruption , but for others the issue is about an airline that became an extension of British national identity , says John Strickland .
Had you gazed out across the apron of an international airport 30 years ago , the sight of the arrayed tailfins would have looked not unlike a United Nations flag display .
An airline 's colours were often simply those of its home country 's flag .
Green , white and red for the Italian carrier Alitalia , a square white cross on a red background that denoted Swissair , the maple leaf of Air Canada and , of course , the red , white and blue designed to induce a pang of patriotism in any far - flung British traveller - the colours of British Airways .
HISTORY OF A FLAG CARRIER British Airways was formed in 1974
The new government - owned airline was a merger of BOAC and BEA
The name was a nod to British Airways Ltd , which had been formed in 1935
BA hopes to fly 60 % during strike
It 's no coincidence that the biggest airlines are known as flag carriers .
But the current troubles faced by British Airways , which is set to be hit by seven days of strikes by cabin crews , serve as a reminder that while the term flag carrier is still often bandied around its status is in the balance .
Do flag carriers still have a place in the air - travelling public 's imagination ?
Flag carriers were a product of the immediate post - war world when governments around the globe saw the emergence of air travel as a means to " wave the flag " for their respective countries .
Airlines , which were typically owned by their governments , were not so much businesses as prized trophies - each a self - conscious statement that their country had a place on the global stage .
In this heyday of " romantic " air travel , the UK , which had form as a country punching above its small island weight , actually had two flag carriers : BEA ( British European Airways ) in Europe and BOAC ( British Overseas Airways Corporation ) on long - haul flights .
Both were state - owned .
Similar companies performed the role in other parts of the world , with examples including Air France and Lufthansa in Europe and Pan Am and TWA in the USA ( the latter two actually being privately owned ) .
Fly the Flag Britain 's airborne ambitions were further enhanced when , in 1974 , its two big airlines joined forces to form one giant flag carrier , British Airways , a name that had originally been registered in 1935 .
Does this appeal on a patriotic level ?
The livery began to feature a stylised union jack and for those inured to subtlety , its advertising campaigns urged us to " Fly the Flag " .
But as government ownership gave way to privatisation in 1987 , so British Airways ' emphasis evolved from flag carrier to profit turner .
As the management era of Lord King and Sir Colin Marshall began , the objectives of greater efficiency , customer service and the promotion of brand values came to the fore .
That 's not to say that national identity and " Britishness " did n't continue to play a part .
But as other European governments began to look enviously at BA 's growing profitability , the airline industry started to shift .
Deregulation , liberalisation , greater competition and consumer choice were becoming the watchwords .
In a profit - driven world , the sentiment induced by flag carriers is no rival for the hard bitten , price - slashing tactics of low - cost airlines such as Easyjet and Ryanair .
Yet letting go of a piece of national heritage is hard and still , today , many airlines are treated as flag carrier first , business concern second .
The " budgets " have turned the idea of flag carriers ' status and national identity on its head .
Status trappings
While Ryanair and Easyjet both started operations in the UK market , today they are pan-European businesses that have successfully applied their formula across cultural and national boundaries without resistance to their lack of patriotic identity .
Alitalia has been saved by political will , but the point is well made when we reflect that the biggest airline in Italy is now ...
Ryanair
The low - cost airline for which I worked , Buzz ( British - based , Dutch - owned , sold to Ryanair ) , flew French customers between French cities such as Bordeaux and Grenoble while customers happily purchased and ate our British - baked croissants .
While many still see British Airways as the UK 's flag carrier in the skies , it has shed many of the trappings of that status .
Indeed , its ill - fated multicultural tailfins were a deliberate attempt to break away from the ball - and - chain of British identity in a globalised world .
Margaret
Thatcher 's famous dismissal of the new livery , with a strategically placed handkerchief , coupled with customer backlash , suggests even the most free market - orientated of thinkers cannot shed the sentimental attachment to national identity .
It 's perhaps ironic that the airline business as a truly global industry attracts such powerful feelings of patriotism and political pride .
Warm feeling
However as airlines battle their worst financial crisis ever and as many have fallen by the wayside or been bought by competitors , consolidation is the ongoing trend with a widespread recognition in the industry that financially it simply is not sustainable for every country to maintain its own flag carrier .
Not exactly a livery in the spirit of flag carrying
The experience of Alitalia is a case in point .
The company , wracked by losses and industrial strife on an altogether grander scale than those affecting BA , would ordinarily have died a natural death .
However it has been saved by political will , albeit in a reduced form , but the point is well made when we reflect that the biggest airline in Italy is now ... Ryanair .
There is no doubt that there is an intangible warm feeling for many customers in boarding an aircraft representing elements of their own national culture and possibly with the national flag on the tail .
British Airways has managed to successfully capitalise on these feelings and to do so profitably until the global financial problems of the last two years .
However there is no place for sentiment , the ultra-lean and non-nationalistically aligned low cost carriers have brought a new reality to the marketplace .
They have shown that a multiplicity of customers is happy to use them .
There is n't room for all the flag carriers that still exist and those that survive will have to find the right blend of empathetic imagery combined with a hardnosed focus on efficiency and profitability .

Below is a selection of your comments
My family and I flew BA once on a trip from Seattle to Rome .
We still talk about the flight as much as we do the vacation .
Flying British Airways is the only flight I 've been in in thirty years where you felt special and were treated that way by the crew .
Marshall Pinkston , Boise , Idaho -- USA
Having been flying back and forth to Europe several times a year for many years , I have experienced several European airlines , BA being the latest .
The multinational cabin crew , while attentive is still multinational ( mostly Brazilian , probably cheaper ) .
Regret to say that BA has lost the kind of " British " service one had come to expect .
Air France goes out of their way to make sure their customers feel they are in France at 30,000 ft as do Iberia and Lufthansa in varying degrees .
In any event , BA 's fares are currently not competitive in the face of their rivals on the same routes .
A great shame .
Charles Jordan , Buenos Aires , Argentina Yes ...
It may be hard to believe , but from my perspective ( an American living and working in the UK ) , there is still great value , both for the airline and the nation , in being recognized as a ' flag carrier ' .
Why ?
It 's an issue of brand - and , in business , there is NOTHING more important .
Corporations spend billions creating , maintaining , and defending their brands - it truly is critical to their success .
For a discount airline - an EasyJet or RyanAir - the brand is " cheapest available " , and little more ...
However , the brand of a flag carrier represents a " safe choice " for passengers , with an expectation of safety and quality service , and some element of prestige .
And because a disruptive strike damages the brand - and it most surely does - the union 's actions serve to destroy , little - by - little , their livelihood .

I 'm not in the least bothered whether British Airways carries a flag or a folded flypaper .
I 'm much more concerned about the destruction of the Post Office network - something that really impacts on ordinary people 's lives .
Roger , Morpeth BA is no longer a national airline : it became London Airways when it abandoned customers living in the rest of the UK .
Mark Jameson , Leeds I have flown the world over .
You would not believe the condition and inconvenience of most of the worlds airlines .
It 's always a relief to know when I have been booked on BA .
The food , service and seating are always good .
There are some standards that are just too expensive for non-flag carriers to maintain .
This is where BA , showing the flag , maintains a standard that others try to emulate .
Standards should not be sacrificed for the short - sighted and brief convenience of expense and share holder profit .
Keith , Galveston , Texas
Those of us who live away from London are bemused at the national media 's fixation with what is , in reality , local news !
BA has long since ceased to be a national airline , becoming instead a regional carrier for the South - East .
I frequently travel on business , across Europe and worldwide , but hardly ever with BA .
Flying BA typically means connecting in London , while there is usually another carrier flying direct from Manchester .
And even when there are no direct flights , it is usually pleasanter and more reliable to connect in Paris , Amsterdam or Chicago than LHR .
Mark , Manchester
There are certain advantages to having a state carrier .
Very senior govt and royalty can fly BA in safety and do n't need an " Airforce One " .

Mit Diskussionen um die Sicherheit von Kernkraftwerken bin ich aufgewachsen , meine AKW - Nee- Broschen rosten vermutlich irgendwo im Keller meiner Eltern vor sich hin , den Aktivismus von einst hat der Alltag rationalisiert , und trotzdem ich Atomkraft nach wie vor ablehne , kann ich nicht behaupten , dass mich die Angst vor einem GAU um den Schlaf bringt .
Wie sehr auch Verantwortliche auf das Prinzip Hoffnung bauen , zeigt die NDR - Dokumentation „ Die Atomlüge “ .
Wer hätte gedacht , dass es überhaupt keine Pläne darüber gibt , was im Ernstfall mit der Bevölkerung im direkten Umfeld eines AKWs passiert , dass es nicht einmal eine Antwort auf die Frage gibt , von wem ein brennender Reaktor gelöscht wird ?
Mit Hochachtung , so erzählt ein ehemaliger Kerningenieur , habe man seinerzeit die Arbeit der Kollegen in Tschernobyl beobachtet , wissend , dass man auf eine solche Katastrophe in Deutschland nicht so schnell hätte reagieren können , weil es in Deutschland nicht möglich gewesen wäre , tausende Sicherheitskräfte zu „ verheizen “ .
Je einfacher die Fragen sind , die Gesine Enwaldt in „ Die Atomlüge “ stellt , desto erschütternder sind die Antworten .
Wenn es denn überhaupt welche gibt .
Wer die gruselige „ Was - passiert - dann “ - Dokumentation gestern Abend im TV verpasst hat , kann sich dank NDR - Mediathek eine lohnenswerte Portion Beunruhigung abholen .

This just in from mobile analytics company Flurry : Nexus
One sales are still flopping .
After 74 days on the market , Flurry estimates that Google has sold 135,000 Nexus Ones .
In its first 74 days on the market , the Droid sold 1.05 million units .
In the iPhone 's first 74 days on the market , it sold 1 million units .
For further context , the iPad just went on sale in an online - only mode and sold an estimated 152,000 units in three days .
None of these comparisons can be " apples to apples . "
The Nexus One is only available online , and only through T - Mobile .
The original iPhone was a completely new style phone and it cost $ 600 when it came out .
The Droid is on Verizon , sold for $ 200 during the holidays and marketed like crazy .
The iPad is a totally new and unique product .
Even with all those caveats , it 's evident that Google 's plan to disrupt the carriers by selling direct to the consumer is off to a very rocky start .

” No absolute openness on ACTA , ” says Commissioner Neelie Kroes in an article in Dutch .
If this is indeed the official position of the Commission , it is very alarming .
Article 218 of the Lisbon Treaty ( TFEU ) says that when it comes to international negotiations ,
10 . The European Parliament shall be immediately and fully informed at all stages of the procedure .
What part of that sentence does the Commission find hard to understand ?
The Commission needs to clarify if it really intends to completely disregard the resolution adopted by a nearly unanimous Parliament last week .
Together with eight other members of the Green Group in the European Parliament , I have co-signed a written question to the Commission ( pdf ) :
Statements by vice - President Neelie Kroes of the Commission concerning the negotiations on the ACTA agreement
In a Dutch newspaper interview the vice - President of the Commission and Commissioner for the Digital Agenda Neelie Kroes stated that the European Commission should not give response to the demand of Parliament for full transparency and openness concerning the negotiations on the ACTA agreement .
Does the Commission concur with the statement , rendered by her vice - President , not to give response to Parliament ’s demand of full transparency and openness concerning the negotiations on the ACTA agreement ?
Does the Commission concur with the view , of her vice - President , that certain information should remain undisclosed for Parliament ?
Is the Commission aware of the fact that the aforementioned statement de facto implies that the Commission has to set aside its statutory obligation to inform Parliament fully , immediately and at all times , as promulgated in article 218 paragraph 10 TFEU ?
Is the Commission furthermore aware that the aforementioned statement is in clear contradiction with the joint resolution ” on the transparency and state of play of the ACTA negotiations ” adopted almost unanimously by Parliament .
Will the Commission issue a statement indicating its stance on transparency and openness relating to its ( future ) conduct in regard to the negotiations on the ACTA agreement ?
And if so , will this imply that the earlier differing opinions and statements rendered by her Commissioners should be considered as revoked ?
These are very sharp questions , and they are meant to be .
It will be very interesting to see what the Commission answers .

Barbour : Health bill like forcing gun purchases
In an apparent effort to jumble the battle lines in the fight over health care reform , Mississippi Republican Gov. Haley Barbour on Sunday compared the individual mandate for health insurance to forcing Americans to buy guns .
" Not only you must buy a product called health insurance , you must buy a product that has been approved by the United States government , and the price of that product will be fixed by the United States , " Barbour said on ABC's " This Week . "
" I do not believe the United States government has a right , it has the authority or power to force us to purchase health insurance any more than , in the name of homeland security , they can force every American to have to buy a gun , " the governor said .
Barbour was endorsing lawsuits that Republican attorneys general have filed , challenging the constitutionality of the legislation and rebutting a comment in which former Reagan Solicitor General Charles Fried dismissed the suits as posturing .
" Anybody who proposes something like this is either ignorant -- I mean , deeply ignorant -- or just grandstanding in a preposterous way .
It is simply a political ploy and a pathetic one at that , " Fried told ABC .
Over the last few years , I 've occasionally commented on JavaScript 's RegExp API , syntax , and behavior on the ES - Discuss mailing list .
Recently , JavaScript inventor Brendan
Eich suggested that , in order to get more discussion going , I write up a list of regex changes to consider for future ECMAScript standards ( or as he humorously put it , have my " 95 [ regex ] theses nailed to the ES3 cathedral door " ) .
I figured I 'd give it a shot , but I 'm going to split my response into a few parts .
In this post , I 'll be discussing issues with the current RegExp API and behavior .
I 'll be leaving aside new features that I 'd like to see added , and merely suggesting ways to make existing capabilities better .
I 'll discuss possible new features in a follow - up post .
For a language as widely used as JavaScript , any realistic change proposal must strongly consider backward compatibility .
For this reason , some of the following proposals might not be particularly realistic , but nevertheless I think that a ) it 's worthwhile to consider what might change if backward compatibility was n't a concern , and b ) in the long run , all of these changes would improve the ease of use and predictability of how regular expressions work in JavaScript .
Remove RegExp.prototype.lastIndex and replace it with an argument for start position
Actual proposal : Deprecate RegExp.prototype.lastIndex and add a " pos " argument to the RegExp.prototype.exec /test methods
JavaScript 's lastIndex property serves too many purposes at once :
It lets users manually specify where to start a regex search
You could claim this is not lastIndex 's intended purpose , but it 's nevertheless an important use since there 's no alternative feature that allows this .
lastIndex is not very good at this task , though .
You need to compile your regex with the /g flag to let lastIndex be used this way ; and even then , it only specifies the starting position for the regexp.exec / test methods .
It can not be used to set the start position for the string .
match / replace / search / split methods .
It indicates the position where the last match ended Even though you could derive the match end position by adding the match index and length , this use of lastIndex serves as a convenient and commonly used compliment to the index property on match arrays returned by exec .
Like always , using lastIndex like this works only for regexes compiled with / g .
It 's used to track the position where the next search should start
This comes into play , e.g. , when using a regex to iterate over all matches in a string .
However , the fact that lastIndex is actually set to the end position of the last match rather than the position where the next search should start ( unlike equivalents in other programming languages ) causes a problem after zero - length matches , which are easily possible with regexes like / \w*/g or /^/mg .
Hence , you 're forced to manually increment lastIndex in such cases .
I 've posted about this issue in more detail before ( see : An IE lastIndex Bug with Zero - Length Regex Matches ) , as has Jan Goyvaerts ( Watch Out for Zero - Length Matches ) .
Unfortunately , lastIndex 's versatility results in it not working ideally for any specific use .
I think lastIndex is misplaced anyway ; if you need to store a search 's ending ( or next - start ) position , it should be a property of the target string and not the regular expression .
Here are three reasons this would work better :
It would let you use the same regex with multiple strings , without losing track of the next search position within each one .
It would allow using multiple regexes with the same string and having each one pick up from where the last one left off .
If you search two strings with the same regex , you 're probably not expecting the search within the second string to start from an arbitrary position just because a match was found in the first string .
In fact , Perl uses this approach of storing next - search positions with strings to great effect , and adds various features around it .
So that 's my case for lastIndex being misplaced , but I go one further in that I do n't think lastIndex should be included in JavaScript at all .
Perl 's tactic works well for Perl ( especially when considered as a complete package ) , but some other languages ( including Python ) let you provide a search - start position as an argument when calling regex methods , which I think is an approach that is more natural and easier for developers to understand and use .
I 'd therefore fix lastIndex by getting rid of it completely .
Regex methods and regex - using string methods would use internal search position trackers that are not observable by the user , and the exec and test methods would get a second argument ( called pos , for position ) that specifies where to start their search .
It might be convenient to also give the String methods search , match , replace , and split their own pos arguments , but that is not as important and the functionality it would provide is not currently possible via lastIndex anyway .
Following are examples of how some common uses of lastIndex could be rewritten if these changes were made :
Start search from position 5 , using lastIndex ( the staus quo ) :
var regexGlobal = /\w+/g , result ; regexGlobal.lastIndex = 5 ; result = regexGlobal.test ( str ) ; regexGlobal.lastIndex = 0 ; var regexNonglobal = /\w+/ ; regexNonglobal.lastIndex = 5 ; result = regexNonglobal.test(str.slice ( 5 ) ) ;
Start search from position 5 , using pos :
var regex = /\w+/ , result = regex.test ( str , 5 ) ;
Match iteration , using lastIndex :
var regex = / \w*/g , matches = [ ] , match ; while ( match = regex.exec ( str ) ) { matches.push ( match ) ; if ( regex.lastIndex == match.index ) { regex.lastIndex ++ ; } }
Match iteration , using pos :
var regex = / \w*/ , pos = 0 , matches = [ ] , match ; while ( match = regex.exec ( str , pos ) ) { matches .
push ( match ) ; pos = match.index + ( match [ 0 ] .length || 1 ) ; }
Of course , you could easily add your own sugar to further simplify match iteration , or JavaScript could add a method dedicated to this purpose similar to Ruby 's scan ( although JavaScript already sort of has this via the use of replacement functions with string .
replace ) .
To reiterate , I 'm describing what I would do if backward compatibility was irrelevant .
I do n't think it would be a good idea to add a pos argument to the exec and test methods unless the lastIndex property was deprecated or removed , due to the functionality overlap .
If a pos argument existed , people would expect pos to be 0 when it 's not specified .
Having lastIndex around to sometimes screw up this expectation would be confusing and probably lead to latent bugs .
Hence , if lastIndex was deprecated in favor of pos , it should be a means toward the end of removing lastIndex altogether .
Remove String.prototype.match's nonglobal operating mode
Actual proposal : Deprecate String.prototype.match and add a new matchAll method
String.prototype.match currently works very differently depending on whether the /g ( global ) flag has been set on the provided regex :
For regexes with /g :
If no matches are found , null is returned ; otherwise an array of simple matches is returned .
: If no matches are found , is returned ; otherwise an array of simple matches is returned .
For regexes without /g :
The match method operates as an alias of regexp.exec .
If a match is not found , null is returned ; otherwise you get an array containing the ( single ) match in key zero , with any backreferences stored in the array 's subsequent keys .
The array is also assigned special index and input properties .
The match method 's nonglobal mode is confusing and unnecessary .
The reason it 's unnecessary is obvious :
If you want the functionality of exec , just use it ( no need for an alias ) .
It 's confusing because , as described above , the match method 's two modes return very different results .
The difference is not merely whether you get one match or all matches — you get a completely different kind of result .
And since the result is an array in either case , you have to know the status of the regex 's global property to know which type of array you 're dealing with .
I 'd change string .
match by making it always return an array containing all matches in the target string .
I 'd also make it return an empty array , rather than null , when no matches are found ( an idea that comes from Dean Edwards 's base2 library ) .
If you want the first match only or you need backreferences and extra match details , that 's what regexp.exec is for .
Unfortunately , if you want to consider this change as a realistic proposal , it would require some kind of language version - or mode - based switching of the match method 's behavior ( unlikely to happen , I would think ) .
So , instead of that , I 'd recommend deprecating the match method altogether in favor of a new method ( perhaps RegExp.prototype.matchAll ) with the changes prescribed above .
Get rid of /g and RegExp.prototype.global
Actual proposal : Deprecate /g and RegExp.prototype.global , and add a boolean replaceAll argument to String.prototype.replace
If the last two proposals were implemented and therefore regexp.lastIndex and string .
match were things of the past ( or string .
match no longer sometimes served as an alias of regexp.exec ) , the only method where /g would still have any impact is string .
replace .
Additionally , although /g follows prior art from Perl , etc. , it does n't really make sense to have something that is not an attribute of a regex stored as a regex flag .
Really , /g is more of a statement about how you want methods to apply their own functionality , and it's not uncommon to want to use the same pattern with and without /g ( currently you 'd have to construct two different regexes to do so ) .
If it was up to me , I 'd get rid of the /g flag and its corresponding global property , and instead simply give the string .
replace method an additional argument that indicates whether you want to replace the first match only ( the default handling ) or all matches .
This could be done with either a replaceAll boolean or , for greater readability , a scope string that accepts values ' one ' and ' all ' .
This new argument would have the additional benefit of allowing replace - all functionality with nonregex searches .
Note that SpiderMonkey already has a proprietary third string .
replace argument ( " flags " ) that this proposal would conflict with .
I doubt this conflict would cause much heartburn , but in any case , a new replaceAll argument would provide the same functionality that SpiderMonkey 's flags argument is most useful for ( that is , allowing global replacements with nonregex searches ) .
Change the behavior of backreferences to nonparticipating groups
Actual proposal : Make backreferences to nonparticipating groups fail to match
I 'll keep this brief since David " liorean " Andersson and I have previously argued for this on ES - Discuss and elsewhere .
David posted about this in detail on his blog ( see : ECMAScript 3 Regular Expressions : A specification that does n't make sense ) , and I 've previously touched on it here ( ECMAScript 3 Regular Expressions are Defective by Design ) .
On several occasions , Brendan Eich has also stated that he'd like to see this changed .
The short explanation of this behavior is that , in JavaScript , backreferences to capturing groups that have not ( yet ) participated in a match always succeed ( i.e. , they match the empty string ) , whereas the opposite is true in all other regex flavors : they fail to match and therefore cause the regex engine to backtrack or fail .
JavaScript 's behavior means that /( a|( b ) ) \2c/.test ( " ac " ) returns true .
The ( negative ) implications of this reach quite far when pushing the boundaries of regular expressions .
I think everyone agrees that changing to the traditional backreferencing behavior would be an improvement — it provides far more intuitive handling , compatibility with other regex flavors , and great potential for creative use ( e.g. , see my post on Mimicking Conditionals ) .
The bigger question is whether it would be safe , in light of backward compatibility .
I think it would be , since I imagine that more or less no one uses the unintuitive JavaScript behavior intentionally .
The JavaScript behavior amounts to automatically adding a ?
quantifier after backreferences to nonparticipating groups , which is what people already do explicitly if they actually want backreferences to nonzero - length subpatterns to be optional .
Also note that Safari 3.0 and earlier did not follow the spec on this point and used the more intuitive behavior , although that has changed in more recent versions ( notably , this change was due to a write up on my blog rather than reports of real - world errors ) .
Finally , it 's probably worth noting that .
NET 's ECMAScript regex mode ( enabled via the RegexOptions .
ECMAScript flag ) indeed switches .
NET to ECMAScript 's unconventional backreferencing behavior .
Make \d \ D \w \ W \b \ B support Unicode ( like \s \S . ^ $ , which already do )
Actual proposal : Add a /u flag ( and corresponding RegExp.prototype.unicode property ) that changes the meaning of \d , \w , \b , and related tokens
Unicode - aware digit and word character matching is not an existing JavaScript capability ( short of constructing character class monstrosities that are hundreds or thousands of characters long ) , and since JavaScript lacks lookbehind you can't reproduce a Unicode - aware word boundary .
You could therefore say this proposal is outside the stated scope of this post , but I 'm including it here because I consider this more of a fix than a new feature .
According to current JavaScript standards , \s , \S , . , ^ , and $ use Unicode - based interpretations of whitespace and newline , whereas \d , \ D , \w , \ W , \b , and \B use ASCII - only interpretations of digit , word character , and word boundary ( e.g. , /na\b/.test ( " naïve " ) unfortunately returns true ) .
See my post on JavaScript , Regex , and Unicode for further details .
Adding Unicode support to these tokens would cause unexpected behavior for thousands of websites , but it could be implemented safely via a new /u flag ( inspired by Python 's re.U or re.UNICODE flag ) and a corresponding RegExp.prototype.unicode property .
Since it 's actually fairly common to not want these tokens to be Unicode enabled in particular regex patterns , a new flag that activates Unicode support would offer the best of both worlds .
Change the behavior of backreference resetting during subpattern repetition
Actual proposal : Never reset backreference values during a match
Like the last backreferencing issue , this too was covered by David Andersson in his post ECMAScript 3 Regular Expressions : A specification that does n't make sense .
The issue here involves the value remembered by capturing groups nested within a quantified , outer group ( e.g. , /( ( a ) | ( b ) ) */ ) .
According to traditional behavior , the value remembered by a capturing group within a quantified grouping is whatever the group matched the last time it participated in the match .
So , the value of $ 1 after /(?:( a ) |( b ) ) */ is used to match " ab " would be " a " .
However , according to ES3 / ES5 , the value of backreferences to nested groupings is reset / erased after the outer grouping is repeated .
Hence , /(?:( a ) |( b ) ) */ would still match " ab " , but after the match is complete $ 1 would reference a nonparticipating capturing group , which in JavaScript would match an empty string within the regex itself , and be returned as undefined in , e.g. , the array returned by the regexp.exec .
My case for change is that current JavaScript behavior breaks from the norm in other regex flavors , does not lend itself to various types of creative patterns ( see one example in my post on Capturing Multiple , Optional HTML Attribute Values ) , and in my opinion is far less intuitive than the more common , alternative regex behavior .
I believe this behavior is safe to change for two reasons .
First , this is generally an edge case issue for all but hardcore regex wizards , and I 'd be surprised to find regexes that rely on JavaScript 's version of this behavior .
Second , and more importantly , Internet Explorer does not implement this rule and follows the more traditional behavior .
Add an /s flag , already
Actual proposal : Add an /s flag ( and corresponding RegExp.prototype.dotall property ) that changes dot to match all characters including newlines
I 'll sneak this one in as a change / fix rather than a new feature since it's not exactly difficult to use [ \s \S ] in place of a dot when you want the behavior of /s .
I presume the /s flag has been excluded thus far to save novices from themselves and limit the damage of runaway backtracking , but what ends up happening is that people write horrifically inefficient patterns like ( . |\r|
) * instead .
Regex searches in JavaScript are seldom line - based , and it's therefore more common to want dot to include newlines than to match anything - but - newlines ( although both modes are useful ) .
It makes good sense to keep the default meaning of dot ( no newlines ) since it is shared by other regex flavors and required for backward compatibility , but adding support for the /s flag is overdue .
A boolean indicating whether this flag was set should show up on regexes as a property named either singleline ( the unfortunate name from Perl , . NET , etc. ) or the more descriptive dotall ( used in Java , Python , PCRE , etc. ) .
Personal preferences
Following are a few changes that would suit my preferences , although I do n't think most people would consider them significant issues :
Allow regex literals to use unescaped forward slashes within character clases ( e.g. , /[/ ]/ ) .
This was already included in the abandoned ES4 change proposals .
) .
This was already included in the abandoned ES4 change proposals .
Allow an unescaped ] as the first character in character classes ( e.g. , [ ] ] or [ ^ ] ] ) .
This is allowed in probably every other regex flavor , but creates an empty class followed by a literal ] in JavaScript .
I 'd like to imagine that no one uses empty classes intentionally , since they do n't work consistently cross - browser and there are widely - used / common - sense alternatives ( (?!) instead of [ ] , and [ \s \S ] instead of [ ^ ] ) .
Unfortunately , adherence to this JavaScript quirk is tested in Acid3 ( test 89 ) , which is likely enough to kill requests for this backward - incompatible but reasonable change .

Change the $& token used in replacement strings to $ 0 .
It just makes sense .
( Equivalents in other replacement text flavors for comparison : Perl : $ & ; Java : $ 0 ; .NET : $ 0 , $ & ; PHP : $ 0 , \0 ; Ruby : \0 , \& ; Python : \ g < 0 > . )
token used in replacement strings to .
It just makes sense .
( Equivalents in other replacement text flavors for comparison : Perl : ; Java : ; .NET : , ; PHP : , ; Ruby : , ; Python : .)
Get rid of the special meaning of [ \b ] .
Within character classes , the metasequence \b matches a backspace character ( equivalent to \x08 ) .
This is a worthless convenience since no one cares about matching backspace characters , and it 's confusing given that \b matches a word boundary when used outside of character classes .
Even though this would break from regex tradition ( which I 'd usually advocate following ) , I think that \b should have no special meaning inside character classes and simply match a literal b .
Fixed in ES3 : Remove octal character references
ECMAScript 3 removed octal character references from regular expression syntax , although \0 was kept as a convenient exception that allows easily matching a NUL character .
However , browsers have generally kept full octal support around for backward compatibility .
Octals are very confusing in regular expressions since their syntax overlaps with backreferences and an extra leading zero is allowed outside of character classes .
Consider the following regexes :
/ a\1/ : \ 1 is an octal .
: is an octal .
/( a) \1 / : \ 1 is a backreference .
: is a backreference .
/( a ) [ \1 ] / : \ 1 is an octal .
: is an octal .
/( a) \1\2/ : \ 1 is a backreference ; \ 2 is an octal .
: is a backreference ; is an octal .
/( a) \01\001[ \01\001 ] / :
All occurences of \01 and \001 are octals .
However , according to the ES3 + specs , the numbers after each \0 should be treated ( barring nonstandard extensions ) as literal characters , completely changing what this regex matches .
( Edit - 2012 : Actually , a close reading of the spec shows that any 0 - 9 following \0 should cause a SyntaxError . )
: All occurences of and are octals .
However , according to the ES3 + specs , the numbers after each should be treated ( barring nonstandard extensions ) as literal characters , completely changing what this regex matches .
( Edit - 2012 : Actually , a close reading of the spec shows that any 0 - 9 following should cause a . ) /( a) \0001 [ \0001 ] / :
The \0001 outside the character class is an octal ; but inside , the octal ends at the third zero ( i.e. , the character class matches character index zero or " 1 " ) .
This regex is therefore equivalent to /( a) \x01[\x00\x31 ] / ; although , as mentioned just above , adherence to ES3 would change the meaning .
: The outside the character class is an octal ; but inside , the octal ends at the third zero ( i.e. , the character class matches character index zero or ) .
This regex is therefore equivalent to ; although , as mentioned just above , adherence to ES3 would change the meaning .
/( a) \00001 [ \00001 ]/ :
Outside the character class , the octal ends at the fourth zero and is followed by a literal " 1 " .
Inside , the octal ends at the third zero and is followed by a literal " 01 " .
And once again , ES3's exclusion of octals and inclusion of \0 could change the meaning .
: Outside the character class , the octal ends at the fourth zero and is followed by a literal .
Inside , the octal ends at the third zero and is followed by a literal .
And once again , ES3's exclusion of octals and inclusion of could change the meaning .
/\1(a ) / : Given that , in JavaScript , backreferences to capturing groups that have not ( yet ) participated match the empty string , does this regex match " a " ( i.e. , \ 1 is treated as a backreference since a corresponding capturing group appears in the regex ) or does it match " \x01a " ( i.e. , the \ 1 is treated as an octal since it appears before its corresponding group ) ?
Unsurprisingly , browsers disagree .

Unsurprisingly , browsers disagree .
/( \2(a ) ) {2} / :
Now things get really hairy .
Does this regex match " aa " , " aaa " , " \x02aaa " , " 2aaa " , " \x02a\x02a " , or " 2a2a " ?
All of these options seem plausible , and browsers disagree on the correct choice .
There are other issues to worry about , too , like whether octal escapes go up to \377 ( \xFF , 8 - bit ) or \ 777 ( \u01 FF , 9 - bit ) ; but in any case , octals in regular expressions are a confusing cluster - cuss .
Even though ECMAScript has already cleaned up this mess by removing support for octals , browsers have not followed suit .
I wish they would , because unlike browser makers , I do n't have to worry about this bit of legacy ( I never use octals in regular expressions , and neither should you ) .
Fixed in ES5 : Do n't cache regex literals
According to ES3 rules , regex literals did not create a new regex object if a literal with the same pattern / flag combination was already used in the same script or function ( this did not apply to regexes created by the RegExp constructor ) .
A common side effect of this was that regex literals using the /g flag did not have their lastIndex property reset in some cases where most developers would expect it .
Several browsers did n't follow the spec on this unintuitive behavior , but Firefox did , and as a result it became the second most duplicated JavaScript bug report for Mozilla .
Fortunately , ES5 got rid of this rule , and now regex literals must be recompiled every time they 're encountered ( this change is coming in Firefox 3.7 ) .

So there you have it .
I 've outlined what I think the JavaScript RegExp API got wrong .
Do you agree with all of these proposals , or would you if you did n't have to worry about backward compatibility ?
Are there better ways than what I 've proposed to fix the issues discussed here ?
Got any other gripes with existing JavaScript regex features ?
I 'm eager to hear feedback about this .
Since I 've been focusing on the negative in this post , I 'll note that I find working with regular expressions in JavaScript to be a generally pleasant experience .
There 's a hell of a lot that JavaScript got right .
Remember the much criticised Climate Change ad run by Ed Miliband and the DECC where a father read his daughter a nightmare bedtime story with drowning rabbits and the like ?
This did not breach the Advertising Standards Authority ’s guidelines , unlike the corruption of children ’s nursery rhymes Jack and Jill and Rub a Dub Dub which were used to spread the fear message and wildly exaggerate the potential impact of Anthropogenic Global Warming on the British Isles .
Using the tried and tested “ nothing to see here ” approach that Pope Al Gore and liars like Michael Mann and Phil Jones trot out relentlessly , Miliband ’s adverts ignored Climategate and the many flaws , lies and exaggerations of the 2007 IPCC report and continued with business as usual approach .
The two posters created on behalf of the Department of Energy and Climate Change juxtaposed adapted extracts from the nursery rhymes with prose warnings about the dangers of global warning .
One began : “ Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water .
There was none as extreme weather due to climate change had caused a drought . ”
Beneath was written : “ Extreme weather conditions such as flooding , heat waves and storms will become more frequent and intense . ”
The second advert read : “ Rub a dub dub , three men in a tub — a necessary course of action due to flash flooding caused by climate change . ”
It was captioned : “ Climate change is happening .
Temperature and sea levels are rising .
Extreme weather events such as storms , floods and heat waves will become more frequent and intense .
If we carry on at this rate , life in 25 years could be very different . ”
Upholding complaints from members of the public , the ASA said that in both instances the text accompanying the rhymes should have been couched in softer language .
The newspaper adverts were part of a controversial media campaign launched by the DECC last year which attracted a total of 939 complaints .
Ed Miliband has said his department is completely vindicated by the ASA , see what Aardvark means about the business as usual approach , but promises that future campaigns would better reflect the scientific uncertainty about AGW in future campaigns .
Yeah right , maybe we will indeed see flying pigs one day .
This episode does pose 2 questions :
Why was public money wasted on nothing more than hysterical propaganda and lies , so how could the DECC be vindicated by the ASA unless it ’s missions is to spread propaganda and lies ?
If there is sufficient scientific uncertainty about AGW what is the point of an advertising campaign about something that may or may not happen ?
Unless of course it ’s just another attempt to keep propagating the AGW lie by yet another means .
Updated Vodafone has been blamed for shipping Mariposa botnet malware and other nasties on a HTC Magic Android smartphones it supplied .
The mobile phone giant 's Spanish arm supplied an HTC Magic smartphone preloaded with malware that attempted to establish a backdoor for stealing information on connected PCs during the synchronisation process .
Vodafone acknowledged the problem but said that the incident was an isolated and local problem , which came to light because the customer affected works for Spanish anti-virus firm Panda Security .
The extra code was a strain of the Mariposa bot client that attempted to connect to systems not associated with the recent arrests of three suspected botmasters in Spain , according to an analysis of the attack by Panda Security researcher Pedro Bustamante .
" A quick analysis of the malware reveals that it is in fact a Mariposa bot client , " Bustamante explained .
" This one , unlike the one announced last week which was run by Spanish hacker group ' DDP Team ' , is run by some guy named ' tnls ' as the botnet - control mechanism shows .
" Once infected you can see the malware ' phoning home ' to receive further instructions , probably to steal all of the user ’s credentials and send them to the malware writer , " he added .
The same mobile phone was also infected by Confiker and a Lineage password - stealing code , according to Panda .
The incident came to light because the infected phone was sold to one of Bustamante 's colleagues in Spain .
In a statement , Vodafone said the problem , which it is investigating , was isolated .
Vodafone takes the security and privacy of its customers extremely seriously and launched an immediate investigation into this incident Following extensive Quality Assurance testing on HTC Magic handsets in several of our operating companies , early indications are that this was an isolated local incident Vodafone keeps its security processes under constant review as new threats arise , and we will take all appropriate actions to safeguard our customers ’ privacy .
Incidents where computing devices come preloaded with malware are far from unprecedented .
Normally problems arise when computers used in manufacturing production lines are themselves infected . ®
Update
Although Panda 's screenshot features Vodafone Germany the incident in question happened in Spain .

Some climate change sceptics have been guilty of applying double standards in their condemnation of alleged misdeeds by researchers at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia .
On 25 February , I wrote to Dr Benny Peiser , the director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation which is chaired by Lord Lawson , to warn him that a graph of " 21st century global mean temperature " displayed prominently on his group 's website contains an error .
Instead of showing that 2009 was the warmest year since 2005 , the foundation 's graph portrays it as slightly cooler than 2006 and 2007 .
While it is a relatively small error , it is the kind of discrepancy that many sceptics would be seizing upon if it had been found on the website of the Climatic Research Unit .
Yet Peiser still has not responded to me and the foundation 's graph still remains inaccurate .
And it is not the first such error .
When the foundation first launched its website in late November 2009 , I wrote to Peiser to point out that his graph mistakenly showed 2003 instead of 2005 as the warmest year of the new century .
He replied , acknowledging the error and stating that the graph was intended to represent the HADCRUT3 data series that is compiled by the Met Office 's Hadley Centre and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia .
The foundation corrected the error a few weeks later .
When pressed , Peiser told journalists that " a graphic designer " was to blame for the problem and insisted that the graph was just " a logo " .
Now that the foundation 's " logo " has been updated to include a data point for 2009 , it has introduced a new misrepresentation of the data compiled by the Met Office and the University of East Anglia .
I have also asked Peiser if Professor Ian Plimer , who is a member of the foundation 's " academic advisory council " , was involved in the preparation of the dodgy graph .
Plimer 's recent book , which is promoted heavily as a " reference work " by sceptics , contains a figure which also misrepresents the HADCRUT3 data series .
Yet the inaccurate portrayal of global temperature since 2001 is not the most misleading feature of the foundation 's graph .
It is the fact that it excludes the entire temperature record from the 20th century , and thus the marked increase that has taken place such that nine of the 10 warmest years on record have all occurred in the last decade .
What makes this attempt to " hide the rise " all the more ironic is the fact that the foundation has been so keen to highlight one of the emails , sent in November 1999 by Professor Phil Jones , which includes the phrase " hide the decline " .
As is now well known , this phrase was referring to the practice of adding the instrumental temperatures since the 1960s to a proxy record compiled from tree rings that erroneously indicated a cooling over the last four decades of the 20th century .
In his written submission to the current inquiry into the emails by the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee , the foundation 's chairman , Lord Lawson , described the practice as demonstrating " a lack of integrity " .
Lord Lawson repeated this accusation on 1 March when he and Peiser represented the only pressure group invited by the committee to give oral evidence .
We are still waiting to see how Lord Lawson explains his foundation 's misleading and inaccurate portrayal of the temperature record compiled by the Met Office and the University of East Anglia .

The English Lesson
We 'll begin with box , and the plural is boxes ;
But the plural of ox should be oxen , not oxes .
Then one fowl is goose , but two are called geese , Yet the plural of moose should never be meese .
You may find a lone mouse or a whole lot of mice , But the plural of house is houses , not hice .
If the plural of man is always called men , When could n't the plural of pan be called pen ?
The cow in the plural may be cows or kine , But the plural of vow is vows , not vine .
And I speak of a foot , and you show me your feet , But I give a boot -- would a pair be called beet ?
If one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth , Why should n't the plural of booth be called beeth ?
If the singular is this and plural is these , Why should n't the plural of kiss be called kese ?
Then one may be that , and three may be those , Yet the plural of hat would never be hose ;
We speak of a brother , and also of brethren , But though we say mother , we never say methren .
The masculine pronouns are he , his and him , But imagine the feminine : she , shis and shim !
So our English , I think you will all agree , Is the trickiest language you ever did see .
I take it you already know Of tough and bough and cough and dough ?
Others may stumble , but not you On hiccough , thorough , slough , and through ?
Well done !
And now you wish , perhaps
To learn of less familiar traps ?
Beware of heard , a dreadful word
That looks like beard and sounds like bird .
And dead ; it 's said like bed , not bead ; For goodness ' sake , do n't call it deed !
Watch out for meat and great and threat .
( They rhyme with suite and straight and debt . )
A moth is not a moth in mother , Nor both in bother , broth in brother .
And here is not a match for there .
And dear and fear for bear and pear .
And then there 's close and rose and lose -- Just look them up -- and goose and choose .
And cork and work and card and ward , And font and front and word and sword .
And do and go , then thwart and cart .
Come , come , I 've hardly made a start .
A dreadful language ?
Why , man alive , I 'd learned to talk it when I was five , . . .
And yet to write it , the more I tried , I had n't learned it at fifty - five ! -- anonymous
Australia 's biggest technology companies , communications academics and many lobby groups have delivered a withering critique of the government 's plans to censor the internet .
The government today published most of the 174 submissions it received relating to improving the transparency and accountability measures of its internet filtering policy .
Legislation to force ISPs to implement the policy is expected to be introduced within weeks .
The filters will block a blacklist of " refused classification " websites for all Australians on a mandatory basis .
Most of the submissions called for full transparency surrounding the operation of the list and for all sites placed on the list by bureaucrats at the Australian Communications and Media Authority first to be examined by the Classification Board .
They supported a regular review of the list by an independent expert and the ability for blacklisted sites to appeal .
At the height of the worst Israel - US crisis in decades , Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was forced to distance himself Wednesday from the views of his brother - in - law , who called President Obama " anti-Semitic " over the airwaves this morning .
In an interview with Israel Army Radio on Wednesday , Hagai Ben Artzi , the brother of Netanyahu 's wife Sara , reportedly said : " it needs to be said clearly and simply :
There is an anti-Semitic president in the US .
It 's not that Obama does n't sympathize with [ Mr. Netanyahu ] .
He does n't sympathize with the people of Israel . "
Netanyahu's office swifty published a condemnation : " I entirely reject the remarks of Hagai Ben Artzi . "
IN PICTURES : Israeli settlements
Family ties ?
Mr. Ben Artzi , who has a history of controversial remarks , is family in more than one way .
The hardliner – who 's held positions as a bible lecturer at a religious college in Jerusalem , and in the Education Ministry , and has a doctorate in Israel thought and philosophy from Hebrew University in Jerusalem – also represents the family of hawkish nationalists who support Netanyahu and for whom any movement on the peace process is going to stir tension .
The Israeli daily Haaretz reported that Knesset Member Michael Ben Ari of the far - right National Union party recently hung a poster with a picture in which Obama looks like he is bowing to a Gulf prince , underneath a headline , " Caution ! [ Palestine Liberation Organization ] Agent in the White House !''
Suspicion of Obama
So how widespread are those views of Obama in Israel ?
The opinions recall suspicions voiced about Obama in Israel during his run for the presidency that were based on his Muslim relatives and a former pastor whose sermons occasionally included remarks considered anti-Semitic .
Mitchell Barak , a pollster who used to work with Netanyahu , says there is widespread alienation among Israelis regarding Obama , whom many consider the US president most unsympathetic to Israel for decades .
That said , both Ben Artzi and Ben Ari represent fringe opinions , says Mr. Barak .
" The problem with the extremist right groups , " he says , " is that they can't recognize anyone that does n't shares the opinions of their own group . ''

Richard Racicot .
STONY MOUNTAIN -
The massive search for missing 18 - year - old Richard Racicot has ended with the news that his body has been located .
Moments before a scheduled news conference with the family , the RCMP notified Racicot 's father that his son had been found dead .
Out of respect for notification of kin , the RCMP did not initially say where the body was located .
However , police were gathering at the entrance to a secluded area just down the road from the Stony Mountain Curling Club .
About 2 km southeast of the curling club is an area known as Target Hill , where corrections officers have weapons training .
With the entrance blocked off by police , officers travelled into the area by snowmobile .

BRYKSA@FREEPRESS.MB.CA
A group of snowmobiles search for missing Richard Rachicot who was last seen Saturday leaving a social in the town of Stony Mountain .
The RCMP and the Medical Examiner entered the scene with a bodybag .
" This is a nightmare and it's not getting any better right now , " said Sgt. Line Karpish .
Over 50 volunteers , many of them young , have been combing the area since Sunday morning .
Dressed warmly , some on skis and snowmobiles , they passed out photographs of a clean - cut Racicot .
Many of them are now gathered outside the curling club , crying and consoling each other .
A girl who earlier identified herself as Racicot 's sister sat on the ground , sobbing in the arms of friends .
Stony Mountain is located 15 km north of Winnipeg .
( Newser ) – The man who cracked Barack Obama 's Twitter account says he was merely trying to point out security weaknesses in the system .
Francois Cousteix , an unemployed 23 - year - old from France , describes himself as a " kind pirate " who used low - tech methods of guessing passwords , often aided by info on the Facebook pages of Twitter employees .
" I am not a hacker , " he tells AFP .
" I did not act with a destructive aim . "
Cousteix says he attacked Twitter and high - profile users like Obama and Britney Spears to show " that big companies are no more secure than any Internet user .
That 's the message I wanted to get across . "
Known as " Hacker Croll " online , he is scheduled to go on trial in June and faces 2 years in prison on hacking charges , notes AP .

As an old hand in the Starcraft community , Team Liquid has the unique opportunity of looking at SC2 through the eyes of Starcraft veterans .
Today , we do just that .
Last week , Waxangel
Then , we 're going to sit back and enjoy as Liquid`Drone enters the fray , playing non -stop since receiving a beta key so you guys can have insight from one of the SC community 's oldest competitive players .
Eriador has been around since SC 1.0 , and really , what better way to look at SC2 at the moment than to compare it with how Broodwar looked in its infancy ?

After a hundred odd games of Starcraft II , I can say with certainty that it is very fun .
I can also say to everyone who wanted Starcraft : BW – but better – it ’s not gonna happen .
With Starcraft II , it looks like Blizzard has tried hard to make a game that ’s a true successor to Brood War .
That ’s very different from Warcraft III , where they tried to do something fundamentally different from Warcraft II .
As far as sequels go , Starcraft II is as un-innovative as they get .
You mine resources almost the same way , there are many parallels between the units in both games , the damage / HP ratios are similar , the theory of map making is similar , etc .
It ’s practically an homage to Starcraft 1 .
All this similarity is intentional , because Brood War - but - better really is the goal .
Unfortunately for Blizzard , with all their talent and power , that ’s something they cannot achieve .
Sequels sown in succession , surely some should succeed ?
Over ten years of successful competitive play have proved that Brood War is n’t your ordinary video game .
Other games live out a robust two year life and are replaced by their sequels .
Televised shows , professional gamers , and silly non-Koreans who play an ancient relic of a game prove that Brood War is something else completely .
While Brood War might not yet compare to long - running competitions like chess or basketball , it has become one of those establishments that are defined by their immutability and permanence .
Brood
War is a game of such stature that it transcends succession .
Even the flaws are considered to be a venerable tradition .
One big difference between Starcraft I and II is that the sequel is just too smart .
Starcraft : Brood
War is a game full of stupidity that you have to overcome through quick wits and fast hands .
There are no alerts when dark templars one - hit your workers , melee units refuse to acquire targets intelligently , reavers will shoot duds when told to shoot the wrong targets , and a plethora of other annoying things happen on a regular basis .
Yet , we enjoy overcoming these inconveniences , call it skill , and say that Starcraft II sucks because it ’s not stupid .
An immortal says goodbye to its idiot cousin , the dragoon .
But I ’m not saying Starcraft II sucks .
It ’s not even a matter of one game being better or worse , and beyond being objective or judging .
It ’s just the fact that there is a difference with the original at all .
Starcraft 1 and 2 are like baseball and softball ,
Parallel competition is probably what will end up happening in Korea .
The history of game leagues in Korea has shown us there is room for any amount of games as long as they are popular .
Until they stop getting paid , the Brood War progamers will continue to play Brood War , OnGameNet will sell commercial time during Brood War games , and KeSPA will keep
I was excited when I heard Starcraft II was coming out , but I did n’t know why .
Now that I ’ve tried the beta test , I realize that I was excited because I wanted to play another excellent Blizzard game .
I never needed a sequel to Starcraft , because it was perfect all along .

Being a Starcraft fan is the practice of taking amazing for granted .

Starcraft 1 and 2 are like baseball and softball , rugby league and rugby union , or football and futsol .
One may have inspired the other , but they should be treated as completely different games in competition .
Forget the “ Starcraft ” in “ Starcraft II , ” and give it a shot on its own merits .
Two means new , and nothing else .
Parallel competition is probably what will end up happening in Korea .
The history of game leagues in Korea has shown us there is room for any amount of games as long as they are popular .

Alrighty , it 's time for more time travel .
Let 's go back to 1998 , when dinosaurs ruled the earth and the mighty Eriador grazed the lush planes of Battle .

Starcraft : Then and Now by Liquid`Drone
When Starcraft was first released in March 1998 , few could have imagined that it would remain competitive in 2010 .
However , even disregarding Korea , the greatest tournament outside Korea through those 12 years just finished hours prior to writing this .
In fact , having been around since the very beginning , I can recount several moments where the death of starcraft was announced , perhaps most prominently prior to the release of Blizzard ’s previous RTS game – Warcraft 3 .
None of these predictions came to fruition – our great beloved game is as alive as ever .
Or at least it was , until about 10 days ago , when the Starcraft 2 – Wings of Liberty Beta test was officially opened .
I personally did not get my key until five days ago , and I did not play it until four days ago , because apparently I did not have enough RAM and the computer store was closed because it was after 5 pm on Tuesday .
Ever since I walked home with a brand new computer on Wednesday , my thoughts and actions have been completely occupied with Starcraft 2 , and after the first 160 games or so , I feel somewhat qualified in commenting on how it differs from its precursor – and more importantly , how good is it ?
Few who read this will have played Starcraft during its 1.00 patch .
You did not miss out on a lot .
Especially in public games , the game largely revolved around zerg players creating invincible drones through a bug and doing whatever with those .
Some players had discovered 4 - pooling , and before anyone had a clue how to micro peons , this was pretty deadly .
Cannons dealt explosive damage , sunkens had a slower fire rate than sieged tanks , there were no medics , lurkers , corsairs , dark templars , or those other three brood war units that are hardly ever used .
In fact , months after release , many players were massing scouts , as these units fired almost twice as fast as they do today , and people generally ( ignoring a small community of Kali players who had experience with Warcraft 2 – more on this later ) had no clue how to play and thus allowed people to live long enough to actually assemble a fleet of them .
The invincible drone bug was fixed reasonably fast , but not too long after , terran players discovered how to float command centers right next to their minerals enabling them to mine at almost twice the rate of zerg ’s or protosses .
Frankly the game was so imbalanced at this point , to terran ’s disfavour , that this evened things out more than anything , but it still shows what Starcraft players had to deal with in 1998 .
Yet , we continued playing .
We played this game .
A lot .
The Starcraft we eventually grew to love came in two hugely significant updates .
First :
The 1.04 patch and the Brood War addon gave some much needed balance and seven brand new units .
Second :
The 1.08 patch , which included both the final balance changes as well as the absolutely integral replays .
This patch was not released until May 2001 , and believe me , Starcraft pre-1.08 was a vastly inferior product .
Even so , there certainly was n’t anything better , and we happily played it for three years .
Since then the actual game has stayed the same ( even with ten or so patches - these have been bug fixes or changes to Battle .
Net ) , but Starcraft has evolved a lot .
This however , has been the product of the player - base evolving strategies that both awe the audience and balance the game , non-playing programmers developing extremely valuable addons ( Lan-latency being the most influential ) , Iccup combining the efforts of WGTour and PGTour to create the most perfect ladder ever , and mapmakers ensuring we would have new grounds to combat on every couple months .
Essentially – Starcraft as we know it today is not the game Blizzard published in 1998 .
What they published back then was a much , much less finished game than the beta I have been enjoying for the past four days , but due to blizzard continuing to polish their game three years after the initial release , and fans of starcraft caring more than a decade later , computer game perfection was achieved .
The main difference between playing Starcraft back in 1998 and the Starcraft Two beta in 2010 is not the difference between the games .
It is the difference between the players .
As I mentioned , when Starcraft was first released , almost nobody knew RTS games .
Now , the higher ranks in the different ladder division are dominated by people with thousands of hours of RTS gaming experience .
Although I played a lot of Starcraft the first two years of Starcraft , I can confidently say that I am already a better Starcraft 2 player than I was a Starcraft 1 player in early 2000 .
This is not unique to me – my win ratio so far in the beta is below 70 % , and I notice that mostly everyone I play are well aware of all the integral basics of RTS games .
The players also had different demands
Then and Now – back then , we wanted a fun reasonably balanced real time strategy game .
Now , we want a game where it will be possible to continue improving after playing for a decade .
We want Blizzard to recreate Starcraft , without realizing that the Starcraft we love was , more than anything , a fluke which turned into something absolutely incredible through years of effort from thousands of players and followers .
In fact , some of the greatness of competing in Starcraft stems from being able to overcome the faults of the AI .
Goons killing mines they ca n’t spot ( and often not doing so because they ’re dumb – which is why watching someone do it flawlessly is great ) , vultures jumping past pylons because their pathing gets screwed up for a second when they lay mines , building pylons outside an opponent ’s gateway right before his goons spawn because they follow a predictable spawn - pattern which cannot be decided by the player controlling the gateways .
The usefulness of Mutalisks suddenly multiplied when someone accidentally noticed that you could stack them if you had them hotkeyed together with a far - away unit .
These are all examples of unintentional manipulation of a flawed AI which enabled players to pull of awesome moves .
( Not to toot my own horn too hard . )
Stacked mutalisks explain the importance of micro to an unsuspecting Terran .
Noobification ?
I have noticed a lot of good Starcraft players complaining about Starcraft 2 being too dumbed down .
Complains about MBS and automining have been more prominent than any other , but frankly , I feel these are entirely misguided .
Blizzard has done an absolutely tremendous job listening to the wishes of the Starcraft community of adding redundant clicks to make the game more difficult while maintaining the expectations all non-Starcraft players have with regards to the interface .
While they have enabled MBS and automining , the Chrono Boost from the Nexus , the Queen and the combined scan -mule of the command centre succeeds in both requiring an immense amount of speed to fully utilize and in giving some sense of strategic choice .
With regards to base management , which was the biggest fear I had , I absolutely love Starcraft 2 .
In fact , I love the game in general .
Playing it is immensely fun , the music is stunningly great for all three races ( so far I have exclusively been randoming ) , and it really feels like the better player wins – although there are some imbalances at the moment and some build orders that have particular momentum .
Comparing this – and let us remember that we are at the very beginning of the beta phase – with the actual release of Starcraft 1 , there is not a shadow of doubt in my mind .
Starcraft 2 is a vastly superior game .
The Money is in the Micro
However , and bear in mind that this is stated with very limited experience ...
( And we do need to consider that we are in the first two weeks of the beta test . )
As a long - lasting competitive game , Starcraft 2 might have less ” Awe - factor ” than Starcraft did .
It lacks flashy micromanagement .
Walking up and down cliffs with reapers raping peons , it feels awesome .
But it ’s easy .
I could pull it off quite decently the second game I played with Terran .
Obviously it improves , but most of the micromanagement has the same feel to it .
Blizzard has improved the AI to such an extent that the units actually behave the way you tell them to – but this also means that anyone is able to pull off what they are trying to do .
Watching someone shoot a perfect free kick in football would not be impressive if you knew he just had to decide to do this , it is impressive because even though he knows exactly what to do , it is really difficult to execute it .
This allegory can be transferred to mostly all sports , especially any involving a ball : if it is easy , it ’s not impressive .
Macronation
Now – the macro aspect is wonderful .
This is what most people were afraid of ; that there just would n’t be enough to do .
I myself expected that while writing this , I would find myself stating that despite my inexperience , I felt like there were more things I was n’t able to find time for doing in Starcraft 1 than in starcraft 2 .
This is not even remotely close to the truth .
Starcraft 2 is absolutely riddled with constant tasks that need to be done for optimal play .
In Starcraft 1 , I ’ve had many games where my minerals constantly stayed below 500 despite being on 4 saturated bases .
In starcraft 2 , it appears like everyone is struck by the yellow syndrome – me included .
People just do n’t seem to be able to maintain good macromanagement when they have more than two saturated expansions , and frankly , it ’s rare to even run into someone mining from more than two bases at the same time .
( Quite possibly for this reason . )
Whereas the micro is from my perspective not sufficiently demanding , constantly landing mules , charging whatever building needs to be charged ( especially if you have three nexus ’.. ) , injecting larvea into every hatchery you own , is an aspect of the game where the room for improvement is enormous .
Some final comments , at least for now ; Starcraft 2 feels great .
Blizzard genuinely attempted to remake Starcraft just the way we want it .
They have updated the interface to meet the demands of a new generation – which is absolutely necessary to enthrall an audience consisting ” not solely of ex-Starcraft players ” .
While doing this , they have supplied us with enough additional tasks , and ones that are actually strategically relevant ( although they certainly need some alterations – the supply boost is completely useless , you usually know when you should use the mule , and I think a good 98 % of the time I have used a queen or seen a queen be used , it has been used to inject larvae . ) , to make speed continue to be an important factor .
In fact I am quite certain you will need at least equally high APM to succeed in Starcraft 2 as you need in Starcraft , probably even higher if you play protoss .
There are however , unfortunately , significant problems as well , and I am not sure Blizzard can ( nor wants to ) do anything about these , because they essentially stem from the game being properly programmed .
I am not even certain it ’s possible to intentionally replicate the ” charming flaws ” of Starcraft .
And to be fair : Starcraft happened over ten years .
We are currently at the end of the first ten days of the beta .
Expecting the world ’s greatest computer game to be replicated at this stage is perhaps demanding a little much , even from Blizzard .
If you compare what we have now to what was released in 1998 , applause is the only option .
When Starcraft was first released in March 1998 , few could have imagined that it would remain competitive in 2010 .
However , even disregarding Korea , the greatest tournament outside Korea through those 12 years just finished hours prior to writing this .
In fact , having been around since the very beginning , I can recount several moments where the death of starcraft was announced , perhaps most prominently prior to the release of Blizzard ’s previous RTS game – Warcraft 3 .
None of these predictions came to fruition – our great beloved game is as alive as ever .
Or at least it was , until about 10 days ago , when the Starcraft 2 – Wings of Liberty Beta test was officially opened .
I personally did not get my key until five days ago , and I did not play it until four days ago , because apparently I did not have enough RAM and the computer store was closed because it was after 5 pm on Tuesday .
Ever since I walked home with a brand new computer on Wednesday , my thoughts and actions have been completely occupied with Starcraft 2 , and after the first 160 games or so , I feel somewhat qualified in commenting on how it differs from its precursor – and more importantly , how good is it ?
Few who read this will have played Starcraft during its 1.00 patch .
You did not miss out on a lot .
Especially in public games , the game largely revolved around zerg players creating invincible drones through a bug and doing whatever with those .
Some players had discovered 4 - pooling , and before anyone had a clue how to micro peons , this was pretty deadly .
Cannons dealt explosive damage , sunkens had a slower fire rate than sieged tanks , there were no medics , lurkers , corsairs , dark templars , or those other three brood war units that are hardly ever used .
In fact , months after release , many players were massing scouts , as these units fired almost twice as fast as they do today , and people generally ( ignoring a small community of Kali players who had experience with Warcraft 2 – more on this later ) had no clue how to play and thus allowed people to live long enough to actually assemble a fleet of them .
The invincible drone bug was fixed reasonably fast , but not too long after , terran players discovered how to float command centers right next to their minerals enabling them to mine at almost twice the rate of zerg ’s or protosses .
Frankly the game was so imbalanced at this point , to terran ’s disfavour , that this evened things out more than anything , but it still shows what Starcraft players had to deal with in 1998 .
Yet , we continued playing .
The Starcraft we eventually grew to love came in two hugely significant updates .
First :
The 1.04 patch and the Brood War addon gave some much needed balance and seven brand new units .
Second :
The 1.08 patch , which included both the final balance changes as well as the absolutely integral replays .
This patch was not released until May 2001 , and believe me , Starcraft pre-1.08 was a vastly inferior product .
Even so , there certainly was n’t anything better , and we happily played it for three years .
Since then the actual game has stayed the same ( even with ten or so patches - these have been bug fixes or changes to Battle .
Net ) , but Starcraft has evolved a lot .
This however , has been the product of the player - base evolving strategies that both awe the audience and balance the game , non-playing programmers developing extremely valuable addons ( Lan-latency being the most influential ) , Iccup combining the efforts of WGTour and PGTour to create the most perfect ladder ever , and mapmakers ensuring we would have new grounds to combat on every couple months .
Essentially – Starcraft as we know it today is not the game Blizzard published in 1998 .
What they published back then was a much , much less finished game than the beta I have been enjoying for the past four days , but due to blizzard continuing to polish their game three years after the initial release , and fans of starcraft caring more than a decade later , computer game perfection was achieved .
The main difference between playing Starcraft back in 1998 and the Starcraft Two beta in 2010 is not the difference between the games .
It is the difference between the players .
As I mentioned , when Starcraft was first released , almost nobody knew RTS games .
Now , the higher ranks in the different ladder division are dominated by people with thousands of hours of RTS gaming experience .
Although I played a lot of Starcraft the first two years of Starcraft , I can confidently say that I am already a better Starcraft 2 player than I was a Starcraft 1 player in early 2000 .
This is not unique to me – my win ratio so far in the beta is below 70 % , and I notice that mostly everyone I play are well aware of all the integral basics of RTS games .
The players also had different demands
Then and Now – back then , we wanted a fun reasonably balanced real time strategy game .
Now , we want a game where it will be possible to continue improving after playing for a decade .
We want Blizzard to recreate Starcraft , without realizing that the Starcraft we love was , more than anything , a fluke which turned into something absolutely incredible through years of effort from thousands of players and followers .
In fact , some of the greatness of competing in Starcraft stems from being able to overcome the faults of the AI .
Goons killing mines they ca n’t spot ( and often not doing so because they ’re dumb – which is why watching someone do it flawlessly is great ) , vultures jumping past pylons because their pathing gets screwed up for a second when they lay mines , building pylons outside an opponent ’s gateway right before his goons spawn because they follow a predictable spawn - pattern which cannot be decided by the player controlling the gateways .
The usefulness of Mutalisks suddenly multiplied when someone accidentally noticed that you could stack them if you had them hotkeyed together with a far - away unit .
These are all examples of unintentional manipulation of a flawed AI which enabled players to pull of awesome moves .
( Not to toot my own horn too hard .
I have noticed a lot of good Starcraft players complaining about Starcraft 2 being too dumbed down .
Complains about MBS and automining have been more prominent than any other , but frankly , I feel these are entirely misguided .
Blizzard has done an absolutely tremendous job listening to the wishes of the Starcraft community of adding redundant clicks to make the game more difficult while maintaining the expectations all non-Starcraft players have with regards to the interface .
While they have enabled MBS and automining , the Chrono Boost from the Nexus , the Queen and the combined scan -mule of the command centre succeeds in both requiring an immense amount of speed to fully utilize and in giving some sense of strategic choice .
With regards to base management , which was the biggest fear I had , I absolutely love Starcraft 2 .
In fact , I love the game in general .
Playing it is immensely fun , the music is stunningly great for all three races ( so far I have exclusively been randoming ) , and it really feels like the better player wins – although there are some imbalances at the moment and some build orders that have particular momentum .
Comparing this – and let us remember that we are at the very beginning of the beta phase – with the actual release of Starcraft 1 , there is not a shadow of doubt in my mind .
Starcraft 2 is a vastly superior game .
However , and bear in mind that this is stated with very limited experience ...
( And we do need to consider that we are in the first two weeks of the beta test . )
As a long - lasting competitive game , Starcraft 2 might have less ” Awe - factor ” than Starcraft did .
It lacks flashy micromanagement .
Walking up and down cliffs with reapers raping peons , it feels awesome .
But it ’s easy .
I could pull it off quite decently the second game I played with Terran .
Obviously it improves , but most of the micromanagement has the same feel to it .
Blizzard has improved the AI to such an extent that the units actually behave the way you tell them to – but this also means that anyone is able to pull off what they are trying to do .
Watching someone shoot a perfect free kick in football would not be impressive if you knew he just had to decide to do this , it is impressive because even though he knows exactly what to do , it is really difficult to execute it .
This allegory can be transferred to mostly all sports , especially any involving a ball : if it is easy , it ’s not impressive .
Now – the macro aspect is wonderful .
This is what most people were afraid of ; that there just would n’t be enough to do .
I myself expected that while writing this , I would find myself stating that despite my inexperience , I felt like there were more things I was n’t able to find time for doing in Starcraft 1 than in starcraft 2 .
This is not even remotely close to the truth .
Starcraft 2 is absolutely riddled with constant tasks that need to be done for optimal play .
In Starcraft 1 , I ’ve had many games where my minerals constantly stayed below 500 despite being on 4 saturated bases .
In starcraft 2 , it appears like everyone is struck by the yellow syndrome – me included .
People just do n’t seem to be able to maintain good macromanagement when they have more than two saturated expansions , and frankly , it ’s rare to even run into someone mining from more than two bases at the same time .
( Quite possibly for this reason . )
Whereas the micro is from my perspective not sufficiently demanding , constantly landing mules , charging whatever building needs to be charged ( especially if you have three nexus ’.. ) , injecting larvea into every hatchery you own , is an aspect of the game where the room for improvement is enormous .

The NASA Hubble Space Telescope may have photographed the debris left over after two asteroids collided .
Although such asteroid - asteroid smashups do happen in the Solar System , such a collision has never been seen before by anyone on Earth .
The February 2 , 2010 NASA media brief ' Suspected Asteroid Collision Leaves Trailing Debris ' states that the comet - like object P/2010 A2 photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope shows '' ¦a complex X - pattern of filamentary structures near the nucleus . '
 Because of how P/2010 A2 looks from the images so far taken of it , NASA thinks that the object contains a debris field that is left over from the collision of two asteroids .
See it for yourself .
A photograph of P/2010 A2 is found at the Astrosurf.com website , when it was taken on January 8 , 2010 .
P/2010 A2 has an approximate 3.5 - year orbit around the Sun .
Its closest approach to the Sun - - for its current orbit -- occurred at the beginning of December 2009 , about one month before it was discovered .
The object was discovered by astronomers , on January 6 , 2010 , while using the sky survey Lincoln Near - Earth Asteroid Research ( LINEAR ) program .
The LINEAR program uses a 1 - meter ( 36 - inch ) reflecting telescope with a charge - coupled device ( CCD ) camera .
Page two continues .
For most of its life , the object is found within the warmer , inner regions of the asteroid belt '” within 2.7 astronomical units ( AU ) from the Sun ( where one AU equals the average distance between the Earth and Sun ) .
Past the 2.7 - AU distance , most objects are comets , with cores made primarily of ice and secondarily from dust and gas .
Closer than 2.7 AU , objects are usually asteroids consisting primarily of rocky - type material .
The NASA article states , ' Asteroid collisions are energetic , with an average impact speed of more than 11,000 miles per hour , or five times faster than a rifle bullet .
" The images taken by Hubble -- actually taken by its Wide Field Camera 3 ( WFC3 ) instrument -- show an estimated 140 - meter ( 460 - foot ) diameter object that has characteristics similar to both asteroids ( has an orbit of a main - belt asteroid ) and comets ( has a tail ) .
However , it does n't have a bright nucleus ( center ) , which makes it a bit different than your normal looking comet .
David Jewitt , of the University of California -- Los Angeles , who is a principal investigator for Hubble , commented on P/2010 A2 within the NASA article .
Dr. Jewitt said , ' This is quite different from the smooth dust envelopes of normal comets .
The filaments are made of dust and gravel , presumably recently thrown out of the nucleus .
Some are swept back by radiation pressure from sunlight to create straight dust streaks .
" And , " Embedded in the filaments are co-moving blobs of dust that likely originated from tiny unseen parent bodies .
" Page three continues .
The Hubble images were taken on January 25 , 2010 , and three days later , on the 29th , when P/2010 A2 was approximately 145 million kilometers ( 90 million miles ) from Earth and about 290 million kilometers ( 180 million miles ) from the Sun .
What is unique about this discovery is that the ''¦ main nucleus of P/2010 A2 lies outside its own halo of dust .... NASA states that , ' This has never been seen before in a comet - like object . '
 Consequently , astronomer think that this object is the result of a smashup of two asteroids .
Dr. Jewitt adds ,
' The filamentary appearance of P/2010 A2 is different from anything seen in Hubble images of normal comets , consistent with the action of a different process . '
 And , when astronomers first looked at this object they did n't see a bright center in its coma ( filmy cloud - like material around its nucleus ) Usually comets have bright centers , which indicate that they are outgassing icy particles .
In addition , P/2010 A2 orbits the Sun totally within the warmer inner region of the asteroid belt where few icy bodies reside '” most of them are rocky bodies .
Page four concludes .
So , astronomers are conjecturing that P/2010 A2 does not consist of ice that has broken off from its nucleus and ended up in its debris trail .
Instead , they think that the debris trail consists of rocky material that was ejected from two asteroids after they collided .
Dr. Jewitt adds , " If this interpretation is correct , two small and previously unknown asteroids recently collided , creating a shower of debris that is being swept back into a tail from the collision site by the pressure of sunlight .
" NASA 's article concludes with this statement : ' The asteroid belt contains abundant evidence of ancient collisions that have shattered precursor bodies into fragments .
The orbit of P/2010 A2 is consistent with membership in the Flora asteroid family , produced by collisional shattering more than 100 million years ago .'
' One fragment of that ancient smashup may have struck Earth 65 million years ago , triggering a mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs .
But , until now , no such asteroid - asteroid collision has been caught " in the act .
" For right now , astronomers are not sure whether P/2010 A2 is the result of two asteroids impacting each other and spewing out many smaller pieces .
However , they are looking into the pictures provided by Hubble , and other such telescopes .

California State Senator Roy Ashburn , Republican and vocal gay rights opponent , was busted for DWI in his state - issued Chevy Tahoe by Sacramento police .
He 'd gotten drunk at a gay bar .
Also , there was an unidentified man in the passenger seat .

Here 's an idea :
If you take a principled stand against something , stake your reputation on fighting it , and belittle others because of it , do n't get caught red - handed doing that which you oppose .
Ashburn , a second - term Senator from California 's 18th district has been a very vocal opponent of gay rights and gay marriage in the state and based his campaigns on a platform of family values .
With a resume like that , it must have been something of a surprise when police in Sacramento observed Ashburn 's state - issued Chevy Tahoe ( Chevy Tahoe ?
Is n't California in a massive budget crisis ? ) swerving all over the road and after performing a field sobriety test arrested the Senator for driving while intoxicated .
Normally , this is a story of bad judgement and would have ended with Ashburn 's brief statement of apology the next day , but the devil is in the details .
The fact there was an unidentified man in the passenger seat at the time of Ashburn 's arrest is n't at all salacious until you discover eye - witnesses confirming ole Roy had been boozing it up that night at Sacramento area gay nightclub " Faces . "
That right there ?
That feeling you 're getting ?
It 's extreme schadenfreude borne from impossibly thick hypocrisy .
Well , alleged hypocrisy .
Let this be a lesson to all politicians with a dirty little career - ending secret ;
Do n't drink and drive .

On Thursday , Al Jazeera broadcast what it said was a new audiotape released by Osama bin Laden .
The voice , said to be that of Al Qaeda ’s leader , warned the United States not to execute “ hero warrior Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , ” who claims to have orchestrated the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 , and other accused terrorists .
“ The White House has expressed its desire to execute them , ” the speaker said .
“ The day America will take such decision it would have taken a decision to execute whoever we capture . ”
The Obama administration recently decided not to hold trials for the Qaeda prisoners in a civilian court in New York and has not yet announced an alternative plan .
In civilian or military court , though , it is expected that they would face the death penalty .
An American counterterrorism official , who did not confirm whether the tape was authentic , told The Associated Press that Al Qaeda has already executed prisoners .
“ ‘ They may have forgotten Danny Pearl and all the others they ’ve slaughtered , but we have n’t , ” the official told the news agency .
The audio message to the people of the United States also said , “ Your friend in the White House has been following in the footsteps of his predecessor in many important issues , such as escalating the war in Afghanistan . ”
It added :
Backing up longstanding rumors of NYPD quotas , a cop claims police officers are required to issue 20 summonses and make 1 arrest per month so commanding officers appear to maintain low crime rates in their precincts .
" At the end of the night you have to come back with something , " Officer Adil Polanco told ABC .
" You have to write somebody , you have to arrest somebody , even if the crime is not committed , the number 's there .
So our choice is to come up with the number . "
Following in the footsteps of other officers who came forward with allegations of crime stat manipulation , the five - year veteran said quotas have compromised police work .
" I 'm not going to keep arresting innocent people , I 'm not going to keep searching people for no reason , I 'm not going to keep writing people for no reason , I 'm tired of this , " he said .
" Our primary job is not to help anybody , our primary job is not to assist anybody , our primary job is to get those numbers and come back with them ? "
The station obtained audio recordings of officers in Polanco 's 41st Precinct in the Bronx that seemingly defend his allegations : " If you think 1 and 20 is breaking your balls , guess what you 're going to be doing .
You 're going to be doing a lot more , a lot more than what they 're saying , " said one officer .
" Next week , 25 and 1 , 35 and 1 , and until you decide to quit this job to go to work at a Pizza Hut , this is what you 're going to be doing till then , " said another .
NYPD spokesman Paul Browne told ABC : " Police Officers like others who receive compensation are provided productivity goals and they are expected to work . "
Polanco says the quotas force officers to arrest and fine individuals on trumped up charges , like five adolescents who say they were just racing each other when they were jailed overnight for " engaging in tumultuous and violent conduct that caused public alarm " and given summonses for " unlawful assembly . "
The whistleblower claims cops who do n't meet the quotas lose overtime and days off , or are re-assigned far from their homes .
I ’m writing this because I ’m just damn tired of being branded a rapist by the doctrine of feminist philosophy .
This is going to be a rant , but one that will be supported by facts and reason .
There will be emotive language in this post , but those emotions will be backed by logic and reality .
First off , all reasonable men , including the ones who identify themselves as “ feminists , ” should be deeply offended by the prevailing ideas regarding the male population and the crime of rape .
Those ideas can be summed up by three concepts that are continuously put forth in the majority of feminist - supported platforms , including the US government by way of VAWA :
One in four women are victims of rape .
There is a culture of rape that permeates human society even to the modern day .
Nearly all rape victims know their attacker .
Without taking the time to disprove these individual ideas , I can say that combined , these three ideas support one other underlying and frightening concept that is being put forth as “ fact : ”
Rape is not an action that is symptomatic of criminal or deviant behavior but something that is causal of being male .
Let me state this in another manner ; the feminist philosophers and thinkers have disassociated the concept of rape with deviant behavior and re-associated it with being a facet of typical male behavior .
The logical extension of this thinking ( which has been stated in many feminist dialogs ) is that any male can be a rapist granted motive and opportunity .
One of the core documents of feminist philosophy , “ Against Our Will ” by Susan Brownmiller clearly states these ideas and promotes them as fact .
Take this passage for example :
“ Man ’s discovery that his genitalia could serve as a weapon to generate fear must rank as one of the most important discoveries of prehistoric times , along with the use of fire and the first crude stone axe .
From prehistoric times to the present , I believe , rape has played a critical function … it is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear . ”
Read that passage again and consider what it says .
Brownmiller is citing that “ all men ” consciously use rape as a tool .
This is dangerous thinking and symptomatic of what is wrong with some divisions of feminist thought .
More dangerous thinking includes the infamous “ one in four ” statistic .
I wo n’t get into how Mary Koss ’ data collection methods purposely skewed the results to get her results .
There are several websites that clearly dissect the reality of the “ one in four ” myth , but because of feminist political and social manipulation , any attempt to question this idea is immediately dismissed as “ enabling rape , ” “ victim blaming , ” or collectively as “ misogynistic rhetoric . ”
Currently , now that flawed statistic has been adopted part and parcel within the arena of academia as now it is being claimed that this specifically applies to women who attend colleges and universities across America .
If these people had their way , then the most horrific thing you could do is to send your daughter away to college , as it is almost mathematically certain that she will become a victim of rape .
Universities are now afraid to counter those statistics for fear of being branded a “ tool of the patriarchy . ”
But here is the other thing ; some feminists are changing the definition of rape in an attempt to vilify men and while doing so , discredit the viewpoints millions of Western women who have no problem with having sex with their chosen male partners .
They have already absolved women from any responsibility for their sexual behavior while under the influence of alcohol .
If after a drunken evening , a man unexpectedly wakes up in bed with a woman that he does n’t remember meeting , it is just something we as men have to deal with and we have to accept whatever consequences which have resulted from the drunken encounter .
But if a woman wakes up with a man she does n’t remember meeting after a night of drinking , then she only has to cry rape and she is “ absolved ” of all other consequences of her behavior except for the biological ones ( i.e. infection with a venereal disease , pregnancy ) .
The fact is that men have no out in regards to the consequences of a drunk hookup ; all they can do is either pretend that it did not happen , or own up to the mistake and move on ; they have nobody to blame for the situation other than the alcohol and their own lack of judgment .
Women on the other hand have the agency ( backed by law ) to blame men for their situation rather than accept the possible truth that their own activity has led to their consequences .
Just recently in Utah , a man was arrested for rape ; now here are the details .
The victim met the man in a bar .
The victim had imbibed a considerable quantity of alcohol .
The victim agreed to take the man home .
The man offered the victim a pill ( revealed to be a prescription medication ) and the victim accepted the pill willingly .
The victim fell asleep but woke to find herself engaged in sexual intercourse with the man .
She fell asleep again and then awoke again to find herself completely undressed .
Now , while we have to acknowledge that the man in question was wrong for his actions in having non-consensual sex with the victim while she was incapacitated due to the drug , where does her responsibility come into play ?
She willingly brought the man to her home and willingly accepted a controlled substance ( the pill ) from a man she did not know and accepted at his word what the substance would do ( which it did …he did not lie ) .
But when law enforcement agencies / organizations start campaigns to encourage women to be more careful and take more responsibility for their safety when they go out drinking , feminists choose to interpret this as an attack on women and “ victim blaming . ”
They choose to interpret these studies and warnings as an attack on the victim , even though such research is simply attributing the consequences of an action .
If a person walks down the street openly displaying a large amount of money and gets robbed , while the robber is still at fault for his crime , the victim ’s lack of caution presented the criminal with an opportunity .
Criminals are the ultimate opportunists ; when they see the chance to commit a crime , they will act upon it .
Criminals should be punished for their crimes ; I have no question in my mind about that fact .
But that does not preclude the need for caution and the feminist drive to absolve women from their need for that caution is dangerous to say the least .
And following that flawed logic , if women choose to ignore that caution and as a result rapes increase , their agenda is supported .
By the way and on the subject of “ victim blaming , ” this is the 21st Century ; we are no longer collectively claiming that female rape victims are responsible for their becoming victims .
There are countless resources available for victims of rape to receive counseling and support for their plight .
While there are still individuals who continue to promote that flawed thinking , that is not the same as asking pointed questions regarding a rape investigation to determine what happened .
There is no conspiracy which is promoting the idea that men should get away with rape , but what has happened is that the pendulum of justice has swung to the opposite extreme .
There has always been a historical injustice involved with adjudication of the crime of rape .
In the United States alone , we have been through periods of history where women in general have incapable of receiving justice after being raped , African American men have been systematically considered “ guilty until proven innocent ” of the crime of raping a White woman , while the raping of an African slave by a White male was considered a social norm , and now we are living in a society where any male who has been accused of rape is automatically tried and found guilty by society at large and their judgment is often carried over into the municipal courts .
Only now with the advent of genetic - based science being applied to crime scene investigation techniques as well as the advent of new communication / electronic presence devices ( i.e. the Hofstra Case ) are we starting to see the truth behind a number of rape cases .
Men who were railroaded into jail because of rape accusations are now being released based upon DNA evidence placing them away from the crime scene .
Other cases are being thrown out because electronically - derived evidence is being produced to either place the accused away from the crime scene or prove that the accuser has ulterior motives regarding her accusation .
But even with these items , feminist supporters are crying for these items to be dismissed as a number of them still hold to the idea that women are incapable of lying about rape .
Another piece of ill - logic that is applied to men and rape is that while a child molester ( regardless of gender ) is seen as “ mentally unbalanced , ” a rapist is being portrayed as just “ one of the guys . ”
Part of this is based upon the Koss study which many researchers use as a metric ( albeit flawed ) to base their research upon .
Both rapists and child molesters display the same predatory behavior ( though the rapist who targets adult women is allowed a broader freedom based upon the simple fact that their chosen prey is legally accessible for sexual activity ) .
There are other traits that both predators share in their behavior .
One trait is the “ grooming ” of the victim .
Feminists will quickly tote out the fact that most rape victims know their attacker .
If you compare this to a child molester grooming their victim , then it makes sense .
The predator picks out his or her victim and then tries to get to know their victim in a twisted form of courtship , which eventually leads to the actual molestation / rape .
In addition , though criminal psychologists have typically classified all other forms of criminal behavior as being symptomatic of a greater socio- psychological deviance , there is a concerted effort by the feminist lobby to avoid defining the rape of an adult female as deviant behavior by a male perpetrator .
We have to ask ourselves one question ; what is there to be gained by this systematic drive to vilify men across the spectrum ?
Regardless of the answer to this question , it has to be understood that there is something very wrong going on here and I ’m damn tired of seeing it go on .
I am tired of being vilified because I am male .
Then you have groups like “ Men Can Stop Rape ” who tote out feminist - inspired propaganda and attempt to guilt the men who attend into accepting the burden for all men that “ rape is what men do . ”
I am not a rapist and damn you all for saying different .
Furthermore , as a victim of a false rape accusation and an African American male , as well as by the virtue of the dead African American men of Tulsa Oklahoma , Rosewood Florida , and every other place in this country where a Black man has been lynched / murdered because of the lie of a White woman , I have the right to this rant .
I ’m done for now and if you want to post a response , feel free .

Allen used to have so much faith in her employees that she would loan them company funds to buy homes , cars and other big expenses .
But that changed in 2007 when she determined one had stolen an estimated $ 250,000 from her firm , Multi-Point Communications Inc. , a provider of Web - and audio - conferencing services in Birmingham , Ala .
" I trusted her implicitly , " says Ms. Wein Allen of the alleged thief , an employee who had worked for Multi - Point for more than seven years in a senior finance position .

What if space held the key to producing alternative energy crops on Earth ?
That 's what researchers are hoping to find in a new experiment on the International Space Station .
The experiment , National Lab Pathfinder - Cells 3 , is aimed at learning whether microgravity can help jatropha curcas plant cells grow faster to produce biofuel , or renewable fuel derived from biological matter .
Jatropha is known to produce high quality oil that can be converted into an alternative energy fuel , or biofuel .
By studying the effects of microgravity on jatropha cells , researchers hope to accelerate the cultivation of the plant for commercial use by improving characteristics such as cell structure , growth and development .
This is the first study to assess the effects of microgravity on cells of a biofuel plant .
" As the search for alternate energy sources has become a top priority , the results from this study could add value for commercialization of a new product , " said Wagner Vendrame , principal investigator for the experiment at the University of Florida in Homestead .
" Our goal is to verify if microgravity will induce any significant changes in the cells that could affect plant growth and development back on Earth . "
Launched on space shuttle Endeavour 's STS - 130 mission in February , cell cultures of jatropha were sent to the space station in special flasks containing nutrients and vitamins .
The cells will be exposed to microgravity until they return to Earth aboard space shuttle Discovery 's STS - 131 mission targeted for April .
For comparison studies of how fast the cultures grow , a replicated set of samples are being maintained at the University of Florida 's Tropical Research and Education Center in Homestead .
" Watching the space shuttle go up carrying a little piece of my work is an indescribable experience , " said Vendrame .
" Knowing that my experiment could contribute to creating a sustainable means for biofuel production on Earth , and therefore making this a better world adds special value to the work . "
Hey , remember this guy ?
Plucky young guy Viktor Tikhonov ?
You may ( or may not ) have been wondering where he went off to and if we 'd ever be seeing him again .
He did n't make the Phoenix Coyotes out of camp this year and was sent down to the AHL .
However , in his contract he had a provision that allowed him to be loaned to the KHL if he was n't going to be seeing significant time with the Coyotes .
So Viktor headed off to the land of his father , and more notably his famous grandfather of the same name , to play for the Severstal Cherepovets .
With Severstal Tikhonov was getting respectable numbers and more importantly getting lots and lots of ice time against some pretty good players .
His 17:21 per game is 4th on his team for forwards and would amount to being a 2nd line winger on a team just above the AHL in terms of the level of play .
Even more impressive is while Cherepovets did n't make the playoffs by a long shot ( they were pretty terrible ) Tikhonov was a +11 in only 25 games played .
While +/- is n't the end all be all of stats , when the next closest forward is a +3 ?
That 's kind of significant .
Here 's a look at his stats for the season with Severstal ...
Viktor Tikhonov # 41 / Right Wing / Phoenix Coyotes Height : 6 - 2 Weight : 187 Born : May 12 , 1988 GP G A P +/- PIM PPG SHG GWG SOG PCT 2009 - Viktor Tikhonov 25 14 1 15 11 12 6 0 2 75 18.7
Not bad for a kid that was getting 3rd or 4th line minutes in the 2008 - 2009 season .
The nice part is now that the rosters have expanded and we can pretty much have as many players as we want on the team he 'll be returning shortly from Russia to provide yet another option to go to and to get a few games worth of experience on a playoff team .
That does n't mean we 'll be throwing him into the fire .
Far from it .
This is what should have happened last year with him just getting a taste of the NHL , but we simply were n't able to do that with him with how our team was built and with no one being able to get some experienced players .
Tikhonov has the potential to be really good for us for a very long time .
I 'm excited to see what the kid can do once he returns .
There 's no specific date on when that will be , but it could be any time now with the KHL regular season over and Severstal not making the playoffs .

With thirteen species of parrots found in California , it is often difficult to identify a particular species especially among those with similar traits .
This identification guide is provided as a quick reference and is intended to aid in the identification of naturalized parrots by showing the visual differences between species .
Other than the parrot species shown below , Macaws , Cockatoos , African Greys , Budgies , Cockatiels , etc. are occasionally seen .
Only those shown below are known to have established naturalized populations in California .
Genus Amazona ( aka Amazon Parrots )
There are six species of Amazona found in California .
They are green overall with a stocky body and short squarded tail which varies in length between species .
Head and beak colors vary from horn colored to black .
The main differences between the species are colors on the head and the size of the bird .
Red-crowned Parrot Lilac - crowned Parrot Red-lored Parrot
In addition to those six species shown , other species of Amazona may occasionally be sighted .
Hybrids have also been reported .
Click photo at right for species specific information and a detailed description for each .
Blue - fronted Parrot Yellow - headed Parrot White - fronted Parrot Amazona are generally seen flying in pairs within small to large flocks .
Most flocks are mixed species flocks .
Their shallow , rapid wingbeats and raucous calls are unmistakable .

As Washington prepares to revisit the subject of health - care reform , perhaps some fresh experience from Middle America would be of value .
When I was elected governor of Indiana five years ago , I asked that a consumer - directed health insurance option , or Health Savings Account ( HSA ) , be added to the conventional plans then available to state employees .
I thought this additional choice might work well for at least a few of my co-workers , and in the first year some 4 % of us signed up for it .

The high point for individual liberty and freedom was of course the American Declaration of Independence .
Jefferson , Adams and Patrick Henry and others were the most ardent proponents of individual freedom , liberty , and rights .
Between these two ends , the common men and women of society have struggled to maintain moderation and restraint on both the government and upon individuals .
The scorecard in most major Canadian cities looks dismal for individual liberty .
Traffic cameras are used to spy on and record the public 's moves ; the intention was to catch traffic violators .
Private property owners are fined for allowing patrons to smoke in their bars .
People are losing their hard - earned property and livelihood in bankruptcy due to smoking bylaws .
The police have created special programs that allow them to stop each and every vehicle , and inspect whether you are wearing a seatbelt or have proper documentation ; the intention was to stop impaired drivers .
In Ottawa , people are ticketed and fined for walking on the frozen Rideau Canal , or having dogs in a park .
Ottawa Hydro will identify to the police suspicious consumers of electricity , and cut off their power , without the benefit of a judge or jury .
Federally and provincially , the concept of liberty is buried under the collective layers of bureaucratic regulations .
Gun registration that allows the search and seizure of people 's homes and property is now legal ; the intention was to reduce crime .
Revenue Canada has started a database to track our travels and holidays ; the intention is to stop terrorists .
Constitutionally individual property is not recognized as a right nor protected as such , although the intention of law is to protect persons and property .
Plant , animals , habitat , and wetlands are protected , but what protection is afforded the homeowner , the businessman , and the farmer .
« It is clear to all that governments are adept at creating new laws , rules and regulations , but seldom remove them .
The casual actions of a person today are often the criminal act of tomorrow .
The intentions of the law today are forgotten by the police and lawmakers of tomorrow . »
These people require government approvals and reams of paperwork , regulations , and licenses to install a well , or to landscape their cottage lot .
Parents who take responsibility for their children and provide love , nurturing , and discipline must be on the lookout for the outstretched arm of the Children 's aid Society .
This agency can remove children and place them in bureaucratic institutions and foster care if a parent disagrees with them .
The school boards are allowed to lock down our schools , and our children , and mete out punishment without consequence under the omnipotent zero tolerance policy .
Zero tolerance is a bureaucratic phrase that justifies " zero thinking . "
It is clear to all that governments are adept at creating new laws , rules and regulations , but seldom remove them .
The casual actions of a person today are often the criminal act of tomorrow .
The intentions of the law today are forgotten by the police and lawmakers of tomorrow .
To all of the people who are clamouring and supporting these abuses , and cheering for greater safety : what will you say , when you are imprisoned , or fined for having a beer in your backyard , eating fatty foods , or creating smoke from your BBQ ?
What will you do when your child is taken away , or your house expropriated ?
Will you think it is still in the public interest to fine or imprison you ?
Or will you cry out , and ask others to defend your liberty ?
There is an axiom that is forgotten : " If you wish for me to defend your rights , then you must be here to respect and defend mine . "
Our courts and bureaucracy have come to believe that individual rights are not real , only privileges that need justification .
But what defines a right is the knowledge that it never needs to be justified .

A pair of brand name sports shoes are made at the cost of 12 dollars in China but sold at 120 dollars a pair on the US market .
Only two dollars goes to Chinese workers .
That makes some people believe that a suspension of trade with China would immediately push the US inflation rate up by two percentage points as China enjoys unparalleled labor cost advantage .
They are also assured by the fact that China has invested 300 billion US dollars on the overseas market while receiving 500 billion US dollars of foreign stakes .
But an expert on finance at Beijing Normal University warns against the " over optimism " about the risks of China 's international account imbalance and the exchange rate issue and reminds of the lessons from the tragedy of the Japanese economy and Japanese currency yen in history .
The Japanese yen exchange rate has gone through three stages .
During the first stage between 1949 and 1971 , Japan achieved a 10 percent economic growth annually through its export - oriented strategy based on fixed exchange rate system with 380 yen against a dollar .
Such a growth outraced Britain and France and modeled after by other East Asian economies .
A dramatic change occurred in December , 1971 , when finance ministers of ten Western countries reached the Smithsonian Agreement in Washington requiring a precise yen appreciation of 16.88 percent and floating band of 2.25 percent around the newly agreed par value .
That ended yen 's 12 - year old pegged rate system and the yen began to float since then .
The second stage since then lasted till 1985 , during which the Japanese currency inflated from 315 yen against a dollar to 200 yen against a dollar with an annual growth of 5.2 percent .
The upward yen did not seem to hinder Japan 's prosperity .
The huge trade surplus and capital influx pushed Japan 's foreign exchange reserve up sharply .
However , nobody realized at that time that the yen 's constant , moderate appreciation was leading to buddle economy which was injuring the dynamics of the Japanese economy .
That was followed by the third stage till 1989 .
On Sept. 22 , 1985 , the Group7 , under the proposal of the United States , initiated the Plaza Accord maintaining the dollar 's dominance and shrinking the value of other major currencies in the world by 30 percent in two years .
Then there was Louvre Accord dragging yen into uncontrollable uptick .
The media reported that the land prices of the 23 districts of Tokyo could buy the whole US .
But the bubble of the Japanese economy went burst in 1989 .
Recalling the history is to learn from it so that the same thing would not happen in the future .
There are similarities in the two economies which both depend on foreign trade and capital .
Comparing China in 2004 and Japan in 1967 , we can see a lot of parities in terms of per capita GDP , per capita power consumption , the urban Engel 's coefficient , industrial structure , and even the hosting of the World Expo and the Olympics .
The Chinese currency yuan , like yen , also was pushed into a period of slight appreciation after 22 years of fixed exchange rate system from 1983 to 2005 .
And China 's foreign trade mix currently is nearly repeating Japan 's when yen was going up slightly .
Both began with textiles , evolved into electromechanical products and upgraded into automobiles .
Back to the issues of China 's exchange rate and trade conflicts , how can a pair of 12 - dollar Chinese shoes exported to the US for insignificant processing profits affect a pair of 120 - dollar shoes significantly ?
How can we dare to say that the US orders would not shift to India or Indonesia where there is labor as smart and diligent as that in China so as to bring same economic miracle ?
The difference between Japan 's past and today 's China does not lie in the way they go down , but on how far they have been on the way .

It 's International Women 's Day – a day I usually use to applaud the progress and accomplishments of my gender .
How cool that few would dare , any longer , refer to us as the “ weaker sex ” ( at least not in our hearing ) , and that no one bats an eye when a woman 's title is Dr. rather than Mrs .
How wonderful to see women in Parliament and the Legislature ( although look at the ratios – we 're not there yet , ladies ) .
I love that I 'm no longer expected to burn my bra in solidarity ( bras are expensive and , as my colleague so aptly noted , we women need all the support we can get ) .
But in the face of all this happy self - congratulation , I 'd like to suggest there 's more yet to be done than merely patting each other on the backs .
Every year I say this – and every year I take heat for it .
A true feminist must lobby for men's rights .
Feminism is not about female supremacy – it's about equality .
Seeking dominion over men is , therefore , the very antithesis of feminism .
Feminism is so often grossly misinterpreted .
I do n't hate men , in fact , I kinda like them ( well ... most of them , anyway ) .
I have no desire to dress or act like a man – mustache notwithstanding – and I do n't think any of that has anything to do with feminism .
It 's not about hating men or rejecting our differences – I like our differences , and I choose to shave my armpits regardless the political statement others feel that makes ( although I will say , I wish men did likewise ) .
The operative word there , for anyone who missed it , was “ choose ” .
Feminism is all about getting to choose ; defining ourselves ; not being locked into antiquated gender stereotypes that ultimately subjugate men and women alike .
I 'm still going to wear nylons and high heels – that 's my choice - but I want equal pay for equal work ; equal access to all elements of our society ; and equal opportunity .
None of that can happen , ladies – none of it – if we do n't ensure men are equal .
For you to be equal , so , too must they – look it up in the dictionary , if you doubt me .
So let 's look at some of the inequities .
Men are statistically far more violent than women ( 90 per cent of all physical domestic abuse is perpetrated by men ) , but they have nowhere near as much access to mental health services as women .
Often , the only time men can receive publicly - funded mental health services like anger management training is a ) in prison after committing a violent crime ; b ) after a psychotic break with full hospitalization , or ; c ) to address a substance addiction .
Go back to that domestic abuse statistic and ask yourself who we 're hurting when men are n't given equal access to social safety nets .
Of course , even then , that 's only if he drums up the courage to seek help in the face of grotesque stigma associated with so doing ... another way in which our brothers are subjugated .
And how about parenting ?
We want men to see themselves as equal partners in parenting ; sharing the responsibility and workload and , we hope , closeness and joy in the relationship ... but only if we 're still married .
Look at the court statistics – when a relationship fails , men simply are n't considered equal stakeholders in caring for offspring .
Well , they are financially ... but that 's just money .
When it comes to custody , time spent , decision - making – all the things the feminist movement claims to want from modern fathers – they take a dramatic backseat to their female co-parents .
The numbers are clear ... women get more of the custody , more of the time .
Period .
How is that equality ?
And does it not foster , in fact forward , the antiquated , sexist notion that women are solely responsible for their children 's emotional well - being ( not to mention day - to - day care , from diaper changing to meal preparation to bathing and bedtime ) , while men's only responsibility is fiscal ?
How does that do anything but violate a feminist persective ?
And let 's take a moment to note that I 'm only referring to Western society here – woman are still stoned to death for promiscuity in other countries ( while their male counterparts go unpunished ) .
They 're still the legal possessions of their fathers and husbands ; still subjected to female genital mutilation ; honour killings ; being burned alive over dowry issues .
How can we congratulate ourselves on our “ equality ” when the majority of the world still treats us like we 're sub-human ?
How can we trust we 'll keep that equality when more than half of the world would willingly – nay , gleefully – take it away ?
The day our rights are safe is the day all women , the world over , enjoy the same rights – so what are we doing to make that happen ?
Negotiating with the Taliban sure does n't seem , to me , to be a step in the right direction there – but how many women spoke out against that ?
C'mon – do we mean it , or do n't we ?
Feminism can't just be about your rights , or my rights .
To be a true feminist ; to genuinely entrench the values the feminist movement encompasses ; we must begin earnestly fighting for the rights of all those around us - men , women of other nationalities , children , everyone - as well .
I do n't want to spend today celebrating women – I actually think the concept is a tad patronizing – I want to spend it celebrating equality ... but it seems to me we need to send out a lot more invites before that party can start .

LATEST : Israel Video & Transcript : Prime Minister Netanyahu's Speech to AIPAC ( 23 May 2011 )
Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on Tuesday :
Israel Special : Obama - Netanyahu Meeting and the Settlement “ Surprise ”
Full Video and Transcript : Secretary of State Clinton at AIPAC Conference ( 22 March )
Members of the Obama Administration , Senators , Members of Congress , Ambassadors , Leaders of AIPAC , Ladies and Gentlemen , As the world faces monumental challenges , I know that Israel and America will face them together .
We stand together because we are fired by the same ideals and inspired by the same dream the dream of achieving security , prosperity and peace .
This dream seemed impossible to many Jews a century ago .
This month , my father celebrated his 100th birthday .
When he was born , the Czars ruled Russia , the British Empire spanned the globe and the Ottomans ruled the Middle East .
During his lifetime , all of these empires collapsed , other powers rose and fell , and the Jewish destiny swung from despair to a new hope the rebirth of the Jewish state .
For the first time in two thousand years , a sovereign Jewish people could defend themselves against attack .
Before that , we were subjected to unremitting savagery : the bloodletting of the Middle Ages , the expulsion of the Jews from England , Spain and Portugal , the wholesale slaughter of the Jews of the Ukraine , the pogroms in Russia , culminating in the greatest evil of all the Holocaust .
The founding of Israel did not stop the attacks against the Jews .
It merely gave the Jews the power to defend themselves against those attacks .
My friends , I want to tell you about the day when I fully understood the depth of this transformation .
It was the day I met Shlomit Vilmosh over forty years ago .
I served with her son , Haim , in the same elite unit in the army .
During a battle in 1969 , Haim was killed by a burst of gunfire .
At his funeral , I discovered that Haim was born shortly after his mother and father had been freed from the death camps of Europe .
Had he been born two years before , this daring young officer would have been tossed into the ovens like a million other Jewish children .
Haim 's mother Shlomit told me that though she was in great anguish , she was proud .
At least , she said , my son fell wearing the uniform of a Jewish soldier defending the Jewish state .
Time and again the Israeli army was forced to repel attacks of much larger enemies determined to destroy us .
Recognizing that we could not be defeated in battle , Egypt and Jordan , embraced the path of peace .
Yet there are those who continue the assault against the Jewish state and who openly call for our destruction .
They seek to achieve this goal through terrorism , missile attacks and most recently by seeking to develop atomic weapons .
The ingathering of the Jewish people to Israel has not deterred these fanatics .
In fact , it has only whetted their appetite .
Iran 's rulers say Israel is a one bomb country . "
The head of Hezbollah says : " If all the Jews gather in Israel , it will save us the trouble of going after them worldwide .
" My friends , These are unpleasant facts , but they are the facts .
The greatest threat to any living organism or nation is not to recognize danger in time .
Seventy - five years ago , the leading powers in the world put their heads in the sand .
Untold millions died in the war that followed .
Ultimately , two of history 's greatest leaders helped turn the tide .
Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Winston Churchill helped save the world .
But they were too late to save six million of my own people .
The future of the Jewish state can never depend on the goodwill of even the greatest of men .
Israel must always reserve the right to defend itself .
Today , an unprecedented threat to humanity looms large .
A radical Iranian regime armed with nuclear weapons could bring an end to the era of nuclear peace the world has enjoyed for the last 65 years .
Such a regime could provide nuclear weapons to terrorists and might even be tempted to use them itself .
Our world would never be the same .
Iran 's brazen bid to develop nuclear weapons is first and foremost a threat to Israel , but it is also a grave threat to the region and to the world .
Israel expects the international community to act swiftly and decisively to thwart this danger .
But we will always reserve the right to defend ourselves .
We must also defend ourselves against the lies and vilifications .
Throughout history , the slanders against the Jewish people always preceded the physical assaults against them and were used to justify them .
The Jews were called the well - poisoners of mankind , the fomenters of instability , the source of all evil under the sun .
Like the physical assaults , these libelous attacks against the Jewish people did not end with the creation of Israel .
For a time after World War Two , overt anti-Semitism was held in check by the shame and shock of the Holocaust .
But only for a time .
In recent decades the hatred of the Jews has reemerged with increasing force , but with an insidious twist .
It is not merely directed at the Jewish people but increasingly at the Jewish state .
In its most pernicious form , it argues that if only Israel did not exist , many of the world 's problems would go away .
My friends , Does this mean that Israel is above criticism ?
Of course not .
Israel , like any democracy , has imperfections but we strive to correct them through open debate and scrutiny .
Israel has independent courts , the rule of law , a free press and a vigorous parliamentary debate --- believe me , it 's vigorous .
I know that members of Congress refer to one another as my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin or the distinguished Senator from California .
In Israel , members of Knesset do n't speak of their distinguished colleagues from Kiryat Shmona and Beer Sheva .
We say well , you do n't want to know what we say .
In Israel , self - criticism is a way of life , and we accept that criticism is part of the conduct of international affairs .
But Israel should be judged by the same standards applied to all nations , and allegations against Israel must be grounded in fact .
Here is one allegation that is not .
The attempt by many to describe the Jews as foreign colonialists in their own homeland is one of the great lies of modern times .
In my office , I have on display a signet ring that was loaned to me by Israel 's Department of Antiquities .
The ring was found next to the Western Wall , but it dates back some 2,800 years ago , two hundred years after King David turned Jerusalem into our capital city .
The ring is a seal of a Jewish official , and inscribed on it in Hebrew is his name : Netanyahu .
His name was Netanyahu Ben -Yoash .
My first name , Benjamin , dates back 1,000 years earlier to Benjamin , the son of Jacob .
One of Benjamin 's brothers was named Shimon , which also happens to be the first name of my good friend , Shimon Peres , the President of Israel .
Nearly 4,000 years ago , Benjamin , Shimon and their ten brothers roamed the hills of Judea .
Ladies and Gentlemen , The connection between the Jewish people and the Land of Israel can not be denied .
The connection between the Jewish people and Jerusalem can not be denied .
The Jewish people were building Jerusalem 3,000 year ago and the Jewish people are building Jerusalem today .
Jerusalem is not a settlement .
It is our capital .
In Jerusalem , my government has maintained the policies of all Israeli governments since 1967 , including those led by Golda Meir , Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Rabin .
Today , nearly a quarter of a million Jews , almost half the citys Jewish population , live in neighborhoods that are just beyond the 1949 armistice lines .
All these neighborhoods are within a five - minute drive from the Knesset .
They are an integral and inextricable part of modern Jerusalem .
Everyone knows that these neighborhoods will be part of Israel in any peace settlement .
Therefore , building them in no way precludes the possibility of a two - state solution .
Nothing is rarer in the Middle East than tolerance for the beliefs of others .
Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem has ensured that the religious sites of all faiths have been protected .
While we cherish our homeland , we also recognize that Palestinians live there as well .
We do n't want to govern them .
We do n't want to rule them .
We want them as neighbors , living in security , dignity and peace .
Yet Israel is unjustly accused of not wanting peace with the Palestinians .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
My government has consistently shown its commitment to peace in both word and deed .
From day one , we called on the Palestinian Authority to begin peace negotiations without delay .
I make that same call today .
President Abbas , come and negotiate peace .
Leaders who truly want peace should be prepared to sit down face - to - face .
Of course , the United States can help the parties solve their problems but it cannot solve the problems for the parties .
Peace can not be imposed from the outside .
It can only come through direct negotiations in which we develop mutual trust .
Last year , I spoke of a vision of peace in which a demilitarized Palestinian state recognizes the Jewish state .
Just as the Palestinians expect Israel to recognize a Palestinian state , we expect the Palestinians to recognize the Jewish state .
In the past year , my government has removed hundreds of roadblocks , barriers and checkpoints in the West Bank .
As a result , we have helped spur a fantastic economic boom there .
Finally , we announced an unprecedented moratorium on new Israeli construction in Judea and Samaria .
This is what my government has done for peace .
What has the Palestinian Authority done for peace ?
Well , they have placed preconditions on peace talks , waged a relentless international campaign to undermine Israel 's legitimacy , and promoted the notorious Goldstone Report that falsely accuses Israel of war crimes .
I want to thank President Obama and the United States Congress for their efforts to thwart this libel .
The Palestinian Authority has also continued incitement against Israel .
Less than two weeks ago , a public square was named after a terrorist who murdered 38 Israeli civilians , including 13 children .
The Palestinian Authority did not prevent it .
Ladies and Gentlemen , Peace requires reciprocity .
It can not be a one - way street in which only Israel makes concessions .
Israel stands ready to make the compromises necessary for peace .
But we expect the Palestinian leaders to compromise as well .
But one thing I will never compromise is our security .
If you want to understand Israel 's security predicament , imagine the entire United States compressed to the size of New Jersey .
Next , put on New Jersey 's northern border an Iranian terror proxy called Hezbollah which fires 6,000 rockets into that small state .
Then imagine that this terror proxy has amassed 60,000 more missiles to fire at you .
Now imagine on New Jersey 's southern border another Iranian terror proxy called Hamas .
It too fires 6,000 rockets into your territory while smuggling ever more lethal weapons into its territory .
Do you think you would feel a little bit vulnerable ?
Do you think you would expect some understanding from the international community when you defend yourselves ?
A peace agreement with the Palestinians must include effective security arrangements on the ground .
Israel must prevent a repeat in the West Bank of what happened when it withdrew from Lebanon and Gaza .
Israel 's main security problem with Lebanon is not its border with Lebanon .
It is Lebanon 's porous border with Syria , through which Iran and Syria smuggle tens of thousands of weapons to Hezbollah .
Israel 's main security problem with Gaza is not its border with Gaza .
It is along Gaza 's border with Egypt , under which nearly 1,000 tunnels have been dug to smuggle weapons .
Experience has shown that only an Israeli presence on the ground can prevent weapons smuggling .
This is why a peace agreement with the Palestinians must include an Israeli presence on the eastern border of a future Palestinian state .
As peace with the Palestinians proves its durability over time , we can review security arrangements .
We are prepared to take risks for peace , but we will not be reckless with the lives of our people and the life of the one and only Jewish state .
Ladies and Gentlemen , The people of Israel want a future in which our children no longer experience the horrors of war .
We want a future in which Israel realizes its full potential as a global center of technology , anchored in its values and living in peace and security with all its neighbors .
I envision an Israel that dedicates its creative and scientific energies to help solve some of the great problems of the day , foremost of which is finding a clean and affordable substitute for gasoline .
If we can help find an alternative to gasoline , we will stop transferring hundreds of billions of dollars a year to radical regimes that support terror worldwide .
I am confident that in pursuing these goals , we have the enduring friendship of the United States of America , the greatest nation on earth .
The American people have always shown their courage , their generosity and their decency .
Time and again , America has stood by Israel 's side against common enemies .
From one President to the next , from one Congress to the next , America 's commitment to Israel 's security has been unwavering .
In the last year , President Obama and the U.S. Congress have given meaning to that commitment by providing Israel with military assistance , by enabling joint military exercises and by working on joint missile defense .
So too , Israel has been a staunch and steadfast ally of the United States .
As Vice President Biden said , America has no better friend in the community of nations than Israel .
For decades , Israel served as a bulwark against Soviet expansionism .
Today it is helping America stem the tide of militant Islam .
Israel shares with America everything we know about fighting a new kind of enemy .
We share intelligence and we cooperate in countless other ways that I am not at liberty to divulge .
This cooperation saves American lives .
Our soldiers and your soldiers fight against fanatic enemies that loathe our common values .
In the eyes of these fanatics , we are you and you are us .
To them , the only difference is that you are big and we are small , you are the Great Satan and we are the Little Satan .
This fanaticism 's hatred of Western civilization predates Israels establishment by over one thousand years .
Militant Islam does not hate the West because of Israel .
It hates Israel because of the West , because it sees Israel as an outpost of freedom that prevents them from overrunning the Middle East .
When Israel stands against its enemies , it stands against America 's enemies .
President Harry Truman , the first world leader to recognize Israel , said : " I have faith in Israel and believe that it has a glorious future not just as another sovereign nation , but as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization .
" My Friends ,
We are gathered here today because we believe in those ideals .
And because of those ideals , I am certain that Israel and America will always stand together .
An alleged attempted rape at a Lower Hutt train station this morning was a false complaint , according to police .
A woman , 20 , had claimed she was sexually assaulted while walking to catch the train at Pomare station shortly before 7 am .
The station was closed till 7.45 am while police conducted a scene examination .
Police said this afternoon the woman admitted while being interviewed that she made a false complaint .
For no particular reason I could fathom , I began receiving all kinds of religous loon - mail today , including denunciations of evolution , pictures of fireworks explosions resembling Jesus on the cross , and sundry laments for the fate of my soul , all by people who have somehow failed to apprehend the sophisticated theologies of Karen Armstrong and Terry Eagleton :
Dear Sir , I am very upset with what you said within a recent article on yahoo .
Sir , I ’m going to tell you something that you need to hear .
Sir ,
You are going to HELL .
Because when GOD CREATED the Earth HE made everything perfect and in GOD ’s perfect plan humans did n’t need to be evolved from monkeys .
So there evolution is wrong .
GO
Read the bible it tells you the truth , see what GOD said about creation , not what some Man thought were we came from .
Because I believe that WORD OF GOD is the truth and nothing else is .
Yours truly , a GOD fearing Man
Aha , something in the press !
It turns out that writer Dylan Lovan of the Associated Press just published a nice piece on evolution and homeschooling .
You may remember , early in the history of this website , that a woman wrote me about the nearly complete absence of materials to help homeschooled children , like her daughter , learn evolution .
Or , rather , there are materials , but they ’re all creationist pap , directed to that large segment of homeschooled kids who are being homechurched at the same time .
At Lovan ’s request , Virginia Tech professor Duncan Porter and I reviewed two widely - used evolution units sold by religious homeschool outfits , Apologia and Bob Jones University Press ( I ’ve talked about Apologia before ) .
The materials were worthless , pretty much straight creationist garbage that did n’t even have the decency to pretend it was intelligent design .
Whatever these kids are learning from Apologia and Bob Jones , it is n’t biology .
Both Porter and I flunked these two modules .
Lovan writes about the Bob Jones effort :
The textbook publishers defend their books as well - rounded lessons on evolution and its shortcomings .
One of the books does n’t attempt to mask disdain for Darwin and evolutionary science .
“ Those who do not believe that the Bible is the inspired , inerrant Word of God will find many points in this book puzzling , ” says the introduction to “ Biology : Third Edition ” from Bob Jones University Press .
“ This book was not written for them . ”
The textbook delivers a religious ultimatum to young readers and parents , warning in its “ History of Life ” chapter that a “ Christian worldview … is the only correct view of reality ; anyone who rejects it will not only fail to reach heaven but also fail to see the world as it truly is . ”
When the AP asked about that passage , university spokesman Brian Scoles said the sentence made it into the book because of an editing error and will be removed from future editions .
Editing error ?
More like their real motivations .
Distressed , I told Lovan that these books were “ promulgating lies to schoolchildren . ”
Ergo my inundation with religious wackaloonery .
Expect more of it here because , unfortunately , Lovan also published the URL of this website .
REGIONAL elections on March 28th - 29th made several things clear about today 's Italy .
The first was that it is not France .
Defying predictions , the prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi , did not get a trouncing at the polls of the kind President Nicolas Sarkozy suffered recently .
Of the 13 regions at stake , Mr Berlusconi 's conservative People of Freedom ( PdL ) movement took six , regaining four of them from the left .
This was a strong performance for the prime minister .
The opposition had everything in its favour : a string of sex scandals involving Mr Berlusconi last year ; a display , in late February , of extraordinary ineptitude by the PdL when it failed to deliver its list of candidates on time in Lazio , the region that includes Rome , and an economic crisis that last year slashed GDP by 5.1 % and destroyed more than 400,000 jobs .
One poll conducted two weeks before the election had predicted the left holding all but one of the 11 regions that it won in 2005 .
The Democratic Party ( PD ) , Italy 's biggest opposition group , did at least narrow the gap with the PdL .
Partial results suggested the distance between the parties could be as little as 1 % , compared with more than 4 % at the 2008 general election .
And the left could claim that its vote was eroded in at least one marginal region by the Five - Star Movement , a new outfit led by Beppe Grillo , an anti-Berlusconi comedian and blogger .
Mr Grillo's party had an impressive first outing , winning almost 7 % in the left 's heartland of Emilia - Romagna .
Yet this was a disappointing result for the left .
It lost four of its 11 governorships , and might well have lost another , Puglia , had the right there held together .
In Campania , the region around Naples , the opposition 's share of the vote plunged from 62 % to 43 % — a damning judgment on ten years of left - wing administration .
The left also failed to hold Lazio , despite fielding a strong candidate : Emma Bonino , a former European commissioner .
What went wrong ?
The mainstream opposition is clearly still incapable of capitalising on the dissatisfaction felt towards the government by many parts of the electorate , particularly the young .
Instead of supporting the PD or the smaller , feistier Italy of Principles ( IDV ) movement , many voters stayed at home .
Only 64 % bothered to vote , almost 8 % fewer than five years ago .
And contrary to expectations , the right was not the only victim of the low turnout .
The other explanation for the turnaround is even more disquieting for the left .
Two weeks before voting , Mr Berlusconi took to the hustings , and his personal charisma may have tilted the balance .
The prime minister was not slow to draw conclusions , reportedly telling aides that in Lazio he had wrought a “ sort of miracle ” .
But there is a cloud on Mr Berlusconi 's horizon : the success of his ally , Umberto Bossi , whose populist , xenophobic Northern League was the one undisputed victor of these elections .
The party won 13 % of the vote , up from 8 % at the general election , and took the governorships of two northern regions , Veneto and Piedmont .
Mr Bossi promptly announced he would press for greater financial autonomy for the north as the price of his continued support .
This is unlikely to be the last demand he will make of the prime minister .
As for Mr Berlusconi , he will doubtless see the result as a mandate for his continued attempts to curb the criminal prosecutors who have pursued him since before he entered politics 16 years ago .
He may also view the outcome as legitimising his aspiration to a presidential style of government .
How far he gets down either of these roads may now depend less on the opposition than on Mr Bossi .
Scientists revealed Sunday for the first time how some snakes can detect the faint body heat exuded by a mouse a metre ( three feet ) away with enough precision and speed to hunt in the dark .
Scientists revealed Sunday for the first time how some snakes can detect the faint body heat exuded by a mouse a metre ( three feet ) away with enough precision and speed to hunt in the dark .
It has been known for decades that rattlesnakes , boas and pythons have so - called pit organs between the eye and the nostril that can sense even tiny amounts of infrared radiation -- heat -- in their surroundings .
Among pit vipers , the western diamondback rattlesnake , native to northern Mexico and southwestern United States , is in a class of its own , its heat - seeking ability up to 10 times keener than any of its cousins .
Even with tiny patches covering its eyes , the snake has shown the ability to track and kill prey blindfolded .
But exactly how these reptiles detect and convert infrared signals into nerve impulses has remained a mystery , and the subject of sharp debate .
One candidate was the photochemical process underlying vision , whereby the eye sees electromagnetic radiation -- visible light for humans -- in the form of photons that activate receptor cells , which in turn convert the energy into a biochemical signal to the brain .
Some fish , for example , can see into the infrared wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum .
But David Julius , a molecular biologist at the University of California in San Francisco , demonstrated in laboratory experiments that a different neurological pathway was at work for the serpentine " sixth sense . "
" In this case , the infrared radiation is actually detected inside the pit organ as heat , " Julius said in a phone interview .
" We found the molecule responsible . "
A very thin membrane inside the pit organ -- essentially a hollow , bony cavity -- warms up as the radiation enters through an opening in the skin , he explained .
Because the membrane is in a hollow space , it is exquisitely sensitive to changes in temperature .
" The heated tissue then imparts a signal to nerve fibres to activate the receptors we have identified , " known as TRPA1 channels .
The neurochemical pathway involved suggests that snakes feel heat rather than see it .
" The molecule we found belongs to a family of receptors related to pain pathways in mammals , " Julius said .
In humans , the equivalent mechanism is called the " wasabi receptor " because it allows our sensory nervous system to detect irritants -- such as the Japanese condiment -- that belong to the mustard family .
It is not , however , activated by heat .
The discovery , published in Nature , may also shed light on how snakes , which have been slithering across the planet for more than 100 million years , evolved .
" Studying change in sensory molecules is an interesting way to look at evolution because as animals inhabit different niches , smell and taste different things , hunt different animals , their sensory systems have to adapt , " Julius said .
The findings also suggest that the forces of natural selection yielded the same remarkable heat - seeking mechanism in reptiles on separate occasions .
Unlike boas and pythons , which also have pit organs , vipers -- including rattlesnakes -- are relatively recent arrivals , in evolutionary terms , and thus must have developed the same capacity independently .
" It is amazing to think that random mutation could have come up with the same kind of solution more than once , " Julius said .

The photo above highlights some new cycling infrastructure that was recently installed in a suburb of Shanghai , China .
Our China correspondent Mark Green spotted this segregated bike lane in the Boa Shan District ( 宝山区 ) – about 13 KM north of Shanghai ’s People ’s Square ( City Centre ) .
It seems that Shanghai has installed this new infrastructure not necessarily out of demand for cycling , but more likely to encourage people to ride their bicycle in a city that is being choked by automobile traffic .
While visiting China in 2007 I observed the widest bike lanes I had ever seen in my life – more than 1 car lane in width on each side of the road in Beijing .
However , segregated infrastructure is n’t as common , so it ’s a beautiful sight to see these segregated lanes in the suburbs – where space is more abundant .
Since peaking in the 1980 ’s , cycling has been declining as the automobile has strangled the great Chinese cities .
But the popularity of the automobile has also been detrimental to the lifestyle that the Chinese enjoyed under the rule of the bicycle .
The pollution is disturbing , and the gridlock painful .
But utility cycling might be making a comeback in China , as discussed in this BBC article from earlier this month .
Electric bikes are also extremely popular in China right now – Mark observed more e-bikes than regular bicycles in this suburb of Shanghai .

Back here in North America , we ’re seeing a similar trend in suburbia with bicycles becoming an important aspect of municipal urban planning .
Toronto ’s largest suburb , the City of Mississauga ( population ~ 700,000 ) recently announced it would build a 600 KM bike path network over the next 20 years .
Mississauga , like most suburbs has no shortage of road space in which bicycle infrastructure could be installed .
Below is a typical street in Mississauga – you can see the automobile was the only mode of transportation considered when the traffic engineers designed this street ( Hurontario St ) .
So it ’s no surprise that many Mississaugans are forced to drive everywhere – even short trips to the store , since walking and cycling on most streets in Mississauga is not a pleasant experience .
Mississauga is trying to catch up after decades of neglect .

Suburban bicycle infrastructure is extremely important because these are the areas where other modes of transportation have been most deprived .
Thus it ’s no coincidence that obesity is higher in the suburbs than in downtown urban areas .
Automobile traffic is also generally much faster than dense urban areas , so building safe infrastructure is critical before people will even remotely consider utility cycling .
Tens of thousands of suburban dwellers use commuter trains to get to work in Toronto .
There is no reason why these commuters should n’t have the option to ride a bike to the train station or to the corner store ..
Except for the lack of safe infrastructure to do so .

Coaching hockey can be a complicated endeavor .
The required skill - set to be a good coach is much different than the skill - set to be a good player .
Because of this difference , many people find it difficult to make the transition from player to coach .
I often hear new coaches say “ I know what my players should be doing , but I do n’t know how to get them to do it … ” or “ I do n’t know how to explain proper skating technique , I just know how to show it … ”
In these situations , I usually recommend that the coach try to break each skill down into three key points that he or she can verbalize .
For example , if I were explaining proper forward skating technique , I would say that each player needs to ( 1 ) maintain a good knee bend , ( 2 ) push each stride to the side at about a 45° angle ( not straight back ) , and ( 3 ) avoid head - bobbing .
These three steps are easy for players to remember , and will become a reference point for you to come back to if skating technique becomes sloppy in subsequent hockey drills .
Once you have one or two players who are able to execute the given skill correctly , ask them to demonstrate the skill , and tell the other players to “ watch the demonstration , visualize themselves executing with the same precision , and imitate the final result . ”
Reminding the players to watch , visualize , and imitate helps to encourage and motivate the precise execution of the given skill .
This coaching strategy can be applied to most situations , and can include everything from individual skills to team systems and positioning .
Breaking skills and concepts down into three simple steps can help you , as a coach , to verbalize what you want the players to do .
It will also help the players to comprehend and implement the instructions you are giving them .
Once the players are executing the given skill correctly , you will them be able to make small tweaks that will further enhance their playing abilities .
all your problems are over

U.S. conservatives have blasted James Cameron ’s blockbuster space epic Avatar for depicting U.S. marines as villains , others have critiqued it as a patronizing tale of a white American rescuing a native people from the ravages of imperialism , but the most unique criticism of the film yet may come from the St. Petersburg Communist Party :
In the recently issued statement they claim that the sci - fi blockbuster is trying to justify the Nobel Prize award given to Barack Obama , but fails in its task as no one would believe that a US marine in the film ( who the Communists describe as a “ murderer and oppressor of Iraq , Yugoslavia , Afghanistan , Haiti and Somalia ” ) can stand for good .
It should be noted that the production of Avatar began four years ago when Obama was n’t even in office .
“ It is quite funny to watch how the activists of the national liberation movement of Pandora accept a Pentagon - made mutant instead of judging him by the laws of the revolutionary time , ” the communists noted . [… ]
“ The carefully concealed nature of an aggressor , traitor and maniac quickly discerned itself in Cameron ’s film – according to the plot , Venezuela has already been invaded , Chavez is killed , and the hordes of G.I. break out into the Solar System , burning everything in their path .
Conditionally separating the film ’s heroes from the bad ones – Republicans ( the head of the human ’s colony and the marines ) , and good ones – Democrats , led by Jake Sully and fanatical botany professor ( Sigourney Weaver ) , Cameron comes to the absurd – taking the side on of an extraterrestrial civilization in conflict with humanity . ”
At the end of the statement is the demand “ to ban the presentation of all Cameron ’s films in Russia until he recognizes the plagiarism and robbing of Soviet science fiction in order to create his low - grade blockbuster . ”
It 's nearly that time again , and folks are already asking when the Germantown beer walk is .
For those lost in translation , and for others just foggy about the particulars , the walk is the last Saturday in April .
Every year , just right before Derby , the bars of Germantown collectively collaborate and lock down the surrounding streets of the neighborhood and allow people to walk from one bar to the next drinking and carrying on as if this were an everyday event .
It 's definitely a neighborhood holiday of sorts , and even a well - known festivity all about the city .
As the Afternoon sun breaks and the bars begin to put up their street barricades , beer tents , and karaoke equipment , the Germantown lifers begin to plot on their evening drinking schedule .
Participating homeowners in the area ready food and ice down their pre-walking alcohol .
It 's an all day event for most , and for some , an almost Olympic worthy sport in twelve ounce beer curling .
Just before dark the streets start to liven up , fill with more and more people , and echo treble heavy music from blaring speakers .
The parking lot of Mo's food mart becomes a revolving door of patrons and drunkards alike frequenting for twelve packs of canned domestic beer , cigarettes , and grippos potato chips .
Only the essentials are sold there , and how could one go wrong with these three such products ?
That 's right , you can't go wrong there , but you 'll certainly miss a hell of a time if you do n't reserve an open night in your schedule for the 24th of April .

Jennifer Duffy , a senior editor and U.S. Senate analyst for The Cook Political Report , said Boxer ’s high - profile donors are n’t likely to hurt her with Golden State voters .
“ In California , it ’s pretty accepted because most of the people who gave Boxer money actually vote in California , ” Duffy said .
“ I do n’t believe it tells us anything new about Boxer or her politics .
She has a voting record that supports many of the same causes that the stereotypical celebrity supports . ”
Boxer ’s campaign emphasizes that besides celebrities , Boxer received donations from a wide array of physicians , farmers , homemakers and others .
Rose Kapolczynski , Boxer ’s campaign manager , said Boxer is “ proud to have earned the support of a broad cross-section of this incredibly diverse state that is home to every possible profession , from high - tech entrepreneurs to nurses to farmers to actors . ”
“ In fact , one of the most represented professions among our donors is teachers — thousands of teachers have contributed to her campaign .
Nearly a thousand people are in the ‘ Be A Boxer ’ program of recurring small monthly contributions — including a bookkeeper in Los Angeles and a truck driver in Union City .
“ More than 61,000 people have contributed to Sen Boxer 's campaign -- including people in every single county in California and every single state in the union .
Eighty percent of Boxer contributions are under $ 100 . ”
Boxer ended 2009 in prime financial shape .
Subtracting her expenses and adding the money she already had on hand , she rang in the New Year with more than $ 7.2 million on hand .
No one else came close — according to the FEC , GOP candidate Carly Fiorina was the next - closest winner in the money race , ending the year with $ 2.7 million in the bank .
Boxer does have a challenger in the June 8 primary elections — online political blogger Mickey Kaus , who filled out campaign papers earlier this month but has not yet filed an FEC report .

Everybody dies .
But not everybody 's death leads to the death of an entire clan .
But that is what happened in the Andamans Nicobar Islands , when Boa Sr , the last member of a unique tribe , died last week .
Boa Sr , aged 85 , was the last speaker of ' Bo ' , one of the 10 Great Andamanese languages , says a report in Survival .
The Bo are said to have lived in the Andaman Islands for as much as 65,000 years , making them the descendants of one of the oldest human cultures on Earth .
Boa Sr was the oldest of the Great Andamanese .
Originally 10 distinct tribes , the Great Andamanese were 5,000 - strong when the British colonized the Andaman Islands .
Most were killed or died of diseases
After having failed to lure them , the story goes , the British tried to civilize them by relocating them in an Andaman Home .
Expectedly , of the 150 children born there , none survived beyond the age of two .
The Survival reports : Linguist Anvita Abbi , who knew Boa Sr , said , ' Since she was the only speaker of Bo she was very lonely as she had no one to converse with Boa Sr. had a very good sense of humour and her smile and full throated laughter were infectious .
Survival 's director Stephen Corry said , " The Great Andamanese were first massacred , then all but wiped out by paternalistic policies which left them ravaged by epidemics of disease , and robbed of their land and independence . "
' With the death of Boa and the extinction of the Bo language , a unique part of human society is now just a memory .
Boa 's loss is a bleak reminder that we must not allow this to happen to the other tribes of the Andaman Islands . '
Boa
Sr survived the 2004 tsunami and famously told linguists , ' We were all there when the earthquake came .
The eldest told us ' the Earth would part , do n't run away or move ' .
The elders told us , that 's how we know . '
Now , there is no one like an elder .
For that matter , a young one .
The final epitaph is sealed .
Is anyone listening ?
MacGruber was released to the theaters this weekend , and preliminary reviews put it among the best SNL films .
Previous to MacGruber , Lorne Michaels and Saturday Night Live have put out ten films , including sequels , over the past 30 years based on short sketches .
They created a couple of classics and a bunch of movies so awful it makes me never want to go to any theater that the flick had tainted .
The Blues Brothers and Wayne ’s World would likely top reader polls as the best of the bunch , so instead , we ’ll ask you what film is the worst .
That is sure to yield more compelling results .
What better thing to do with your time than to vote for the worst Saturday Night Live film ?
But first , the candidates :
1 The Blues Brothers 1980
A silly movie , sure , but it had such great music that it became a classic .
Rest in peace , John Belushi .
Could n’t find a clip that I could embed , so here ’s Soul Man !
2 Wayne ’s World 1992
This Mike Meyers / Dana Carvey movie made bank and resurrected Queen ’s Bohemian Rhapsody .
Schwiiing !
3 Coneheads 1993
Many years after the skit even aired , an all - star cast made this travesty of a flick .
4 Wayne ’s World 2 1993
Of course they put out a sequel .
But the joke was over .
5 It ’s Pat : The Movie 1994
The Julia Sweeney skit was hilarious the first few times , then it got old , then it was outright terrible on the big screen .
6 Stuart Saves His Family 1995
This is the reason why no one should have voted for Al Franken as senator of Minnesota .
7 Blues Brothers 2000 1998
8 A Night at the Roxbury 1998
The highlight of Chris Katan ’s career .
And who would ’ve thought Will Ferrel would ’ve made it so big ?
9 Superstar 1999
Again , a funny skit , but the Molly Shannon character just did n’t work well as a full - length feature .
10 The Ladies ’ Man 2000
This skit was n’t even funny …
This is my vote for the worst .

In honor of Pi Day , here ’s a semi - brief history of how pi came to be known as 3.14( 1592653589793238462643383279502884197169 … and so on ) .
The history lesson
It 's hard to pinpoint who , exactly , first became conscious of the constant ratio between the circumference of a circle and its diameter , though human civilizations seem to have been aware of it as early as 2550 BC .
The Great Pyramid at Giza , which was built between 2550 and 2500 BC , has a perimeter of 1760 cubits and a height of 280 cubits , which gives it a ratio of 1760 / 280 , or approximately 2 times pi .
( One cubit is about 18 inches , though it was measured by a person 's forearm length and thus varied from one person to another . )
Egyptologists believe these proportions were chosen for symbolic reasons , but , of course , we can never be too sure .
The earliest textual evidence of pi dates back to 1900 BC ; both the Babylonians and the Egyptians had a rough idea of the value .
The Babylonians estimated pi to be about 25/8 ( 3.125 ) , while the Egyptians estimated it to be about 256/81 ( roughly 3.16 ) .
Archimedes did n't calculate the exact value of pi , but rather came up with a very close approximation — he used 96 - sided polygons to come up with a value that fell between 3.1408 and 3.14285 .
The Ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse ( 287-212 BC ) is largely considered to be the first to calculate an accurate estimation of the value of pi .
He accomplished this by finding the areas of two polygons : the polygon that was inscribed inside a circle , and the polygon in which a circle was circumscribed ( see figure above , right ) .
Chinese mathematician Zhu Chongzhi ( AD 429-500 ) used a similar method to approximate the value of pi , using a 12,288 - sided polygon .
His best approximation was 355/113 .
The approximate ratio for pi also appears in the Bible in 1 Kings 7:23 :
" And he made a molten sea , ten cubits from the one brim to the other : it was round all about , and his height was five cubits : and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about . "
( I should point out that the Biblical ratio for pi could be more accurate than one might think , since cubits changed depending on a person 's forearm length .
So , assuming the Bible is n't quoting cubits from the same person each time … )
In the 15th century , Indian mathematician Madhavan of Sangamagramam discovered what is now known as the Madhava - Leibniz series ( named after German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz , who rediscovered the series in the 17th century ) , an infinite series that converges to four .
Madhavan subsequently calculated pi to 11 decimal places .
Later , in 1707 , Welsh mathematician William Jones was the first to use the Greek letter pi ( π ) to denote the constant ratio , though it was n't until 1737 that Swiss mathematician and physicist Leonhard Euler popularized the use of the symbol .
The π symbol was taken from the Greek word for " perimeter . "
The most accurate calculation of pi before the advent of the computer was by D. F. Ferguson , who calculated pi to 620 digits in 1945 ( previously , William Shanks had calculated pi to 707 digits in 1874 , but only 527 of said digits were correct ) .
Of course , then computers entered the picture and calculating pi knew no bounds — beginning with D. F. Ferguson 's calculation of pi to 710 digits in 1947 with a desk calculator to Takahashi Kanada 's calculation of pi to 206,158,430,000 digits in 1999 with a Hitachi SR8000 .
Shigeru Kondo carried out the longest calculation of pi to date on October 19 , 2011 .
Kondo used Alexander
Yee ’s y-cruncher program to calculate pi to 10 trillion digits , which is a record calculation for both supercomputers and home computers .
So there you have it — Egyptians calculated pi using pyramids ( or did they calculate pyramids using pi ? ) , Archimedes busted out the 96 - gon , Zhu Chongzhi one - upped him with a 12,288 - gon ( or is that 12,192 - upped him ? ) , Ferguson calculated 620 digits by hand , and Kondo used a supercomputer to nab the current world record of 10 trillion digits .
Pi in pop culture
But wait — the obsession with pi is n’t just limited to mathematicians and scientists .
Pi has a special place in popular culture , thanks to its prevalence in mathematical formulae and its mysterious nature .
Even completely non-cerebral shows , books , and movies ca n’t help but mention the popular constant .
For example , pi gets mentioned in a scene from Twilight , in which vampire - boy Robert Pattinson recites the square root of pi ( and on - the - ball Kristin Stewart quickly shuts him down ) .
The Simpsons is also pretty into pi ( and math references in general ) .
In one scene , two young girls at a school for the gifted play patty - cake and say “ Cross my heart and hope to die , here ’s the digits that make pi , 3 .
1415926535897932384 … ”
In another scene , a sign at the Springfield graveyard says “ Come for the funeral , stay for the π . ”
Albert the Intern contemplates pi .
Yep , whether you like it or not , pi is everywhere .
Here are a few more places it ’s popped up :
Finally , pi is perhaps most rampant in pop culture on March 14 — Pi Day !
On Pi Day , nerds , geeks , and mildly interested geometry students alike come together and wear pi-themed clothing , read pi-themed books , and watch pi-themed movies , all while eating pi-themed pie .
Just think of how excited everyone will get two years from now , when Pi Day falls on 3/14/15 .
Correction , March 14 , 2013 : An earlier version of this story mistakenly stated that Archimedes ' estimate for pi was 3.1485 .
His actual estimate calculated pi to be between 3.1408 and 3.14285 .
( If you average these two figures , you get an in - between point of 3.141851 . )
We regret the error .

Saed a - Sultan , principal
In August 2009 I became the principal of the Abu J'afer al - Mansur Elementary and Middle School for Boys , which is comprised of grades six to nine .
The school was built in 1994 , when the Palestinian Authority came to Gaza , and has 24 classrooms , a principal 's office , a teachers ' room , a science lab , a computer lab , a library , and a gym .
The school was hit by gunfire and shelling during the war , and soldiers also held detainees in it .
Also , Israeli bulldozers destroyed part of the school 's walls and damaged the electricity , water , and telephone infrastructure .
The building is in terrible shape .
The classrooms , bathrooms , lab , library , furniture , windows , and doors were all damaged by the gunfire and shelling .
The building does n't look like a school , it looks like a wreck .

When I began working at the school , its poor condition was very hard for me .
I did n't know what to do with the destroyed rooms , which had no chairs , tables , or closets , and the teacher 's room that was ruined .
Since seven rooms were completely destroyed , we had to divide the children among the other classrooms , so there are now 47 - 50 pupils in each one , compared to no more than 37 previously .
The high number of pupils in each room affects their ability to concentrate and learn .
Classroom damaged in Operation Cast Lead , still not repaired .

The classrooms that were not totally destroyed are in bad shape .
There are not enough tables and chairs , and the doors and window panes are gone .
We sealed the windows with nylon , but nylon does n't last for long and is not a substitute for glass in any case .
The noise from outside makes it hard for the pupils to hear the teacher , and the wind and cold penetrate the room .
In addition , sometimes there are electricity blackouts , just like in the rest of the Gaza Strip .
The classrooms go dark , and the children find it hard to see the blackboard .
The pupils have trouble concentrating in conditions like this , with the overcrowding , the noise , and the poor lighting .
All these things also affect the atmosphere in the school .
There is n't much we can do to make it easier for the pupils and to make learning a pleasant experience for them .
In the schoolyard , everywhere you look you see destruction and marks from the shooting and shelling , which constantly reminds the pupils of the war and the harsh things they saw .
Some of the pupils were injured in the war , others lost family and friends , and the homes of some of them were destroyed or damaged .
Some of them fled from their homes to stay with relatives or to schools , and lived under severe conditions .
They are still carrying these experiences and memories with them , especially when they find themselves in an environment in which signs of the war are visible everywhere .
Due to the siege , there are no building materials , so it is impossible to improve the situation and repair the school .
Israel is denying our pupils the right to study like children all over the world do and to enjoy a normal life .

Morality Policing
The police treat protests and festivals as a threat to their power
By George Monbiot , published in the Guardian 20th March 2010
This Thursday a year will have passed since Ian Tomlinson died after being assaulted by a policeman at the G20 protests .
No charges have been brought ; no one has been punished .
Despite 300 official complaints about the policing of the protests on April 1st , and plenty of video and photographic evidence , no officer has faced serious disciplinary proceedings ( 1,2 ) .
Those who removed their identification numbers , beat up peaceful protesters and bystanders , then repeatedly lied about what had happened remain untroubled , either by the law or their superior officers .
There has been no apology to Tomlinson ’s family .
Contrast this with another case , in which a Nottinghamshire police officer caused two deaths in June .
As soon as it happened , the police reported themselves to the Independent Police Complaints Commission and launched their own investigation .
A chief superintendent told the press that “ we will certainly take any lessons we can get from this process and make sure we put them in place so this sort of thing never happens again .
It has caused immense sadness and immense shock .
” (3 ) The papers carried pictures of officers paying tribute , saluting the flowers left outside police headquarters ( 4 ) .
There was no cover up , no botched post - mortem , no lies about the victims or their families .
The officer responsible was quickly charged and , though his victims died as a result of neglect not assault , last month he was convicted over the deaths ( 5 ) .
There ’s a significant difference between the two cases : the Nottinghamshire victims were dogs .
The officer had left two police dogs in his car and forgot about them while he completed some paperwork .
Judging by their response to these two tragedies , both police and prosecutors appear to care more about dogs than human beings .
Later this week the Association of Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) will publish its draft manual for policing protests .
Expect police forces to assure us that the bad old days of beating up protesters are over .
And do n’t believe a word of it .
Seven days before the G20 demos last year , the parliamentary committee on human rights published a damning report on the policing of protest .
It proposed that “ counter - terrorism powers should never be used against peaceful protesters ” ; and that “ the presumption should be in favour of protests taking place without state interference ” ( 6 ) .
Police chiefs insisted that they took the report seriously .
A week later the Met deployed the tactics the committee had criticised .
In November the chief inspector of constabulary lambasted the way protests are policed .
He urged the police to stop treating protesters as the enemy and reminded them that they have a duty under human rights law to facilitate peaceful assembly .
The policing of public events , he said , “ demands more than a rigid response within a conveniently harsh legal environment . ” ( 7 ) But little has changed .
Last week at Isleworth Crown Court the prosecution abandoned a case brought against a protester called Jake Smith ( 8 ) .
Smith had been charged with violent disorder at a protest outside the Israeli embassy : the police accused him of throwing a stick at them , and produced video evidence which appeared to support them .
Though Mr Smith found some material on YouTube that told a different story , they stuck to their line , and denied that they had any more footage of the incident .
Two days before the case was about to begin , the police admitted that they had a further seven and a half hours of videos .
What they showed was that another man had thrown the stick then run away ; Smith , by contrast , had committed the traditional offence of having the crap beaten out of him by riot cops .
Just as dead civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan become terrorists , protesters beaten by the police become guilty of violent disorder : how else can their treatment be explained , and what other means do the police have of silencing them ?
Smith ’s lawyer maintains that the video evidence the Met had used was a “ cut and paste job ” : a bit like the story they codded up about Ian Tomlinson .
A fortnight ago , the Cambridgeshire force won the battle it has been waging against peaceful assembly , when it forced the cancellation of Strawberry Fair , a free festival that has taken place in Cambridge every summer since 1972 .
At the beginning of March the fair was licensed for this year by the city council , against the protests of the police .
In order to show what a terrifying threat to public order it presented , Cambridge police posted up a video of scenes from the last festival : a few hippies skinning up and some people pissing against a tree .
They took it down again when they realised that it made them look like total wallies , breaking up picnics and arresting people for microscopic particles of hash ( 9 ) .
But though they had told the local paper that they were “ not aware of any major incidents at the event ” ( 10 ) , they lodged an appeal against the licence .
As the alternative magazine Schnews points out , the appeal could n’t have been resolved until soon before the fair was due to begin ( 11 ) .
If the police had won , it would have forced a last - minute cancellation of the kind that bankrupted the Big Green Gathering last year ( 12 ) .
The organisers had no choice but to cancel .
The police told the BBC , “ we are surprised that the Strawberry Fair organisers have decided to cancel this year ’s event … we are not against the event in principle , and never have been . ” ( 13 ) This looks disingenuous on both counts .
The chair of the city council ’s licensing committee attacked the “ unelected and unaccountable police force ” for countermanding a democratic decision ( 14 ) .
Schnews also reports that Durham police have just lost their case against Andrew Norman , the organiser of Thimbleberry Festival , who was charged with allowing his premises ( a field ) to be used for taking cannabis .
The case should never have come to court ( 15 ) .
It is hard to see what protection policing of this kind offers the public .
Every summer the cops spend millions of pounds patrolling and disrupting peaceful festivals like this , for no obvious purpose except to spoil people ’s fun .
This is morality policing of the kind you ’d expect in Iran or Saudi Arabia .
In both cases – protests and festivals – the police trample our legal right to peaceful assembly , cause trouble where none existed before , cobble together evidence against the people they want to stop , deny responsibility for their actions and treat peaceful citizens like enemies of the state .
No recommendations – from parliament , the chief inspector , ACPO or the Home Office – are likely to change this pattern much , because this is about power .
The police believe that they should exercise unchallenged control over public space : any gathering is a threat to their hegemony .
The reviews and proposals published so far have failed because they treat the problem as a tactical issue .
It ’s not : it is deeply rooted in the politics and culture of the police .
We must demand much bolder reforms than these if we want the police to stop behaving as if they run this country .

The Obama administration on Saturday called for a broad overhaul of President George W. Bush ’s No Child Left Behind law , proposing to reshape divisive provisions that encouraged instructors to teach to tests , narrowed the curriculum , and labeled one in three American schools as failing .
By announcing that he would send his education blueprint to Congress on Monday , President Obama returned to a campaign promise to repair the sprawling federal law , which affects each of the nation ’s nearly 100,000 public schools .
His plan strikes a careful balance , retaining some key features of the Bush - era law , including its requirement for annual reading and math tests , while proposing far - reaching changes .
The administration would replace the law ’s pass - fail school grading system with one that would measure individual students ’ academic growth and judge schools based not on test scores alone but also on indicators like pupil attendance , graduation rates and learning climate .
And while the proposal calls for more vigorous interventions in failing schools , it would also reward top performers and lessen federal interference in tens of thousands of reasonably well - run schools in the middle .
In addition , President Obama would replace the law ’s requirement that every American child reach proficiency in reading and math , which administration officials have called utopian , with a new national target that could prove equally elusive : that all students should graduate from high school prepared for college and a career .
Washington ( CNN ) --
Democratic congressional leaders unveiled a long - awaited $ 940 billion compromise health care plan Thursday , setting the stage for a final legislative showdown on President Obama 's domestic priority .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs announced that Obama had decided to delay an upcoming trip to Australia and Indonesia to help push the bill over the finish line .
The president had been set to depart Washington on Sunday , the same day that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the measure .
Watch Gibbs defend health plan maneuver
" I 'm sure he wants to be here for the history , " said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - California .
If enacted , the measure would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid more than four decades ago .
It would extend insurance coverage to an additional 32 million Americans , according to a preliminary analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .
Among other things , the plan would expand Medicare prescription drug coverage , increase federal subsidies to help people buy insurance , and ban denials of coverage for pre-existing conditions .
It seeks to bridge the gap between previous House and Senate bills partly by watering down and delaying the implementation of a tax on high - end insurance plans .
As with earlier House and Senate plans , it includes significant reductions in Medicare spending , in part through changes in payments made under the Medicare Advantage program .
It also eliminates a deeply unpopular provision in the Senate bill that exempts Nebraska from paying increased Medicaid expenses .
The compromise plan would cut the nation 's deficit by $ 138 billion over the next 10 years , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
It would further reduce the deficit by more than $ 1 trillion in the following decade .
The full House is now tentatively set to consider two measures Sunday : the $ 875 billion plan passed by the Senate in December and the compromise , which would bring the total to $ 940 billion .
The compromise plan cannot become law if the Senate bill is not also enacted .
If the Senate bill passes , it would go to Obama to be signed into law .
If the revisions unveiled Thursday are also approved , they would still have to clear the Senate .
House members unhappy with the less expansive Senate bill have received assurances from top Senate Democrats that they will pass the $ 940 billion compromise .
House Democrats pushed hard to ensure the compromise included an expansion of subsidies to low - and middle - income families , as well as a reduction in the tax on high - end " Cadillac " plans .
Rep. Henry Waxman , D - California , told reporters Thursday that the budget office 's cost estimate " will go a long way to get [ fiscally conservative Democrats ] to feel comfortable with the legislation . "
The Senate bill , if allowed to stand unchanged , would reduce federal deficits by $ 20 billion less than the compromise plan over the next 10 years .
GOP leaders said the new budget office estimate of the revised plan had not changed their opinion of the overall measure , which they vehemently oppose .
" It 's not too late for the American people to continue to speak up , " House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said Thursday .
" They need to yell a little louder , and we can stop this . "
Republicans insist the Democratic proposal will do little to slow spiraling medical costs .
They also say it would lead to higher premiums and taxes for middle - class families while resulting in deep Medicare cuts .
Pelosi has nevertheless expressed confidence in recent weeks that she will have enough support to pass both the Senate plan and the compromise bill when they come to the House floor .
The speaker needs 216 votes from her 253 - member caucus to pass the measures .
No Republicans are expected to back either one .
Watch Pelosi express her confidence in the plan
Twenty - seven House Democrats indicated to CNN on Wednesday they will join Republicans in opposing the Senate plan .
That leaves opponents of reform 11 votes shy of defeating the measure .
Pelosi has tried to sweeten the deal for House liberals by adding a large student loan reform measure to the compromise plan .
The measure , which is a priority for Obama , would end the practice of having private banks offer student loans while expanding direct lending from the government .
The speaker may also try to help House Democrats unhappy with the Senate bill by allowing them to avoid a direct vote on the measure .
She is considering pushing for a vote on a rule that would simply " deem " the Senate bill to be passed .
The House then would proceed to a separate vote on the changes incorporated in the $ 940 billion version of the plan .
Read about the highlights of the compromise plan
Republicans failed Thursday to force a vote on a resolution requiring the Senate health care bill to be brought to an up - or - down vote .
GOP leaders are also fuming over Democrats ' decision to use a legislative maneuver called reconciliation , which will allow the $ 940 billion plan -- if passed by the House -- to clear the Senate with a simple majority of 51 votes .
Senate Democrats lost their filibuster - proof 60 - seat supermajority in January with the election of GOP Sen .
Scott Brown of Massachusetts .
Republicans say that reconciliation , which is limited to provisions pertaining to the budget , was never meant to facilitate passage of a sweeping reform measure such as the health care bill .
Democrats say that reconciliation was used to pass several major bills in recent years , including President George W. Bush 's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts .
Public opinion polls indicate that Americans remain sharply divided over the Democrats ' health care reform agenda , though individual elements of it remain widely popular .
CNN 's Ted Barrett , Dana Bash , Lisa Desjardins , Brianna Keilar and Kristi Keck contributed to this report .

ORLANDO , Fla . ( PAI ) – The AFL - CIO will integrate its political drive with its pro-jobs campaign this year , holding politicians accountable and refusing to support those who do n’t actually do something to help suffering workers , top leaders say .
Speaking to reporters on March 2 during the federation ’s executive council meeting here , federation political committee chair Gerry McEntee – the AFSCME president , political director Karen Ackerman and Working America director Karen Nussbaum said the integration has already started .
That start was highlighted at a town hall meeting on March 1 in Orlando featuring suffering workers , and a decision the next day to back the fed ’s Arkansas affiliate , which is supporting Lt. Gov. Bill Halter , the primary challenger to Sen.
Blanche Lincoln , D - Ark .
“ We helped elect Lincoln and she has n’t basically voted for any legislation for the labor movement , ” McEntee elaborated .
There are 45,000 unionists in Arkansas .
“ She ’s been against the Employee Free Choice Act and she ’s been against the public option ” in health care reform , among other issues , McEntee said .
“ We ’ll send a message to other politicians … When people are as recalcitrant as this on workers ’ issues , you have to do something . ”
The integrated campaign includes a “ week of action ” starting March 15 and continuous education aimed at unionists and their families , plus non-union workers .
It will concentrate more on issues and on holding politicians accountable not just for kind words but for real actions , the three said .
That ’s the point of the Halter endorsement .
Neither McEntee nor Ackerman provided estimates on how much the federation would spend nor how many people it would put in the field in this year ’s election cycle .
The AFL - CIO ’s election spending in 2007 - 08 – not counting sums spent by individual unions – totaled $ 53 million , and it marshaled 200,000 activists .
Ackerman said an informal survey of unions produced a spending figure of approximately $ 200 million then .
“ We ’ll spend what it takes in the political campaign and spend what it takes in the jobs campaign , ” Ackerman promised .
The federation ’s decision , to be implemented over the next few months – McEntee ’s committee will meet in D.C. the week of March 8 to start hashing out details – comes as workers and their allies face what all three admit will be a “ difficult ” political landscape this fall .
Conditions are so bad that another labor official , Sheet Metal Workers legislative representative Vincent Panvini , predicts Democrats will lose the House and the Senate .
But Ackerman and Nussbaum laid down some guideposts about where and how labor would spend its political money .
Ackerman named “ a firewall ” of six states – New York , California , Illinois , Ohio , Nevada and Pennsylvania – with key races for the Senate and House to keep a pro-worker majority on Capitol Hill .
All those states also have gubernatorial seats and state legislative races , she added .
Those contests are important to workers because the states will redraw both state and federal district lines in 2011 - 2012 , affecting who will or wo n’t represent workers in Congress and in state legislatures .
But she could not break down planned spending percentages on congressional , gubernatorial or state legislative contests .
Nussbaum , whose organization now numbers 3 million workers who agree with organized labor on the issues but who for various reasons can’t join unions , had her own list of states Working America will mobilize in : Arkansas , Colorado , Connecticut , Michigan , Minnesota , Nevada , New Mexico , Ohio and Pennsylvania .
“ And there might be 10 more , ” she added .
In all of those states , and nationwide , “ people are at the tipping point ” about jobs and the economy , Nussbaum said .
“ They ’re not angry at ( President ) Obama , but at the government for failing to deliver ” when they ’re in need .
“ It ’s our job to talk about alternatives when they do n’t see immediate improvements in their lives . ”
Talking about alternatives returns the discussion to the other half of the federation ’s integrated drive : the jobs campaign , begun by the town hall meeting at the Painters hall in Orlando .
Hundreds of other such meetings will occur in coming weeks , AFL - CIO staffers said later .
The schedule is still being constructed .
“ This is the kickoff of a national conversation , ” AFL - CIO President Richard Trumka told the standing - room - only crowd in the Painters hall , which overflowed outside .
“ It ’s about jobs , it ’s about health care , it ’s about lost wages , it ’s about retirement security and it ’s about fears that the values you heard tonight ” – the value of hard work at good wages to provide decent family lives – “ are not the values that have driven this country ” in recent years .
“ When there are systemic problems , it ’s time to change the system , ” he added .
“ But we can do that only as a community . ”

Although interpretations of both the American and French Revolution vary , there is still a spectrum of thought that includes the belief that one was more influential than the other .
However , the American Revolution has been characterized not as a “ revolution ” , but as a shift of government from distant to local .
Therefore , radical changes that emerged from radical events greatly impacted world affairs .
The American Revolution brought about peoples “ natural rights ” , republicanism - neither good nor bad , and a system of laws that were chosen by the people .
On the other hand , we ca n’t ignore the fact that the French Revolution introduced a platform of laissez - faire reforms in Europe during the 19th century and remain today as simplistic forms of democracy .
After the Glorious Revolution and the Magna Carta , British citizens felt they had more freedom and rights and were protected from injustice .
Not only that , but the Americans understood their law and government .
If there was a so called injustice , they had the precedent of the Glorious Revolution that told them when it was being done , therefore it could be retaliated against .
This rational perspective resulted in their independence and the formation of one of the most influential nations of the modern world .
On the other hand , the French Revolution played an important role with religion .
The freedom of religion and the press , as articulated in the Declaration of the Rights of Man , resulted in freedom of morality and status for Protestants and Jews .
The Revolution ultimately paved the way for the separation of church and state .
Consequently , the American Declaration of Independence , as well as the American state constitutions , directly influenced what evolutionary changes were taking place in France .
Ultimately , the American Revolution proved to Europeans that liberalism during the Enlightenment was not a lifeless manifestation .
The ideas that man had the right to equality , thought , press , religion , and liberty proved to be the very embodiment of the American Revolution .
It created a new social contract , proving that a better world could be achieved .
The more intangible results of the Revolution were embodied in its watchwords , “ Liberty , Equality , and Fraternity ” .
However , ultimately , both Revolutions resulted in a highly centralized state and mass warfare involving total wars of nations - in - arms .
In the end , the American Revolution was far less important to Europe than the French Revolution , although in the Americas it was revolutionary .
The French Revolution was much more complex and radical , and while a new social order was established during the American Revolution , a political movement in France inaugurated the modern political world .
It ’s hard to say which revolution had more impact , simply because each contributed different aspects to the Americas and Europe .
( CNN ) --
The federal government is starting to deploy full - body scanning machines to 11 airports across the United States , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced Friday .
Forty body - imaging machines already have been put into use at 19 airports nationwide as part of a field test , according the Department of Homeland Security .
The Transportation Security Administration expects to deploy 450 units by the end of this year .
" By accelerating the deployment of this technology , we are enhancing our capability to detect and disrupt threats of terrorism across the nation , " Napolitano said in a statement .
The first of the new units are being installed Friday at Boston 's Logan International Airport , according to a DHS statement .
The list of other airports set to receive the scanners by the end of summer includes Chicago O'Hare International , Fort Lauderdale - Hollywood International , Cincinnati / Northern Kentucky International , Mineta San José International , Los Angeles International , Port Columbus International , Oakland International , San Diego International , Kansas City International and Charlotte Douglas International .
The imaging machines are being funded through the Obama administration 's $ 862 billion economic stimulus plan .
Under existing protocols , full - body scans are optional at airport checkpoints .
Travelers who decline the scans are funneled to a location where they may be given a pat down and subjected to other tests such as swabs that can detect minute traces of explosives on hands or luggage .
The TSA said most passengers prefer a body scan to a pat down .
But others have objected to the body scans , calling them electronic strip searches .
Passenger privacy is maintained during the scannning process by blurring all images , deleting images after they are viewed and placing the screener viewing the images in a remote location , according to DHS officials .
Acting TSA Administrator Gale Rossides testified before Congress on Thursday that the machines will not significantly slow the passenger screening process , saying it will be done at the same time as carry - on baggage screening .
The TSA has spent years testing full - body imagers .
Plans to deploy them this year were given added urgency after the arrest of a Nigerian man , Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab , who has been accused of attempting to detonate an explosive sewn into his underwear on a December 25 flight .
Field testing of full - body scanners already is under way at the following 19 airports :
• Albuquerque International Sunport Airport
• Hartsfield - Jackson Atlanta International Airport
• Baltimore / Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport
• Denver International Airport
• Dallas / Fort Worth International Airport
• Detroit Metro Airport
• Indianapolis International Airport
• Jacksonville International Airport
• McCarran International Airport
• Los Angeles International Airport
• Miami International Airport
• Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport
• Raleigh - Durham International Airport
• Richmond International Airport
• Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport
• San Francisco International Airport
• Salt Lake City International Airport
• Tampa International Airport
• Tulsa International Airport

Here 's the beginning of my talk on the politics of homosexuality at Princeton .
It 's in two parts , one just below , and continued after the jump .
It 's an attempt to take the arguments of both Protestant Biblical literalists and Catholic adherents of natural law on their own terms and to show how they make no internal sense ; how they are internally incoherent even on their own terms .
My same dissections on the delusions of the queer left , middle - of - the - road moderate conservatism and Human Rights Campaign liberalism , will be posted in the next few days .
The entire speech , if you have the time this weekend , can be seen here .
But here 's my case against the Biblical fundamentalists :
I tackle the natural law arguments here :
And here 's the clincher against the prohibitionist position that holds sway across much of the world today :
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
I believe you either have your facts and information backwards , or you have a short memory !
Statistics in National Media sources recently stated that females now outnumber males , in leading the corporate world .
For you to think men have the most influence in society , you obviously do not drive a car .
Females drive like they are immune to prosecution , because if they do get stopped , it is mostly a male that stops them , and cops being what they are in America , which is next to being a used car salesman , and the majority cops let females go .
You obviously never competed at the McDonald 's check out register against a male for the largest biggie fries .
You obviously never went to divorce court , and especially where children were involved !
Females are never satisfied , and do n't tell me you do n't eat up the preferential treatment you get from cops , court systems , and in every other walk of life .
You can be pregnant with my child , and if you want to abort the fetus , that I have deposited on loan with you , and entrusted in your care , which you only own half of it , you can decide to have my part of the fetus aborted as " freedom of choice " .
What about my freedom of choice ?
What if I wanted to keep and raise the baby ?
Did you stand up for my equal rights then ?
Or , what if I knew I could not afford to raise a child and wanted the child to be adopted out upon birth , but you wanted to keep the child at birth , does the court make you support it since you wanted it ?
Do n't tell me you are blind and can not feel the injustce and inequality in the air , because you are lying , injustice is just too thick .
Admit it , you just like the way it is , and , if the government ever comes down on you , well then , you pull the " poor me feminist routine " , and a " syndrome " is created just for you females .
You females have a syndrome for everything .
Why , with equal rights laws in the Constituion , and again with the civil rights and anti-discrimination laws that exist , did the feminists in the 1980's , push for an amendment to the US Costitution giving females equal rights ?
I will only believe that you stand for equality , when you take a public stand for it , denounce injustice against men , and denounce the use of innocent children as weapons in divrorce and custody issues , and , when you demonstrate equality by your actions .
In conclusion , there are many studies and statistics published if you care to research it , that are in direct conflict of the feminist stereotyping of men .
Females are equal or more responsible for domestic violence then men .
( Government study )
Females hurt their children or kill their children more then men .
More females are in jail for killing theri children , then men .
Female teachers are equally or more responsible for sexual acts against young men , then male teachers are against young girls .
Do n't blame men if you did not get to vote until the 1930's because , those were some sad days in America .
Yes ,
God ordained life the way it was suppose to be , where females were not suppose to be in leadership roles ,
What has happened in the past , which you are so proud of , is also responsible for the degeneration of the family , and society .
The world is a mess , you are right , but you are also responsible for it , because you are messing with God 's plan , not mine !
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed its opposition today to the healthcare reform bill making it's way through the House , arguing it 's too lenient on abortion .
" The American people and the Catholic bishops have been promised that , in any final bill , no federal funds would be used for abortion and that the legal status quo would be respected , " said Cardinal Francis George , USCCB president .
" However , the bishops were left disappointed and puzzled to learn that the basis for any vote on health care will be the Senate bill passed on Christmas Eve , " he added .
At issue is how strict provisions should be restricting funding for abortions .
The previous House - passed bill included language authored by Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) that disallowed any federal subsidies from being spent on plans that cover abortion .
The Senate bill , meanwhile , would allow subsidies to be spent on such plans as long as a sperate fee is paid to cover the abortion coverage .
A number or pro-life Democrats in the House , including Stupak , have pledged to vote against the weaker Senate version when it comes up for a vote .
" This is not quibbling over technicalities , " Cardinal George said .
" The deliberate omission in the Senate Bill of the necessary language that could have taken this moral question off the table and out of play leaves us still looking for a way to meet the President ’s and our concern to provide health care for those millions whose primary care physician is now an emergency room doctor . "
LONDON  Scientists warned on Wednesday that the world is on the brink of a major biodiversity crisis and called for the creation of an international body to advise governments on how to protect the planet 's ecosystems .
" All the scientific evidence points to the fact that whatever measure of vulnerability you take , whether it is local populations , species or ecosystem , we know that the rate at which we are altering them now is faster than it has been in the past , " Georgina Mace said in an interview .
Mace , director of science at the Institute of Zoology in London , is one of 19 scientists from 13 countries who signed a declaration published in the journal Nature explaining why an intergovernmental body is needed .
They said that although all aspects of biodiversity are in decline and many species are likely to become extinct this century , the crisis is not given the weight and importance it merits in public and private decision making .
The new panel would address policy - related issues and get the best consensus on what the scientific opinion really is .
" It is not telling policy makers what to do .
It is giving them advice about what the consequences of different decisions will be , " Mace added .
The experts , who include Dr Robert Watson , the chief scientist at the World Bank , suggested that a single global body similar to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) could speak for the biodiversity science world .
" For the sake of the planet , the biodiversity science community has to create a way to get organised , to coordinate its work across disciplines , and together with one clear voice advise governments on steps to halt the potentially catastrophic loss of species already occurring , " Watson said in a statement .
The scientists and experts from countries ranging from China , Chile and Canada to South Africa , Germany and the United States suggested that the panel should be independent , transparent and include input from governments , non-government organisations and the private sector .
They suggested the group be funded by governments and that it should generate information about trends in biodiversity and future changes so targets for action can be set .
The scientists said French President Jacques Chirac had supported the idea at an international conference in January 2005 .
" The French government is currently funding a consultation process to assess the need , scope and possible models for an international mechanism of scientific expertise on biodiversity , " they said in the statement .
The consultations are expected to produce recommendations within 18 months .

CLEVELAND , Ohio -- James McCafferty and Martin Zanotti , the two most visible faces behind Cuyahoga County 's transition to charter government , were on the hot seat this morning .
Dan Moulthrop , host of " The Sound of Ideas " ( follow this link to listen to an archived recording of the show ) on WCPN - FM / 90.3 , pressed the two -- with help from his skeptical listeners -- on a wide range of issues surrounding the changeover .
The most interesting discussions centered on transparency and openness of the transition process .
When announcing a roster of committee co-chairs last month , McCafferty and Zanotti said news reporters and the general public would not be welcome at all committee meetings .
It was an eyebrow - raising statement , given that the form of government being replaced by the charter drew complaints for its secretive , backroom dealings .
These committees , which will convene and operate with the support of the lame - duck county commissioners , will make a host of recommendations to the new county executive , who is not bound to accept them .
On the radio , Zanotti gave several reasons why he believes the committees must be able to conduct business behind closed doors .
For starters , he thinks reporters could be a distraction .
" It 's not that the public is not welcome , it 's the practicality of getting work done , " he said .
" It 's not practical to expect every single meeting to be open to media questions .
There are going to be times that people are going to need to sit in groups of five or six and just get work done . "
Another reason offered : Giving the public proper notice of all meetings is not feasible .
" Technically speaking , " Zanotti said in response to a question from Moulthrop , " we do n't believe the Sunshine Laws [ state guidelines for open meetings ] apply to us . "
McCafferty has pledged to make minutes -- a general rundown of what is discussed at each committee gathering -- available on the county 's
Web site after every meeting .
Several callers worried about a lack of transparency and a lack of diversity among transition leaders .
McCafferty and Zanotti are both white , but they cited black leaders such as State Sen. Nina Turner and Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson , both of whom will be committee co-chairs .
Boiled down to two words , the gist of McCafferty and Zanotti's message today : Trust us .
Quickit
After Reddit was rewritten in Python , some Lisp fans got the idea of writing clones of Reddit in Lisp .
I do n't have many spare cycles right now , and I 'm not in the market for a long - term project , so I set myself a slightly different goal : I decided to implement the largest possible subset of Reddit 's features that I could within one hour .
I think I did an ok job , considering .
One hour passes by rather quickly when you try something like this !
Here 's the code :
quickit.asd
package.lisp
quickit.lisp
All the above code is released under the BSD license .
Update : After I put Quickit online , a bug was found : Ranking an article down , and then hitting reload would keep ranking that article down .
At first I was n't going to fix the bug .
The whole point of the Quickit was to write a clone very quickly .
Fixing bugs at this point felt wrong .
But I decided to set myself another challenge :
Fix the bug and deploy a patch onto the running Lisp process in less than five minutes ...
It actually took a little over a minute and a half to fix the bug and push the new code onto the server ( without , of course , stopping the Lisp process ) .
The patch ( to quickit.lisp ) is :
55,56c55,56 < ( format out " < a href=http://abstractnonsense.org:8000/rankdown?id=~A><img border=0 src=down.png ></a> < a href= \ " ~A\ " >~ A </a> ( score ~ A ) < br > " < ( article - id article ) ( article - url article ) ( article - description article ) ( article - score article ) ) ) ) ) --- > ( format out " < a href=http://abstractnonsense.org:8000/rankdown?from=~A&id=~A><img border=0 src=down.png ></a> < a href= \ " ~A\ " >~ A </a> ( score ~ A ) < br > " > ( article - score article ) ( article - id article ) ( article - url article ) ( article - description article ) ( article - score article ) ) ) ) )
109c109,110 < ( id ( second ( assoc " id " params : test #'equalp ) ) ) ) --- > ( id ( second ( assoc " id " params : test #'equalp ) ) ) > ( from ( second ( assoc " from " params : test #'equalp ) ) ) )

I also moved Quickit from abstractnonsense.org to abstractnonsense.com ( actually the same machine ) because my dyndns entry for abstractnonsense.org mysteriously stopped working ... again , I did this without having to stop the process or lose any of the saved state .
