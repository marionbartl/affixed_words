An initiative backed by both mobile phone manufacturers and operators will result in a universal charger based on the Micro - USB interface for new mobile phones .
Moving to a universal charger will be a boon for both users and the environment by reducing the amount of waste , since fewer chargers have to be thrown away .
It will make life a lot easier for users , who will be able to charge their mobile phones using any available charger , and when they buy a new phone they wo n't have to get a new charger .
The group agreed that by the January 2012 , most mobile phones will support the universal charger , according to the GSM Association , which is leading the initiative .
Members on the phone and chipset side include LG , Motorola , Nokia , Qualcomm , Samsung and Sony Ericsson .
Members on the operator side include 3 Group , AT&T , KTF , Mobilkom Austria , Orange , Telecom Italia , Telefónica , Telenor , Telstra , T - Mobile and Vodafone .
Nokia sees the reduction of waste related to chargers as the biggest advantage with the initiative , but is n't ready to say when it will ship its first universal charger .
The company will provide both the universal charger and its standard charger during a transitional period , according to a spokeswoman at Nokia .
The GSM Association expects the first chargers to ship this year , according to its chief marketing officer Michael O'Hara .
Here are a couple techniques I use for setting up a CL website that runs at boot time .
They 're not especially generic or reusable as - is , but I hope the ideas are useful .
Booting : Here 's how I make sure l1 sp.org starts when I reboot my Linux box .
/etc/rc.local :

SVG 1.1 became a W3C recommendation on January 13 , 2003 .
Eight years later , this page records my results of running various SVG implementations ( web browsers and browser plugins ) through the official SVG Test Suite .
Last updated 2011 - 03 - 24 .
The following picture indicates the results of running all 280 tests in many popular SVG implementations in the wild .
Each test takes up a two - pixel strip in each column .
I use a top secret scoring system ... ok , well actually I just use GREEN for " Pass " ( 2 points ) , YELLOW for " Almost Pass " ( 1 point ) , RED for " Fail " ( 0 points ) and BLACK for " Fail with Crash " ( - 1 point ) .
The " Almost Pass " scoring is subjective , so think of it as me giving out points for trying .
Now I know that I 'm going to get complaints that the SVG test suite does n't cover all functionality ( I agree with you ) , nor does the score give a fair indication of other factors like performance ( again , I agree with you ) , so please take this page as what it is : A data point from a guy who had too much time on his hands but is interested in seeing how the overall quality of SVG implementations improves in the future .
Some Final Notes
With IE9 , Microsoft has finally released a browser that has strong support for the SVG core features ( shapes , text , gradients , masks , clipping , DOM , scripting ) .
This feature set is comparable to the set of features in the first releases of Gecko and WebKit that supported SVG and indicates that IE9 is a solid platform on which to build SVG web applications .
IE9 has not yet implemented the following set of features : SVG Animation ( SMIL ) , Filters or Fonts .
Though technically a shim , I added SVG Web to the plugin section .
It 's amazing that it scores so high while still in an ' alpha ' phase .
I did not add Chrome Frame plugin to this chart as it does not handle the SVG MIME type by default yet ( see this bug ) .
However , since it uses Webkit as its base , with the proper meta tag , it can function quite well in a pinch .
You can get a feel for its level of SVG support by looking at the latest Chrome score above .
If you have something to say about this chart , please leave me a comment on my blog .
Apparently as of right now , this stunning piece of high art is just a foam model mock - up , but listen to us , mouse manufacturers of the world : if you build this , we will give you every penny we have to own it .

We all know better than to believe the most recent Final Fantasy to be our last , and it ’s persistent cast of mages , moogles , and guys named Cid has become far less fantastical than familiar , but the Tactics spinoff has yet to entrench itself so strongly .
But not long enough ...
Still only in its third installment , FF Tactics is like an engorged tick on our arm , and only one match to the skin will expose it for the parasitical life sucker it yearns to become .
The word “ tactics ” is defined as “ the branch of military science dealing with detailed maneuvers to achieve objectives set by strategy . ”
In gaming terms , it evokes a plotting , plodding genre of tanks and hexagons , fog of war and field of influence , risk , reaction , resource management , positioning , and consequential choices .
Final Fantasy Tactics A2 , even more so than Tactics Advance or the original Tactics , has none of the above .
Nor does it offer the caliber of self - indulgently elliptic femme - boy parable to which this series has made us all over - accustomed .
In fact , the already insulting bullshit - to - plot ratio of Tactics Advance has been distilled impossibly further down to “ Illiterate sociopath teenager becomes contract killer / delivery boy in magical realm .
Keeps journal . ”
Do n't let his raspberry beret and high heels fool you - this kid is stone boring .
I ’ve seen better plots in Grand Theft Auto .
And , given that the game now progresses solely by going to the pub to sign up for plot - related missions amongst endless side - quests ( pssst !
Try picking the one quest that does n’t have a time limit associated with it ! ) , the comparison is n’t far off .
Except that driving ambulances and beating whores is fun , while waiting your turn to chase down a defenseless bloodied bunny rabbit so you can finally learn how to become a Tinker is not .
What the fuck good is a tinker anyway ?
There are n’t even poisonous marshes anymore !
Christ , archers can no longer shoot their friends by mistake ( Believe me , I ’ve tried . )
And you give me 57 new jobs to waste my time earning but take away the Chemist ?
Becoming that useless item - mongering fuck was the only tough decision we ever had to make in these games !
And what ’s with all this racial profiling ?
Where is it written in Ivalice canon that Moogles can’t grow up to be Gladiators , or that No Mou ca n’t Dance ?
What would Barack Obama say ?
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
This is a story that normally would n't get a lot of attention here , but this yarn involving a high - powered tech chieftain , a kowtowing Silicon Valley township , an old house and a clash of wills is worth telling .
The house is a 1920s - era mansion .
On one side of the clash is a group of historical preservationists who want to keep the house for posterity .
The chieftain ?
None other than Apple Inc. 's Steve Jobs .
More than four years ago , the town of Woodside -- a bucolic Silicon Valley enclave known to occasionally toady to the region 's high - tech billionaires -- approved an application by the Apple AAPL , +1.63 % co-founder and chief executive to tear down his Spanish Colonial Revival estate .
But the sprawling 1925 home remains standing because a group of preservationists intervened , and , after a lawsuit and appeal , Jobs lost .
Now , Jobs is trying again to demolish the estate , which he purchased in the early 1980s and lived in for about 10 years .
Known to be obsessive about the design of Apple 's products , Jobs wants to build a smaller , brand - new single - family house on the site of the once - elegant estate .
( No doubt one of those sleek numbers with crisp white spaces and free of buttons .
Sort of like a giant iPod or a Mac cube ? )
A new application will be heard Tuesday evening , in what may be a lively and contentious meeting .
No decisions are expected Tuesday , but based on past actions and some documents on a municipal Web site , the town of Woodside appears ready to grant Jobs another demo permit .
" The question now is whether the evidence he is submitting will let them legally permit the demolition , " said Brian Turner , an attorney for the Western region of the National Trust for Historic Preservation , a nonprofit created by Congress in 1949 to promote public participation in the preservation of historic resources in the U.S .
( Full disclosure : I 've watched this episode with interest because I 'm a member of this preservation group and have also written a book on San Francisco architecture . )
The house Jobs wants to destroy has been deemed historic for both architectural styling as well as notable former residents .
The 17,250 - square - foot estate was designed by architect George Washington Smith , renowned among architectural historians as an early and notable purveyor of the Spanish Colonial Revival style in Southern California .
The house , designed for copper magnate Daniel Jackling , is one of Smith 's rare works in Northern California and is replete with unique copper fixtures , evocative of his client 's occupation .
Jobs has been making an effort to give the house away , a condition specified in the original 2004 demolition permit .
The Apple chief is required by the town to market the estate at his own expense .
He then could donate the house to anyone with the financial wherewithal to relocate and restore it .
It has sat unoccupied for more than a decade .
Jobs would donate a " reasonable amount , as determined by the town manager , [ toward ] the cost of moving the massive house to a new location . "
It is not clear what Susan George , Woodside 's town manager , has deemed " reasonable . "
George did not respond to a request for comment .
Howard Ellman , Jobs ' attorney , said in a memo to the town of Woodside in September that after spending more than 100 hours marketing the Jackling house , " there are no persons or entities of which we are aware seriously considering the possibility of moving and restoring the Jackling Estate . "
He added that two financially strong parties are still considering the matter but that had yet to present any proposal in writing .
When reached by phone , though , Ellman said that all the relevant documents were on the town 's
Web site and that he had nothing further to say .
He then hung up .
Maybe he was anticipating a question about Jobs ' health , about which many investors remain anxious .
Last week , during Apple 's post - earnings - report conference call , executives said they looked forward to the CEO 's return to Apple in June after a leave of absence to deal with health issues .
Jobs ' attorney has typically shown up at Woodside meetings in the past , and Jobs is not expected to attend on Tuesday evening .
Another new argument for allowing demolition is that , according to contractors Jobs has hired , the cost of building a new residence would be approximately $ 8.2 million , while modernizing and restoring the Jackling house would cost $ 13.3 million .
But Uphold Our Heritage , a nonprofit founded to save the Jackling house , thinks the firm hired by Jobs may be overstating the extent of damage to the 84 - year - old residence .
The town of Woodside hired a San Francisco firm with expertise in architectural restoration , Architectural Resources Group , which gave an analysis of the property and of the relocation , and came up with a more economical method of moving the house .
Woodside does not have a good record in preserving its own history .
According to a letter written to the town by Wendy McCaw , a fan of Smith 's architecture who owns three of his buildings , when McCaw was growing up in nearby Portola Valley , she witnessed the destruction of many great estate homes and buildings .
I must confess my hope that this small but wealthy enclave will recognize the need to preserve some of its heritage and wo n't be so quick to grant Jobs another demolition permit .
But the fact that Jobs has not simply sold the house , which he has called poorly designed , shows his iron will .
Some have argued that he is purposely letting the house deteriorate .
Yet the episode offers a glimpse into how an influential tech titan can impose his will on a small Silicon Valley township , and how old values can conflict with new demands .
MLB Scouts Are Drooling Over Six Fingered Baby
Total Pro Sports – Earlier this week baseball scouts have been drooling over the fact that a potential MLB pitching star was born .
A California couple gave birth to a new baby boy , but the parents got a little more then they expected ; the baby was born with 6 fingers on each hand and 6 toes on each feet .
“ The presence of extra appendages , known as polydactyly , is reported in about 2 per 1000 children .
Usually , polydactylism presents as an extra piece of non-functional tissue , typically occurring as an extra finger with no bone .
Most of these cases are easily treated at birth by tying a string tightly around the base .
This causes the extra appendage to eventually fall off over time . ”
The news of the baby boys rare extra fingers reached the media like wild fire .
The boy has already been compared to relief pitcher Antonio Alfonseca .
Alfonseca won the 2000 National League reliever of the year award and in 1997 he helped the Florida Marlins win the World Series closing their games for them .
“ When Antonio Alfonseca was born in the Dominican Republic , in 1972 , with 6 fingers on each hand , no effort was made to remove the extra appendage .
While some professional scouts joked about Alfonseca ’s “ six - finger sinker , ” and teammates nicknamed him El Pulpo ( The Octopus ) , his success pitching in the majors speaks for itself . ” [ HealthGuru ]
“ Antonio ’s 6th finger is quite small in comparison to his other digits ( it looks much like a stump ) , it does n’t actually touch the baseball when he ’s pitching – and therefore his sinker is really just a conventional – albeit very effective – pitch . ”
The only problem is that doctors are unsure if the fingers will actually develop and become fully functional .
If the tissue does develop into functional fingers and not just an extra piece of non-functional tissue it would be scary to think of the potential this child may have .
But we raise the question if steroids are a banned substance is having an extra functional finger a legal advantage for a pitcher in Major League Baseball ?
I guess were just gonna have to wait about 16 years to find out .

A " unique " micrometeorite found in Antarctica is challenging ideas about how planets can form .
Detailed analysis has shown that the sample , known as MM40 , has a chemical composition unlike any other fragment of fallen space rock .
This , say experts , raises questions about where it originated in the Solar System and how it was created .
It also means that astrochemists must expand their list of the combinations of materials in planetary crusts .
The detailed analysis of MM40 was led by Matthieu Gounelle from the Laboratory of Mineralogy and Cosmochemistry at the French Natural History Museum .
Published in PNAS , the analysis revealed the " unique " chemical composition of MM04 despite it being only 150 microns across as its widest point - about half the width of a written full stop .
Micrometeorites are often seen as the ' poor man 's space probe '
Dr Caroline Smith , Natural History Museum Dr Caroline Smith , curator of meteorites at the Natural History Museum , London , UK , said the sample was important because of the role that the study of meteorites played in our understanding of Solar System and planetary formation .
MM40 was a basaltic achondritic micrometeorite , said Dr Smith .
Achondritic meteorites were formed when the Solar System 's planets were coming into being .
The substances in such meteorites and the processes they have undergone can give clues about how the larger bodies were formed .
By contrast , chondritic meteorites were formed during the the Solar System 's early days before material had accreted into planets .
They have not been altered by the melting and re-crystalisation that has utterly transformed the nature of , say , Earth rocks .
Dr Mahesh Anand , an astrochemist from the department of Earth & Environmental Sciences at the Open University , said : " It is fascinating as to how much information can be retrieved about the processes involved in planetary formation from tiny fragments of extra-terrestrial material that routinely arrive on Earth anonymously . "
For Dr Smith , the excitement of MM40 lay in the mystery of its origins .
" We have basaltic meteorites that are thought to come from an asteroid called 4 Vesta and we also have basaltic meteorites from the Moon and Mars , " said Dr Smith .
" But [ MM40 's ] chemistry does not match any of those places , " she said .
" It has to be from somewhere else . "
While its ultimate origins are a mystery it does have implications for the ways that astrochemists thought planets could be formed .
The analysis of MM40 showed that the " inventory " of such processes must be expanded , said Dr Smith .
" Micrometeorites are often seen as the ' poor man 's space probe ' , " said Dr Smith " They land on Earth fortuitously and we do not have to spend millions of dollars or euros on a robotic mission to get them . "

Founded in 1998 , the National Youth Rights Association ( " NYRA " ) is America 's largest youth rights organization .
NYRA is truly youth - led , with most of its 9,000 + members , its president and a majority of its board of directors being high school or college students .
Here is some of what 's on NYRA 's very large plate :
Voting Rights
Millions of high school students , work , pay taxes and want the right to vote .
So why should we lower the voting age to 16 ?
Teens will be most effected by issues like education and environment , but have no voice that counts .
16 is a BETTER age to start voting than 18 .
16 year olds are more tied to their communities ( living at home with their parents ) .
Many 18 year olds are moving to brand new communities to which they have no ties and feel less of a vested interest .
Teens who start voting early are more likely to vote for life .
The movement to lower the voting age is growing worldwide .
Austria has already lowered its voting age to 16 .
England and Scotland are seriously considering it .
In the U.S. , supporters of a lower voting age include Michael Moore , Dennis Kucinich , and John B. Anderson ( 1980 Independent Presidential candidate ) .
NYRA 's teen members are doing more than just talk about lowering the voting age .
Last year , NYRA 's Southeast Florida chapter produced the following commercial , which aired on Washington DC area cable .
.
For more on the voting age issues and arguments , visit NYRA 's Voting Age Page .
Drinking Age
Old enough to fight , but not to drink ?
NYRA strives to lower the drinking age to 18 .
NYRA works with organizations such as Choose Responsibility to support a sane and sensible alternative
to the present 21 - year old requirement , which ( 1 ) does not reduce driving deaths and ( 2 ) puts the U.S. at odds with almost the entire world ( only Indonesia , Palau and Mongolia have a drinking age as high as 21 ) .
For more on drinking age issues , visit NYRA 's Drinking Age Page .
Curfews
Civil liberty organizations like the ACLU have long opposed curfews , arguing that they are both unconstitutional and ineffective in reducing juvenile crime .
Now , NYRA 's Southeast Florida chapter is stepping up to challenge West Palm Beach 's curfew .
NYRA has hired an attorney to file a lawsuit arguing that the city 's curfew is unconstitutional .
For more on curfew issues in general , go to NYRA 's Curfew Page .
How you can help :
Unlike many civil rights movements , the youth rights movement has few major funding sources .
It operates off of the donations of its members .
Given that most are under age 21 , it has limited resources .
NYRA is having its annual NYRAthon fundraiser .
If you would like to help out , go to NYRA 's Donation Page .

THE BIG IDEA
60 seconds to change the world
Can a simple idea help make the world a better place ?
Each week we ask a guest to outline an idea to improve all our lives .
Here , mathematician Manil Suri suggests that children should be encouraged to find answers purely using logic .
Everyone should think for themselves more , rather than relying on ideology .
Do n't ride along with the teachings of your left - or right - wing politics - or even worse , your religion I 'd say .
Instead , try to reason out the correct path from common sense and basic humanist principles .
FROM BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from The Forum Download the 60 Second Podcast Many of us actually might be already too set in our ways to make this change but we can all train children around us to behave this way .
They have a natural curiosity , which gives rise to a hundred questions for each answer , and it behoves us not to squelch this spirit .
What I mean by that is that rather than getting irritated or invoking God or tradition , we need to patiently show then how to rely on logic to arrive at the best answer .
And thus , trained to not accept notions at face value but to rely on their own reasoning power - they might one day grow up and challenge us to do the same .
Manil Suri is Professor of Mathematics at the University of Maryland Baltimore County and a novelist .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I think that Philosophy as a whole should be the central core of education .
Perhaps if we had a population more formally educated in thinking , ethics and learning , then we might avoid some of the unreasoned beliefs , urban myths and non-thinking behaviour evident in today 's society .
Steve Cowie , Llandudno Common sense and basic humanist principles ' are not necessarily ' common ' to everyone , nor are they a ' basic ' framework we can assume exists naturally in everyone 's mind .
This sort of abstract universalised idea of what is involved in reasoning conceals ideologies behind a veneer of being common to all .
We may end up leading children to believe that they are thinking for themselves when they have only internalised the ideologies we have fed them .

As a mother , my best day was when my daughter learned the word ' Why ? ' .
Many mothers groan but I delighted in it and always answer her questions .
As a teacher , I see my role being to replace an empty mind with an open and enquiring one
Megan , Cheshire UK
Simple and spot on , imagine if more people had this clarity of thought .=
Anthony , London
Not all things can be arrived at by logic alone , unless that is you are a machine !
S Warman , Crewe Logic alone will not always get you the correct answer .
We need also to take into account empirical facts .
But there are not always enough hard facts to decide the matter .
Ian , Nottingham
This is one of the most profound yet simplest ideas , we should all think for ourselves .
Nick , Brynteg , Angelsey
When children realize that any position can be credibly argued for , they will become cynical and disenchanted with truth .
The young need passionate role models , not an introduction to lawyering .
Patrick , Chicago , USA
Nice little ad for humanism .
It all sounds very nice , but please define " common sense " for us .
And yes , list a few " basic humanist principles " , I 'll start with a few , self - preservation , dog - eat - dog and survival of the fittest .
Phil J Walton , Panchkula , India Everyone should question what is taught , especially religion and politics .
Blind belief is the supreme ignorance that leads to confrontation and intolerance , while questioning leads to understanding , improvement and tolerance .
Good on you .
Manil .
Albert E. James , Vancouver , Canada Logic is always a good idea but I think it also needs to be backed up by long - term thinking , not short - term thinking .
What 's logical in the short term can be disastrous in the long term .
It needs to go hand in hand with responsibility on a bigger scale .
Mick , Groningen , Netherlands
What a terrible idea to only use logic .
Obviously , this comes from someone comfortable only using half his mind .

Phoenix 's domestic - partner registry opens on Monday for couples wishing to make their relationships at least somewhat official .
The registry opens at 9 a.m. Monday at Phoenix City Hall .
Registration will take place in Assembly Room B throughout the week before moving to the city clerk 's office on the 15th floor .
The registry grants the right to visitation with a domestic partner in any health - care facility in Phoenix .
The registration also could be used to demonstrate a domestic partnership to employers or others that offer benefits to employees .
Registry supporters argued that it was necessary because domestic partners have been prevented from dealing with loved ones ' medical emergencies by patients ' families .
" This policy really will strengthen all families , including gay and lesbian families , " Sam Holdren , spokesman for the gay - rights group Equality Arizona , told the city council at the time of the vote .
Barbara McCullough - Jones , executive director of Equality Arizona , said she does not know what to expect with the registry .
" Some want to wait , and others are very excited and eager to get registered , " she said .
Couples will be charged $ 50 to register .
Both parties must appear together to register and must provide a valid photo ID issued by a government agency within the U.S. that includes name , date of birth , weight , height and hair and eye color .
Both same - sex and opposite - sex couples may apply .
Both partners must share a residence in Phoenix , be in a committed relationship and share responsibility for each other 's common welfare .
Neither person may be married to a third person or be part of another domestic partnership or civil union .
Each person must be 18 or older , and may not be blood relatives .
McCullough - Jones said she has heard that as many or more opposite - sex couples will register than gay couples .
But if you ’re having trouble paying your medical bills , you ’re not helpless , either .
There are ways to reduce , or at least more effectively manage , medical debt .
CONFRONT , DON ’T IGNORE Procrastinating only leads to trouble .
If your bills are turned over to a collection agency , the debt goes on your credit report and will remain there for lenders , and even potential employers , to see .
You may have difficulty getting a loan and , if you do get one , you ’ll be charged higher rates .
So take action  even if that does n’t mean writing any checks right away .
Proceed to Step 2 :
SCRUTINIZE YOUR BILLS
Look over your outstanding bills and make sure the listed services actually square with the care you received .
Errors are common .
If terms or procedures confuse you , call the hospital ’s or doctor ’s billing department and ask for an explanation .
If your insurer denied one or more of your claims , resubmit the bills , advises Mark Rukavina , executive director of the Access Project ( www.accessproject.org), a nonprofit group in Boston that helps consumers cope with medical debt .
“ If that does n’t work , file a formal grievance or appeal with the insurer , ” Mr. Rukavina said .
“ Even it that fails , most states allow insured patients the right to an external review by a certified third party , often a state agency .
And patients should exercise this right . ”
HIRE AN EXPERT
Try first to negotiate with your providers for a discount or an extended payment plan .
Explain that you simply can’t pay your bills in full right now , and you need some leeway .
If this tactic does n’t work , or you do n’t have the time or energy to haggle , consider hiring a billing specialist  a professional trained to spot errors who speaks the language that medical providers understand and respond to .

There is only one earth , yet every incarnation of it as a globe is different .
Their surfaces may be smooth and shiny , or rough and textured .
They can be made of almost any material , and are commonly seen as works of glass , leather , paper or stone .
Globes can be small keychains or large monuments , but all are fascinating .
They remind us of the magnitude of the planet we call home and the importance of protecting it .
As we celebrate Earth Day 2009 , the focus is on renewable energy sources , commitment to responsible consumption and the creation of green jobs .
Public Displays and Monuments
Every day we are surrounded my reminders of the peril of the planet .
Globes used as public displays and monuments visually draw our attention and stir a sense of community within us .
One primary message of Earth Day is that we are all in this together and we all need to become active members of the green generation to protect our planet .
Global Warming Activism
Artist activists often use models of the Earth as vehicles to spread their message .
The Cool Globes project in San Francisco put up a display of works at Crissy Field that do just that .
Intriguing artwork conveys the urgency to take action against global warming .
The collection was unveiled to the public in hopes of inspiring visitors and community leaders to seek real solutions .
Unique Mediums
Globes can be constructed of nearly any medium the artist chooses .
Some of the most visually striking models of Earth utilize unexpected elements .
Metals , semi-precious stones , marble and rock were used to create these incredible globe displays .
When Earth ’s own elements are put together to create a model of the planet , the effect can be magical .
Lit From Within
Globes that have a degree of opacity and are lit from the inside can be truly breathtaking .
Seeing the Earth sparkle and glow can be a special treat for children , and help foster an interest in the planet , conservation and geography .
Of course , these lit up globes are also a delight for adults who can appreciate their beauty .
Relief and Topographic Globes
Some globes not only show geographic locations , but through relief and topography , indicate the lay of the land as well .
Highlights and shading make relief globes seem 3 - D on the surface , while added features of topographic globes make ridges and valleys you can feel .
The use of these elements in design enhance globes and make it practically impossible not to touch them .
Taking It Personally
Whether it ’s a keychain or a part of your home decor , globes are readily available to anyone who wishes to own one .
Having the world in your hands , quite literally , can be fun ; however the greater message of Earth Day is that the planet is truly in our hands .
It is how we choose to manage environmental issues that will make the difference to our future and our children ’s future on this planet .

Music is an art , entertainment , pleasure , and ... medicine for the body and soul .
Playing music is one of the few activities that involve using the whole brain .
Music is intrinsic to all cultures and has surprising benefits not only for learning language , improving memory and focusing attention , but also for physical coordination and development .
Not all types of music have favourable effects , however .
Too loud or too jarring music can be distracting , and can compete for our attention with what we 're trying to do .
But for the most part , exposure to music , specifically classics , has beneficial effects :
1 Music heals
Pain relief
Overall , music does have positive effects on pain management .
It can help reduce the sensation as well as distress of both chronic pain and postoperative pain .
It may be difficult to beleive , but music can help to reduce pain , chronic actually , resulting from several conditions , like osteoarthritis , disc problems or rheumatoid arthritis , by up to 21%29 .
Music therapy is increasingly used in hospitals to reduce the need for medication during childbirth , or to decrease postoperative pain and complement the use of anesthesia during surgery30 .
There are several theories about how music positively affects perceived pain :
1. Music produces revulsive effect
2. Music may give the patient a sense of control
3 . It causes the body to release endorphins to counteract pain
4 . Slow music relaxes by slowing breathing and heartbeat

Reducing blood pressure
By listening to the recordings of relaxing music every morning and evening , people with high blood pressure can train themselves to lower their blood pressure - and keep it low31 .
This claim is supported by American Society of Hypertension .
They reported that listening daily to just 30 minutes of some music genres like classical , Celtic or raga music may noticeably lower high blood pressure .
Medicine for the heart
Music is good for your heart also .
In this case , benefits comenot from music style , but it 's tempo .
Italian and British researchers 32 recruited young men and women , half of whom were trained musicians .
The participants listened to six styles of music in headphones , including rap and classical pieces , with random two - minute pauses .
As the participants listened to the music , the researchers monitored their breathing , heart rates and blood pressure .
Heart and breathing rates were faster when they listened to lively music .
And when the musical slowed , so did their heart and breathing rates .
Some results were surprising .
During the musical pauses , heart and breathing rates normalized or reached more optimal levels .
Whether or not a person liked the style of music did not matter .
The tempo , or pace , of the music had the greatest effect on relaxation .
Promotes Post - Stroke Recovery
A daily portion` of one 's favorite pop melodies , classical music or jazz , can speed recovery from debilitating strokes , according to the latest research .
When stroke patients in Finland listened to music for a couple of hours each day , verbal memory and attention span improved significantly compared to patients who received no musical stimulation , or who listened only to stories read out loud , the study reports33 .
Besides that , patients with unilateral neglect after stroke may improve their visual attention by listening to classical music43 .
Another benefit for stroke patients coming from listening to music is that it also promotes fine - grained neuroanatomical changes in the recovering brain40 .
Chronic headaches & migraine remedy
Music can help people who suffer from migraines34 and chronic headaches35 to reduce the intensity , frequency , and duration of the headaches .
Music boosts immunity
Music can boost the immune function .
Scientists explain that a particular type of music can create a positive and profound emotional experience , which leads to secretion of immune - boosting hormones 22 .
This helps contribute to a reduction in the factors responsible for illness .
Listening to music or singing can also decrease levels of stress - related hormone cortisol .
And this is significant , because higher levels of cortisol can lead to a decreased immune response23 - 24 .
Mozart 's anti-seizure effect
The latest 2014 study revealed that listening to Mozart K 448 ( Sonata for Two Pianos in D major ) helps children suffering from epilepsy 36 .
The antiepileptic effect of Mozart 's sonata has been earlier demonstrated by Taiwanese scientists37 .
Postpartum well - being
Listening to music during such an important event as a childbirth may also have its benefits .
Not only it may increase the satisfaction with childbirth , but it also decreases post-natal anxiety and pain and reduces chances of experiencing postpartum depression38 .
Tinnitus
Music therapy in an early stage of tinnitus can prevent development of a chronic form of tinnitus39 .
2 Effects of music on the brain
Music activates many regions of the brain , including auditory , motor and limbic ( associated with emotions ) 46 .
Such widespread activation of brain explains many beneficial emotional and cognitive music effects .
Music enhances intelligence , learning , and IQ
The idea that music makes you smarter received considerable attention from scientists and the media .
Listening to music or playing an instrument can actually make you learn better .
And research confirms this .
Music has the power to enhance some kinds of higher brain function :
Reading and literacy skills 11 - 13
Spatial - temporal reasoning 14 - 15
Mathematical abilities 16 - 17
Emotional intelligence
Recall of autobiographical and episodic information 44 - 45
The famous " Mozart effect "
Earlier it has been thought that listening to classical music , particularly Mozart , enhances performance on cognitive tests .
However , there are findings18 that show that listening to any personally enjoyable music has positive effects on cognition .
Music improves memory performance
The power of music to affect memory is quite intriguing .
Baroque and Mozart 's music , with a 60 beats per minute beat pattern , activates the left and right parts of the brain .
The simultaneous left and right brain action maximizes learning and retention of information .
The information being studied activates the left brain while the music activates the right brain .
Also , activities which engage both sides of the brain at the same time , such as playing an instrument or singing , cause the brain to be more capable of processing information .
Listening to music facilitates the recall of information19 .
Researchers have shown that certain types of music are a great " keys " for recalling memories .
Information learned while listening to a particular song can often be recalled simply by " playing " the songs mentally .
Musical training has even better effect than just listening to classical music .
There is clear evidence20 , that children who take music lessons develop a better memory compared with children who have no musical training .
Note :
For learning and memory performance improvement , it 's important listen to music without a vocal component .
Otherwise you 're more likely to remember the words of the background song than what you 're supposed to be recalling .
Music improves concentration and attention
Music that is easy to listen to or relaxing classics improves the duration and intensity of concentration in all age groups and ability levels .
It 's not clear what type of music is better , or what kind of musical structure produces the best results , but many studies have shown significant effects21 .
3 Music improves physical performance
Athletic performance
Choosing music that motivates you will make it easier to start moving , walking , dancing , or any other type of exercise that you enjoy .
Music can make exercise feel more like recreation and less like work .
Furthermore , music enhances athletic performance6 - 8 !
Anyone who has ever gone on a long run with their iPod or taken a particularly energetic spinning class knows that music can make the time pass more quickly .
The four central hypotheses explaining the mechanism how music facilitats exercise performance :
Reduction in the feeling of fatigue
Increase in levels of psychological arousal
Physiological relaxation response
Improvement in motor coordination
Body movement and coordination
Musical rhythm has the remarkable ability to move our bodies .
Music reduces muscle tension and improves body movement and coordination 25 - 26 .
Music may help in developing , maintaining and restoring physical functioning in the rehabilitation of persons with movement disorders .
4 Music helps to work more productively
Fatigue fighter
Listening to upbeat music can be a great way to find some extra energy .
Music can effectively eliminate exercise - induced fatigue9 and tiredness caused by monotonous work10 .
Keep in mind that listening to too much pop and hard rock music can make you more jittery than energized .
Vary what you listen to and find out what type of music is the most beneficial for you .
You could try classical music one day , pop the next day and then some jazz .
Music improves productivity
Many people like to listen to music while they work and I am certainly one of them .
How about you ?
Did you know you can perform better at your work with music ?
Whilst there may be many reasons for wishing to listen to music in the workplace , it really improves your productivity 27 !
According to a report in the journal Neuroscience of Behavior and Physiology28 , a person 's ability to recognize visual images , including letters and numbers , is faster when either rock or classical music is playing in the background .
5 Music calms , relaxes and helps to sleep
Relaxing music induces sleep
Relaxing classical music is safe , cheap and easy way to beat insomnia1 .
Many people who suffer from insomnia find that Bach music helps them .
Researchers have shown that just 45 minutes of relaxing music before bedtime can promote a restful night2 .
Relaxing music reduces sympathetic nervous system activity , decreases anxiety , lowers blood pressure , slows down heart and respiratory rate , relaxers muscles , and helps to distract from thoughts .
Music reduces stress and aids relaxation
Listening to slow , quiet classical music , is proven to reduce stress3 .
Numerous studies and experiments have shown that anyone can experience relaxing effects of music , including newborns .
One of the unique benefits of music as a stress reliever is that it can be used while you do your normal daily activities , so that it really does n't take extra time .
How does the music reduce stress ?
Physical relaxation .
Music can promote relaxation of tense muscles , enabling you to easily release some of the tension you carry from a stressful day .
Music can promote relaxation of tense muscles , enabling you to easily release some of the tension you carry from a stressful day .
Aids in stress relief activities .
Music can help you get " into the zone " when practicing yoga , self hypnosis or guided imagery , can help you feel energized when exercising and recover after exercising , help dissolve the stress when you 're soaking in the tub .

Reduces negative emotions .
Music , especially upbeat tunes , takes your mind off what stresses you , and promotes optimistic and positive feelings .
And this helps release stress and can even help you keep from getting as stressed over life 's little frustrations in the future .
In fact 4
6 Music improves mood and decreases depression
Prescription for the blues
Music 's ability to " heal the soul " is well known and respected in every culture .
Many people find that music lifts their spirits .
Modern research tends to confirm music 's psychotherapeutic benefits5 .
Bright , cheerful music ( e.g. Mozart , Vivaldi , bluegrass , Klezmer , Salsa , reggae ) is the most obvious prescription for the blues .
Anti-anxiety remedy
Listening to music has beneficial effects on preoperative anxiety 41 .
Also music can help overcome anxiety related to dental procedures42 .

Fighting back tears , the family of a Sunday school teacher suspected of killing an 8 - year - old Northern California girl said they were at a loss Sunday to reconcile the accusations with the person they know as a devoted mother who loves children .
“ The information that we have been given regarding the charges against Melissa Huckaby are completely out of character for her , ” the 28 - year - old woman ’s uncle , Brett Lawless , of Lakewood said outside the Orchard Estates Mobile Home Park in Tracy , Calif. , where Sandra Cantu was last seen alive March 27 .
But he said his family ’s pain could not compare with that of Sandra ’s relatives .
Later , at an emotional Easter service at nearby Clover Road Baptist Church , Huckaby ’s grandfather , Pastor Clifford Lane Lawless , and others offered prayers for Sandra ’s family .
“ Nothing can be more tragic than losing a child , ” Lawless said .

For Sandra ’s family , still trying to come to terms with their loss , the condolences from Huckaby ’s family came as a “ slap in the face , ” said the girl ’s aunt , Angie Chavez .
“ You ca n’t apologize for this because it is not going to bring Sandra back home , ” Chavez said by phone .
“ They get to see their daughter grow up .
We do n’t . ”
Huckaby , who lived with her grandparents in the same mobile home park as Sandra ’s family , was arrested Friday , hours after she drove to a police station for questioning .
Police said she acknowledged that she owned the suitcase in which Sandra ’s body was found in an irrigation pond about 2 1/2 miles from her home .
Police have not said where and how Sandra died , or offered a motive for the killing .
Huckaby is being held without bail at San Joaquin County Jail .
An arraignment hearing is scheduled Tuesday .

The picture of Huckaby that emerged from her family was that of a “ sweet ” woman , raised in the Baptist Church , who did not drink or take drugs , and had no history of mental illness .
Her father , Brian Lawless , who lives in Cypress , said Huckaby ’s life revolved around her daughter , Madison , 5 .
“ She just always had an extreme patience with her , never raised her voice , never yelled , never struck her , ” he said Sunday .
“ She was that same way with other children .
She loved , loved children . ”
However , her father acknowledged that Huckaby had struggled with depression , especially after she divorced her husband and had to raise her daughter alone .
Court records show that when Huckaby filed for divorce from her husband , John Huckaby , in Orange County in January 2005 , the couple had no children .
The identity of Madison ’s father was not immediately clear .

According to her family , Huckaby has been hospitalized several times with stomach problems and struggled to hold a job after graduating from Brea Olinda High School in 1999 .
She worked for a time at a Food 4 Less supermarket in Tracy , but later returned to Southern California .
Federal court records show that Melissa Chantel Lawless of Tracy filed for bankruptcy protection in 2003 .
Her debts totaled $ 26,300 , which included thousands of dollars in medical and credit card bills .
Public records also show that Huckaby was convicted of felony theft in Los Angeles County in November 2006 .
Last summer , the family said , she moved in with her grandparents and began teaching Sunday school to the children of their congregation .

According to both families , Huckaby ’s daughter become good friends with Sandra , and the two played together often .
Madison left on a pre-arranged vacation with family members shortly after her friend disappeared , relatives said .
About 20 worshipers attended Sunday ’s service at the small church , about 500 yards from the mobile home park .
Visitors stopped in front of the park to pay respects .
Some left stuffed Easter bunnies and chocolates .
Others visited the Fry Memorial Chapel to reflect before an altar covered with stuffed toys , balloons and condolence messages .

The velocity of money can vary , aggregate demand matters , and the multiplier is real .
Let 's get those preliminaries out of the way .
That all said , this is one of the least accurate chapters in Keynes 's General Theory .
To pull out one key quotation ( pp.116-117 , in section II ) :
It follows , therefore , that , if the consumption psychology of the community is such that they will choose to consume e.g. , nine - tenths of an increment of income , then the multiplier is 10 ; and the total employment caused by ( e.g. ) increased public works will be ten times the primary employment provided by the public works themselves …
AARRRGGHH !
Empirically a typical estimate of a multiplier might be 1.3 or 1.4 , not 10 , not even in a deep slump .
( Valerie Ramey points out that the key issue in estimating a multiplier is to determine when the fiscal innovation actually occurred ; this is not easy . )
One theoretical problem in generating a high multiplier is this .
Say you have a debt - financed increase in government spending .
You can get some dollars out of low - velocity pools into high - velocity pools on the first round of redistributing the spending flow .
Do not expect complete crowding out and so nominal aggregate demand can increase , thus boosting output and employment .
But the second and third round effects of the redistributed money are usually a wash and the boost to velocity dwindles .
Why should it stay in a high - velocity sector of the economy ?
It is common in the GT that Keynes confuses marginal and average effects and , for all of his explicit talk about average and marginal in this chapter , he is making one version of that error again .
Rothbard and Hazlitt are not in general reliable critics of Keynes , but
they do have a good reductio ( see chapter XI ) on crude interpretations of the multiplier and that is what Keynes is serving up here .
You can't just take a partial derivative of an accounting identity and call the result a causal relationship .
In addition to velocity / spending effects , there are also multiplier effects through real production .
The most insightful analysis of supply - side multipliers comes from the work of W.H. Hutt .
The multiplier is a legitimate concept but often it is overestimated in its import .
This chapter in Keynes is a step backwards from Richard Kahn , the father of the multiplier concept .
Here is one critique of Keynes on the multiplier .
Do n't forget

In a continuing series on immigration , Room for Debate this week examines the issue of skilled foreign - born workers , many of whom are here on temporary guest worker visas .
An article that will appear over the weekend will explore this topic .
For the high - tech industries , particularly , foreign - born workers on temporary H - 1B visas are an important labor pool .
Many of these workers arrived in the United States as students and stay on through the H - 1B program .
Many also go on to become permanent residents and founders of startup firms .
But there is longstanding criticism among some labor groups that workers on such visas suppress engineering salaries and actually make it easier for employers to move more jobs to low - cost countries like India .
We ’ve asked several experts how immigration policy affects high - skilled workers and the industries that rely on them .
Please join the discussion in the comments section here .
Our Real Problem
Is the Brain Drain
Vivek Wadhwa is an executive in residence for the Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University and a senior research associate in the labor and work - life program at Harvard Law School .
The debates about H - 1B visas and legislation restricting firms getting federal bailouts from hiring foreign students are badly out of touch with the new global reality .
The U.S. is no longer the only land of opportunity .
Highly skilled foreign - born workers are leaving the country in droves .
Research at Duke , Berkeley , New York University and Harvard has shown that skilled immigrants have fueled our tech boom .
Over half of Silicon Valley tech start - ups and a quarter of those nationwide were founded by immigrants from 1995 - 2005 .
In 2005 alone , these companies generated $ 52 billion in revenue and employed 450,000 workers — a number greater than the number of H - 1B workers in the tech industries over the prior 10 years combined .
Foreign nationals in the U.S. contributed to 25.6 percent of our global patents in 2006 .
But because of shortsighted immigration policies , we increased the numbers of temporary H - 1B visas over the years , but not permanent resident visas .
So we have about 500,000 engineers , scientists , doctors and other professionals working for American companies who are stuck in “ immigration limbo . ”
With thousands of workers returning to India and China , the next Google or Cisco may be founded overseas .
While they wait to become permanent residents , they ca n’t change jobs without losing their position in line or even accept a promotion .
Their visas do n’t allow their spouses to work or obtain Social - Security numbers which are needed for things like driver ’s licenses .
So they live like second - class citizens .
Add to this the isolation and loneliness which most immigrants feel when they come to a new land and the burgeoning economies of India and China , and you have the perfect storm for diminishing U.S. competitiveness .
Thousands are returning home every month .
Our survey of 1,203 returnees to India and China revealed that they were doing better back home .
Returnees moved up the organization chart and found better professional opportunities .
They enjoy being close to parents and friends .
They are making less money but enjoy a better quality of life .
The majority want to start a company and think that their home countries are more fertile .
We also surveyed 1,224 foreign students in the U.S. and learned that they were thinking much like the returnees .
Only 6 percent of Indian , 10 percent of Chinese , and 15 percent of European students want to stay permanently .
( In the past , most Indian and Chinese Ph.D.s in science and engineering ended up making the U.S. their home . )
This is even most troubling when you consider that 47 percent of all U.S. science and engineering workers with doctorates are immigrants as were 67 percent of the additions to the U.S. science and engineering work force between 1995 to 2006 .
And roughly 60 percent of engineering Ph.D. students and 40 percent of master ’s students are foreign nationals .
This is great for India and China .
China will be able to develop innovative and competitive products .
India will be able to offer better and cheaper outsourcing services .
Both countries will see thousands of new companies being started — one or two of which may be the next Google or Cisco .
By encouraging this exodus , we wo n’t create new opportunities for Americans , but only more unemployment .
Suppressing Wages With Younger Workers
Norman Matloff is a professor of computer science at the University of California , Davis .
Numerous studies , including those conducted by the National Research Council and the General Accounting Office , show that foreign workers holding H - 1B work visas are often paid less than comparable Americans .
Underpayment of H - 1Bs is usually in full compliance with the law , with employers exploiting loopholes ; it ’s not mainly a fraud problem .
Abuse of foreign worker programs pervades the industry , including large ,
mainstream firms .
We should welcome the world ’s “ best and brightest , ” but H - 1B visa workers are n’t in that league .
This is also true with foreign students graduating from U.S. universities , who are hired as H - 1B workers .
A 1989 National Science Foundation position paper , written when Congress was debating creation of the H - 1B program , actually advocated using the program to hold down Ph.D. salaries by flooding the job market with foreign students .
The N.S.F. also forecast , correctly , that stagnant salaries would push domestic students away from Ph.D. study .
A core problem with the H - 1B program is its impact on older U.S. workers .
The median age of H - 1B workers is 27 , and since younger workers are cheaper , employers use H - 1B to avoid hiring older ( i.e. over age 35 ) U.S. citizens and permanent residents .
Human resources departments routinely exclude the applications of older workers on the grounds that the applicants have experience beyond the range stated in the job ad .
Proposals to grant green cards in lieu of H - 1B visas are thus misguided , as they would still swell the young labor pool .
The hiring managers have a “ gotcha ” for the younger applicants too , rejecting them as lacking job experience in some special ( but quickly learnable ) skill .
The industry lobbyists note that 50 percent of Silicon Valley startups have been founded by immigrants .
But since immigrants make up half of Silicon Valley engineers , the lobbyists ’ figure merely shows that entrepreneurship rates of immigrants and natives are the same .
There is no evidence that the displacement of American workers has produced a net increase in startups .
The world ’s “ best and brightest ” should be welcomed , but most H - 1B workers are not in that league .
Meanwhile , many of our own best and brightest are squeezed out of the market once they become “ expensive . ”
The industry ’s
claim that American kids do n’t study enough math and science is a red herring , and is rank hypocrisy , with the layoffs of thousands of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who were math and science whizzes as kids .
A Work Force in Motion
Guillermina Jasso is professor of sociology at New York University , research fellow at IZA Bonn and a principal investigator on the New Immigrant Survey .
What we know about foreign workers who become legal permanent residents is that their status is quite fluid — shifting from temporary workers to permanent residency , and some times back to temporary status .
There is also fluidity in the way such workers may move from illegal to legal immigration status .
For highly - skilled workers , there are three categories of employment - based permanent residency visas : EB - 1 for those of extraordinary ability , outstanding researchers and multinational executives ; EB - 2 for those with advanced degrees or exceptional ability ; and EB - 3 for those with skills or college degrees .
Half of all new green card holders arrived on temporary visas , while those with permanent visas regularly leave .
The match between visa and person is neither perfect nor forever .
Over half of all new legal permanent residents each year are already living in the United States on temporary visas , and those with permanent visas regularly leave the United States .
Data from the New Immigrant Survey , the first longitudinal study of a cohort of new legal immigrants , indicate that soon after admission to the U.S. on permanent visas , only about 78 percent of the 2003 cohort intended to stay .
Intention to stay is even lower among the very highly - skilled immigrants : 59 percent in EB - 1 , 52 percent in EB - 2 , and 71 percent in EB - 3 categories .
The low intention to stay may be due in part to the ban on employment for the spouses of many temporary workers , including those with H - 1B visas .
Such workers may seek legal permanent residence to obtain work authorization for their spouses .
Of course , highly - skilled workers also receive green cards in other ways .
Among new legal permanent residents who had ever had student visas , 59 percent obtained their permanent visas as the spouse of a U.S. citizen .
Very high educational levels do not mean that high - skilled visa holders are immune from lapsing into illegality .
Increasingly , for more and more immigrants , a spell of illegality is a stop along the road to legal status .
Estimates indicate that although prior illegal status among highly - skilled visa holders is less than among all green card holders , it is not trivial — the data suggest 5 percent for the EB - 1 holders , 7 percent for EB - 2 , and 24 percent for EB - 3 , versus 36 percent for the entire 2003 group .
The widespread notion that legals and illegals are two distinct populations is one of the two major misconceptions that has stymied efforts at immigration reform .
The other is that legalization of illegals is an idea alien to American immigration law — in fact , it has been an integral part of the law since 1929 , a few years after the start of immigration restriction .
Training Your Own Replacement
Ron Hira is assistant professor of public policy at Rochester Institute of Technology and co-author of “ Outsourcing America . ”
The U.S. has benefited economically , culturally and scientifically from high skill immigration .
Look at any university faculty or research laboratory and the fruits are obvious .
But the public debate over high - skill immigration has been plagued by widely held myths .
The H - 1B visa program — guest worker permits held by an employer — is thoroughly corrupted and needs to be cleaned up immediately .
Loopholes enable employers to hire H - 1B workers at below - market wages , and bypass American workers , never even entertaining their applications for a position .
In fact , some firms replace American workers and their contractors with guest workers on H - 1B and other visas , at times even having their American workers train their foreign replacements .
This is not a hypothetical problem : According to news reports , companies like I.B.M. , Nielsen and Pfizer have engaged in such practices .
The corrupted H - 1B program allows companies to train H - 1B workers here , and then rotate them and their jobs offshore .
The H - 1B application process effectively does nothing to protect U.S. or foreign workers and their working conditions .
And there is virtually no oversight of the weak regulations in place .
A recent audit of the program by Department of Homeland Security found that more than one in five H - 1Bs were granted under false pretenses , either outright fraud or serious technical violations .
To qualify for an H - 1B one only needs to hold a bachelor ’s degree , something that one in four Americans in the work force have .
Worse , contrary to conventional wisdom , the program actually speeds up the offshoring of American jobs .
This is so obvious that India ’s commerce minister , Kamal Nath , has called the H - 1B the “ outsourcing visa . ”
In 2008 , Infosys , Wipro , Satyam and Tata Consultancy , all offshore outsourcing firms , were the top H - 1B recipients .
They use the H - 1B and L - 1 visa programs to facilitate the offshoring of American jobs to low - cost countries like India .
Companies achieve this by bringing foreign workers to the U.S. for training and then rotating them back to their home country , with improved skills .
Employers can sponsor an H - 1B worker for permanent immigration , but many never do so .
For workers lucky enough to be sponsored , the wait for a green card can be as long as 10 years because the numbers of temporary work permits like the H - 1B and L - 1 being issued annually is far higher than for green cards .
While waiting for a green card H - 1B workers are put in a horrible position .
They effectively can’t change jobs or even take a promotion without going to the back of the green card line .
This kills any bargaining power they might have with employers , depressing everyone ’s wages and working conditions .
In addition to reforming the H - 1B and L - 1 visas , we ought to clear out the backlog of those waiting for green cards and devise a more rational approach to high - skill immigration that is fair to American and foreign workers .
Both the American worker and the guest worker are harmed by the current immigration system .
Who benefits from this mess ?
The corporations that can take advantage of exploitable workers .
Why Reject Entrepreneurial Spirit ?
Mark Heesen is president of the National Venture Capital Association .
Foreign - born entrepreneurs have consistently contributed to our economy , to innovation and to new job creation .
But current immigration policies are jeopardizing our ability to attract and retain these talented and highly driven individuals .
According to “ American Made : The Impact of Immigrant Entrepreneurs and Professionals on U.S. Competitiveness , ” 25 percent of the venture - backed public companies that were established in the last 15 years were started by one or more immigrant founders , reaching 40 percent in the high - tech sector .
Foreign - born workers willing to leave their home countries tend to be risk takers and have the drive to start a business .
The aggregate market capitalization of these companies , which includes Intel , Google , Yahoo ! , Sun Microsystems and eBay , exceeds $ 500 billion .
The “ American Made ” study found that of private , venture - backed start - up companies in the U.S. , some 47 percent have immigrant founders .
Just 10 years ago , such companies would not have been able to grow outside the U.S. , but that is no longer the case .
Foreign - born entrepreneurs have been particularly successful in the start - up community for a number of reasons .
First , these individuals , by their immigrant status alone , tend to be risk takers .
Leaving their home countries suggests a level of tenacity and drive that is conducive to starting a business .
Many have scientific backgrounds , and the focus and ability to invent breakthrough products and services .
We want them here as students , workers and company builders .
While immigration policies have encouraged foreign - born nationals to get a higher education here , they have discouraged highly - skilled immigrants from staying here once they have their degrees .
There are serious issues with the current H - 1B visa program , but the limited number ( 65,000 a year ) has prevented start - up companies from getting the talent they need to grow .
At the same time , countries like China and India are aggressively nurturing their technology start - up ecosystems because they understand how America has grown its economy and want to do the same for themselves .
If the best talent ca n’t come here and stay , they will surely take their skills , ideas and companies elsewhere .
The game is ours to lose .
To maintain our competitive edge , we have to remain a magnet for global talent .
Shutting our borders to these entrepreneurs is counterproductive .
The more of them we can attract , the more jobs for everyone .
Low Salaries , Low Skills
John Miano is a lawyer and computer programmer .
The United States has a very generous immigration policy for skilled workers .
America ’s doors are wide open to the best minds in the world — both for permanent residency and for guest workers .
For high - skilled workers with distinguished ability , the U.S. has “ O ” temporary guest worker visas , for which there is no numerical limit .
The debate in this area has been driven by a dumbing down of what “ highly skilled ” means .
The situation is the same for people seeking green cards .
According to the latest visa bulletin from the State Department , there is currently no backlog for employment - based green cards for the highest - skilled workers .
We already give people with the best skills a clear path for immigration .
For those with professional skills ( ranked below the highest - skilled workers ) there is only a green card backlog for those from India and China .
One has to go down to the last immigration preference before finding green card backlogs .
The fact is , our immigration policy is very welcoming to highly skilled workers , and has been for decades .
But this aspect of the immigration system tends to get little attention .
Instead , much of the debate in this area has been driven by a dumbing down of what “ highly skilled ” means .
When the annual quotas on H - 1B visas are exhausted , one often hears lobbyists arguing that the world ’s best and brightest are being shut out .
But for the most part the people who seek H - 1B visas — and may be barred by the quotas — are not extremely highly skilled workers .
A college degree from a correspondence school can qualify someone for an H - 1B visa .
Employers making skill - based prevailing wage claims for H - 1B computer workers classify most as being at the lowest skill level .
The reported wages for the majority of H - 1B computer workers is in the bottom 25th percentile of U.S. wages .
In short , H - 1B is a cheap labor program being marketed as a program for the highly - skilled .
Mr Wilders has threatened to defy the ban on him A Dutch MP who called the Koran a " fascist book " says he still plans to travel to the UK despite being banned on public security grounds .
Freedom Party MP
Geert Wilders was invited to show his controversial film - which links the Islamic holy book to terrorism - in the UK's House of Lords .
But Mr Wilders , who faces trial in his own country for inciting hatred , has been denied entry by the Home Office .
He plans to fly into Heathrow later , saying : " Let 's see what happens . "
Mr Wilders was asked to show the film at the House of Lords by UK Independence Party peer Lord Pearson .
However , he received a letter from the British Embassy in the Netherlands telling him he would not be allowed into the UK .
Lord Pearson said he disagreed with Mr Wilders ' call to ban the Koran , but accused the Home Office of " appeasing violent Islam " .
" We 're coming to this from the angle of freedom of speech , " he said .
" This man must be allowed to say what he wants , he must answer questions and then everyone can make up their minds .
" I think this man is raising one of the most important issues of our time .
I think it should be discussed more , particularly by the vast majority of the mild Muslim community .
They should talk about what the Koran really means .

More from BBC World Service Views on the ban " These people are using verses in one of the great religious tracts in history to blow up innocent people .
That 's what we want to talk about ... whether these acts of violence can be rooted in the Koran . "
' Offensive ' Mr Wilders ' film Fitna caused outrage across the Muslim world when it was posted on the internet last year .
Its opening scenes show a copy of the Koran followed by footage of the 9/11 attacks in the US and the bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005 .
The Dutch prime minister has said the film served " no purpose other than to offend " .
The Home Office said there was a blanket ban on Mr Wilders entering the UK under EU laws enabling member states to exclude someone whose presence could threaten public security .
" The government opposes extremism in all forms , " it said in a statement , adding that it had tightened up rules on excluding those engaging in " unacceptable behaviour " in October .
" It will stop those who want to spread extremism , hatred , and violent messages in our communities from coming to our country . "

Who is barred from Britain ?
Profile : Geert Wilders
The home secretary has the power to stop people entering the UK if she believes there is a threat to national security , public order or the safety of UK citizens , but she cannot exclude people simply because of their views .
Mr Wilders described the decision as " cowardly " and said he still intends to travel to the UK on Thursday to take part in the event .
He told the BBC : " It 's incredible that an elected politician who was invited by one of your parliamentarians to a discussion with people who are against me , or in favour of me [ was banned from the UK ] . "
Mr Wilders added : " I was surprised and very saddened that the freedom of speech that was a very strong point of UK society has been harassed .
I thought Great Britain had the mother of all parliaments . "
The Dutch government is reported to be trying to overturn the ban and Lord Pearson said the screening would still go ahead on Thursday - with extra security - whether Mr Wilders was present or not .
The peer also called for a major Muslim conference to discuss the Koran and its meaning .
Earlier this year , a Dutch court ordered prosecutors to put Mr Wilders on trial for inciting hatred and discrimination by making anti-Islamic statements .
Labour peer Lord Ahmed , who expressed his concerns to the Parliamentary authorities about Mr Wilders ' visit , said he welcomed the decision to ban the MP .
" It would be unwise to have him in the UK because this man 's presence would cause hatred , " he said .
" He has a case against him in the Amsterdam court for inciting hatred . "
' Revolting ' Lord Ahmed , who said other Muslim peers shared his concerns , stressed that Mr Wilders ' views would certainly present a threat to public order .

More from BBC Radio 5 live The Muslim Council of Britain said Mr Wilders was " an open and relentless preacher of hate " .
" We have no problem with the challenge of criticisms to our faith , but the film ... is nothing less than a cheap and tacky attempt to whip up hysteria against Muslims , " it said .
And Chris Huhne , Lib Dem home affairs spokesman , said he had watched the film , which he called " revolting " , and backed the ban .
" Freedom of speech is our most precious freedom of all , because all the other freedoms depend on it , " he said .
" But there is a line to be drawn even with freedom of speech , and that is where it is likely to incite violence or hatred against someone or some group . "

There 's more bad news for people who carry excess weight around their waists :
Not only is abdominal obesity associated with diabetes , hypertension , cardiovascular disease and a host of other health problems collectively known as " metabolic syndrome , " a new study has found that a high waist circumference is strongly associated with decreased lung function — independent of smoking history , sex , body mass index ( BMI ) and other complicating factors .
The study analyzed health information on more that 120,000 people from the Paris Investigations Preventives et Cliniques Center , and assessed demographic background , smoking history , alcohol consumption , as well as lung function , including FEV1 ( forced expiratory volume in one second ) and FVC ( forced vital capacity , or the total expiratory volume ) with respect to BMI , waist circumference and other measures of metabolic health .
The results were published in the second issue for March of the American Thoracic Society 's American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine .
" After adjustment for age , sex , BMI , smoking status , alcohol consumption , leisure time physical activity and cardiovascular history , metabolic syndrome remained independently associated with lung function impairment , " wrote lead author Natalie Leone , M.D. , of French National Institute for Health and Medical Research .
" We found a positive independent relationship between lung function impairment and metabolic syndrome due mainly to abdominal obesity . "
Abdominal obesity was defined as having a waist circumference of greater than 35 inches for women and 40 inches for men .
" [ This ] study demonstrated that only mild abdominal adiposity , even with a normal body mass index ( BMI ) , in associated with lower FVC , " said Paul Enright , M.D. , of the University of Arizona , in an accompanying editorial .
While the cross-sectional study was not able to address causality or temporal associations , the authors posit several possible mechanisms by which excess abdominal fat may limit or decrease lung function .
" This association may result from the mechanical effects of truncal obesity and / or the metabolic effects of adipose tissue , " wrote Dr. Leone .
" Abdominal obesity may mechanically affect the diaphragm and chest wall compliance with decreased lung volumes . "
Moreover , adipose tissue itself is known to be involved in a complex metabolic feedback cycle — the mass of adipose tissue in one 's body directly and positively correlates with pro-inflammatory markers and negatively correlates with anti-inflammatory markers .
" [ A ] dipose tissue may act as an additional source of systemic inflammation . " wrote Dr. Leone .
The researchers also found a significant interaction between metabolic syndrome and smoking status , with estimated lung function impairment risk in current and former smokers being higher than in those who never smoked .
" Prospective studies are needed to determine the temporal relationship between lung function impairment and metabolic syndrome , including abdominal adiposity in particular .
Mechanistic studies are also required to clarify the underlying physiopathological pathways , " concluded Dr. Leone .
While more research will undoubtedly shed light on the underlying mechanisms linking abdominal fat to lowered lung function , there is an immediate clinical consideration : " I believe there is now enough evidence to recommend that waist circumference always be measured before spirometry tests .
Abdominal obesity could then be highlighted on the printed report so that the physician interpreting the report could take the effect of obesity into account , " wrote Dr. Enright .

by Redpill8 Tuesday , Mar. 24 , 2009 at 7:30 PM
Matt Taibbi has written an important article in this month 's Rolling Stone magazine .
In it he explains to the reader , in laymen 's terms , just what happened , how it happened , and who benefited from the massive taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street 's biggest firms .
But , most importantly , he hits the nail on the head by saying that the Republic is officially dead ( and we do hear the dirge ) -- there is no more pretense that we live in a democracy under the rule of law , because now the lawless ones have " officially " taken over the apparatus of the state and given us the finger in the process .
Yes , as Taibbi 's says : " We are royally fucked . "
Congress is now a collection of rubber stampers , and the people -- Wall Street slaves .
obama_kool-aid.gif , image / gif , 216x308 Taibbi writes in the " The Big Takeover " :
" The crisis was the coup de grâce : Given virtually free rein over the economy , these same insiders first wrecked the financial world , then cunningly granted themselves nearly unlimited emergency powers to clean up their own mess .
And so the gambling - addict leaders of companies like AIG end up not penniless and in jail , but with an Alien - style death grip on the Treasury and the Federal Reserve  " our partners in the government , " as Liddy put it with a shockingly casual matter - of - factness after the most recent bailout . "
The gambler - addicts have taken over and are running ( and ruining ) the country , and , we can bet that they will be jonesing for their next fix soon .
Just the other day , in an effort to stave off Wall Street 's DDTs , Geithner injected these vampires with liquidity by promising to take their toxic assets off the balance sheet with taxpayer 's blood .
But , as anyone who has ever known an addict will tell you , it will get worse , much worse as addicts are expert liars and manipulators .
They will say , and do , anything to get their next fix .
Lock your doors and hide what little , and , hopefully , what ' real ' money you have left .
Although I commend Matt for putting many of the festering pieces together to help us understand the legalized , mafioso - world of high finance and their partners in crime in congress , there are a few notable dots in this exposé that he forgot to connect -- namely , the relationships that certain Obama cabinet members have to those benefitting most from the bailout ( though Taibbi does mention some of these cancerous moles in his article ) .
For instance , one of the key benefactors of the bailout - " stimulus " bills not mentioned in the article is that perennial fixer / war criminal Henry Kissinger -- and , as a corollary , his corporate clients ( but you intuitively already knew that , did n't you ? ) .
Yes , Obama 's trusted servant , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , worked for three years with Kissinger Associates , supposedly helping Henry research a book .
And , after this literary stint with Kissinger , the ambitious Geithner went to work at the U.S. Treasury as Under Secretary for International Affairs under Robert Rubin ( a Goldman Sachs man ) and Lawrence Summers -- two key players who help usher in the deregulation of the financial industry by lobbying for the ruination of the Glass - Steagall Act .
Why is this important ?
Well , it may have to do with the fact the A.I.G. -- the company being publicly pilloried today for dolling out millions of dollars in executive bonuses -- is a strategic partner with Kissinger Associates , Inc .
In an article written by John Horne for 9/11 review.org we read :
American International Group , Inc. ( AIG ) , The Blackstone Group L. P. and Kissinger Associates Inc. announced the establishment of a new venture to provide financial advisory services to corporations seeking high - level independent strategic advice . [ ]
The venture will operate globally and will take advantage of the existing relationships between the partners :
- AIG has an ownership interest in Blackstone and is an investor in several of Blackstone 's private equity funds ;
- AIG and Blackstone have a joint venture , specializing in restructuring and M&A ( mergers and acquisitions ) advisory services in selected Asian countries ;
- Henry Kissinger chairs both AIG 's International Advisory Board and the advisory boards of several AIG - sponsored Infrastructure Funds .
Kissinger Associates , by John Horne
Is our New World Order jigsaw puzzle beginning to take shape now ?
Oh , but it gets better ...
Timmy 's father , Peter Geithner , fits in miraculously to the mix as he was is a former top official of the Ford Foundation ( a NWO front group ) who knew Obamas mother , Ann Dunham - Soetoro , when she was working on microfinance programs in Indonesia .
Indeed , the elite travel in a very small circles .
The puzzle begins to take shape further when we see how our Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , and her hubby , Bill , are " life - long friends " with Thomas F. ( Mack ) McLarty , III , who joined Kissinger Associates , Inc. to form Kissinger McLarty Associates in 1992 .
According to Wikipedia : Kissinger Associates ( McLarty left the firm in January 2008 to start his own company ) specialty is in " assisting its clientele in identifying strategic partners and investment opportunities , and advises clients on government relations throughout the world .
It was established in July , 1982 after loans had been secured from Goldman Sachs and a consortium of three other banks . "
So , the puzzle is becoming clear with anyone with eyes to see .
With a good chunk of the bailout money going to Kissinger - affiliated firms like A.I.G. , JPMorgan Chase , and Goldman Sachs ; and with the recent reshuffling of strategic partners ( bye - bye Bear Stearns and Lehman Bros , plus the many community banks that have been taken over or shut down because they bought into the toxic mortgage schemes ) ; and with the new investment opportunities that Geithner is now promising Wall Street firms , we see what the financial crisis really is -- a well - structure M&A ( merging and acquisition ) project of the United States of America , which follows perfectly Kissinger Associates , Inc. strategic goals .
The government will now be taking all its marching orders straight from the central banking - NWO elite as declared by Obama 's new National Security Adviser , Jim Jones , speaking at CFR function :
" Thank you for that wonderful tribute to Henry Kissinger yesterday .
Congratulations .
As the most recent National Security Advisor of the United States , I take my daily orders from Dr. Kissinger , filtered down through General Brent Scowcroft and Sandy Berger , who is also here .
We have a chain of command in the National Security Council that exists today . " -- " NSC advisor Jones :  I take my daily orders from Dr. Kissinger " , Infowars.com
Of course these relationships between individuals who are in key positions in the Obama administration and shady consulting firms like Kissinger Associates would have no baring on Obama 's agenda ?
Of course not .
He 's his own man , they keep telling us .
And , if you believe that , there is some Kool - Aid they would like you to drink .
Maybe today 's new Jim Jones will administer it .

[ Editor 's note : Please note the date of publication above , and take the following story in the spirit of the day . ]
In an unprecedented move Wednesday , the Norwegian Nobel Committee rescinded the Peace Prize it awarded in 2007 to former US vice president Al Gore and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , amid overwhelming evidence that global warming is an elaborate hoax cooked up by Mr. Gore .
A press release from the committee quotes a chagrined Rajendra Pachauri , the UN climate panel 's chair , who claims that he was the victim of a " cunning deception spanning decades " :
" I am deeply ashamed for having unwittingly perpetuated such a massive fraud on the governments of the world , " said Mr. Pachauri .
" It turns out that all that data from satellites and radiosondes , surface temperature readings , borehole analysis , measurements of rising sea levels , melting glaciers and permafrost , phenological data , and proxy reconstructions of paleoclimatic conditions were all fabricated out of thin air by my former friend , Al Gore .
" Now that I think about it , I suppose that we should have instituted some sort of peer - review process before publishing such alarming conclusions .
Once again , I 'm very sorry . "
After revoking the 2007 prize from Gore and the IPCC , the Nobel committee retroactively awarded it to the more than 31,000 people who signed the Oregon Petition – an appeal challenging the notion that there exists a scientific consensus regarding global warming – " for their efforts to pursue pure , objective science that is free from the influence of any special interest group . "
The prize of about $ 1.53 million will be divided equally among the petition 's signatories , whose expertise ranges from astrology to Intelligent Design .
For his part , Al Gore has owned up to duping the scientific community .
In a blog post on his website , the ex-Nobel Laureate explains the genesis of his scheme , " now that the jig is up . "
" As long as I can remember , my only goal in life has been to destroy free - market capitalism and replace it with global totalitarian socialism .
But it seemed that traditional methods , such as guerrilla warfare , were proving unsuccessful .
Then , one day in 1988 , as I was strolling through the halls of my giant mansion , it hit me : carbon dioxide .
" By striking at the molecule that lies at the heart of industrial civilization , I could bring the whole system to its knees and usher in a workers ' paradise .
" The rest just sort of fell into place .
I wrote a book , held some Congressional hearings , made a movie , dashed off a few pseudonymous journal articles on radiative forcing , and the next thing you know , I was on TV with Dave Matthews and Ludacris convincing people to purchase carbon offsets .
Carbon offsets !
I would have gotten away with it , too , if it had n't been for that darn petition . "
The New York Times quotes NASA climate scientist James Hansen , one of the most outspoken advocates of limiting greenhouse gas emissions , who says he bought Mr. Gore 's ruse " hook , line , and sinker . "
" I have to admit , Al got me good , " said Mr. Hansen as he packed up his personal belongings at his office at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York .
" Despite my decades of experience in climate modeling and satellite meteorology , I would just get mesmerized whenever he started showing me all those fancy charts and tables .
The man is a real Svengali . "
Not all scientists were fooled by Mr. Gore 's ruse , but many remained silent nonetheless .
The Associated Press quotes an anonymous marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography , who says she knew all along that " this climate change stuff was completely bogus . "
" But I played along , " she said .
" The opportunities for securing global - warming - related grant money were just too great for me to resist . "
" Sweet , sweet grant money , " she added .
Following the Nobel committee 's announcement , national scientific academies from 187 countries hastily drafted a joint statement denouncing the theory of anthropogenic global warming and expressing a renewed humility in the face of complex natural phenomena :
It is our hope that , whenever future generations find themselves swayed by the notion that one can derive generalizations about the physical world by gathering measurable data and subjecting it to logical analysis , they will recall the humbling and extraordinary events of today , April Fools Day , 2009 .
The only major scientific body not to sign the statement was the Royal Society of Canada , whose country has been brought to a standstill by a massive infestation of polar bears .
For the first time in the United States , a stroke patient has been intravenously injected with his own bone marrow stem cells as part of a research trial at The University of Texas Medical School at Houston .
Roland " Bud " Henrich , 61 , was transferred to Memorial Hermann – Texas Medical Center on March 25 after suffering a stroke while working on his farm in Liberty .
He arrived too late to receive tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , the only treatment for ischemic strokes .
He became the first patient in the trial .
The Phase I safety trial , funded with a pilot grant from The National Institutes of Health and support from the Notsew Orm Sands Foundation , will enroll nine more patients who have suffered a stroke and can be treated with the stem cell procedure within 24 to 72 hours of initial symptoms .
Stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted by a blockage or a rupture in an artery , depriving brain tissue of oxygen .
It is the third - leading cause of death behind heart disease and cancer .
According to the American Stroke Association , nearly 800,000 Americans suffer a stroke each year – one every 40 seconds .
On average , someone dies of stroke every three to four minutes .
" It 's still very early in this safety study , but this could be an exciting new therapeutic approach for people who have just suffered a stroke , " said Sean Savitz , M.D. , assistant professor of neurology at the medical school and the study 's lead investigator .
" Animal studies have shown that when you administer stem cells after stroke , the cells enhance the healing .
We know that stem cells have some kind of guidance system and migrate to the area of injury .
They 're not making new brain cells but they may be enhancing the repair processes and reducing inflammatory damage . "
Savitz said animal studies have shown that the healing effects of stem cells can occur as early as a week but cautioned it is too early to attribute Henrich 's improvement to the stem cell treatment .
" I 'm hoping he will get better and it will be because of the cells , but it 's just hope at this point , " Savitz said .
The stem cells were harvested from the bone marrow in the iliac crest of his leg , then separated and returned to Henrich several hours later .
Because they are his own stem cells , rejection is not expected to be an issue .
When he arrived at the hospital , Henrich could not speak and had significant weakness on his right side .
When he was released after nearly two weeks of hospitalization and rehabilitation , he was able to walk and climb stairs unassisted and said his first words .
His wife , Reba Henrich , said she believes the stem cells have helped .
He has spoken a few times with a single word or a phrase since his return home .
" Too crowded , " he told her at a megastore as they shopped for Easter gifts for their grandchildren and " senior " meal he told a waitress at a local restaurant .
He also has fed the cows by himself , she said .
They are hopeful he will eventually be able to return to his job as a painter .
" This study is the critical first step in translating laboratory work with stem cells into benefit for patients .
If effective , this treatment could be helpful to a huge segment of stroke patients to reduce their disability , " said James C. Grotta , M.D. , Roy M. and Phyllis Gough Huffington Distinguished Professor of Neurology and chair of the Department of Neurology at the medical school .
" We are fortunate here at UT Houston and the Texas Medical Center to have the resources needed to carry out this work , and to have attracted someone of Dr. Savitz 's caliber to lead this study . "
The study is only open to patients who are admitted to the Emergency Center at Memorial Hermann – TMC or through the UT Stroke Team with symptoms of an immediate stroke .

Grand Rounds , Department of Psychiatry , Upstate Medical University , Syracuse , New York
It was a great honor for me to be invited by Professor Chaitanya Haldipur , and former chair of the psychiatry department at Upstate Medical University Professor Mantosh Dewan , to give the first Grand Rounds lecture in honor of Tom on Thursday , February 13 , 2014 , at 12:30 pm , at Upstate Medical University in Syracuse , New York .
The title of my talk was : Games Psychiatrists Play .
Chaitanya Haldipur , long a close friend of Tom's and I am honored to say a friend of mine , took me out for a wonderful Italian dinner the night before my lecture , and Mantosh Dewan , former chair of the Dept of Psychiatry for many years , introduced me at the start of my talk .
I must say it was one of the nicest introductions I have ever received .
( It sure was a long way from how I was treated after teaching for 22 years at American University 's Department of Justice , Law and Society , in the School of Public Affairs ! )
Mantosh gave an equally beautiful appreciation of Tom at the start of our symposium in honor of Tom 's eightieth birthday in Weiskotten Hall , years ago .
When it comes to appreciation and introductions , no one speaks more eloquently and more sincerely than Mantosh .
What a wonderful person .
It was a full house on Thursday , February 13 , 2014 , when I spoke after lunch at 12:30 pm .
You are welcome to read the handout I gave to those who attended my talk , again , an invited lecture for Grand Rounds , " kicking off the year of celebrating their beloved Thomas Szasz " in a series of forthcoming Grand Rounds .
I enjoyed seeing many of the friends I made at the celebration and symposium Nelson Borelli , MD , of Northwestern University Medical School , and I put together in honor of Tom 's eightieth birthday .

Michael was a friend of Tom's , and Michael and I quickly became friends when he contacted me out of the blue and showed me the essay he had written .
I was bowled over , as was Professor Emeritus Chaitanya Haldipur when I sent it to him for review .
Michael is a terrific writer .
For a Professor of Classics at Cornell to grasp the significance and relevance of Rosenhan and Tom 's work is phenomenal .
I was then working on the last issue of Current Psychology as Editor - in - Chief the past eight years .
I imnmediately included it , after it was instantly accepted by two other colleagues of mine in the peer - reviewed process , ( I finished my eight year tenure as Editor - in - Chief of Current Psychology effective December 31 , 2013 . )

Here is an excellent essay I used in college classes for many years .
Interestingly .
those on the political left opposed to capital punishment , always asserted that capital punishment was " too easy " for the guilty defendant .
They consistently wanted defendants found guilty of murder to suffer throughout out the course of their lifetimes , via life imprisonment .
They opposed the death penalty because they though the guilty defendant was not suffering enough .
To my way of thinking , this reveals the sadistic nature of their their rationale .
Too many faculty at American University wanted sadistic murderers to suffer over the course of their lifetime , and not have their suffering ended quickly via a death penalty .
Not all libertarians agree with Szasz about the myth of mental illness . . .

Raise your hand if this BS smells like roses to you .
First civil unions .
Now gay marriage .
Progress .
Backed by 59 legislators , Vermont state Reps. Mark Larson and David Zuckerman introduced legislation today to legalize gay marriage .
The bill will likely be opposed by Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas , who previously said he would not support same - sex marrage .
“ I think the current civil union law is sufficient .
It accords equality of rights to Vermonters in terms of their relationships and I think we should leave the law as it is . ”
Vermont was the first state to legalize civil unions in 2000 .
And the world did n’t end then .
And it wo n’t end because of gay marriage either .

Facebook The Marlboro Man , that cigarette - smoking icon of the tobacco industry , is more than a half - century old .
If he were conceived today , there might not be just a cigarette dangling from his mouth .
He might also have , tucked into his pocket , a cellphone - size container holding a dozen pouches of snus .
Snus ?
It rhymes with " goose , " ( cynics might say " noose " ) , and is a Swedish type of smokeless tobacco that 's not your grandfather 's dip or chew .
Snus comes in teabag - like pouches that a user sticks between the upper lip and gum , leaves there for up to 30 minutes and discards without spitting .
As no-smoking laws sweep the nation and cigarette sales continue to fall , Big Tobacco is alarming the public health community by devising other ways to try to make tobacco appealing .
With smokeless products representing the only booming part of the U.S. tobacco market , snus is an effort to boost sales with a product that — unlike most smokeless ones — does n't require users to spit out the residue .
Snus also represents something more : an attempt to move smokeless tobacco beyond stereotypical users such as baseball players and rodeo cowboys , and into offices or restaurants where people want a nicotine fix but can't light up .
" This is a growth strategy for us , " says Bill Phelps , spokesman for Philip Morris USA , the nation 's biggest tobacco company and maker of Marlboro , the top - selling cigarette .
In Dallas this month , Philip Morris is launching its first smokeless product with a cigarette brand name : Marlboro Snus .
R.J. Reynolds , second in U.S. tobacco sales , is expanding tests of its Camel Snus from two cities to eight , which will include Dallas this month .
Its ads have a " pleasure for wherever " tagline and a playful tone .
Its " abridged guide to snusing " says , " Picture yourself stuck in the center seat 44B of an airplane :
You can mope , or you can Snus . "
Public health advocates are n't smiling .
Although some say smokeless tobacco poses fewer health risks than cigarettes , they note that it has been linked to various types of cancer and warn against using any tobacco product .
" What on the surface looks promising could turn out to be a public health disaster , " says Gregory Connolly , director of tobacco control research at Harvard School of Public Health .
He says the products are still addictive , and unless the Food and Drug Administration can regulate tobacco , consumers wo n't know what 's truly in snus .
A bill that would give the FDA such authority passed a U.S. Senate panel Wednesday and is gaining co-sponsors in the U.S. House .
Under laws in every state , snus and other tobacco products may not be sold to anyone younger than 18 .
But many health advocates see the new smokeless alternatives as an attempt to create a new generation of tobacco users .
Snus will " increase the number of people who use tobacco , " says Matthew Myers , president of the Campaign for Tobacco - Free Kids .
" It 's market protection .
This way , the big companies win no matter what tobacco products people use . "
' It 's the smoke , stupid ' Cigarette sales in the USA have fallen steadily for two decades as tobacco taxes have risen , studies have warned of health risks and laws have expanded smoke - free zones from indoor spaces to outdoor areas such as parks .
Government figures indicate 44.5 million Americans smoke , down from a peak of 53.5 million in 1983 .
The only part of the tobacco market in which sales are soaring is " moist snuff " such as Skoal and Copenhagen , which are placed between the lower lip and gum but not chewed .
Other types of smokeless tobacco , including chewing tobacco and " dry snuff , " have fallen in popularity .
Snus is most akin to moist snuff .
Sales of moist snuff in the USA more than doubled in volume from 1986 to 2005 , according to a report this year by the Federal Trade Commission .
Tobacco companies ' spending on promoting such products rose more than five - fold .
Nik Modi , a tobacco industry analyst at UBS , a financial services firm , projects that the sales volume of moist snuff will rise 6 % to 8 % a year through 2010 .
" It 's becoming more socially acceptable , " says Dan Butler , president of the U.S. Smokeless Tobacco , the nation 's biggest seller of smokeless products including Skoal and Copenhagen .
He says 6.1 million Americans used moist snuff in 2006 , up from 4.7 million in 2001 .
He says most of the new users are smokers , some of whom still light up .
The new smokeless , spit - free products are " an effort to create a different tobacco category in the United States , " says Tommy Payne , executive vice president for public affairs of Reynolds American , parent company of R.J. Reynolds .
He thinks snus will gain acceptance because it 's convenient and discreet .
Payne adds that scientific studies show that smokeless products pose fewer health risks than cigarettes , largely because the tobacco is not burned and inhaled into the lungs .
" It 's the smoke , stupid , " he says .
A debate over the risks Even so , the major tobacco companies are careful not to make any advertising claims that their smokeless products have fewer health risks .
Snus containers carry one of three required warning labels that say the product is either " not a safe alternative to cigarettes , " " may cause mouth cancer " or " may cause gum disease and tooth loss . "
The American Cancer Society , in a study of 116,000 men published in February , says male smokers who gave up cigarettes for smokeless tobacco still had higher death rates from lung cancer , heart disease and strokes than men who quit all tobacco or never smoked .
Several studies that compare smokeless tobacco to cigarettes , however , find smokeless less harmful .
A study published in May in The Lancet , a British medical journal , tracked nearly 280,000 Swedish construction workers from 1978 - 1992 and found that smokers were at least 10 times more likely to get lung cancer than snus users .
The study , done by an international team of public health researchers , and funded by the Swedish Cancer Society , said snus users were not at increased risk for oral cancer .
It found that they were twice as likely to get pancreatic cancer as those who never used tobacco but their risks were lower than those for smokers .
Smokers should be encouraged to quit tobacco entirely , but they also should be told that smokeless products have fewer risks than cigarettes , says Jonathan Foulds , director of the tobacco dependence program at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey .
Foulds says Swedes ' widespread use of snus has helped lower the adult male smoking rate there to among the lowest in Europe .
Snus , though legal in Sweden , has been banned in most of Europe as cancer - causing and a gateway to smoking for young people .
Cigarettes , however , are legal .
Snus use alone did not cause Sweden 's smoking rate to fall , says Harvard 's Connolly .
He says high cigarette prices along with bans on cigarette advertising and indoor smoking played a greater role .
" All forms of tobacco are bad , " he says , adding that the new smokeless products wo n't help American smokers kick the habit .
" It 's like setting up a methadone program next to a drug house and keeping your fingers crossed and hoping it all works out . "
Snus products have varying levels of nicotine .
Connolly says Taboka , Philip Morris ' first smokeless offering , actually creates a craving for a cigarette .
Foulds says Taboka delivers almost no nicotine .
He likens it to Ford or GM building a car with four wheels but no gas .
In Sweden , he says snus products have enough nicotine to help smokers get off cigarettes .
Philip Morris '
Phelps says a pouch of Taboka contains slightly more nicotine than a pouch of any of the four flavors of Marlboro Snus .
He says he cannot compare the nicotine of a snus packet to that of a cigarette because nicotine is measured differently in the products .
Bonnie Herzog , a tobacco industry analyst at Citigroup , says in a July survey of tobacco wholesalers and retailers that most respondents do not believe snus will prompt smokers to quit .
Instead , they say smokers will use snus in addition to cigarettes .
A marketing challenge Health concerns aside , such products could be a tough sell for tobacco companies .
" There 's such a stigma attached to smokeless products , " says Kylie Meiner , tobacco prevention coordinator for the health department in Multnomah County , which includes Portland , Ore. , a test market for Camel Snus .
She says such products generally do not appeal to well - educated people .
The challenge is getting a smoker " to create a new behavior , " says Butler of U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co .
He says its first spit - free product , Revel , was launched in two markets several years ago and " failed to achieve a breakthrough . "
Other new smokeless products also have struggled or failed .
" It has been slow going , " says Sara Troy Machir , a spokeswoman for Star Scientific , a small Virginia company that makes dissolvable tobacco lozenges known as Arriva and Stonewall .
She says awareness of the products is increasing , however .
" It 's going to take some time for these products to take off , " says Modi , the tobacco industry analyst .
For that to happen , he says , they have to work .
In other words , they have to give people a nicotine buzz .
So far , Taboka has n't been " lighting the world on fire , no pun intended , " Modi says .
A USA TODAY visit to a dozen convenience , tobacco and Wal - Mart stores in Indianapolis found Taboka widely available , often in a dispensers displayed near Marlboro cigarettes and priced at $ 1.20 to $ 3.80 per pack .
Retailers say consumers have shown little interest .
" I have n't sold any at all , " says Pat Bowman at The Tobacco Shop .
He says even people who had coupons for free samples did n't want Taboka once they knew what it was .
" I could n't give it away . "
R.J. Reynolds '
Payne says one pouch of Camel Snus offers about as much nicotine as a cigarette .
In Wake County , N.C. , where Camel Snus was launched last month , several smokers gave it a thumbs - down , says Gibbie Harris , the county 's health director .
Ten smokers in her agency tried it .
She says " the women did n't like it at all , " partly because they found it was n't entirely spit - free .
Payne says if used correctly — placed between the upper lip and gum , not the lower lip — snus should not require spitting , because there 's less saliva in the upper lip .
The marketing savvy of big tobacco companies worries public - health advocates such as Harvard 's Connolly .
" If anyone can get the taste and nicotine right , it 's Philip Morris , " he says , noting the allure of the Marlboro brand name .
Connolly says the health community should play no part in helping the industry expand tobacco sales share by acknowledging snus as a safer product .
" We should n't be out there promoting harm , " Connolly says , " even reduced harm . "

Indie films are some of my most favorite movies .
I love the fresh , unconventional , and truly “ independent ” spirit of these films and the people who make them happen .
Sometimes these films make their way to the masses – Slumdog Millionaire is a perfect example — and sometimes not so much .
Still , many are worth seeing just for the sheer ingenuity and creativeness that they embody .
Nun of
That may not be the next greatest indie film since Slumdog but its trailer has left me with a sense of curiosity about the film .
“ After being gunned down in an alley , [ Sister Kelly Wrath ] ascends to heaven to receive training from some of the great figures of religious mythology .
She is then set back to Earth to join the other members of the Order of the Black Habit , a group of supernatural vigilante nuns , as they fight evil and seek revenge against the mob . ”
Now before you start clicking around to learn more about Nun of That , I have to warn you that the film is ( minimally ) R-rated , it is of the horror genre , and it makes a point of promoting blasphemy ( the movie premieres on Good Friday this year ) .
It plays on the absolute worst stereotypes of Catholic sisters and nuns and represents them with the “ usual ” erotica mix : sex , violence , sacredness , profanity , dominance , and submission .
In no way do I recommend it as an accurate portrayal of women religious .
Absolutely not .
So why am I writing about it ?
Well , for a couple of reasons .
One is to provide a place that people searching for info on this movie might stumble upon and perhaps stick around for a bit to learn about who Catholic sisters and nuns really are .
Two , is because frankly I am fascinated and amused ( in the incredulous kind of way ) by this movie and want to try to understand why these stereotypes are so compelling to people .
Indie movies put these kind of things in bold relief for us , and so for me it ’s a kind of study to see what folks are thinking so that I can understand it and also address it .
With all that being said , I have to say I am rather fond of one line in the movie : “ We are nuns .
We do n’t know the meaning of the word fear .
We are strong , dedicated women who laugh in the face of danger . ”
In spite of the violence , blasphemy , stereotypes , and abundant cliches , there is something to be said for a film that presents nuns as “ strong , dedicated women ” who work to fight injustice .
It ’s just that we typically do n’t use hand grenades and ninja stars to accomplish our mission .
RIYADH ( Reuters ) - Saudi Arabia needs to enact a penal code to prevent abuse in its justice system , U.S. - based Human Rights Watch said in a report issued on Tuesday .
Saudi officials say a written penal code is being prepared as part of an overhaul of the judicial system ordered by King Abdullah last year , including expanding the number of courts and judges .
But the legal system , which mainly applies Islamic sharia law , does not recognize precedent .
“ Saudi Arabia should urgently enact a penal code to protect all criminal suspects against arbitrary arrest , ” the New York - based group said in a statement announcing the publication of two reports based on a year of research and field trips .
“ Criminal defendants , especially children , need greater protection against gross abuses during interrogation and unfair trials . ”
The reports say defendants often face prolonged solitary confinement , ill - treatment , forced confessions , and are denied a lawyer at crucial stages of interrogation and trial .
Judges often use evidence of reaching puberty as a standard for dealing with teenagers , and in 2007 Saudi Arabia executed three juvenile offenders , including a 15 - year - old boy who was only 13 at the time of the crime .
A spokesman for the government - run Human Rights Commission was not available for comment .
Saudi Arabia regularly executes murderers , rapists and drug traffickers , usually by public beheading but judges sometimes given the death sentence to armed robbers and people accused of vague crimes such as “ sorcery ” .
HRW , which has been given exclusive access to Saudi Arabia over the past year , said the authorities should outlaw the death penalty and all forms of corporal punishment against persons under 18 at the time of the offence .
If Electronic Arts '
Twitter feed can be believed , the publisher has stepped into the Tweeter race between actor Ashton Kutcher and CNN to be the first user to reach a million followers .

Earlier this week Kutcher challenged CNN to Twitter race in a video .
If he wins , Kutcher promises to ding - dong ditch CNN founder Ted Turner 's house .
Last night , Electronic Arts Tweated that they would put Kutcher 's millionth follower in a video game if the actor won the race .
Today the publisher updated their offer :
@aplusk 's 1,000,000th follower will get a copy of every game EA makes in '09 for their system and be featured in @ TheSims3

Sure it 's silly , but what 's wrong with that .
And as much as I want Kutcher to win , I want CNN to lose ten times more .
So DO IT !

BDSM
BDSM
total power exchange
M/s
Click
for your version of An Owned Life .
The power breakdown is what separates arelationship from a traditional one .
This is something that would be common sense to most .
However , in reading different blogs online , I find it something that is lacking .
So , I will do my best to explain it in clear terms .
A basic fundamental of BDSM is the exchange of power .
In simple terms , a sub gives his / her power over to a Dom / Domme .
Naturally , this exchange will differ based upon the parameters of the relationship .
Nevertheless , the exchange of power is complete pertaining to those areas which are in question .
For example , the typical D/s relationship will see the Dom ( Domme ) in total control during the scene .
While there might be some areas that were agreed upon to be off limits , the power totally lies in the hands of the D .
He or she is responsible for the direction of the scene .
If we go a bit further intoand explore the M/s relationship , this is where theis really evident .
Under these circumstances , a slave cedes all control over to the Master .
Again , there might be areas which are fundamentally off limits such as career or children ( if not the Masters ) .
Nevertheless , the life of the slave is in the hands of the Master .
I believe that many understand this point in concept .
Yet few seem to practice this in reality .
In my reading of words written by slave 's , I often find myself wondering whether they are the slave or the Master .
While claiming to be a slave , there seems to be a lot of " take charge " on her ( in this instance ) part .
To me , this is completely backwards .
I once read how a slave " pulled her Master up " to engage in sex .
This really struck me as off base .
A slave who is horny is only serviced if it is the will of her Master .
It is not a slave 's choice when and where sex is to occur .
Her desires are secondary to his .
That is the basis of service .
If one is constantly looking out for her wishes , then her Master 's desires are taking a back seat .
This is not M/s. Many will claim that it is up to individual 's to establish their relationships as they wish .
I totally agree .
In fact , that is something that I wrote about quite often on this blog .
One of the most attractive aspects of BDSM is the freedom to create a relationship however you see fit .
What people do is their business .
What gets my ire is when people misinform people through their writing .
If one chooses to structure a relationship in a particular way , that is their business .
Nevertheless , do not pass it off as M/s. M/s involves a total exchange of power .
When one pushes her desires on her Master through manipulation , that is something different .
Many times , this is acceptable to the Master .
Again , it works in their relationship yet is not
The main reason why I started this blog is to clear up a lot of misconceptions that are out there .
Sadly , people will rarely admit what they are .
A slave is a slave only is he or she takes that part .
Many say they are slaves when , in fact , they are subs .
They want to maintain some control over different aspects of their relationship .
Complete control is given in certain circumstances yet is taken back at others .
The bottom line is to watch the words that people use .
In true M/s , the Master is the instigator of all action .
When I see a " slave " writing about his or her desires that were thrust upon the Master , I begin to question .
To me , this lacks the completeness .
Remember , just because I say I am an astronaut does not make it reality .
The Kellogg Company said Thursday its profit rose 7 percent during its fiscal fourth quarter despite costs related to the national recall this year of many products containing peanuts .
The company said it earned $ 179 million , or 47 cents a share , during the three months that ended Jan. 3 , compared with $ 176 million , or 44 cents a share , in the last quarter of 2007 .
Its revenue increased to $ 2.93 billion , up 5 percent from $ 2.79 billion a year ago .
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters , on average , forecast earnings of 50 cents a share on revenue of $ 3.05 billion for the quarter .
Kellogg narrowed its sales guidance for this year , saying it expected growth of 3 percent to 4 percent .

It turns out , a 25 - pound cod ate his phone and was then caught by fishermen .
They found the phone , pulled out the SIM card and put it in another phone and called his girlfriend .
They got his old phone back to him , and he claims after drying it out it still worked .
That 's a dubious claim at best , but hey , if true that says a lot for Nokia phones .
I guess .

Bathing Poncho
US Patent No. 7,509,689
Issued : March 31 , 2009
I am almost speechless , which does not happen often .
I came across this patent over the weekend .
It was NFL Draft weekend , which means that I was parked in front of the TV all weekend .
Between picks , and while waiting for a pick from the Dallas Cowboys that never came on Saturday , I was flipping through some recently issued patents online .
I found some really interesting inventions , so good patents that I can use to teach with and a handful of patents that just make you want to scratch your head .
Lets just say that this particular patent fell into the last category .
The photograph initially caught my attention , and then the name “ Bathing poncho ” piqued my interest even further .
Why would anyone want to wear a poncho while bathing ?
Thankfully , the patent answered this question in the Description of the Related Art , explaining :
In institutions such as hospitals , nursing homes , college dormitories , gyms , and the like , the bathing or showering facilities often lack the privacy to which one is accustomed to at home .
Thus , becoming unclad to take a shower or a bath can be somewhat of an unpleasant and embarrassing experience .
A covering that would preserve one ’s dignity by minimzing exposure while also insuring a thorough cleansing would certainly be a welcome addition in the marketplace . ”
I personally cannot believe there is a market for this invention , but that is admittedly something that is not appropriately considered by the Patent Office .
The Patent Office is tasked with determining whether an invention is novel and nonobvious , among other things , but these are the two big inquiries .
The point I am trying to make here is that just because you can get a patent does n’t mean that anyone is going to buy the invention .
Likewise , the decision to issue a patent by the Patent Office via the Patent Examiner should not be taken as an endorsement , confirmation or ratification of the presence of a marketable invention .
Filing for and obtaining a patent is a critical first step to pursue , but if your invention is not one that people will want to pay for then having a patent is unnecessary .
If the goal is to make money and commercialize your invention you first need to have a product or service that will find acceptance in the marketplace .
Returning to the invention , if you are uncomfortable being naked in front of others while taking a shower in a public place , would n’t this invention potentially make things worse ?
I would have to believe that the use of this invention would draw far more attention to yourself than would ordinarily be the case .
I suppose if your fear is being naked then having people look at you funny might not be nearly as bad .
So what is the invention exactly ?
According to the Summary of the Invention :
The present invention is drawn to disposable garments adapted to be donned while bathing or showering and drying off .
The garments take the form of ponchos .
As contemplated , the bathing or showering poncho will have a different color than the drying poncho .
Also the bathing / showering poncho will have soap and shampoo impregnated therein .
Both ponchos will have ties on the sides thereof to secure the poncho and prevent inadvertent exposure .
You just ca n’t make this stuff up !
What is really sad is that this extremely simple invention , which has one of the shortest specifications I have ever seen , was pending at the Patent Office for 34 months .
What is even more sad is that an invention like this took up resources of the Patent Office .
But what is worst is that this invention , one we probably all look at and find unbelievable on at least some level , was issued and other applications on important technological advances cannot get issued at all .
For the life of me I do n’t understand why equal protection is n’t being argued by those who appeal to the Board .
We all know that an equal protection argument would have little or no chance of factoring into a Board decision , but somebody please make the argument exposing the unequal treatement of inventions at the USPTO and preserve it for the record .
We all know that the Patent Office position is that a mistake made in one case does n’t mean they should perpetuate the mistake the next time , but how is that fair ?
How is it fair for inventors and start - up companies to have real technologies held up and forced into the abandoned file while examiners issue patents on a bathing poncho having soap embedded into the fabric and shampoo embedded into the hoodie ?
Simply put , it is not fair and it needs to stop .
The only way we are ever going to put a stop to this is to make the arguments and force the Board , the Federal Circuit and maybe even Congress to take notice .
Are you doing things that suit your preferred thinking style ?
Thinking styles were advanced by Robert Sternberg in his book Thinking Styles .
His main thesis is that there are several thinking styles that we exhibit from childhood and that these styles give us a lot of insight into how we should educate our children and how we should determine what we do as adults .
His first three broad categories of thinking styles are legislative , executive , and judicial , but I ’ve rephrased these as dreamers , doers , and reviewers .
Here ’s a quick breakdown :
Dreamers
Dreamers “ like to come up with their own ways of doing things , and prefer to decide for themselves what they will do and how they will do it . ”
Dreamers have a strong tendency to be highly creative and can be particularly effective leaders and entrepreneurs .
They also tend to have trouble following their own plans and making their ideas come to life .
Doers
Doers “ like to follow rules and prefer problems that are prestructured or prefabricated .
They like to fill in the gaps within existing structures rather than create the structures themselves . ”
Doers tend to be highly valued in organizations and are exceptionally prone to external motivation , but they also have trouble with internal direction .
Reviewers
Reviewers “ like to evaluate rules and problems , and prefer problems in which one analyzes and evaluate existing things and ideas . ”
Reviewers are great analysts and process people , but they can also come across as harsh and judgmental , even they have the best of intentions .
Thinking Styles Are Preferences , Not Abilities
It ’s important to understand that thinking styles are preferences , not abilities .
They are what we would do on our own if we had the free choice to do so .
For instance , some people love reading and editing the work of others , but have no desire to create their own stuff , even though they are technically better skilled than the authors they ’re reading .
Alternatively , some people love to do tasks that other people “ assign ” them but have no inclination to decide what they should be doing on their own or to edit the work of others .
( If you do n’t get why some people like being a VA or copyeditor , examine your own thinking style . )
Once we understand that thinking styles are preferences and not abilities , we can start making sense of the difference between aptitude and desire and can get out of the rut of thinking that we should do the things we ’re good at because we ’re good at them .
Just because you ’re good at something does n’t mean you should keep doing it – especially if it does n’t suit your thinking style .
The following are other points to think about :
1 . There ’s little necessary correlation between ability and style
It ’s counter - intuitive , but a lot of people get good at doing things that do n’t fit their style .
Most people learn to be doers since it ’s so highly rewarded in our society , even though they ’re naturally dreamers or reviewers .
The other pattern that ’s common is that people want to be dreamers but are n’t particularly good at it .
2. You Can Have One Style In Area But Not In Others
A further confusion is that we can be dreamers in one area but not others .
For instance , I ’m primarily a dreamer in most areas , but I ’m a doer when it comes to housework ; I ’d much prefer to be told what to do and in what order to do it .
I ’m a dreamer when it comes to writer , but more of a reviewer when it comes to graphic design ( this was a hard lesson for me to learn ) .
Knowing your thinking styles in the different areas of your life is helpful because it helps you communicate and work with others more effectively ; once Angela got that I was n’t a dreamer when it came to housework , a lot of friction and frustration dissolved , as you might imagine .
3 . It ’s Best to Align Your Activities With Your Preferences
Whereas it ’s possible to be good at an activity that does n’t match your style , it ’s much more difficult to excel at activities that do n’t suit your thinking style .
If you match your thinking styles with the activities you do , then excelling at those activities is far easier because you ’re not trying to resolve what you want to be doing with what you are doing .
4 . It ’s Best to Find Or Build A Team That Compliments Your Style
A team full of doers is directionless .
A team full of dreamers never get anything done .
A team of reviewers stifle each other .
A “ perfect ” team will have the right balance of dreamers , doers , and reviewers to handle the task at hand .
Though at times I ’ve explained thinking styles as though we are one type or the other , the reality is that many of us – especially dreamers and reviewers – are mixtures of the styles .
Thus , it makes sense to understand your thinking styles by ranking them , since it ’s very rare that people are so dominantly one or the other .
For instance , I ’m generally a dreamer , a reviewer , and then a doer , in that order , although that I ’ve come to realize that one of my strengths is that I ’m fairly blended .
That said , it ’s no wonder that this blog started as an attempt to translate productivity and time management ideas in a way that made sense to creative people – I was reviewing the available literature and translating it in a language that fit my natural thinking style so that I can manifest the ideas I had into shareable stuff , which was my root weakness .
If I was primarily a doer , this blog would probably be about gaining perspective and direction ( dreaming ) and analyzing my own patterns ( reviewing ) .
Are you a dreamer , a doer , or a reviewer ?
Does understanding your thinking style help you make sense of your strengths and weaknesses ?

Multiple - core processors are now the norm and functional programming languages are well - matched for use in writing software to take advantage of multi-core environments .
Simon Peyton Jones and Satnam Singh of Microsoft Research Cambridge have authored A Tutorial on Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell on using the functional programming language Haskell for writing parallel and concurrent programs .
The authors have created a practical tutorial to introduce programmers familiar with Haskell to the language 's inherent features for parallel programming .
Among the topics explored are :
Using annotations to write semi-explicit parallel programs ( and to control granularity ) .
Mechanisms for using transactional memory to share information between threads .
Using nested data parallelism to create rich data types ( that can automatically be transformed for efficient execution on multi-core processors .
The authors point out that the rise of multi-core processors has renewed interest in parallel functional programming and spurred many projects that explore the advantages of using a functional language , such as Haskell , for writing parallel code .
And while they note that writing concurrent and parallel programs is more challenging than writing sequential programs , the benefits of undertaking this difficult task can include exponentially increased performance , the ability to hide the latency of slow I / O operations , and being able to modularly structure code .
Besides , they also note that all new mainstream microprocessors have at least two cores and it is only a matter of time before tens or hundreds of cores are introduced .
And Peyton Jones and Singh argue , " We can not expect the performance of each individual core to improve much further .
The only way to achieve increasing performance from each new generation of chips is by dividing the work of a program across multiple processing cores . "
Which is where writing parallel Haskell programs can be useful .
U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood told a national television audience this morning that Portland 's light rail and streetcar systems are a model for the nation and he would soon come to Portland to " make some announcements .
"
On C - SPAN's " Washington Journal " this morning , LaHood also called Portland a model for reducing pollution , " getting people out of their cars " and creating " livable " communities .
The hint about a Portland announcement could mean approval of federal money for the Portland Streetcar 's eastside extension , which would be the first streetcar project with substantial federal funding .
As The Oregonian has reported , the Bush administration resisted the project for several years .
The Portland Streetcar Loop project would extend the line from the Pearl District , across the Broadway Bridge , and south to the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry .
A federal transit grant could fund $ 75 million of the $ 147 million extension .
LaHood said that Portland 's streetcar and light rail systems are a model for efforts to reduce the pollution that automobiles generate .
" They developed a streetcar system and we 're going to be going to Portland and meeting with those folks and making some announcements , " LaHood said .
" They really are a model , over the years , of getting people out of their cars and creating the livable community idea . "
LaHood , a longtime Amtrak supporter and former Congressman from Illinois , said the administration wants to " get people into light rail , into buses , getting people on bicycles and perhaps people walking . "
Washington D.C. is also a good example of an area with rail and bus systems that get people out of their cars , LaHood said .

Only a few days left to Double your gift
[ SEE UPDATE BELOW ]
Today , Washington Post reporters Juliet Eilperin and Mary Beth Sheridan have a piece on the alarming decline of Arctic sea ice .
In and of itself the story is n’t that surprising : scientists have known for a while that the ice is declining ; new data just confirms that it ’s happening faster than originally estimated .
That ’s consistent with all sorts of new observational data on the effects of climate change , which across the board seem to be exceeding scientists ’ most pessimistic predictions .
What jumped out at me is this bit , toward the bottom of the piece :
The new evidence — including satellite data showing that the average multiyear wintertime sea ice cover in the Arctic in 2005 and 2006 was nine feet thick , a significant decline from the 1980s — contradicts data cited in widely circulated reports by Washington Post columnist George F .
Will that sea ice in the Arctic has not significantly declined since 1979 .
[ my emphasis ]
I ca n’t think of another instance when a news story at a newspaper explicitly called out an op - ed writer in the same paper for lying , by name .
It ’s pretty extraordinary .
I can only imagine that something like this got passed up the editorial food chain , from science editor Nils Bruzelius to national news editor Kevin Merida , and perhaps beyond .
( The Post will not talk on record about their editorial process ; they “ stand behind their reporting ” and so forth . )
[ UPDATE : After I put this post up , science editor Nils Bruzelius gave me a call and was quite collegial and open about the story .
It was actually him who had the idea to reference Will , since the , ahem , “ data ” Will had distributed got so much publicity and was on people ’s minds .
He said he and the reporters agreed , it was a routine news judgment , nothing about it struck him as unusual , and as far as he knows no one above him questioned or was even aware of it .
I do n’t know how much of that is feigned innocence —
I ’ve certainly never heard of a similar case — but it seems there was no big process inside WaPo behind this .
Cheers to Bruzelius for the transparency . ]
Hard to read it as anything but a rebuke from the news team to Post editor Fred Hiatt and his editorial page ’s “ multi - layer editing process , ” which allowed Will to lie and mislead on climate change three times just in the last few months , even after being corrected , publicly , by multiple sources .
Along the same lines , see this new piece on the Post ’s weather blog , by Andrew Freeman : “ Will Misleads Readers on Climate Science – Again . ”
George Will ’s recent columns demonstrate a very troubling pattern of misrepresentation of climate science .
They raise some interesting questions about journalism , specifically concerning the editing process .
Editors and fact checkers are there to ensure that publications like the Washington Post do n’t print factually incorrect information .
In response to the Will controversy , numerous people have made the point that people who work for the Post — the ones who are n’t full of shit — have a responsibility to speak out about their employer ’s willingness to mislead readers .
It appears some of them are trying .
Use PHP to build a Twitter - like system on your site
It 's simple to add Twitter - like microblogging to any application using PHP
If you 've been paying any attention at all , you know that Twitter is one of the biggest sensations in the Web 2.0 world .
For those who do n't know , Twitter ( a service available at Twitter.com ) is a simple microblogging service that allows users to make posts ( called tweets ) of up to 140 characters that answer the question " What are you doing now ? "
Users can follow people they find interesting and have followers of their own .
In this way , information can be published to a small following or disseminated far and wide .
A quick glance at any single Twitter account reveals that users typically produce tweets on a wide variety of subject matter , from the everyday ( for example , " I 'm having a sandwich " ) to the more sublime .
Often , there are embedded links to images , media files , and blog postings .
These URLs are frequently obfuscated by services like TinyURL , mostly to keep the total character length of the post at or under 140 characters .
There are lots of folks who have taken to Twitter and have made an art form out of the super - condensed format , even having conversations with other users ( by directing their remarks to @user , for example ) .
From this simple start , a whole galaxy of Twitter - enabled mobile applications and other tools have sprung up .
There are even awards now for funniest , most sublime , and most fact - filled tweets , plus online applications that track the state of the various Twitter applications out there .
Many other sites and services , such as LinkedIn and Facebook , now allow their users to update their current status in a decidedly Twitter - like way .
In other words , updating your status on Facebook involves using a condensed message , and , of course , the status usually answers the question " What are you doing right now ? "
Adding a microblogging or status update tool to your own site does n't require a lot of work , and it provides your users with a fun and simple way to communicate .
The goal of this article is to show you how to do just that .
But first , I have to make a few assumptions about you .
First , I assume that you know something about PHP and MySQL .
I also assume that you have access to some kind of locally available Apache Web server that runs PHP and MySQL .
For the purposes of this article , I develop on a MacBook Pro using Macintosh , Apache , MySQL , and PHP ( MAMP ) , a freeware program that conveniently provides an entire development environment in one package .
However , you should be able to develop on Microsoft® Windows ® or Linux ® without any difficulty .
Finally , I assume that you have an existing application running right now that involves users of some kind and that you 're going to be adding microblogging or tweeting to that application in some way .
For that reason , I skip over some of the more user - centric parts of the application ( for example , logging in , managing a profile , etc. ) in favor of the posts .
Designing the back end of the application
At its simplest , the Twitter service centers around two nouns : users and messages .
If you 've already built an application and want to add a Twitter - like service to it , you probably already have user management in place .
If you do n't , you need to have some way of uniquely identifying each user in a database table ( a primary key , usually an integer ) , a username ( also unique ) , an e-mail address , a password , etc .
Tweets ( or posts ) are stored in a posts table , with each post having a primary key ( some kind of sequential integer ) , a foreign key relationship back to the user that made the post , the post itself ( limited to a number of characters ) , and a date / time stamp .
The final piece of the puzzle is a database table that shows which users are following whom .
All that is needed is some way to record a user ID and the follower ID , giving your application the ability to quickly build lists of followers and easily disseminate information to those who have signed up to follow someone else .
If you 're following along , go ahead and set up your three database tables now .
Use the SQL code shown in Listing 1 to create the first table , called users .
( If you already have a users table in place , please ignore this . )
Listing 1 .
The users table
CREATE TABLE `users` ( `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY , `username` VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL , `email` VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL , `password` VARCHAR ( 8 ) NOT NULL , `status` ENUM ( ' active ' , ' inactive ' ) NOT NULL ) ENGINE = MYISAM ;
The second table , called posts , is shown below .
Listing 2 .
The posts table
CREATE TABLE `posts` ( `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY , `user_id` INT NOT NULL , `body` VARCHAR ( 140 ) NOT NULL , `stamp` DATETIME NOT NULL ) ENGINE = MYISAM ;
Listing 3 shows the last table , called following .
Note that this table has two primary keys .
Listing 3 .
The following table
CREATE TABLE `following` ( `user_id` INT NOT NULL , `follower_id` INT NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( `user_id` , `follower_id` ) ) ENGINE = MYISAM ;
Before you go any further , make a file called header .
php and place all your connection strings for MySQL in it .
If you already have a file that handles this , ignore me for now .
Just be sure to include this file everywhere because you 'll need it .
Listing 4 shows what this file might look like for you .
Listing 4 . Sample header .
php file
$ SERVER = ' localhost ' ; $ USER = ' username ' ; $ PASS = ' password ' ; $ DATABASE = ' microblogger ' ; if ( !( $ mylink = mysql_connect ( $ SERVER , $ USER , $ PASS ) ) ) { echo " < h3 > Sorry , could not connect to database .</h3><br/>
Please contact your system 's admin for more help
" ; exit ; } mysql_select_db ( $ DATABASE ) ;
Please note that you are also free to add any other kinds of security checks to this header .
php file .
For example , you could check to see if a user ID has been set in a session variable ( showing that the user has actually logged in ) .
If a user is n't logged in , you can redirect that user to a login page .
This article does n't get into all of that , but it 's fairly easy to add when you need it .
Creating the entry form
Now that you have the back - end tables set up , it 's time to consider the PHP that will handle any data inserts and updates .
What you need right now are some simple functions that will :
Allow users to log in and add posts .
Disseminate those posts to anyone following that user .
Allow users to follow other users .
I usually work within the context of a Model - View - Controller ( MVC ) application framework such as CodeIgniter because it provides me with a serious set of tools for creating these kinds of applications .
For example , I normally start by creating two models ( one for users and the other for posts ) that allow me to interact with the users , posts , and following tables , then move on from there .
Because you may already be working within a different framework , I decided against that approach here .
Instead , I opt for a simpler approach that is not framework - specific .
Also , just for today , I have you cheat a little bit and add a record to your users table to create a series of test users that you 'll make available to your application .
I create three users and give them usernames of jane , tommy , and bill .
When that 's done , create a simple PHP file called functions .
php that will contain your major functionality .
You 're going to create a handful of functions in this file that allow actions within the context of your microblogging application .
The first function , shown in Listing 5 , is a simple one that allows you to add content to the posts table .
Listing 5 . Function for adding content to the posts table
function add_post ( $userid , $body ) { $ sql = " insert into posts ( user_id , body , stamp ) values ( $userid , ' " . mysql_real_escape_string ( $ body ) . " ' , now ( ) ) " ; $ result = mysql_query ( $sql ) ; }
To test this simple function , you need to add two more PHP files to the mix .
The first is the index .
php file , which contains a basic little form for right now — you 'll add a bit more to the page later .
The second is the PHP file that the form posts to , called add .
php .
Listing 6 is the markup for the index . php file .
Please note that you are using a PHP session to hard - code a user ID value of 1 , which is the user jane in my database .
This is perfectly OK to do now , but will obviously need to be changed later .
Listing 6 . Markup for the index .
php file
<?php session_start ( ) ; include_once ( 'header.php ' ) ; include_once ('functions.php ' ) ; $ _SESSION ['userid ' ] = 1 ; ?> <!
DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd " >
< html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xml:lang= " en " lang= " en " > < head > < meta http-equiv=" content - type " content = " text / html ; charset=utf - 8 " /> < title > Microblogging Application </ title > </ head > vbody > <? php if ( isset ( $ _SESSION [ ' message ' ] ) ) { echo " < b > " . $ _ SESSION [' message ' ] . " </b > " ; unset ( $_SESSION [' message ' ] ) ; } ?> < form method=' post ' action='add.php '> < p > Your status : </p> < textarea name= ' body ' rows = ' 5 ' cols= ' 40 ' wrap=VIRTUAL></textarea > < p >< input type=' submit ' value= ' submit'/></p> </ form > </ body > </html >
Also , note that I left some space just above the form for a status message , which you 'll set dynamically in add.
php , as shown below .
Listing 7 .
Adding posts to the database with the add.php file
<?php session_start ( ) ; include_once ( " header.php " ) ; include_once ( " functions.php " ) ; $ userid = $ _SESSION [ ' userid ' ] ; $ body = substr ( $ _POST [ ' body ' ] , 0,140 ) ; add_post ( $userid , $body ) ; $ _SESSION [' message ' ] =
" Your post has been added ! " ; header ( " Location:index.php " ) ; ?>
There should n't be anything particularly surprising about this code .
It simply takes the field called body from the form and the user ID set in the PHP session and then passes them to the add_post ( ) function in the functions .
php file .
Then another session variable is set ( the update message ) , and the user is redirected back to the index . php page .
If you test this little function , the only way you know that it works is by checking the posts table in the database .
That is n't exactly user - friendly , is it ?
What you need is for the posts to update right on your home page .
For that , you need to add a second function to the functions .
php file and use it on your home page .
Adding a list of updates
It 's time to open the functions .
php file and add a second function to it .
This time , call the function show_posts ( ) .
It will do just that , show all the posts for a particular user ID , as shown below .
Listing 8 . The show_posts ( ) function
function show_posts ( $ userid ) { $ posts = array ( ) ; $ sql = " select body , stamp from posts where user_id = ' $ userid ' order by stamp desc " ; $ result = mysql_query ( $sql ) ; while ( $data = mysql_fetch_object ( $result ) ) { $ posts [ ] = array ( ' stamp ' => $ data -> stamp , ' userid ' => $ userid , ' body ' => $ data -> body ) ; } return $ posts ; }
If you pass this particular function a user ID , it returns all the posts made by that user in reverse - chronological order , all bundled in a nice , multidimensional array .
To use it , all you have to do is call that function on index.php and retrieve all the posts for that user .
Because you 're dealing with a small amount of data for each record , this kind of query scales pretty well .
Listing 9 is the code you add to the index .
php page , right after the form you put in before .
By using the show_posts ( ) function in combination with the session variable , you can grab all the posts by the logged - in user .
If there are no posts , show an error message of some kind .
If there are posts , show them one at a time in a table — or , if you want to get fancy , do your own Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) thing .
Listing 9 .
Showing posts on the index .
php page
<? php $ posts = show_posts ( $_SESSION [ ' userid ' ] ) ; if ( count ( $ posts ) ) { ?> < table border= ' 1 ' cellspacing ='0 ' cellpadding =' 5 ' width= ' 500 ' > <? php foreach ( $ posts as $ key => $ list ) { echo " < tr valign= ' top ' >
" ; echo " < td > " . $ list [ ' userid ' ] . " </td >
" ; echo " < td > " . $ list [ ' body ' ] . " < br / >
" ; echo " < small > " .$ list [ ' stamp ' ] .
" </ small ></td >
" ; echo " </tr >
" ; } ? > </ table > <? php }else{ ?> < p >< b> You have n't posted anything yet !</b></p> <? php } ?>
Figure 1 shows the basic interface you 've built so far — not bad for just a few minutes ' work .
Figure 1 .
The basic interface
The easy part is over .
You now have a basic application that allows users to post their status and see that status displayed .
However , there 's one important part missing :
There 's no one out there to see your status updates besides you .
In the next section , you create a simple interface that lists all users in the system and allows logged - in users to actually follow other users and see their status updates mixed in their own .
Following other users
It 's time to add more substance to the functions .
php file .
You need a show_users ( ) function that gives you a list of all the users in the system .
You 'll use this function to populate a user list .
Listing 10 . The show_users ( ) function
function show_users ( ) { $ users = array ( ) ; $ sql = " select id , username from users where status= ' active ' order by username " ; $ result = mysql_query ( $sql ) ; while ( $ data = mysql_fetch_object ( $ result ) ) { $ users [ $ data -> id ] = $ data -> username ; } return $users ; }
Now that you have the show_users ( ) function , you can create a users .
php file that runs it and displays a list of all the users in the system , each with a link that says follow next to the user name .
Listing 11 . A users. php file that runs the show_users ( ) function
<?php session_start ( ) ; include_once ( " header.php " ) ; include_once ( " functions.php " ) ; ?>
<!
DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd " >
< html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xml:lang= " en " lang= " en " > < head > < meta http-equiv=" content - type " content = " text / html ; charset=utf - 8 " /> < title > Microblogging Application - Users </ title > </ head > < body > < h1 > List of Users </ h1 > <? php $ users = show_users ( ) ; if ( count ( $users ) ) { ?> < table border= ' 1 ' cellspacing ='0 ' cellpadding =' 5 ' width= ' 500 ' > <? php foreach ( $users as $ key => $ value ) { echo " < tr valign= ' top ' >
" ; echo " < td > " .
$key . " </td >
" ; echo " < td > " .$ value . " < small >< a href= '#'> follow</a></small></td>
" ; echo " </tr >
" ; } ? > </ table > <? php }else{ ? > < p >< b> There are no users in the system !</b></p> <? php } ? > </ body > </html >
To access this list of users , add a link to users .
php on the index .
php file , right above the form :
< p><a href='users.php '> see list of users </a></p>
What you end up with is an easy - to - use table of user names , each with a follow link .
Figure 2 . List of users
Before moving on to the next phase , it makes sense to write a small function that tells you who the current user is already following .
That way , users can use this list to determine if they want to follow or unfollow another user .
Go back to the functions . php file and add a function called following ( ) , shown in Listing 12 .
You pass the current user ID to this function to get back every user ID that this user is following .
Listing 12 . The following ( ) function
function following ( $userid ) { $ users = array ( ) ; $ sql = " select distinct user_id from following where follower_id = ' $ userid ' " ; $ result = mysql_query ( $sql ) ; while ( $data = mysql_fetch_object ( $ result ) ) { array_push ( $users , $ data->user_id ) ; } return $users ; }
You can now run this function on users .
php and check to see if a particular user ID is in the array .
If it is , use the unfollow link .
If it is n't , then default to follow .
Listing 13 shows the revised code .
Listing 13 .
Revised users .php file , showing follow and unfollow links
<? php $ users = show_users ( ) ; $ following = following ( $ _SESSION [ ' userid ' ] ) ; if ( count ( $users ) ) { ?> < table border= ' 1 ' cellspacing ='0 ' cellpadding =' 5 ' width= ' 500 ' > <? php foreach ( $users as $ key => $ value ) { echo " < tr valign= ' top ' >
" ; echo " < td > " .
$key . " </td >
" ; echo " < td > " .$value ; if ( in_array ( $key , $following ) ) { echo " < small > < a href='action.php?id=$key&do=unfollow'>unfollow</a> </ small > " ; }else{ echo " < small > < a href='action.php?id=$key&do=follow'>follow</a> </ small > " ; } echo " </td >
" ; echo " </tr >
" ; } ?>
The next step is simple : Create the action .
php file used in the follow and unfollow links .
This file accepts two GET parameters : one for the user ID and the other for follow or unfollow .
As shown in Listing 14 , this file is simple and short like the add. php file .
Listing 14 .
The action . php file
<?php session_start ( ) ; include_once ( " header.php " ) ; include_once ( " functions.php " ) ; $ id = $ _GET [ ' id ' ] ; $ do = $ _GET [ ' do ' ] ; switch ( $ do ) { case " follow " : follow_user ( $ _SESSION [ ' userid ' ] , $id ) ; $ msg = " You have followed a user ! " ; break ; case " unfollow " : unfollow_user ( $ _SESSION [ ' userid ' ] , $id ) ; $ msg = " You have unfollowed a user ! " ; break ; } $ _SESSION [' message ' ] = $ msg ; header ( " Location:index.php " ) ; ?>
As you can see , you take two very different actions — either follow_user ( ) or unfollow_user ( ) — depending on which link you selected before .
You then set a message and redirect users back to the index .
php page where they 'll see not only their own messages but recent messages added by the users they follow .
Or , in the case of an unfollow , that user 's messages disappear from the listing .
You need to add that last bit of code to index . php a little later .
Right now , it 's time to add the follow_user ( ) and unfollow_user ( ) functions to functions .
php .
You have to be a bit careful with both of these functions .
You can't just blindly follow or unfollow a user simply because someone clicks that link .
First , you have to check if there 's a relationship in the following table .
If there is , then you can either ignore the request ( in the case of the follow ) or act on it ( in the case of the unfollow ) .
To simplify things , write a check_count ( ) function you can use in either case , as shown below .
Listing 15 . The check_count ( ) function
function check_count ( $ first , $ second ) { $ sql = " select count ( * ) from following where user_id= '$ second ' and follower_id= '$ first ' " ; $ result = mysql_query ( $sql ) ; $ row = mysql_fetch_row ( $result ) ; return $ row [ 0 ] ; } function follow_user ( $me , $ them ) { $ count = check_count ( $me , $ them ) ; if ( $ count == 0 ) { $ sql = " insert into following ( user_id , follower_id ) values ( $ them , $me ) " ; $ result = mysql_query ( $sql ) ; } } function unfollow_user ( $me , $ them ) { $ count = check_count ( $me , $ them ) ; if ( $ count != 0 ) { $ sql = " delete from following where user_id= '$ them ' and follower_id= ' $ me ' limit 1 " ; $ result = mysql_query ( $sql ) ; } }
The next step is easy : Display a list of other users the user is following on the home page .
You already have a show_users ( ) function , but that shows all users .
You can easily repurpose this function by adding a nonrequired argument .
This argument is a user ID that you use to limit the list of users to those who have that particular ID in the following position .
What 's going on in the newly rewritten code shown in Listing 16 is a simple check on the incoming $ user_id argument .
If the user ID is greater than zero , use a query to pull out any user IDs being followed by that ID .
Use the implode ( ) function to turn that array of values into a comma-separated list .
Then insert that string — which looks something like and id in ( 1,2,3 ...n ) — into the existing SQL query , thereby limiting the user listing to those the user is following .
Listing 16 .
Rewritten code to limit the list of users pulled by the query
function show_users ( $user_id=0 ) { if ( $user_id > 0 ) { $ follow = array ( ) ; $ fsql = " select user_id from following where follower_id= '$ user_id ' " ; $ fresult = mysql_query ( $ fsql ) ; while ( $f = mysql_fetch_object ( $ fresult ) ) { array_push ( $ follow , $ f - > user_id ) ; } if ( count ( $ follow ) ) { $ id_string = implode ( ' , ' , $ follow ) ; $ extra = " and id in ( $id_string ) " ; }else{ return array ( ) ; } } $ users = array ( ) ; $ sql = " select id , username from users where status= ' active ' $ extra order by username " ; $ result = mysql_query ( $sql ) ; while ( $ data = mysql_fetch_object ( $ result ) ) { $ users [ $ data -> id ] = $ data -> username ; } return $users ; }
Next , you add the code shown in Listing 17 to the home page to display all those followed users .
Listing 17 .
Revising index.php to show users being followed
< h2 > Users you 're following </ h2 > <? php $users = show_users ( $_SESSION [ ' userid ' ] ) ; if ( count ( $users ) ) { ?> < ul > <? php foreach ( $users as $ key => $ value ) { echo " < li > " .$value . "
</li >
" ; } ? > </ul > <? php }else{ ?> < p >< b> You 're not following anyone yet !</b></p> <? php } ?>
Adding posts from other users
To add posts from other users to a user 's timeline , you need only reuse some previously written code .
For example , you already know how to get a list of users that the current user is following .
You also know how to pull out all the posts by a certain user .
You merely need to tweak the latter function to be able to accept a list of users rather than a single user .
All you need to do now is move the first function higher up in the index .
php file so you can take advantage of it sooner , then use the list of user IDs you get from the function to pull out a limited number of posts from their timelines — you do n't want all of them , just five or so .
Remember , you want to place the posts by those other users in reverse - chronological order ( most recent on top ) .
First things first : Add a limit argument to the show_posts ( ) function , setting it to zero by default .
If that limit goes higher than zero , you add a limit to your SQL statement for retrieving posts .
The other thing you do is make the $ userid argument into an array you parse into a field of commas , which you then pass to the SQL statement .
This is a bit of extra work , but it pays off handsomely because all of the posts will then display in reverse order , as you can see .
Listing 18 . Updating show_posts ( ) to accept an array of users
function show_posts ( $ userid , $limit=0 ) { $ posts = array ( ) ; $ user_string = implode ( ' , ' , $ userid ) ; $ extra = " and id in ( $user_string ) " ; if ( $ limit > 0 ) { $ extra = " limit $ limit " ; }else { $ extra = '' ; } $ sql = " select user_id , body , stamp from posts where user_id in ( $user_string ) order by stamp desc $ extra " ; echo $ sql ; $ result = mysql_query ( $sql ) ; while ( $data = mysql_fetch_object ( $result ) ) { $ posts [ ] = array ( ' stamp ' => $ data -> stamp , ' userid ' => $ data-> user_id , ' body ' => $ data -> body ) ; } return $ posts ; }
Now go back to the index . php file and work on passing in more than one user ID to show_posts ( ) , as shown below .
It 's a simple thing , really , since you already gathered the users .
You just pull out the keys using array_keys ( ) and add your session variable to the mix .
At minimum , this sends in an array with one value in it ( the currently logged - in user 's ID ) .
At most , it sends the logged - in user 's ID and the ID of every user that user is following .
Listing 19 .
Passing in an array of users to the show_posts ( ) function
$ users = show_users ( $ _SESSION [ ' userid ' ] ) ; if ( count ( $users ) ) { $ myusers = array_keys ( $users ) ; }else{ $ myusers = array ( ) ; } $ myusers [ ] = $ _SESSION [ 'userid ' ] ; $ posts = show_posts ( $myusers , 5 ) ;
Conclusion
In this article , you learned how to build a simple PHP - based microblogging service similar to Twitter and the Facebook status update tool .
With any luck , you can take what you learned here , add it to your application , and tailor it to your needs .

Holder is not at all settled on the White House conclusions about prosecuting CIA ( interrogators ) officers OR officials .
that does not mean the inquiries are over .
Senior Justice Department lawyers and other advisers , who declined to be identified discussing a sensitive subject , say Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. has discussed naming a senior prosecutor or outside counsel to review whether CIA interrogators exceeded legal boundaries -- and whether Bush administration officials broke the law by giving the CIA permission to torture in the first place
Even if prosecutions prove too difficult to bring , an outside counsel 's report could be made public .
In a democracy , the wheels of justice grind on -- and the president , for good reason under the rule of law , does not have the power to stop them .
As suspected , Microsoft used this week 's MIX09 conference to unleash Internet Explorer 8 , downloadable as of noon today ( EDT ) .
Our initial tests on the final release indicate that Microsoft 's promises of better performance and security are realized , and that the team goal of creating " a better way to waste time on the Internet " has been realized too -- in the good sense .
But serious matters first , and both speed and security are seriously better in IE8 .
Betanews has executed its own speed tests during the beta period , and our tests indicated that it was at least twice as fast as the previous version ; Microsoft 's own tests on the RTW ( release - to - web ) version claim it to be between two and four times as fast .

Security 's looking good .
IE senior director Amy Barzdukas told Betanews that the development team had three goals for the 8.0 version -- protecting people from sites that attempt to phish their information or infest their machines with malware , protecting users from themselves ( that is , from the tendency to ignore confusing warnings or to use less than good sense when clicking a savory link ) , and extending security " beyond the browser " to compromised servers .
The most significant effort involves expanding IE 's detection efforts past its current ability to identify phishing sites .
The browser can now also flag suspected or known malware sites , or sites attempting to infect visitors with malware .
The need for SmartScreen is great ; during development , Barzdukas says , Microsoft found that infectious sites outnumbered phishing sites by a charming 10:1 .
In our tests , the detection was effective , correctly jumping on sites we knew to be infected with various bits of feral code .
The warning we received , designed to support that second goal of protecting users from themselves , was perhaps even more effective than a harried tester would have liked -- if the browser sees that you 're headed for a site already known to be problematic , it throws up a bright - red page warning you to turn back to your home page or inviting you to get more information .
What you can't do is easily go anywhere else ; there 's no " OK " button to click .
That design choice may have been a bit unnerving for a reviewer , but I 'm personally planning to install the browser on my mother 's machine for that feature alone .
I also liked the simple visual indicator in the address bar that bolds the actual domain to which the URL points ; a feature designed to give a visual cue that , say , " yourbank.com.evildudes.com " might not be the safest URL for checking your account balance .
Security is n't just about keeping users away from the bad stuff , of course ; you 've got to get out of their way so they can smoothly reach the good stuff .
In the case of cross - site scripting attacks , a page might contain a mix of legitimate and malicious code .
For those pages , IE8 is designed to detect and block the malicious code while allowing users to access the legit material .
Betanews were unable to test this feature in the amount of time available to us .
The browser 's also working on that third goal -- security " beyond the browser " -- while all this is happening .
If an infection is detected , the browser passes the information back to Microsoft , which in turn can notify infected sites that they have a problem .
We 've seen this before over at Google , but considering the market share IE holds , this could be a big help in the fight to keep legit sites free of stealth infections .
Finally from the security front , the InPrivate functionality we saw during the beta process seems to have been refined .
as before , it must be accessed from the menu , but once you 're in it the mode operates in both browser modes ( no persistence of session , no cookies ) and in a filtering mode that examines what information might be gathered by third parties such as advertising networks that might have their code in some part of the page viewed .
users can choose to block the sending of that information , or can choose which providers may receive it .
Much security thought has been given to how to keep malevolent code from wreaking havoc on the system at large , and a great deal of thinking both inside and outside Microsoft has focused on keeping processes separate -- sandboxing , as some call it .
IE8 improves tab isolation and recovery capabilities ; when one of the buggiest pages we tested with ran amok , it only knocked out its own tab rather than sinking the entire browser or the OS at large .
Further experimentation is needed , but we liked what we saw there .

Widespread evidence of a + 4 –6 - m sea -level highstand during the last interglacial period ( Marine Isotope Stage 5e ) has led to warnings that modern ice sheets will deteriorate owing to global warming and initiate a rise of similar magnitude by ad 2100 ( ref. 1 ) .
The rate of this projected rise is based on ice - sheet melting simulations and downplays discoveries of more rapid ice loss2,3 .
Knowing the rate at which sea level reached its highstand during the last interglacial period is fundamental in assessing if such rapid ice - loss processes could lead to future catastrophic sea - level rise .
The best direct record of sea level during this highstand comes from well - dated fossil reefs in stable are as4,5,6 .
However , this record lacks both reef - crest development up to the full highstand elevation , as inferred7 from widespread intertidal indicators at +6 m , and a detailed chronology , owing to the difficulty of replicating U - series ages on submillennial timescales8 .
Here we present a complete reef - crest sequence for the last interglacial highstand and its U - series chronology from the stable northeast Yucatán peninsula , Mexico .
We find that reef development during the highstand was punctuated by reef - crest demise at +3 m and back - stepping to +6 m .
The abrupt demise of the lower - reef crest , but continuous accretion between the lower - lagoonal unit and the upper - reef crest , allows us to infer that this back - stepping occurred on an ecological timescale and was triggered by a 2 – 3 - m jump in sea level .
Using strictly reliable 230Th ages of corals from the upper - reef crest , and improved stratigraphic screening of coral ages from other stable sites , we constrain this jump to have occurred ∼ 121 kyr ago and conclude that it supports an episode of ice - sheet instability during the terminal phase of the last interglacial period .

Veganism and vegetarianism have a bad reputation in our society .
Those who identify as vegan or vegetarian tend to receive odd looks and questions like , “ does n’t that burger look good ? ”
We get labeled as “ tree - huggers ” and “ extremists . ”
It ’s remarkably similar to being out as an Atheist .
I hope to answer some common questions and present a secular case for vegetarianism as a sound ethical choice .
I ’ll start by clarifying my terms .
Vegan means refraining from the consumption of anything that contains animal products , especially things that come from animals with nervous systems .
Yeast is ok , but a Vegan will avoid eating any food containing dairy , eggs or meats , and will carefully check ingredient labels to avoid additives from animal sources , such as gelatin ( from hooves ) or certain enzymes .
Vegans also avoid any products containing animal hide , bones or other bits .
Most vegans will use life - saving medicines made from animal components .
The Vegan Society has a comprehensive list of animal products commonly found in food here .
Vegetarian covers a broad range of consumption choices .
Strict vegetarians will use the same food guidelines as vegans , but use non -food products made from animal parts , such as leather shoes .
Ovo-lacto vegetarians will consume eggs and dairy , but not meat .
Some people will use the term vegetarian to mean that they avoid red meat , so they will eat fish and sometimes chicken .
For this post , vegetarianism means the removal of all chicken , beef and pork from the diet .
I myself am a vegan , although I will be defending vegetarianism in this post .
Without going into the animal welfare issues ( which are well - documented elsewhere ) , my argument will focus on the environmental disruption and social justice issues caused by most large - scale farming practices .
Large - scale farming , also known as factory farming , is by far ( pdf ) the source of most animal products consumed in the West .
Factory farming emphasizes size and concentration by confining a large number of animals into a small space .
This causes numerous problems with waste management , greenhouse gas emissions and diseases .
Factory farming is often criticized for waste - management issues .
Feedlot waste has been shown to have negative effects on the environment .
The standard factory farm uses waste lagoons and spreader fields to hold the large amount of urine and feces generated by the animals .
As you can imagine , the stench from a small lake of poop is vile , and has adverse effects on those who live nearby .
Several studies ( pdf ) have shown that the fumes from feedlots cause health problems for those living nearby .
Ammonia , Hydrogen Sulfide , Volatile Organic Compounds such as Methane and particulate matter are commonly found in the fumes coming from feedlots .
The feedlot lagoons and spreader fields often lack adequate runoff controls , so heavy rainfall or snow melt can cause direct leakage of the feces and urine into natural bodies of water and potable water sources for humans .
This most commonly results in fish kills , but has also been shown to cause a long - term issue with mutated fish in streams .
According to The New York Times , “ an estimated 30 percent of the earth ’s ice - free land is directly or indirectly involved in livestock production , according to the United Nation ’s Food and Agriculture Organization , which also estimates that livestock production generates nearly a fifth of the world ’s greenhouse gases — more than transportation . ”
The amount of fossil fuel needed to grow meat is also considerable ; “ … if Americans were to reduce meat consumption by just 20 percent it would be as if we all switched from a standard sedan — a Camry , say — to the ultra - efficient Prius . ”
According to Ulf Sonesson of the Swedish Institute for Food and Biotechnology , roughly half the diet - based greenhouse gasses come from meat production .
Replacing 50 % of the protein from meat with protein from soy in the western diet would dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions , “ on the order of 70 % . ”
In addition to the pollution issues , industrial animal farming is an incredibly inefficient food source .
The grain fed to cattle in the USA alone would feed 800 million people .
Livestock are also water - intensive sources of food .
According to the Stockholm International Water Institute , a kilogram of grain - fed beef needs at least 15 cubic meters of water .
Thus far I have primarily talked about the environmental problems with using meat as a food source .
There are numerous social problems with our modern meat industry as well .
The modern US slaughterhouse industry has a history of food and worker safety violations , with the now - closed plant in Postville , IA , being just one example .
Other abuses are regularly uncovered .
Workers in US slaughterhouses are expected to work nearly twice as fast as workers anywhere else in the world .
According to Eric Schlosser , author of Fast Food Nation , “ … they [ slaughterhouses ] cut wages , they cut benefits , broke unions .
And now it has one of the highest turnover rates of any industrial job . ”
The modern US slaughterhouse has a turnover rate between 75 % and 100 % per year .
The workers , mostly poor and many recent immigrants , are also working in what the Bureau of Labor Statistics says is the most dangerous job in America .
Injuries are common due to the frantic pace of the work , the fact that power cutting tools are involved , and the amounts of blood and fat that end up on the floor while workers are moving around .
The modern industrial animal farm has many environmental and social costs that are not reflected on the in - store price tag .
Our water and air are poisoned and our poor work in a dangerous job for little pay .
While the modern steak is easier to buy than ever before , it is far more expensive than we as a society realize .
We need to carefully re-think the true cost of our diet before we discover the bill is far more than we can afford .
On gender and the claims made about it .
2008 July 6
I was watching Penn & Teller ’s Bullshit ! last night .
It was the episode about pornography ( ‘ War on Porn ’ season 6 , episode 3 ) and it was good .
It divided arguments against pornography into the two camps ( feminist and conservative ) and dealt with them each in their own way .
It moved away from using statistical data either way .
What I was particularly interested in was the feminist argument .
It contained the same tired repetition of objectification and acceptance of rape .
Penn and Teller easily demolished this .
They should , as the argument is quite dead , intellectually , but radical feminists repeat it like a holy grail .
There is one issue I have with radical feminism that was not addressed to its full force in the programme .
It has been criticised for misogyny on the grounds that it makes some claims that reduce the meaningfulness of women ’s choices and abilities .
When they say that a woman who becomes a pornographer or becomes a prostitute does so not out of choice , but out of mental illness or pressure or the inability to choose otherwise then they are ( so the argument goes ) reducing the recognition of choice .
Now the thing I want female readers to consider is : are you really like that ?
Do you need to be protected from society because it will remove your inability to choose ?
Do you really feel , phenomenologically , that even things such as language make it difficult to express yourself as women and force you to adopt positions ?
Do you honestly feel that things like science , logic and reason are male attempts at objectivity that are thrust upon you ?
Read the The Second Sex and ask yourselves , are you really the miserable creatures that Simone de Beauvoir presents as being oppressed in that book ?
Finally , do you really feel men are doing all that to you ?
But my true target audience is not really female , it is male .
If women should be annoyed at what radical feminists say about them , men ought to be downright furious .
Take in the episode , where the claims are made that men , by viewing pornography , learn to objectify women and treat them as objects , the standard fare , but that it also makes us more likely to rape women .
On top of this one claim is that as pornography becomes more commonplace , it acts as some kind of “ gateway drug ” and , with the increase in shaving pubic hair midst pornographers , it will lead to more men becoming attracted to children and the demand for children increases .
This “ think of the children ” argument is no stranger to radical feminism , they have used a similar line in prostitution ( another episode of Penn & Teller ’s programme I recommend , by the by ) .
Here I ask the male readers to examine their own phenomenology : do you honestly believe that you ever treat women purely as objects because of something like that ?
Do you believe that your sexual desire is so base that it could cause you to rape ?
Do you honestly believe that any amount of exposure to shaved genitalia will cause you to feel sexual attraction to children ?
Do you even mentally associate it with children at all ?
If you feel these are all false then show it .
Do not just let these people say this and pass by , take action .
I know that due to the residual fat of the cultural junk food that makes up the 1960s , many of the women ( and , even sadder , sometimes men ) who present this nonsense make up the now dwindling generation of academics who have run the American university system aground , but resist it .
Boycott class , form groups , harness the anger a lot of these people felt for a genuinely just cause .
Do not just ape their opinions to score marks because you are harming yourselves when you believe it ( or even claim to ) .
Disavow and have nothing to do with friends , whether male or female , who preach this bile .
I cannot , myself , understand why any man would have a friendship with a woman who believed him pre-disposed to rape , violence and paedophilia .
Get angry with the hypocrisy of feminists , get angry when women have posters glorifying or trivialising male - directed violence , even if it is as small as the trashy “ boys are stupid ” posters because they would do the same to us .
They win when we ignore them , because their opinions seep in like an ooze through our culture ’s defences .
This applies to men as regards radical masculinists who preach similar nonsense about women ; it also applies to women as regards both sets of radicals .
People of either gender should hate what both sides say about both genders .
They are trying to fit you into a group and all identity politics wants to do is place you in these groups so they can tell you how you think and feel , how you behave because you are a member of this or that group .
Everyone loses when they win .
Resistance to these false and epistemologically bankrupt ideas are exactly what is needed and they will use every trick to remove that resistance .

Over the last few months , it looks like the wingnuts have undertaken a specific and systematic effort to try and downrate items that do n't reflect well on them at places like REDDIT and DIGG .
Of course , lots of recommendations on those two sites result in thousands --- if not hundreds of thousands --- of more eyeballs to the various stories we run here at The BRAD BLOG --- stories which are often not seen anywhere else in the media , even in the Progressive Blogosphere for that matter !
So your REDDITs and DIGGs actually do matter quite a bit , particular now since the wingnuts seem to have begun their downrating campaign .
Click here to see the amazing number of DOWN votes at REDDIT , for example , for last night 's " Franken Is n't ' Leading ' ; He Won and Coleman Lost " story .
Without all that downrating , the story would easily have made it to the front page of REDDIT for a long while , and therefore been propagated across dozens of other key sites on the net as well .
It takes about 30 seconds to sign up for REDDIT and / or DIGG the first time , and then you can remain logged on forever .
It then takes less than 2 seconds to vote for and / or uprate our stories here at The BRAD BLOG without even leaving this page by hitting the REDDIT and DIGG vote icons for stories that you believe are important to get out there .
Your 2 seconds of a mouse clicking matters .
Really .
And , as ever , your help is much appreciated !
( And thanks to those regular DIGGers and REDDITers who already help out ! )
Miss California Carrie Prejean is casually dating Olympic champion Michael Phelps , according to reports .
The Miss USA runner - up whose gay marriage flap during the pageant drew searing criticism has reportedly cuddled up to Phelps at baseball games and dined out with the hunky Olympian , her grandmother said .
" Carrie and Michael have been out to baseball games and lunch , " grandma Jeanette Coppolla dished to Radaronline.com .
" He always calls her when he is in town and they go out . "
Phelps , who is frequently seen with a stable of girls , denies he is dating the beauty queen .
" I 'm not dating anybody , " he told Usmagazine.com .
" I 'm single .
My private life stays private . "
The swimmer has been laying low since photographs showing the Olympic champion with a bong in hand at a house party surfaced in the media -- but he did defend the the pageant runner - up 's right to an opinion .
" That 's the cool thing about America -- everybody has their opinion , " he told the magazine .
" I 'm not saying I support her .
I 'm not saying I do n't support her . "
The beauty queen 's grandma said Carrie is n't looking for anything serious .
" Carrie knows that he has dated lots of girls but she enjoys going out with him and is n't serious about being in a relationship with him , " she said .
" He 's a nice guy and she likes him . "
Billy Bush , who hosted the pageant , pressed her on the relationship rumors .
" That 's not appropriate to answer right now .
He 's a great man ...
You can call me on a later day and we can talk about that . "
The beauty queen came under fire this week for dissing gay marriage when asked about same - sex marriage during the pageant .
" In my country and in my family , I believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman -- no offense to anyone out there , " she said .

A year after Ruby 1.9.0 was released , it has n't seen much use yet .
Some of the reasons are incompatibilities with popular libraries or frameworks , and changes in behavior in some areas .
David A. Black recently blogged a few small changes in 1.9.x that developers need to be aware of and which might break software in subtle ways .
( InfoQ has reported on many of Ruby 1.9 's other changes ) .
Now Ruby 1.9.1 , the first stable release , is about to be released .
Ruby 1.9.1 RC1 came out a few weeks ago , and RC2 will soon be released .
Currently , the final Ruby 1.9.1 is expected in late January .
A stable 1.9.1 is one reason to take a closer look at running at 1.9.x , if only for the speed improvements .
Some features , such as Fibers have been used to increase scalability ( eg. NeverBlock for database access or I/O ) or for workarounds ( eg. NeverBlock HTTP library ) .
Ruby 1.9.x is also the version used for projects adding new features or usage scenarios for Ruby .
The recently announced Rhodes framework ( Rhodes is now available in version 0.2 ) for mobile applications uses 1.9.x versions of Ruby on some of the supported mobile platforms .
Another example is MacRuby , which should also soon see another release .
MacRuby is based on Ruby 1.9.x , and focuses on tight integration with Objective - C , to the point where object such as Strings are actually Objective - C String objects ; this tight integration allows to script Objective - C APIs with little to no overhead , as well as making use of Objective - C's Garbage Collector ( the Objective - C GC ( Autozone ) was recently open sourced ) .
While JRuby is aiming to support 1.9.x , with full parsing and partial library support already in place in 1.1.6 , other implementations ( except for MacRuby ) , still lag behind in 1.9.x support .
What 's keeping you on Ruby 1.8.x ?
What Ruby 1.9.1 features ( performance , Fibers , threading changes , encoding changes , etc ) are reasons for switching ?

It ’s best not to generalize too much about a newspaper that covers a city whose unofficial battle cry is “ Keep Austin Weird , ” but there is a palpable connection to The Chronicle here .
Many people will also point out that Austin is a notoriously liberal , literate place , but that has n’t done a lot for The Austin American - Statesman , which , like so many other daily papers , is in decline and up for sale .
“ They are a big part of the story here and always have been , ” said Frank Hendrix , who owns Emo ’s , a club here , and was overseeing three stages during the festival .
It ’s an old - school love kind of love .
The newspaper ’s Web site , in spite of Austin ’s reputation as a tech - savvy place , has never been a particularly remarkable one and is still basically a companion to the print version , which is crammed with all manner of editorials , deep political coverage and lots of articles rendered in almost unreadable small type .
“ We do n’t do gotcha journalism , our coverage is very policy - oriented , and always local , local , local , ” he said .
“ Even during the Bush years , which were a very big deal here , we never put anybody that was n’t local on the cover .
We do n’t do out - of - towners . ”
Last Thursday night , sitting outside the Hilton Austin and later walking Red River Street , which was a riot of music performances and noise , Mr. Black said that the festival and the newspaper have been pretty much hand - in - glove all along the way .
It ’s hard to think of another American city where the newspaper has served as an engine for innovation .
South by Southwest now has three vibrant legs  music , film and Web  that come together to create a stool that is the envy of every other American city .
“ All of it has to do with Austin , and not us , ” Mr. Black , who also produces films including “ The Order of Myths . ”
“ Apart from all of the music here , when Richard Linklater hit it big with ‘ Slackers , ’ he not only did n’t move away , but began helping other filmmakers .
Mike Judge , who did ‘ Beavis and Butt - head , ’ same way .
Robert Rodriguez as well . ”
“ We have a critical mass of culture , of government , of people who like to read , that makes this a good place to have a newspaper like ours . ”
A cop walks by and high - fives Mr. Black , which is not the general relationship between most newspapers and local law enforcement , but The Chronicle ’s footprint is so deep here  millions and millions of dollars are flowing into the city this week  that people generally think that what ’s good for The Chronicle is good for the community and vice versa .
It was getting on toward 11 p.m. , which is high noon during the days of the festival , and Mr. Black dropped me at a club .
I watched him walk down the street and he could n’t get three steps without someone stopping him to say hello or tell him thanks .
Imagine that : a newspaper man being one of the most popular guys in town .

According to the house rules , clothes are not optional , but strictly forbidden at all times .
In keeping with naturists ' belief that nudity is non-sexual , acts of a sexual nature are banned in common areas .
Strict rules
The exact opening date has not yet been set , but Mr Haferkorn has already published the house rules for the hotel he soon hopes to run .
Some , like the request to keep noise in the corridors to a minimum , would not raise an eyebrow anywhere .
Others are more unusual .
Rule number one limits access to the hotel to followers of the nudist movement .
And rule number three demands that guests be naked at all times .
HOUSE RULES
Access to the hotel is reserved exclusively to followers of the nudist movement
By entering the hotel grounds , guests agree to comply with the binding house rules Guests are obliged to be naked inside the hotel precinct Sexual harassment will not be tolerated Sexual acts are strictly prohibited in the common areas Photography and filming are only allowed with permission of those photographed Hotel Rosengarten has until now been a destination for walkers taking advantage of its idyllic location in Germany 's Black Forest .
Mr Haferkorn plans to turn it into " a place of relaxation for people who live naturism and who want to spend their leisure time playing sports and games , and mingling with like - minded people in complete nudity . "
He says the new Rosengarten will boast 32 rooms , a restaurant , a sauna and a tanning salon , for those days when the German weather does not play ball .
The director of tourism in nearby Freudenstadt , Michael Krause , calls it an " unusual concept " .
He told Die Welt newspaper he would have preferred a " normal " hotel , but stressed there was nothing sinister about the nudist approach .
He said he was hoping for an increase in visitor numbers to the area , even if more conventional walkers - like him - would now avoid the hotel .
Mr Haferkorn hopes his hotel will attract both walkers who like to go bare and nudists who like to walk .
And while the strict nudity rule only applies within the grounds of the hotel , guests keen to bare it all on their walks may not have to wait too long for permission : two villages in the Harz mountain region are reportedly looking into designating some of their walking paths as nudist routes .
Even without official permission , nudists have for over a century roamed naked through Germany 's forests .
Nudist walkers freely advertise the dates of naked walks on the internet .
If spotted , they are sometimes fined by police , but in general , they say , clothed people 's reaction is one of surprise , not anger .
The nudist movement , or free body culture as it is called in Germany , goes back to the 1890s , when sociologist Heinrich Pudor wrote about stripping off and getting back to nature .
The German nudist association DFK currently has around 50,000 paid - up members , who receive an international membership card granting them access to nudist - only events .
Many more Germans are believed to enjoy bathing , walking , playing and camping naked .
Mr Haferkorn is hoping to attract as many of them as possible to his new hotel , although he may have to think hard about where his guests should pin their DFK badge if his hardline anti-clothing stance is to work .

High School Pitcher Patrick Schuster Tosses 3 Consecutive No-Hitters : Video
Patrick Schuster is good .
He ’s so good that he ’s pitched no-hitters in three straight games for his Mitchell Mustangs high school baseball team .
The streak began against Land O’Lakes with a 17 - strikeout , seven - inning no -hitter on April 3 .
The next team to fall victim to Patrick Schuster was River Ridge , when he fanned 10 in a five - inning , 10 - 0 win five days later .
Schuster ’s most recent triumph came against Clearwater Central Catholic , when he struck out 16 banners en route to his third straight no -hitter .
As his streak has gone on , the pressure has increased .
Schuster ’s last start was in front of several Major League scouts .
“ I tell you what , he ’s just in a zone right now , ” Mustangs coach Scot Wilcox said .
“ It ’s like business .
He went to work .
There were a lot of scouts there and a lot of anticipation and he lived up to it . ”
Schuster said , “ It ’s great .
I ca n’t think of a more perfect time for this .
There were 15 - 20 scouts there and most of them were bosses of guys watching me .
I ’m having a blast right now . ”
As for his future , Schuster has signed with the University of Florida , but that of course is pending the MLB Draft .
A kid who can toss no-hitters like that will certainly be coveted .
He ’ll go for his 4th straight no -hitter on April 20th .
If his opponents “ celebrate ” that day , his chances will be pretty good .

Clinton Mum on UAE Torture Tape Despite pressure to investigate , no action yet from State Department .
April 23 , 2009  --
Following an ABC
News investigation last night that showed a Royal Sheikh from the United Arab Emirates mercilessly torturing a man with whips , electric cattle prods and wooden planks with protruding nails , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is being urged to initiate and carry out an investigation into the sadistic torture tape .
The co-chairman of the House Human Rights Commission , Rep. James McGovern ( D - MA ) , said in a letter to Clinton that the tape " shocks the conscience " and demanded she " express the outrage of our nation regarding these acts , and call for an end to the impunity that has provided Sheikh Issa the freedom and license to carry out such heinous acts without the fear of legal reprisal or consequences . "
McGovern , who repeatedly referred to ABC News ' investigation on Nightline and was interviewed for the initial story , said the existence of the torture tape requires the U.S. to take action .
Click here to watch the Nightline investigation .
In his letter to Clinton , he requests she investigate whether a Department of Homeland Security official stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi , who was reportedly shown the torture tape by the Houston businessman who smuggled it out of the UAE , brought the tape to the attention of higher - ranking officials and " what action these higher - ranking officers then undertook , if any . "
McGovern also requests that a temporary hold be placed on U.S. expenditures of " funds , training , sales or transfers of equipment or technology , including nuclear " to the UAE until an investigation is completed , since the UAE Ministry of Interior – led by one of the Sheikh 's brother 's – reviewed the allegations and found " all rules , policies and procedures were followed correctly by the Police Department . "
The 45 minute - long tape also shows a man in a UAE police uniform tying the victim 's arms and legs , and later holding him down as the Sheikh pours salt on the man 's wounds and then drives over him with his Mercedes SUV .
The victim , a grain dealer , was apparently tortured over a missing load of grain worth about $ 5000 .
State Department Briefing and the Torture Tape
In a State Department briefing today , a spokesman told reporters the agency had seen the tape but could not recall whether Clinton discussed it when she met with the UAE foreign minister .
" The government is aware of our concerns … through our Human Rights Report , " the spokesman said , referring to the 2008 report .
The State Department spokesman said he did n't know if the U.S. had asked the UAE government to look into the incident and dodged numerous further questions about the tape .

WASHINGTON --
Since the fall , senior aides to Timothy Geithner have closely dealt with American International Group Inc. on compensation issues including bonuses , both from his time as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and as Treasury secretary .
The extent of their involvement , which was n't widely known , raises fresh questions about whether Mr. Geithner could have known earlier about AIG's $ 165 million in bonus payments .
When the bonuses sparked a political firestorm last week , Mr. Geithner said he learned ...
While I love living in Italy , one of the things that intrigued and bothered me is the lax attitude versus waste management , recycling and garbage collection .
Sure enough , there are many " parts " in Italy , each with their own habits , procedures , administration , and culture , so I can not speak for the parts I have not lived in , or travelled through , but it seems in many parts the garbage collection is done in the same way :
People dump their waste in garbage skips scattered along the streets , both in town centers and along the roads in rural areas .
A garbage truck comes along every so often to empty the skips .
There seems to be no limit as to what people can dump in these skips .
You can find anything from normal household garbage , the contents of entire file cabinets , chemicals like paint , engine oil and cleaning products , leaves and branches from the garden , bicycles , fridges , microwaves and computer screens .
Just about anything goes .
And if it is too big to put inside , people just leave it next to the skip .
Often these collection points , separated by only a few hundred meters in the towns , become a concentric area of scattered broken glass , plastic bags , tins and cans that were either spilled while throwing them in the skip , pulled out by street dogs , or just dumped on the spot , next to the skip .
There are mainly three types of skips : one for generic waste , one for paper and cardboard and one for plastic and glass .
In many cases , though , you can only find the one for generic waste , so " recycling " is often only a remote thought in Italy .
A thought confirmed if you look what people actually dump in the recycling bins .
It seems like they are used as an overflow for the general waste skip .
Most of the time , the skips are not emptied fast enough .
What is the " well - intended waste generator " to do ?
He or she put his stinking and leaking garbage bags in the car ( guaranteed to leave a smell for the next two months ) early in the morning ( what else do you need to start off a nice day ) , drives to the skip only to find it full ...
Of course people will not drive to the next one , or come back the next day .
They will dump it right there .
I was glad to finally see some recycling bins in my neighbourhood .
Previously I had to drive 3 km to the nearest place where I could conscientiously dump carefully separated paper , plastic and glass .
Unhappy I was to find the " glass and plastic " - skip is never emptied .
It just stands there , full .
And has been for the past four months ..

The White House said it would launch a search for new tax revenues , as Congressional leaders moved to scale back proposed spending increases and tax cuts in President Barack Obama 's ambitious budget .
The Obama administration plans to create a task force to consider elimination of corporate loopholes and subsidies , tougher enforcement against tax avoidance , and tax simplification , White House Budget Director Peter Orszag said late Tuesday .

LEIPZIG , Germany , April 1 ( UPI ) --
A team of German , Russian , Austrian and South African scientists says the Earth 's largest mass land extinction might have been caused by giant salt lakes .
The scientists posit such lakes might have produced halogenated gases emissions , changing the planets atmospheric composition so dramatically that vegetation was irretrievably damaged .

Approximately 250 million years ago about 90 percent of the planet 's animal and plant species ashore became extinct , the researchers said .
Several theories have been offered as to what caused those extinctions , including volcanic eruptions , the impacts of asteroids or methane hydrate .
The scientists ' new theory is based on a comparison of today 's biochemical and atmospheric chemical processes .
" Our calculations show that airborne pollutants from giant salt lakes like the Zechstein Sea must have had catastrophic effects at that time " , said study co-author Ludwig Weibflog of Germany 's Helmholtz - Center for Environmental Research .
" The question as to whether the halogenated gases from the giant salt lakes alone were responsible for it or whether it was a combination of various factors with volcanic eruptions , the impact of asteroids or methane hydrate equally playing their role still remains unanswered , " said Weibflog , who added , however , the effects of salt seas were previously underestimated .
The study led by Weibflog and Karsten Kotte of the University of Heidelberg appears in the Proceedings of the Russian Academy of Sciences .
Raikkonen has had a hugely disappointing start to the season Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen says he cannot match the speed of early season pace - setters Brawn GP and Red Bull and does not see that changing any time soon .
Ferrari have failed to score any points in the first three Grands Prix , their worst start since 1981 , and lie last in the F1 constructors ' championship .
" We are probably one second behind the Brawn and Red Bull cars , " he said .
" To catch them up it 's not easy because everyone is going forward also .
It 's hard to catch up completely . "
Between them , former world champion Raikkonen and team - mate Felipe Massa have managed only three finishes in the first three races of the year , the best performance being Massa 's ninth - place finish in Malaysia .
606 : DEBATE Raikkonen 's comments about the time gap are borne out by the statistics from qualifying at the last race in China .
The fuel - adjusted times showed Raikkonen , who qualified eighth fastest , was 1.096 seconds adrift of fourth - placed Rubens Barrichello in a Brawn car .
On fuel - adjusted times Barrichello was actually quicker than pole sitter Sebastian Vettel in his Red Bull .
Raikkonen said he expected Ferrari 's fortunes to improve when the championship moved to Europe .
The first European Grand Prix of the year takes place at Barcelona on 10 May but before then there is one more race outside Europe , in Bahrain , where Massa has won for the past two years .
" The start of the season is not what we wanted but we do n't have the speed right now , " said Raikkonen .
Kubica ( left ) and Raikkonen ( right ) have struggled so far this season " We will get some new parts at the next race but this race will be difficult again .
Hopefully testing here [ over the winter ] helps a bit and this track could be better for us but we will wait and see . "
Raikkonen admits Ferrari are " not in a position to fight " the early pace - setters and " have to make the best of what we can " , but he denied feeling under any extra pressure because of his poor start to the season .
" For sure , I need to score points but I do n't feel under any pressure , " he said .
" We are all one team , we all feel not happy when we have bad races .
But we will do the best that we can here and hopefully we will get some points . "
BMW Sauber 's Robert Kubica finished third in Bahrain last year , having taken pole .
Formula 1 is difficult to predict but today 's situation is completely different to last year
Robert Kubica Like Raikkonen he is awaiting his first points of the season , and he echoed many of the Finn 's sentiments .
" I think the gap [ to Brawn and the Red Bulls ] is very similar , as Kimi mentioned , " said Kubica , who will race for the first time in Sunday 's GP with the new energy storage and power boost system ( Kers ) .
" We are waiting for our Barcelona package which will probably be a big step forward but everyone is expecting to move forward in Barcelona with their aero packages , so we will just have to wait and see where we are .
" Formula 1 is difficult to predict but today 's situation is completely different to last year .
" There are new teams that are very strong and old teams that are struggling , but this is the reality .
There is nothing to panic about .
" We have to keep working and improving and to keep calm - everyone is working to get the situation back on track as we would like it to be .
The situation is not ideal but we have to move forward step by step and try and catch the frontrunners . "
Meanwhile , F1 championship leader Jenson Button predicted the desert heat will make Brawn hard to beat in Sunday 's race after Red Bull triumphed in a wet China GP last weekend .
" It 's going to be very hot , very different to most circuits and the tyre temperatures are going to be high , " said Button .
" What we suffered in China with the tyre temperatures , hopefully we will have the opposite here . "
And Button believes Toyota and Red Bull are likely to be the biggest threat to Brawn on Sunday .
" Those are the two teams we 'll be looking out for most , " added Button .
" Flavio Briatore says Renault are going to be up there as well ... they might be , I do n't know . "

This is a guest article by Wallace Thomas , an NMA member .
Miles per gallon seems like it ’s easy enough to understand , but it ’s not .
Let give you a hypothetical situation :
Let ’s say that my wife and I have two vehicles , the first , is one of those high performance 4wd SUVs that goes like stink , can tow my trailers , but the way we use it , it ’s averaging 10 MPG per year of use .
The second is a pretty cool sports car .
It ’s real fun to drive , handles well , and the way we use it , it ’s averaging 25 MPG per year of use .
Now , just to make my point , we ’ll say that both cost about the same .
Both are driven the same amount of miles per year — we ’ll say 15,000 , and both are the same year — 2005 .
Now , we realized that replacing two cars at the same time gets quite expensive , so since they both are now 4 years old , we ’ve decided we ’ll replace one now , the other in 4 more years .
This way , we can cycle through , getting one new vehicle every 4 years , keeping each for 8 years and 120,000 miles .
So now we ’re looking at two vehicles to decide which to replace .
The proposed replacement for the SUV is an extended cab pick - up .
We still need the ability to tow ( what with the waverunners , the Harley — there a joke hidden here — and the camping trailer ) , still need passenger room , but are considering a little more utility , and a little less sport .
The pick - up we ’re looking at , with the way we use it , would average 12.5 MPG for a year of use .
That ’s a whole 2.5 MPG improvement .
Woo - hoo .
The sports car replacement would be a sports coupe .
Seating for 4 , still fun to drive , and the way we use it , it would return around 33.3 MPG for a year of use .
That ’s an 8.3 MPG improvement — over an already decent MPG .
Pretty good , huh ?
So , which one will save us more money in fuel ?
Well , with a 2.5 MPH improvement versus an 8.3 MPG improvement , it pretty obvious .
So the SUV goes , and in comes the pick - up with it ’s 12.5 MPG .
Huh ?
What about the 5.8 MPG better we would do with the Coupe ?
That ’s the big problem .
In Europe , they use a different rating system .
It ’s Liters used per 100 Kilometers .
What if we converted to Gallons used per 100 miles ?
We could call it GPHM ( Gallons Per Hundred Miles ! )
So here ’s the story .
The old SUV at 10 MPG is using 10 GPHM .
The new pickup , at 12.5 MPG is using 8 GPHM , an improvement of two gallons for every 100 miles driven .
In 15,000 miles of use per year , that ’s 300 gallons not purchased .
The old sports car used 25 MPG .
That ’s 4 GPHM .
The new one , at 33.33 MPG is using 3 GPHM .
an improvement of one gallon for every 100 miles driven .
In 15,000 miles of use per year , that 150 gallons not purchased .
An improvement of 8.3 MPG saved one half the money and fuel that the improvement of only 2.5 MPG did !
But people do n’t think that way .
They see the bigger MPG improvement and assume they ’ll save more money .
To get the same fuel savings as the truck , the sports car would have to be replaced with a car that gets 50 MPG throughout the year !
How many sporty coupes are there around that do that ?
Now consider this :
If you already were getting 33.33 MPG , you would need to get 100 MPG to get the same fuel saving !
So , what I ’m putting out there for your mull around is that we should SERIOUSLY look at how we measure and compare fuel use .
I ’m including a very simple chart to compare MPG to GPHM .
Look and see , if you were to change from a 10 MPG vehicle to a 20 MPG vehicle , you would save more fuel – and money ( 5 GPHM savings ) than switching from a 20 MPG vehicle to a 100 MPG vehicle ( 4 GPHM savings ) !
As I said in the beginning , we ’re being suckered by miles per gallon ratings .
10 mpg = 10 GPHM
11.11 mpg = 9 GPHM
12.5 mpg = 8 GPHM
14.28 mpg = 7 GPHM
16.66 mpg = 6 GPHM
20 mpg = 5 GPHM
25 mpg = 4 GPHM
33.33 mpg = 3 GPHM
50 mpg = 2 GPHM
100 MPG = 1 GPHM
I know there are the master Super Mario Brothers players out there who are familiar with every single warp zone of the game , but many are probably not familiar with the warp zone sock … which brings you straight to Geeky Heaven .
What a beautiful looking Geek gadget the warp zone sock is .
Not only does it let you wear a Super Mario accessory throughout the day , but some geeks can even imagine they have their feet in another world … ready to roll out .
I can see people fall so in love with these socks that instead of complaining they can’t find the warp zone in the game , they would scream at their loved ones saying their Mario socks are missing .
For only $ 12 , they are a true warp to geekiness .

1. Valerie / Valerie ’s Family : The Hogans / The Hogan Family ( 1986-91 )
A long - term relationship with a TV show can be like a long relationship with any public institution .
Sometimes the shows adapt to the needs of their patrons , evolving in tone , style , and purpose over time .
Sometimes there ’s turnover in personnel .
And sometimes even the name changes .
Rhoda star Valerie Harper returned to TV in 1986 with the sitcom Valerie , playing a working mother trying to balance the demands of her job and the rambunctiousness of three growing boys , including a teenage Jason Bateman .
The show was often issue - driven , discussing teen sex , condom use , drunk driving , and AIDS .
Then Harper quarreled with her producers , presuming ( wrongly , as it turns out ) that a show called Valerie could n’t afford to lose its star .
The next season , Valerie became Valerie ’s Family : The Hogans ( and later just The Hogan Family ) , and Harper ’s character was killed off and replaced by her sister - in - law , played by Sandy Duncan .
The topical subject matter gradually faded too , and the show became more about everyone in the household — including a crochety old grandpa added during thefinal season — trying to find romance .
Before it was cancelled for good , the show even jumped from NBC to CBS .
Anyone who stuck with it through all that was devoted .
( But to what ? )
2. Good Morning , Miss Bliss / Saved By The Bell ( 1988 - 93 )
The longtime Saturday - morning ( and now nearly every weekday morning ) mainstay Saved By The Bell was originally a Disney Channel show called Good Morning , Miss Bliss : an apt title , considering the show ’s original focus was on a harried , good - natured history teacher at an Indianapolis junior high .
Cancelled after one season , the renamed series was picked up by NBC , which changed the title , moved the setting to Bayside High in California , and shifted the spotlight to a charismatic blond scamp named Zack Morris ( plated by Mark - Paul Gosselaar ) , who could , on occasion , literally stop time .
The show went on to run for four more seasons , eventually spawning two spin - offs ( Saved By The Bell : The College Years and Saved By The Bell : The New Class ) , one disconcertingly beefcakey Extra correspondent ( Mario López ) , and one Showgirl ( Elizabeth Berkley ) .
Today , Saved By The Bell is virtually unavoidable in syndication — turn on your TV during any given weekday , at almost any given time , and you can find an episode .
Good Morning , Miss Bliss episodes are often aired as Saved By The Bell episodes , with a little intro from Zack Morris explaining that crazy things often went on even when he was in junior high .
The fact that he apparently moved to California with two of his friends from Indianapolis ( Lark Voorhies and Dustin Diamond ) and his junior - high principal ( Dennis Haskins ) is one of those “ crazy things ” that ’s never addressed or explained .
3. Charles In Charge ( 1984 - 87 )
In season one of the groundbreaking “ manny ” sitcom Charles In Charge , college student / live - in babysitter Scott Baio was “ in charge ” of the Pembroke children : superficial older sister Lila , nerdy middle son Douglas , and troublemaking youngest son Jason .
By season two , however , Charles In Charge had moved from CBS to syndication , and the Pembrokes had mysteriously moved to Seattle , sub- leasing their house ( and evidently Baio ’s manny services ) to the Powells .
Taking care of the Powell children — superficial older sister Jamie , nerdy middle sister Sarah , and troublemaking youngest son Adam — was n’t much of a stretch for Baio , considering their considerable similarities to the Pembroke kids .
By season two , the theme song should have been “ The new boy in the neighborhood / lives downstairs and it ’s understood / he ’s there just to take good care of whomever ’s there . ”
4. The Doris Day Show ( 1968 - 73 )
Few mutant TV series changed as frequently or as radically as The Doris Day Show , which began in 1968 as a sitcom about an urbane , widowed mother of two trying to make a go of it back at her family ’s Northern California ranch .
At the start of season two , while still living on the ranch , Day ’s character began driving into San Francisco to work as a secretary at a hip magazine .
For season three , she and her kids moved to the city ( above an Italian restaurant ) , and Day became a part - time journalist .
And in the show ’s final two seasons , the emphasis was on Day as a single career gal trying to find romance .
Kids ?
What kids ?
Ranch ?
What ranch ?
5 . The Daily Show ( 1996 - present )
When Lizz Winstead co-created The Daily Show in the mid-’90s , she envisioned a program driven by politics rather than just personality .
But due to forces beyond Winstead ’s control , The Daily Show debuted in 1996 as a showcase for the snarky “ charm ” of former ESPN anchor Craig Kilborn , whose smug mean - spiritedness permeated the show ’s often cruel , overwhelmingly “ Craig - centric ” sense of humor .
Kilborn and Winstead famously clashed about the direction of The Daily Show behind the scenes , and the conflict spilled over into the pages of Esquire , where Kilborn referred to his executive producer as an “ emotional bitch . ”
Winstead was long gone by the time Jon Stewart stepped in in 1998 , but he eventually made The Daily Show what she wanted it to be all along : a hilarious , thought - provoking reaction to the news and how it ’s covered .

6. The Avengers ( 1961 - 69 )
Although most audiences , especially in America , remember The Avengers for the suave super - spy antics of Patrick Macnee ’s John Steed and a succession of kinky - booted female sidekicks , the show started out as more of a straightforward detective drama , and Macnee was n’t even the main character .
That honor went to Ian Hendry , playing a medical doctor who got into crime - fighting to , well , avenge his fiancée ’s death at the hands of a drug gang .
Women were peripheral characters on the show ( which had nary a hint of international espionage ) , and most of the action focused on the often - combative relationship between Hendry and Macnee , his partner .
However , the combination of a show retooling , a television strike , and the sudden popularity of the James Bond movies completely revamped The Avengers .
By 1962 , Honor Blackman had been added as Macnee ’s new sexy doctor partner Cathy Gale ( to the delight of fans across Britain ) , and The Avengers quickly dumped the dueling - detectives angle and became all about small - screen super - spies .
Macnee became more Bond - like , Blackman was replaced by bombshell Diana Rigg as Emma Peel , and the ratings went up and up .
7. The Man From U.N.C.L.E. ( 1964 -68 )
The Man From U.N.C.L.E.’s first season offered spry , sophisticated spy stories shot in crisp black and white .
When the show switched to color in season two , the producers began to make the villains cartoonier , and the move toward the ridiculous continued up to the abbreviated season four , when U.N.C.L.E. made a belated stab at restoring some sobriety .
Though arguably responsible for popularizing the TV spy craze in America , The Man From U.N.C.L.E. fell victim to the genre ’s runaway success , and scrambled to keep up with the rapid evolution of TV adventure series into camp and beyond .
8. Mannix ( 1967 - 75 )
The quintessential private - eye show began with Mike Connors ’ fiercely independent gumshoe working for somebody else .
For Mannix ’s first 26 episodes , Connors clocked in at a state - of - the - art detective agency , where he was the guy to call when the super - computers could n’t get the job done .
For season two , Connors hired a secretary ( Gail Fisher ’s iconic Peggy Fair ) , hung out his own shingle , and Mannix became the show everyone remembers : a stylish tribute to breaking and entering , getting beaten up , and going the extra mile to uncover some malfeasance that others would ’ve missed .
9. Wonder Woman ( 1975 - 79 )
The first - season Wonder Woman is pretty high - concept , as far as ’70s superhero TV shows go .
Instead of following Bill Bixby ’s wanderings from back lot to back lot , or watching Nicholas Hammond run aground gangsters in the big city , Wonder Woman gave the world Lynda Carter vs. the Nazis , settling the Amazonian princess in Washington , D.C. near the tail end of World War II .
Wonder Woman and her buttoned - down alter ego Diana Prince , along with Lyle Waggoner as stalwart Steve Trevor , fought against a seemingly endless series of guest stars working for the Third Reich , including Red Buttons , John Saxon , and Robert Loggia .
The series proved popular , but when ABC stalled on negotiations for a second season , the show moved to CBS , which had only one request :
Make it modern .
The writers maintained continuity by having Wonder Woman bounce back to Paradise Island for a few decades , while Waggoner ’s Steve Trevor was replaced by Waggoner ’s Steve Trevor , Jr. , who happened to look exactlylike his dad .
The Nazis were long gone , but in their place , Carter fought something like actual supervillains , including Martin Mull as a rock - star Pied Piper flutist .
The CBS version ran two seasons , and the final filmed episode promised even more changes : dropping Trevor completely , moving the remaining cast to L.A. , and throwing in an indestructible chimpanzee .
But it was n’t meant to be , and the series ended in 1979 .
10 . Dark Shadows ( 1966 - 71 )
Dark Shadows was never exactly a normal soap opera , but the gothic - tinged daytime drama did cling more or less to the genre ’s standard conventions — dressed up with extra gloom — for its first few months .
By the end of 1966 , the strange goings - on at the Collinwood Estate and the adjoining town of Collinsport had turned paranormal , with the appearance of ghosts and ancient Egyptian death - cults .
But it was n’t until the following year , when the show introduced Jonathan Frid as the immortal vampire Barnabas Collins , that the show really went nuts — and not coincidentally , became a runaway hit .
Collins quickly became the show ’s main character , and Dark Shadows went ever more deranged , with parallel realities , Cthulhu cults , werewolves , and time travel all making it far and away the weirdest soap in history — at least until Passions showed up .

11 . Family Matters ( 1989 - 98 )
A spin-off of Perfect Strangers , Family Matters began as a fairly formulaic sitcom about a black middle - class Chicago family , airing as part of the wholesome ABC “ TGIF ” lineup .
Within a year , the show introduced next - door - neighbor / über - nerd - novelty - character Steve Urkel , a shark the program wasted no time jumping .
Alas , the gimmick of Urkel ’s obnoxious pestering could only be sustained for so long , so producers eventually tossed the family - life themes , ramped up Urkel ’s brainiac cluelessness , and morphed the show into a sort of ongoing Absent - Minded / Nutty Professor clone by introducing Steve Urkel ’s suave - but - menacing alter ego Stefan Urquelle , the UrkBot ( an intelligent android that becomes a police officer ) , the UrkPad ( a teleportation device ) , a time - travel invention , a weight - reducing machine , and a cloning machine .
Appropriately , in the show ’s final episode , Urkel heads off into outer space to test an anti-gravity contraption .
12 . The Joey Bishop Show ( 1961 - 65 )
In 1961 , Rat Pack favorite Joey Bishop starred in a sitcom as the harried assistant to a big - shot L.A. press agent .
The show was balanced between inside - showbiz jokes and material about Bishop ’s extended family , who kept trying to use his connections to meet celebrities .
By the end of the first season , the family bits became less prevalent , and for the second season ( now in color ) , The Joey Bishop Show underwent a full - scale reboot .
Bishop ’s character ( whose name did n’t change ) now lived in New York , and was a late - night talk - show host with a pretty wife who did n’t fully understand his jetsetting lifestyle .
The Joey Bishop Show 2.0 became a minor classic .
The first version is all but forgotten .
13 . Newhart ( 1982-90 )
Grammy and Peabody Award - winning comedian Bob Newhart returned to TV in 1982 with Newhart , playing a how - to book author who convinces his wife ( Mary Frann ) to help him run a small country inn in a Vermont town populated by guileless eccentrics .
In the first season — shot on videotape — Newhart and Frann mainly deal with passive - aggressive guests , deceptively friendly townsfolk , a pathological - liar neighbor , and a handyman with the temperament of a pouting 10 - year - old .
From season two onward , Newhart was shot on film and played more for farce .
Julia Duffy and Peter Scolari joined the cast as clueless yuppies , the show ratcheted up the appearances of William Sanderson as philosophical hick Larry , and even Newhart became less of a straight man and more of a loony in his own way .
Newhart was a good show from the start , but it evolved into something unlike anything else on TV at the time .
14 . These Friends Of Mine / Ellen ( 1994 -98 )
In the wake of Seinfeld , Home Improvement , and Roseanne , networks began snapping up high - profile stand - up comics and trying to build shows around them .
The chipper , fumbly Ellen DeGeneres was a natural fit on TV — like a cross between Lucille Ball and Mary Tyler Moore — but ABC ’s first attempt at a DeGeneres vehicle sputtered .
These Friends Of Mine cast DeGeneres as a Los Angeles bookstore manager who , along with her generic TV pals , swapped stories about their various romantic misadventures .
In season two , the show ’s name was changed to Ellen , half of her “ friends ” disappeared , and after a curt resolution to a lingering subplot about DeGeneres ’ crush on her roommate Arye Gross , the “ Ellen goes on bad dates ” stories also faded .
Then in 1997 , Ellen underwent its biggest change , as DeGeneres ’ character finally acknowledged what the actress herself had recently revealed : that she was gay .
The final season of Ellen returned to a little of the romantic comedy of season one , though mostly it became about how Ellen ’s family and second wave of friends reacted to her new lifestyle .
15 . Love , Sidney ( 1981 - 83 )
The intentions were good .
NBC tried to cast Tony Randall in the first TV series with an openly gay leading character , but after testing the waters with a TV movie — a strange kind of pilot for a half - hour sitcom — the network reduced Love , Sidney ’s gay content to strictly between the lines .
Randall still played a fastidious single man living platonically with a wayward actress and her daughter , and he still showed little to no interest in the predatory wife of his building ’s superintendent .
But aside from one brief glimpse at a picture of a man after Randall referred to his one passionate romance , Love , Sidney kept its hero ’s sexuality an open secret .
Meanwhile , the show itself experienced a turnover in its supporting cast between its two seasons , and changed its tone from “ Neil Simon witty ” to “ Diff ’rent Strokes meaningful . ”
( Which means that in its own way , to put it in junior - high terms , Love , Sidney did become totally gay . )

16 . The John Larroquette Show ( 1993 - 96 )
Television producer Don Reo was coming off a big success with Blossom in 1992 , and actor John Larroquette had been a breakout success on Night Court , so the timing seemed perfect for the two to try something different together .
And that ’s exactly what The John Larroquette Show was — for its first season .
Reo gave free rein to the darker , more intellectual side of his humor , and Larroquette sank his teeth into the role of a recovering drunk who could only get employment as the night manager of a ratty St. Louis bus terminal .
The show was rife with literate jokes , drug references , sexual innuendo , and extremely black humor , and it was a critical success .
But its ratings were mediocre , so NBC executives ordered a major retooling .
By season two , Larroquette ’s character had become more likeable , and no longer lived in a dingy , creepy apartment .
( His transvestite hooker friend also all but vanished . )
The bus station was made to look less dire and sleazy , and even the theme music was brightened up .
The John Laroquette Show dragged on for another year , but it was never as good again .
17 . Homicide : Life On The Streets ( 1993 -2000 )
Fans of NBC ’s gritty Baltimore cop show Homicide — which blazed the trails followed by The Wire and The Shield — learned to live with the compromises required to keep the series on the air for seven years .
Though Homicide remained quality TV all the way up to its feature - length finale , it gradually evolved from the wry , very dark depiction of the existential crises of police detectives that dominated its early episodes , and became more conventionally melodramatic , with big shootouts and confrontations .
Homicide ’s wit and melancholy held constant , but under pressure from NBC , sensationalism often took precedence over poignancy .
18 . Happy Days ( 1974 - 84 )
Happy Days was famously conceived as a nostalgic coming - of - age comedy about clean - cut , whitebread teen Ron Howard learning life lessons alongside chums Anson Williams and Donnie Most .
Then came the Fonz .
Henry Winkler ’s loveable , defanged greaser character became such a fan favorite — and his trademark catchphrases grew so ubiquitous — that the balance of the show tilted unmistakably and permanently in his favor .
After Howard left the show to pursue a filmmaking career that never went anywhere , Winkler became the star of Happy Days , even receiving top billing in Howard ’s absence .
This same dynamic played out around the same time with Good Times , which evolved ( or devolved ) from a Norman Lear social - issues comedy about a struggling black family to a showcase for the mugging and catchphrases of breakout star Jimmie “ J.J ” Walker .
The best - laid plans of television people are no match for the public ’s lusty embrace of a breakout character .
19 . The Facts Of Life ( 1979 - 88 )
Itself a spore - like outgrowth of Diff ’rent Strokes , the original version of The Facts Of Life followed the Drummonds ’ housekeeper Edna Garrett ( Charlotte Rae ) as she became the den mother to a batch of socioeconomically diverse students at Kimberly Drummond ’s all - girls private school .
But as early as the second season , major retooling was already underway : Mrs. Garrett was suddenly the campus dietitian , and much of the original cast had been jettisoned — including a still - unknown Molly Ringwald , and major characters like John Lawlor ’s headmaster — in favorof focusing on spoiled rich girl Blair ( Lisa Whelchel ) , sarcastic chubby girl Natalie ( Mindy Cohn ) , and gossipy token black girl Tootie ( Kim Fields ) , with Jo ( Nancy McKeon ) brought in as Blair ’s “ streetwise ” foil .
This was only the beginning of the show ’s many , many permutations .
Over the years , NBC went to great lengths to revive flagging interest in the show , beginning with putting the now - graduated girls to work in Mrs.
Garrett ’s bakery .
When that grew stale , Edna ’s Edibles was burned to the ground and replaced by the Spencer ’s Gifts - like shop Over Our Heads , which doubled as a mullet - breeding ground for hunky new support star George Clooney .
By 1986 , however , even Rae was tired of the desperate measures , and she abandoned the sinking ship , so producers brought in Mrs. Garrett ’s never - before - seen sister Beverly Ann ( Cloris Leachman ) to mind the store .
Almost immediately , Beverly adopted loveable orphan Mackenzie Astin and an Australian exchange student , but even an infusion of cute , troubled moppets could n’t save the show .
After several detours into fantasy episodes based on The Golden Girls and The Twilight Zone ( shades of Roseanne ’s final season ) , The Facts Of Life gamely tried to bring everything full circle by staging a first - season “ class reunion , ” meant to launch its own spin - off where Blair would become the Mrs. Garrett to a group of new students ( played by Seth Green , Mayim Bialik , and Juliette Lewis ) .
By then , the show had been born again more times than Whelchel , and was all but unrecognizable .
20 . The L Word ( 2004 -09 )
The L Word began as a lesbian soap opera , following the lives and loves of a group of ( mostly ) lesbian friends in Los Angeles .
In season two , the show ramped up the ridiculousness to include an absurd plotline about a male roommate who planted hidden cameras throughout the home he shared with Jenny ( Mia Kirshner ) and Shane ( Katherine Moennig ) , leading Jenny to experience several repressed memories of sexual abuse at a carnival , apparently by klezmer musicians .
By season three , the show bore almost no resemblance to reality — even soap - opera reality — and in seasons four and five , the show seemed to embrace its ridiculousness and turn into farce .
In season six , the show ’s writers decided to take a stab at another genre — why not ?— by introducing a murder - mystery , although the L Word version was , naturally , high - camp .
But The L Word is n’t just a mutant television series :
Several of the characters are mutants as well , changing personalities from season to season or episode to episode .
Alice Pieszecki ( Leisha Hailey ) is an out - and - proud bisexual in season one , but her sexuality has completely disappeared by season two , with no explanation or revelation .
In season two , Helena Peabody ( Rachel Shelley ) is introduced as a ruthless , manipulative , cold - hearted outsider whose only goal is to make Bette Porter ’s ( Jennifer Beals ) life hell .
By season three , she ’s generous , kind - hearted , and good friends with all of Bette ’s friends .
Continuity is definitely not an “ L word . ”
Why Is Her Paycheck Smaller ?
Nearly every occupation has the gap — the seemingly unbridgeable chasm between the size of the paycheck brought home by a woman and the larger one earned by a man doing the same job .
Economists cite a few reasons : discrimination as well as personal choices within occupations are two major factors , and part of the gap can be attributed to men having more years of experience and logging more hours .
Deflation properly defined is a net decrease in the money supply and credit , with credit being marked to market .
Deflation by that measure went global long ago .
This post however , is in reference to sustained price drops widely ( and incorrectly ) referred to as deflation .
Japan wholesale prices log fastest drop since 2002
In Japan wholesale prices log fastest drop since 2002 .
Japanese wholesale prices fell at their fastest annual pace in nearly seven years last month , official data showed Monday , adding to worries about the renewed threat of deflation .
Corporate goods prices fell by 2.2 percent in March from a year earlier , down for a third straight month , the Bank of Japan reported .
It was the steepest year - on - year drop since May 2002 and followed declines of 1.6 percent in February and 0.7 percent in January .
" Companies are in tough competition to cut prices due to weak consumer sentiment , " said Hideyuki Araki , economist at the Resona Research Institute .
" Consumers are now worried about their jobs or pay cuts .
It 's natural that they want cheaper goods , " he said .
German wholesale prices see record decline in 22 years
Wholesale prices in Germany dropped 8.0 percent in March compared with the same month last year , the biggest year - on - year decline since January 1987 , the German Federal Statistical Office said Wednesday .
Compared to February , however , wholesale prices declined 0.9 percent , said the Wiesbaden - based statistics office .
Crude oil prices have retreated 66 percent from a record 147 U.S. dollars per barrel in July 2008 .
As a result , solid fuels and petroleum products were 21.4 percent cheaper in March than a year earlier , the statistical office said .
Prices of grain , seeds and feed declined 42.6 percent in the past 12 months .
Statistics show that Germany 's inflation has fallen to its lowest level in almost 10 years , as the global financial crisis has dragged the European Union 's biggest economy into its worst recession since World War II .
European Central Bank ( ECB ) council member Athanasios Orphanides told local media a day earlier that the risk of deflation may push further monetary easing .
Chinese CPI , PPI Negative
US CPI In First Year - Over - Year Decline Since 1955
The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ( CPI - U ) increased 0.2 percent in March , before seasonal adjustment , the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today .
The index has decreased 0.4 percent over the last year , the first 12 month decline since August 1955 .
On a seasonally adjusted basis , the CPI - U decreased 0.1 percent in March after rising 0.4 percent in February .
The decrease was due to a downturn in the energy index , which declined 3.0 percent in March after rising 3.3 percent the previous month .
All the energy indexes decreased , particularly the indexes for fuel oil ,
natural gas , and motor fuel .
The food index declined 0.1 percent for the second straight month to virtually the same level as October 2008 .
The food at home index declined 0.4 percent , the second straight such decrease , as the index for dairy and related products continued to decline .

Notes from David Rosenberg at Merrill Lynch
Spare Capacity
" There seems to be a lot of market chatter today about how the dramatic fiscal and monetary stimulus is going to reignite inflation .
Let 's get a grip .
We have a real unemployment rate of nearly 16 % and a capacity utilization rate that looks about to decline to 65 % .
There is simply too much spare capacity to absorb to be concerned about what the government is going to do except prevent an outright deflationary environment from taking hold . "
Deflation in headline to intensify going forward
" Relative to year - ago levels , overall [ Consumer ] prices fell by 0.4 % , for the first dip into deflationary territory since August 1955 .
Looking ahead , easy energy comparisons versus a year - ago will be a key factor in leading the overall CPI lower in the months ahead .
Food prices , eased to 4.4 % Y/Y versus a peak of 6.1 % Y/Y in October 2008 , will also be a factor .
By 3Q , we anticipate annual declines of 2.5 % .
Core prices were unchanged at 1.8 % Y/Y in March , though down from the nearby peak of 2.5 % in August 2008 .
By 3Q , the core CPI is also expected to ease toward 1.0 % , with depressed demand and more competitive pricing for a broad array of consumer categories as tailwinds .
Underlying weakness in core CPI
" Owners ’ equivalent rent – a category that accounts for 31 % of the core CPI ) – rose 0.2 % M/M , in part due to falling natural gas prices , which have an inverse relationship to rent prices . "

Bernanke 's Deflation Preventing Scorecard
Lessons From History
The Smoot - Hawley Tariff
Act was signed into law on June 17 , 1930 , and raised U.S. tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods to record levels , and , in the opinion of most economists , worsened the Great Depression .
Many countries retaliated , and American exports and imports plunged by more than half .
The tariff was replaced by lower bilateral agreements in the mid 1930s .
Six million piglets and 220,000 pregnant cows were slaughtered in the AAA 's effort to raise livestock prices .
Many cotton farmers plowed under a quarter of their crop in accordance with the AAA 's plans .
The tax underwriting the AAA was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the case United States v. Butler , because , among other stated reasons , it taxed one farmer in order to pay another .
Farm leaders supported the Butler decision .
The Geithner - Obama - Bernanke policy track trifecta the US is on takes scarce resources ( taxpayer dollars ) and wastes them on the very banks and lending institutions that exacerbated the problem with foolish lending practices .
This extremely poor policy decision is the modern day equivalent of Roosevelt 's illegal Agricultural Adjustment Act .
The big difference is the massive size and scale of the plan .

PARIS --
When French foes of capitalism want to mount an effective protest , they phone Xavier Renou .
As one of France 's top protest consultants , Mr. Renou teaches activists how to chain themselves to trees , damage genetically modified crops and withstand police interrogations .
These days , his phone is ringing off the hook , as the tumult in the global financial system has led to a boom in protests .
Despite ...
The French certainly have a flair for the dramatic , what with the recent kidnapping of bosses and the near - constant succession of transport and farmers ' strikes .
Even last night 's " graduated response " vote featured its share of parliamentary theatrics , as the controversial Cr�ation et Internet law went down to a shocking 21 - 15 defeat .
That 's right — " three strikes " has struck out in France .
At least for now .
A model for the world
According to French daily Lib�ration , the surprising vote came after the Senate and the National Assembly worked out the differences between their versions of the bill , which would set up a state agency called HADOPI to enforce warnings and Internet disconnections against repeat file - swappers .
Both houses had already passed the bill , and all that remained was for them each to ratify the final text that came out of the conference committee .
The Senate passed its version , and things looked set to move ahead in the National Assembly , when the supernatural made its presence felt .
" All�luia !
C’est un miracle parlementaire ! " said Socialist MP Christian Paul about the vote , which turned down the bill 21 - 15 .
Why so few votes for such a major piece of legislation ?
Apparently , the government ( which backed the law ) thought it had its votes in the bag .
Culture Minister Christine Albanel , now fuming about the loss , describes the vote as a " trap " and a " pathetic commedia dell ' arte " mounted by the opposition .
According to Albanel 's people , as the vote came up , 15 Socialists were hanging about in the hallway , charging in at the last minute to cast their votes and defeat the law .
It 's a bizarre turn of events for what has become one of France 's signature bits of legislation , the sort of thing routinely held up as a model for the world to follow by music and movie industry representatives .
This is n't the example they hoped to set , however .
Albanel apparently plans to bring the bill back on April 27 , but it will face a new round of debate and scheduling difficulties .
Paul argues that the bill is dead .
La Quadrature du Net , which has long opposed the plan , was ecstatic .
" This is a formidable victory for all citizens , " said J�r�mie Zimmermann , one of the group 's cofounders .
" This vote shows that it is still possible to make oneself heard .
It is a fantastic example of how to use the Net to fight against those who are trying to control it .
Individual liberties , in the end , have not been sacrificed to try to preserve the corporate interests of some obsolete industries .
The HADOPI law has been interred earlier than expected . "
IFPI , the global music trade group , holds out hope that the law can still be passed on resubmission .
" It is disappointing that the law was not confirmed today , " said IFPI boss John Kennedy in a statement sent to Ars , " but we understand that the French Government will be resubmitting the law very shortly .
President Sarkozy has been a true champion of intellectual property rights and the proposed law is an effective and proportionate way of tackling online copyright infringement and migrating users to the wide variety of legal music services in France . "
Senate bill 109 , the Missouri Non-Discrimination Act ( MONA ) will be coming to the floor for a vote shortly and our voices must be heard .
The new law if passed will update the human rights statute to include sexual orientation and gender identity / expression , address discrimination in housing , employment , and public accommodations .

Opinion
Will Obama restore constitutional government ?
While most of us have had our attention fixed on the global economic firestorm , President Obama is failing to meet his only sworn responsibility as our chief executive - to preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .
Americans understand that President George W. Bush defiled the Constitution with the Patriot Acts , military commissions , torture , extraordinary rendition and warrantless wiretapping .
Now , just weeks into the Obama era , we are seeing that little has changed in terms of extra-constitutional prosecution of the so - called war on terror .
So far , Obama has signed an order banning " harsh interrogation techniques " but may be keeping other reprehensible policies in place , and perhaps adding a few of his own .
President Obama issued an order to close the Guantanamo Bay prison as one of his first official acts .
He was duly praised for what seemed a reversal of the sad legacy of his predecessor .
Days later , however , the Christian Science Monitor reported that , in seeming contradiction to the Obama executive order closing Guantanamo , nearly three times as many prisoners are being held without due process at an enormous U.S. military prison in Bagram , Afghanistan .
Last month , U.S. District Judge John Bates gave the Obama administration until today to " refine " its position on " open- ended detention . "
Meanwhile , plans for detention at home are being expanded under Democratic Party leadership .
On Jan. 22 , Rep. Alcee Hastings , D - Fla. , a former judge who was impeached and removed from the bench before being elected to Congress , introduced HR645 , the National Emergency Centers Establishment Act .
This bill calls for the establishment of six centers on military installations across the United States .
Previous centers were for addressing an " emergency influx of immigrants " or to support " the rapid development of new programs . "
These new FEMA centers are " to provide temporary housing , medical and humanitarian assistance to individuals and families dislocated due to an emergency or major disaster . "
Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , is to date the sole member of Congress willing to raise a public stink .
" Apparently , the fusion centers , militarized police , surveillance cameras and a domestic military command is not enough , " blogged Rep. Paul .
" Even though we know that detention facilities are already in place , they now want to legalize the construction of FEMA camps on military installations using the ever popular excuse that the facilities are for the purposes of a national emergency .
With the phony debt - based economy getting worse and worse by the day , the possibility of civil unrest is becoming a greater threat to the establishment .
One need only look at Iceland , Greece and other nations for what might happen in the United States next . "
Why , asks Paul , are these centers being constructed on military bases if they 're not for the purpose of detaining large groups of people ?
Obama should explain what is going on .
Last fall , we learned who would be doing the rounding up when , for the first time since Reconstruction , U.S. troops were deployed within U.S. borders .
The Third Infantry Division 's 1st Combat Team , trained during multiple tours in Iraq , will " help with civil unrest and crowd control . "
According to Air Force Gen. Gene Renuart , commander of the U.S. Northern Command , at least two more brigades will be deployed by 2010 .
The doctrine of posse comitatus , under which U.S. troops shall not be used against U.S. citizens , prohibits detaining us .
Obama needs to explain why continuing this program is not a violation .
In his inaugural address , Obama " rejected as false the choice between our safety and our ideals . "
His actions in the first month of his presidency appear to belie his rhetoric .
The success of the Obama presidency will turn on the degree to which he can command the trust and respect of both the American people and the international community .
If he shortchanges his pledge to return the country to lawful and constitutional government , achieving his greater goals may become impossible .
Captain 's log : Leonard Nimoy , left , as Dr Spock and William Shatner , right , as Captain Kirk in the original TV series
To its detractors , Star Trek represents everything that 's wrong with science fiction .
A corny space soap opera with wonky sets and often wonkier acting .
Improbable technologies and implausible plots , held together with shaky gimmicks such as time travel , faster - than - light warp drives , bad jokes and teleport machines .
The story of Captain James Tiberius Kirk and his beloved starship , the U.S.S.
Enterprise , boldly going forth on a five - year mission to explore strange new worlds , is often derided , its fans dismissed as sad obsessives in need of a life .
But this impression is utterly wrong and those who dismiss Star Trek out of hand are usually people who have n't seen it .
In fact Star Trek - the original TV series first ran an extraordinary 43 years ago - was groundbreaking television , at its best a complex morality tale which broke numerous conventions and which was not afraid to tackle subjects contemporary drama shied away from .
When I first started watching Star Trek , in the early Seventies , its dark and adult themes went right over my head , but the gadgets and spooky aliens had me spellbound .
It is testament to the quality of the scripts that , like so many of my generation , I could carry on watching the programmes as an adult and still find them entertaining .
The ' rightness ' of the original idea , conceived in 1960 by Gene Roddenberry , is proven by the fact that Star Trek has turned out to be one of the most enduring franchises in television and movie history .
The original series ( which was not a hit at first ) begat numerous spin - offs and feature - length films .
Some of these have been successful ( notably the Next Generation series starring Patrick Stewart ) and some less so ( the odd - numbered movies were usually derided ) .
Now a new Star Trek film takes the idea back to the beginning , with a young Kirk gathering his crew and setting forth for the first time .
It has already garnered glowing reviews and is widely predicted to be one of the biggest hits of 2009 .
The question is , why , after almost half a century , is Star Trek still capable of inspiring so many ?
The secret of Star Trek , as with all good science fiction , is that the ' science ' and , especially , the technology form a backdrop to the real business in hand - plot and characterisation .
The original series provided stories of adventure , suspense and excitement running parallel with a series of morality tales .
Star Trek had ( unusually for sci- fi ) well - realised characters , from the hot - headed all - American super - hero Captain James T Kirk to the often angst - ridden Vulcan - human hybrid Mr Spock , whose psyche comprised a battleground between his impulsive , human ' emotional ' side and his cold , logical Vulcan inheritance .
We had a gruff engineer , Scotty , and ' Bones ' McCoy , an irascible medic whose loyalty to his friends often held the whole thing together .
Three - piece : From left , Leonard Nimoy as Dr Spock , William Shatner as Captain Kirk and James Doohan as Scotty show off their phaser guns Fringe benefits : Dr Spock , played by Leonard Nimoy , in the original TV series of Star Trek on the bridge of the Enterprise
Conceived at the height of the Cold War , Star Trek was set in a utopian future , the world of the 2200s when Earth 's petty national rivalries had been put aside for ever , the world united for the first time .
Although the world of Star Trek was robustly ' American ' in most respects , the bridge of the Enterprise was unusually multi-ethnic , with a Russian navigator ( Chekov ) , an Oriental navigator ( Sulu ) , an African woman ( Uhura ) as communications officer , that British engineer and , of course , a half - alien ( Spock ) .
In the captain 's seat : The Ponder The Mystery singer - best known as Captain James T. Kirk - will also direct and host a TV documentary about Star Trek : The Next Generation
It is perhaps hard now to understand just how groundbreaking this was .
In 1966 , when the series was first aired on American TV , race segregation laws were still on the statute books of 12 American states and non-white characters were rare or non-existent in TV drama .
Aboard the U.S.S Enterprise , it was very rarely remarked upon that Uhura was black , and that was remarkable in itself .
Beam us up : Scene from the 70s TV series starring DeForest Kelley as ' Bones ' McCoy and William Shatner as Captain Kirk
Even more remarkable was the fact that in a 1968 episode entitled Plato 's Stepchildren , she was kissed by her white captain , one of the first interracial kisses seen on American television and the source of some controversy in the Southern States .
Few of the Star Trek stories have dated .
The idea of a benevolent superpower , the United Federation of Planets , spreading peace and democracy through the Galaxy has strong resonances today .
The ' prime directive ' of Starfleet was that Kirk and his crew were not supposed to interfere in the lives of the aliens they encountered , even when those lives were blighted by war or dictatorship .
BUT this was a directive they usually ignored , often using overwhelming force if necessary .
The ethos of the Star Trek universe was deeply liberal - but it was liberal with a very hard edge .
As well as race , Star Trek was not afraid to tackle sexual politics .
Kirk , unmarried , was depicted as a womaniser , but he had an obvious respect for women unusual among fictional alpha-males .
And politics itself reared its ugly head many times .
In The City On The Edge Of Forever , Kirk and his landing party are time - transported to Thirties New York , where they threaten to alter history by preventing the death of a woman called Edith Keeler ( played by Joan Collins , no less ) .
Edith does indeed die , but if she had n't it is revealed that she would have led a pacifist movement that prevented the entry of the U.S. into the Second World War , hence ensuring a Nazi victory .
Some have interpreted this as a dig against the anti-war movement raging at the time in response to Vietnam .
Or it could be seen as making the clever philosophical point that sometimes evil will result from the very best of intentions .
Either way , this is not mindless space opera .
One theme not explored in the original series was homosexuality , although the general air of campness and philosophy of celebrating diversity ( and the sometimes ambiguous relationship between Spock and Kirk ) has won Star Trek many gay fans .
Star Trek was , at times , absurd .
The sets rarely passed muster and some of the ' science ' was risible .
And yet , at its best , it managed to combine the essence of the best Wild Western romances , Greek myth and legend , and classical literature .
Sure , there were ray guns and time machines , ' aliens ' who were nothing more than wobbly lights ( even cheaper than a man in a monster suit ) and planets apparently made of polystyrene .
Will the American cars of the future be powered by gasoline , biofuels , natural gas , or electricity ?
If the Set America Free Coalition has their way , the answer will be " all of the above . "
Here 's how Anne Korin , the group 's chair , sees it : American transportation is subject to a monopoly of oil , which gives OPEC the ability to paralyze a huge chunk of the American economy .
In order for the US to be truly independent , oil , she likes to say " needs to be stripped of its strategic value . "
But switching all cars to some other fuel source would just swap one monopoly for another .
Run all the cars on electricity , says Ms. Korin , and a single falling tree branch could cripple transportation for an entire region .
Run them all on biofuels , and a drought could send fuel prices soaring .
" You do n't want to go from 100 percent of one thing to 100 percent of another thing , " she told me at an energy conference in Washington , DC , Thursday .
" You want a system that 's resilient . "
The solution : an engine that runs on multiple energy sources , an " open fuel standard " platform that allows different fuels to compete with each other .
It 's a little like a computer , whose hardware was built without specifying in advance exactly what software can and cannot run on it .
Want to surf the Web with Firefox ?
Opera ?
Konqueror ?
Amaya ?
Flock ?
It 's up to you .
Your hardware does n't discriminate .
Such engines already exist in what are known as flex - fuel vehicles , which make up more than seven million of the roughly 250 million passenger cars and trucks on America 's roads .
In most cases the vehicles can run on any combination of gasoline and ethanol , a combustible fuel made from corn , sugar , and other plants .
But , as Korin tells me , many US drivers do n't even know that their fuel tanks will accept anything other than gasoline .
The difference between a flex - fuel car and a conventional car is minimal .
Ethanol and other biofuels tend to be more corrosive than conventional gasoline , so the fuel system requires some higher - quality parts .
According to Korin , using these parts in manufacturing adds $ 100 to the cost of the vehicle .
The Set America Free Coalition 's members , a relatively eclectic group that includes Tom Daschle , Gary Bauer , and former CIA director James James Woolsey , were among those who successfully got a bill introduced in Congress this summer .
Titled the Open Fuel Standard
Act , the bill would have mandated that , starting in 2012 , 50 percent of new US automobiles be able to operate with E85 ( a gasoline blend with 85 percent ethanol ) or M85 ( the same with methanol , a type of combustible fuel commonly made from methane gas ) , or be able to operate on biodiesel .
In 2015 , that figure would jump to 80 percent .
[ Editor 's note :
The original version misspelled Mr. Woolsey 's surname . ]
The bill died in committee , but its proponents plan to reintroduce it next year .
In 2007 , automakers said that they could meet the 2012 target if enough ethanol - blend fuel is available .
Other types of flex - fuel vehicles can run on a greater variety of fuels .
In Brazil , where flex - fuels make up almost a quarter of all cars , it 's common to see cars that can run on pure ethanol , ethanol or methanol blends , or on compressed natural gas .
What 's more , many of these cars are made by Ford and General Motors .
You can even bring electricity into the mix .
" Why not have a flex - fuel plugin hybrid ? " Korin asks .
She predicts that China 's recently announced plug - in hybrid , which costs just over half of what the Chevy Volt is expected to cost , will soon be configured to run on flex fuels .
Set America
Free estimates that such a vehicle , which would have an E85 - hybrid engine powered by a battery that plugs into a standard electrical outlet , could achieve efficiency of up to 500 miles per gallon of gasoline ( this does n't count the ethanol being burned ) .
Of course , biofuels have their critics , particularly in light of the global spike in food prices .
Does running vehicles on products made from corn and sugar force empty stomachs to compete with empty tanks ?
Korin does n't think so .
The food crisis , she says , is primarily caused by growing prosperity in the developing world , rising oil prices , and a general rise in commodity prices caused by capital flight from the dollar ( here 's a YouTube video of her saying basically the same thing she told me . )
The role of biofuels in driving up food prices , Korin says , is " negligible . "
Korin 's claims are at very much odds with a July 2008 report by the World Bank [ PDF ] , which found that 70 to 75 percent of the rise in food prices " was due to biofuels and the related consequences of low grain stocks , large land use shifts , speculative activity and export bans . "
The World Bank 's findings , while hotly contested , are consistent with a May 2008 report by the International Monetary Fund , which found that " rising corn - based ethanol production accounted for about three - fourths of the increase in global corn consumption in 2006 - 07 , " an increase that also drove up prices for edible oils and for meat .
Oxfam has also taken a strong stance against biofuels .
A June 2008 report [ PDF ] says that their use has deepened global poverty .
But even if these reports are correct , there may still be a way to grow fuel without contributing to hunger .
Brazil , where cultivation of sugarcane for ethanol is widespread , is often held up as a sustainable model .
And so - called second - generation biofuels , which use inedible plant parts such as stems and leaves , or inedible plants such as switch - grass or jatropha , show some promise , as those made from algae .
I asked Korin if she thought that , perhaps in a few years , the next time I pull into the gas station , I 'll be able to choose more than just my octane rating .
" Not a gas station , " she corrected me .
" A fuel station . "
Glurge Gallery
What is glurge ?
Think of it as chicken soup with several cups of sugar mixed in :
It ’s supposed to be a method of delivering a remedy for what ails you by adding sweetening to make the cure more appealing , but the result is more often a sickly - sweet concoction that induces hyperglycemic fits .
In ordinary language , glurge is the sending of inspirational ( and supposedly “ true ” ) tales , ones that often conceal much darker meanings than the uplifting moral lessons they purport to offer or undermine their messages by fabricating and distorting historical fact in the guise of offering a “ true story . ”
Many of us , it seems , cannot overcome the urge to glurge .
A Brisbane pimp who paid his child prostitute in chicken nuggets will serve just nine months behind bars .
Ronald Vikash Gander , 27 , was described by a District Court judge yesterday as a ' ' sleaze merchant ' ' who treated the 16 - year - old girl as a ' ' piece of meat ' ' after it was revealed he had forced her to have sex with older men and take part in a lesbian sex romp in order to pay rent on his Spring Hill apartment .
The $ 4500 she made as a first - time prostitute went on living expenses , car hire and buckets of chicken nuggets for the girl , prosecutors said .
At the time of the offences , Gander was on parole for trying to pull off a multi-million dollar real - estate fraud involving the sale of a highrise city building .
Despite a scathing assessment of Gander 's crimes by Judge Marshall Irwin , he will serve less than half of a two - and - a - half year sentence behind bars .
Sleep may be a way to sweep out the brain and get it ready for a new day of building connections between neurons , according to two new studies of fruit flies .
The studies support the controversial theory that sleep weakens or entirely dissolves some synapses , the connections between brain cells .
" We assume that if this is happening , it is a major function , if not the most important function , of sleep " [ Science News ] ,
says Chiara Cirelli , a coauthor of the first study , published in Science .
Pruning synapses may be a practical necessity to keep the brain from being overwhelmed , says Paul Shaw , coauthor of the second study ( also published in Science ) .
" There are a number of reasons why the brain can't indefinitely add synapses - including the finite spatial constraints of the skull .
We were able to track the creation of new synapses in fruit flies during learning experiences - and to show that sleep pushed that number back down " [ Telegraph ]
, he says .
In the first study , Cirelli and her colleagues show that proteins found in the synapses
build up in fruit fly brains while the flies are awake .
Depriving flies of sleep leads to ever - greater levels of synaptic proteins , the researchers show .
Levels of the proteins decrease as the flies sleep [ Science News ] .
The researchers could n't directly determine synaptic strength because fruit fly brains are too small to allow them to measure electric activity between neurons ; however , they say that measuring the proteins is a valid indirect gauge of synaptic strength .
Meanwhile , Shaw 's lab had previously determined that fruit flies sleep longer following social interactions , rather like a human who has been through a busy day .
His team then
showed that the brains of socially isolated flies contained fewer synaptic terminals than flies subjected to social enrichment , and that the number of terminals decreased in flies that were allowed to sleep .
" I think our data shows the first signs of real structural changes , " he said [ The Scientist ] .

CIA Director Leon E. Panetta said Thursday that he had banned the agency ’s use of contract employees to interrogate prisoners or provide security at detention facilities , ending a practice that had drawn frequent criticism from human rights groups and key members of Congress .
Panetta also spelled out new obligations for officers to safeguard the well - being of detainees when working with U.S. partners in Pakistan and other countries that frequently capture terrorism suspects with CIA help .
The rules require agency employees to report abuses even if they take place “ in the custody of an American partner . ”
The new policies come amid fresh disclosures about the CIA ’s harsh treatment of detainees in the years after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
A previously secret Red Cross report based on interviews with prisoners who had been in CIA custody concluded that the agency ’s methods “ constituted torture . ”
President Obama banned the CIA ’s use of so - called enhanced interrogation techniques during his first week in office , and the White House has continued to take high - profile steps to distance itself from the practices adopted by the Bush administration .

Panetta outlined the latest measures in a note distributed to the CIA ’s workforce , as well as in a letter to congressional intelligence committees .
A copy of the memo to CIA workers , which also was given to reporters , cited a desire to address ongoing media and congressional scrutiny of the agency ’s interrogation activities .
The CIA ’s pursuit of extremists “ continues undiminished , ” Panetta said .
But CIA officers “ do not tolerate , and will continue to promptly report , any inappropriate behavior or allegations of abuse . ”
Under the new directive , Panetta said that “ no CIA contractors will conduct interrogations ” and that he had ordered the agency to sever its contracts with companies that provided security at secret CIA facilities .
Advertisement
Agency officials declined to elaborate , but Panetta said that the contract decision would save the CIA as much as $ 4 million .
Panetta said that the agency had not had a prisoner in custody since he became director two months ago .
The CIA still has the authority to detain terrorism suspects temporarily , and question them , before transferring them to the U.S. military or the custody of another country .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a vocal critic of the agency ’s use of contractors in interrogations , praised the steps as necessary “ to fully comply with legal requirements and uphold the values we hold dear . ”
Human rights groups have also frequently expressed concern .
Advertisement
“ The worry has been that [ contractors ] would be less professional and less accountable ” than full - time government employees , said Tom Malinowski of Human Rights Watch .
After the Sept. 11 attacks , Malinowski said , the CIA bypassed the advice of FBI and military interrogators and turned to contractors “ whose approach would be consistent with the Bush administration ’s theory that you have to go to the dark side to fight the dark side . ”
Agency officials have maintained that the CIA turned to contractors because the agency did n’t have its own roster of skilled interrogators , and that contractors were required to abide by the same rules as agency employees .
But one contract interrogator , David A. Passaro , was convicted of beating an Afghan detainee who later died .
Passaro was sentenced in 2007 to eight years in prison .

Panetta said that if the CIA captured new prisoners it would use only “ a dialogue - style of questioning ” consistent with the methods approved in the U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogation .
He also said that the agency had developed a plan to dismantle the secret prison facilities , known as “ black sites , ” where the detainees were held .
Seven years after the CIA set up the secret sites , new details are still emerging on the treatment of agency prisoners .
The Red Cross report accused the agency of inflicting “ severe physical and mental pain and suffering ” on prisoners by subjecting them to a battery of methods including beatings , prolonged periods of nudity and the simulated drowning method known as waterboarding .
The document includes detailed accounts from Al Qaeda prisoners who were interviewed by Red Cross workers after they were transferred to the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Among them was Abu Zubaydah , who said of his waterboarding that “ I thought I was going to die .
I lost control of my urine .
Since then , I still lose control of my urine when under stress . ”

The Red Cross report was completed in 2007 , but remained secret until it was posted recently on the website of the New York Review of Books .
The CIA has declined to comment on the report .

A jumbo jet being chased by a F - 16 fighter jets buzzed Lower Manhattan this morning , panicking New Yorkers , many of whom were forced to evacuate their office buildings .
Have Photos of the Stunt ?
E-mail them to photo@nypost.com or Upload Them Here .
It was not a terrorist attack , however , but a photo opportunity for Air Force One , sources told the Post .
President Obama was in Washington at the time , but the low - flying 747 circling the Statue of Liberty was one of the planes used as Air Force One , sources said .
The NYPD and the city were notified of the planned flight , but did not share that information with Mayor Bloomberg and other New Yorkers , many of whom said they were terrified .
MORE : White House Apologizes For Air Force One Photo Op
Hours after the incident , a furious Bloomberg called the photo - op “ insensitive . ”
“ First thing is I ’m annoyed – furious is a better word – that I was n’t told , ” he said .
“ Why the Defense Department wanted to do a photo op right around the site of the World Trade Center catastrophe defies imagination .
Poor judgment would be a nice ways to phrase . ”
Bloomberg said federal officials notified the NYPD and another city official , whom he declined to identify , of the flight plan .
“ Had I known about it I would have called them right away and asked them not to , ” he said .
“ The good news is it was nothing more than an ill considered , badly conceived , insensitive photo op – with the taxpayers ’ money . ”
Dominick Caglioti , who works at the Mercantile Exchange , thought the worst as he saw the jets hurtle toward his window just after 10:30 a.m .
After learning it was all a photo op , he was furious .
“ It ’s so stupid because they tell you about every fire drill , but they did n’t tell us about this , ” he said .
The planes flew over the Verrazano Bridge , buzzed the left ear Lady Liberty and then continued up the Hudson past Jersey City and then circling back toward Staten Island , federal sources told the Post .
Thousands flooded the streets downtown as buildings called evacuations .
“ There is situation outside .
We do n’t have any further information , ” went one announcement at the Embassy Suites downtown .
After hearing it was all planned , many of those in the streets complained New Yorkers should have been warned .
“ You do n’t do this to people down here after all we have been to , ” said Jillian Pizzarello , who also works at the Mercantile Exchange .
According to the Department of Defense , that Presidential Airlift Group began its aerial photography mission at Andrews Airforce Base .
“ This mission , involving the VC - 25 and an F - 16 , was conducted in conjunction with normally scheduled continuation training for assigned aircrew members , ” officials said .
More on torture , from TPM Reader PB :
I think something else tends to get lost in the current arguments about torture .
The whole issue has been framed as “ moving forward ” and looking to the future ( good ) versus doling out “ retribution ” and dwelling on the past ( bad ) .
This is not merely the Republican framing of the issue , as Obama and many Democrats seem to have accepted this framework .
But this framing is entirely wrong .
A better way to look at is that we can either choose to do something about the fact people were tortured by the United States government , or we can choose to ignore it .
Either outcome will have a profound effect on what happens in this country “ moving forward . ”
Choosing to ignore profound and systematic violations of international law creates a bad precedent that can ( and no doubt will ) be followed by future administrations .
The current administration might be inclined to have a “ no torture ” policy , but the next one might think more like the Bush Administration .
What expectation would members of future administrations have of being prosecuted for violating the law if we do n’t hold the past one accountable ?
In many ways the decision to “ move forward ” and pardon Nixon set the stage for Iran - Contra and the Bush administration ’s myriad law breaking .
What future horrors will ignoring the fact that the Bush administration codified torture as a “ legal ” interrogation technique set the stage for ?
This is not a can that can be kicked down the road because we have other problems we have to deal with .
But no matter what we do now , this is about what might happen in the future as much as it is about what did happen in the past .
For shoplifting two purses , an Oklahoma City woman was sentenced Friday to life in prison .
A judge imposed the unusually long term after learning the shoplifter is a heroin addict who has been punished almost 30 other times for theft - related crimes .
The stealing dates to 1971 , records show .
" It ’s past time to say , ‘ Enough is enough , ’ ” Oklahoma County District Judge Ray Elliott said .
" She needs to be warehoused for the rest of her life .
She ’s a one - person crime wave . ”
Cecilia Cathleen Rodriguez , 56 , pleaded guilty in January to grand larceny .
She was caught a year ago at a Dillard ’s store stealing a $ 275 purse and a $ 380 purse , records show .
Her attorney said she shoplifted to support her drug habit .
She cared for her mother and lived off monthly disability checks and food stamps , according to a presentencing report prepared for the judge .
She has never had a steady job .
The judge also revoked Rodriguez ’s probation on a 2000 larceny case , meaning she has 19 more years to serve in prison after completing her life term .
Her arrest record shows theft cases in California , Oklahoma , Kansas and Texas .
She has gone to prison before for thefts .
She also went to prison for a 1983 assault .
Her attorney said some of the crimes actually were done by others using her name .
The judge noted the outcomes on all her criminal cases were not known so she may have even more convictions .
The judge criticized legislators who complain state prisons are overcrowded because of inmates sent there for crimes such as larceny .
He called Rodriguez a " poster child ” for why it ’s OK to send thieves to prison .
" We ’ve got to do something , ” Elliott said .
" She ’s costing every hard - working taxpayer in this state money because these businesses have to raise prices because thieves like her come in and steal because , I guess , they ’re too lazy to go work . ”
In the report to the judge , a probation and parole officer wrote , " Her need to support her addiction overpowers the remorse that she expresses for the crimes she has committed .
...
Her substance abuse began in the 1960s .
Her drug of choice is heroin .
Her criminal history began in the early 1970s . ”
Her family complained after the sentencing that Rodriguez needs treatment for her drug problem rather than being sent to prison for life .
" It ’s all wrong , ” said her mother , Geneva Gabriel , 78 .
" She has n’t done any violent crime .
She has a problem .
... Prison ’s not going to help her .
She ’s been in and out so many times .
She ’s a good girl .
She just needs help .
She has seizures . ”
Defense attorney Chris Daniels said he will ask the judge in a year to reduce the sentence .
" It costs a ton of money to lock somebody up for that long , ” the attorney said .

Axum , previously known as Maestro , is a Microsoft incubation language project meant to provide a parallel programming model for .NET through isolation , actors and message passing .
The language borrows many concepts from Erlang but with a C# - like syntax .
Axum is an imperative language with a C# - like syntax .
While it is aware of objects , classes cannot be defined , because the language is domain and actor - oriented instead of being object - oriented .
Axum is not a general purpose language being targeted at solving concurrency tasks and is built upon Concurrency and Coordination Runtime ( CCR ) from Microsoft Robotics .
The idea is to make calls to Axum code from other .NET languages when parallelism is necessary .
Shared state is considered the main roadblock for safe parallelism .
To use shared state in Axum , one needs to declare he is using it and the runtime controls the serialization process of accessing data stored in it .
Concurrency is built right in the language .
The main concept in Axum is the domain .
A domain is a repository of resources , a collection of data , agents and functions .
Domains are isolated from each other and offer protection of their respective data or shared state .
The state can be shared by agents of the same domain .
The functions of a domain are pure functions which do not keep state between calls .
Inside of a domain , agents exchange messages with each other through channels .
A schema is introduced to facilitate the communication between agents that have no relationships to each other , so they need some sort of metadata to be able to properly communicate .
An agent is basically a thread that can communicate with other agents and their access to the shared state is controlled by adding reader / writer declarations :
domain A { int i ; int func ( int k) {} writer agent X : Channel1 {} reader agent Y : Channel2{} } domain B { int j ; agent Z : Channel1 {}
}
Graphically , the communication between domain agents looks like this :
While there is no official word on Microsoft ’s plans with Axum , it looks like the Axum team is getting ready to ship the product .
There are still documentation issues to solve , making the integration with Visual Studio work flawlessly , creating a MSI package .
Jell - O may be used to kill off non-native trout in Yellowstone National Park .
Yes … I said Jell - O. Illegally introduced into the park , lake trout heavily threatens the native cutthroat trout in Yellowstone Lake .
Something the park service has been contending with since 1994 .
I ’m trying to picture a Bill Cosby commercial for this .
httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHpUMCrnUNE
The biggest threat posed by the lake trout is its longevity .
Compared to cutthroat trout , a lake trout can live up to three - times longer .
In addition , lake trout outweigh cutthroat trout by about 15 pounds .
Once a lake trout reaches 4 years of age , it starts eating cutthroat trout .
A few years later , it lives off of cutthroat trout almost exclusively .
But Jell - O is n’t the only consideration for removing the trout .
Sorry Bill , no commercial deal just yet .
Other possibilities include ultrasound , microwaves and electroshock .

Seriously ?
Am I the only one who thinks this sounds like a movie starring some SNL alumni ?
If “ death by Jell - O ” is chosen , it will be spread over the fish eggs to smother them .
Most likely this will be done during late fall which is the fish ’s spawning season .
I have to say that is one un -honorable death ; it ’s Darwin Award worthy .
But I have to ask , if Jell - O is chosen then why not use a pectin based product ?
Does it have to be gelatin - based ?
The researcher–Al Zale–received a grant from the National Park Service and heads the Montana Cooperative Fishery Research Unit at Montana State University .
Zale and his team will continue to analyze different solutions and recommend the best one .
In case you were wondering , the Jell - O would probably be unflavored .

DANCE MARATHONS :
Written for the U.S.A. Twenties Encyclopedia .
Copyright Renee Camus , © 2004
The article will be used in a copyrighted work , published by Grolier Publishing , an imprint of Scholastic Library Publishing , in 2005 .
The 1920s was a period of wild living and fleeting fads , among which was a craze for strange record - breaking contests .
Flagpole sitting , mountain climbing , even Charles Lindbergh ’s solo trans -Atlantic flight were contests of self - endurance and human record setting .
Dance Marathons started in a similar vein , a celebration of life , public spirit , and nationalism , and hope for brief fame .
However , they developed from a voluntary , fun activity to one of the most widely attended and controversial forms of commercialized live theater .
The craze began in 1923 , when 32 - year old Alma Cummings danced non-stop for 27 hours , wearing out six different partners , breaking the previous record set in Britain and gaining brief national acclaim for her feat .
This inspired others ( more often women ) who wished to share her glory and break her record .
More local spectacles and contests were held , which dancers could enter solo or with a specific partner , celebrating the spirit and endurance of both winners and losers .
Dancers defied protests and restrictions in striving to break previously set records , propelled by the excitement of competition , the possibility of brief fame , and cheered on by family and friends .
Local dance studios all over the country , such as McMillan ’s Dancing Academy in Houston , held marathons .
McMillan , the proprietor , set a number of firsts in the promotion and development of marathon dancing .
He charged admission to spectators and awarded a record - breaking winner with a cash prize .
He embraced a flair for the spectacular and encouraged contestants to entertain the crowds in any way they could .
However , he also seemed to care for and protect his contestants in a way that vanished in later marathons .
After 1923 , marathons began to change shape .
Sports and entertainment promoters realized that good money could be made from commercializing and standardizing the contests .
Unlike flagpole sitting or mountain climbing , dancing had movement and variety but took place in a stationary venue , perfect for entertaining audiences .
The contests became endless , grueling marathons that would continue for weeks , regulated by rules and heavily promoted to audiences .
No longer driven by dancers ’ record setting or “ fifteen - minutes - of - fame , ” these events were staged and structured by promoters , fueled by the money that could be made .
Presented on a much grander scale , these marathons offered non-stop entertainment hosted by a Master of Ceremonies and threaded with performances and specialty numbers , live band music , and audience participation , in addition to the contest element .
Each marathon had its own set of rules , demanding more from their participants and dictating a way of life for the around - the - clock dancers ( not to mention judges , nurses , vendors and many others involved in the event ) , governing dancing , sleeping , eating , bathing and using the toilet .
Rules often demanded that couples register and stay together , stating that if one partner dropped out , the other had to leave too .
They regulated rest periods : fifteen minutes for every hour of dancing , often in separate quarters for men and women , during which they could sleep , change clothes , or have a massage ( which contestants themselves paid for ) .
Though healthier for the dancers than the earlier non -stop contests , these rest periods allowed the marathons to continue for days , weeks , and even months .
Though these contests were never a test of finesse or technical ability , later marathons were much more a question of stamina and endurance ; outliving your opponents , often at the risk of health and well being .
In a 1920s reality show – Survivor with a twist – couples would dance popular dances of the day , including fox trot , waltz , and Charleston , for as long as possible , while judges watched to verify their knees did not touch the ground .
In fact , rules stated that contestants did not need to dance as long as they stood in a dance position and kept their feet moving .
Every so often however , they were made to do a sprint or quick competition of waltz or fox trot , earning the winning couple prestige and extra money .
To break the monotony of constant dancing for spectators , promoters added distractions , usually performances both by contestants and by guest artists .
They invited professional dancers and teachers to enter the contest , often paying them to participate .
Specialty acts from vaudeville and burlesque , exhibition dancers , even boxing matches , were all added to the spectacle .
In addition , the competition element and constant proximity of the dancers combined with exhaustion and mental stress created real dramas and conflicts , which promoters exploited and publicity and the press spread , especially via the new media venue , the tabloids .
Promoters would assure a good show by hiring eccentric and ostentatious personalities sure to create exciting situations .
They arranged for “ unexpected ” guest appearances by local celebrities such as theatrical agents and performers .
Equivalent to today ’s reality shows , the contests combined professional and amateur entertainment , simultaneously creating real life and theatricalized drama .
Contestants and spectators alike bought into the staged excitement and competition .
Spectators could cheer , make wagers and root for their favorite team , even interacting with the dancers , chatting with them and throwing money .
Contestants were enticed by the potential for fame and fortune , from prizes of several thousand dollars to performing contracts , and were fueled by the audiences ’ support and applause .
Like professional wrestling , the contests were fixed , but both sides bought into the simulated reality of it and participated heartily , provoking each other and egging each other on .
The newest episodic entertainment , spectators would return day after day to follow their heroes and see more drama unfold .
Many contestants , considering themselves theater professionals based on their marathon experience , traveled the country competing in one marathon after another .
Especially during the depression , marathons offered work , shelter , food , and potential for extra money and more .
Contestants hoped to have careers in films , and though many took roles as extras , only the few who were veteran performers before entering , like June Havoc and Red Skelton , found real fame and entertainment careers after their marathon days .
During the Depression , marathons reflected the status of America at the time .
A heavily staged form of forced labor , marathons relied on the amount of time spectators and contestants , out of work victims of the Depression , had on their hands .
Promoters found new ways of forcing the marathons to continue for months , enlisting entertainers and staging dramatic situations .
They established ways of adding tension and excitement to the dreary competition , including races and complicated tests of endurance for the contestants ; elimination contests that likened the marathons to the horrors of spectator sports in the Roman Coliseum .
The chance at fame and fortune was there , but at the cost of humiliation at least , and at most , mental and physical health problems or even death .
By the depressed 1930s , marathons took on new meanings : the pain and misery of the contestants helped spectators feel better about their own situations , while the prize represented a hope of the American Dream for contestants , probably never to be realized .
It was certainly a far cry from the fun , voluntary sport that it had been in the 1920s .
The Dance Derby of the Century
On June 10 , 1928 , Milton Crandall , veteran promoter and publicist of theatrical events , staged a monumental contest at New York ’s Madison Square Garden .
He called this national , large - scale marathon “ The Dance Derby of the Century , ” making the event unique and setting the tone for marathons to follow .
Exemplary of the changes dance marathons were adopting , the event challenged the attention , strength and endurance of both dancers and spectators .
This “ Derby ” was the most famous and financially successful of the marathons , especially before the 1930s , and was the first to fully exploit the thin line between reality and theater .
Creating a combined atmosphere of horse shows , ballrooms , and vaudeville , the event offered everything from exhibition dancers to variety performers to Shipwreck Kelly – the record - holder for flagpole sitting , to special “ unexpected ” guests such as Texas Guinan , Prohibition ’s most infamous speakeasy owner .
Crandall knew how to exploit tabloids and press to cover his show , scandalizing and dramatizing the event ’s daily occurrences .
The contest ran until 2 pm on June 30 , when the health commissioner ( possibly another publicity stunt ? ) came in and closed it down .
The $ 5,000 prize money was split among the remaining eight couples .

Yesterday Jeremy declared Pie-Palooza to be in effect when he found this picture :
So , I have acknowledged Pie-Palooza to be in effect by working up a recipe for his favorite : Key Lime Pie .
While I have n’t any pictures of the cut pie ( we mangled it by diving in immediately ) , it tastes as excellent as it looks .
Key Lime Pie
Crust
1 C graham cracker crumbs
1/2 C sugar
3 T butter
Filling
1 C key lime juice , preferably fresh squeezed
2 14 oz . cans sweetened condensed milk
2 whole eggs
2 T sugar
Topping
1 1/2 C heavy whipping cream
2 T confectioner ’s sugar
1 tsp. vanilla extract
Garnish
key lime slices
fresh blackberries or raspberries
fresh mint
Preheat oven to 375° .
Melt butter , and stir into sugar and graham cracker crumbs until fully combined .
Press into bottom and sides of a 9 ″ pie pan .
Bake for 10 – 15 minutes until golden brown .
Remove pie crust from oven to wire rack to cool , and reduce temperature to 325° .
Meanwhile , juice limes .
Combine lime juice with the sweetened condensed milk , eggs , and sugar .
Whisk together until everything is well combined , making sure the eggs are well blended into the mixture .
When pie crust is completely cooled , pour filling into crust .
Bake for about 15 – 20 minutes , until filling is set .
Remove the pie from the oven to wire racks , allowing it to cool to room temperature .
Once the pie has reached room temperature , refrigerate the pie for at least 2 hours until the filling is firm .
When the pie is completely chilled , it is ready to top .
Whisk together the whipping cream , sugar , and vanilla until the mixture is stiff and fluffy .
Use a star or flower tip with a decorating bag , and pipe the vanilla whipped cream in circles on the surface of the pie , completely covering it .
Slice key limes thinly , then cut 3 / 4 of the way across to form twists .
Garnish the pie with lime twists , blackberries , and sprigs of mint .
Yum .
Protesters against torture are arrested by U.S. Park Police officers after moving their rally from Lafayette Park to the sidewalk in front of the White House on Thursday in Washington .
WASHINGTON ( AP )  Dressed in an orange jumpsuit , Ken Crowley stood silently facing the White House .
On Crowley 's back , a black sign printed with the name of a Libyan man read , " Cleared for Release . "
The Washington , D.C. , resident , who was among 61 people arrested during an anti-torture demonstration Thursday , said he wanted to bring attention to the plight of detainees held in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
GITMO CLOSING : U.S. senators press for details " Everywhere I go and I talk about Guantanamo , people say , ' Oh , that 's closed , " ' said Crowley , who is in his 60s .
" This movement is important because it brings awareness . "
More than 100 protesters solemnly marched from the U.S. Capitol to the White House , with many of them clad in jumpsuits and black hoods .
They claimed to represent Guantanamo prisoners who have been cleared for release , but remain in custody , as well as those who have died at the facility .
Demonstrators called for a criminal inquiry into claims of torture against terrorism suspects under the Bush administration , including abuses committed at Guantanamo and other U.S. prisons .
President Obama has been reluctant to begin such an investigation , they said .
Tom Parker , policy director for counterterrorism and human rights at Amnesty International , said no steps have been taken to prosecute those responsible for torturing people in U.S. custody .
By not taking action , Parker said terrorists can fuel anti-Americanism by showing recruits how authorities used torture and got away with it .
" It has a corrosive effect on our democracy .
It has a corrosive effect on our military , " Parker said .
" It puts every man , woman and child at a greater threat . "
Throngs of tourists stepped aside as dozens of the protesters walked onto a sidewalk outside the White House .
Sgt. David Schlosser , a U.S. Park Police spokesman , said police arrested the 61 demonstrators because they violated a permit regulation that required them to remain in motion on the center portion of sidewalk .
The protest comes as U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder spent this week asking European countries to help relocate detainees , of which about 30 have been cleared for release .
There are currently 241 prisoners at Guantanamo , and Holder is working to carry out President Obama 's order to shut down the site over the next nine months .
On Wednesday , a Spanish magistrate opened an investigation of Bush officials on harsh interrogation methods .
Speaking with reporters in Berlin before the investigation was announced , Holder did not rule out cooperating with such an investigation .
In a separate move , human rights lawyers have filed a complaint that seeks charges against six specific Bush administration officials they accuse of creating a legal framework to permit torture of suspects at Guantanamo and other U.S. detention facilities .
Frida Berrigan , a protest organizer with Witness Against Torture who marched with other activists to Guantanamo in 2005 , said Obama has made some progress in his first 100 days in office , but more needs to be done within the U.S. to bring the detainees justice .
" Our message today is that the work continues , " Berrigan said .
" We need to push Congress and push the consciousness of the American people . "

There is a new strategy afoot in the Democratic Party .
The White House has decided to use Rush Limbaugh against his own party .
The White House is making Rush the symbol of partisan division .
They are setting a trap for the GOP , which they are almost certain to fall into .
On Face The Nation , Emanuel said of Limbaugh , “ He has been upfront about what he views , and has n’t stepped back from that , which is he hopes for failure .
He said it .
And I compliment him for his honesty , but that ’s their philosophy that is enunciated by Rush Limbaugh .
And I think that ’s the wrong philosophy for America . ”
Host Bob Schieffer asked Emanuel if he though Limbaugh was such a force in the Republican Party , and he answered , “ I do think he ’s an intellectual force , which is why the Republicans pay such attention to him .
But our goal , Bob , is to continue to reach out .
And it ’s our desire that the Republicans would work with us and try to be constructive , rather than adopt the philosophy of somebody like Rush Limbaugh , who is praying for failure . ”

Rham Emanuel does n’t say anything without a reason , and it seems obvious that the White House is baiting the trap for Rush Limbaugh and the GOP .
Emanuel ’s comments set up an interesting dilemma for Republicans .
Do they disavow their most powerful media voice , or do they side with Rush as he drives the party into the ground ?
If Limbaugh was smart , he would n’t take the bait here , but since Rush is guided by ego , and not intellect , he is certain to use this on his show tomorrow .
By making Rush Limbaugh the leader of the Republican Party , Democrats are seeking to make the GOP look out of touch and extreme .
This is a smart move by Emanuel , because Rush will say that the White House is feuding with him , and play up the Importance of his , “ national address ” yesterday .
He will say something stupid like the he has the White House on the run and Republicans will feel compelled to defend him out of fear , thus playing into the White House ’s hands .
It is almost absurd the way Obama and the Democrats are controlling the Republican Party right now .
Space shuttle Discovery rests on Launch Pad 39A after a seven - hour rollout from the Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Jan. 14 , 2009 .
The shuttle is slated to launch no earlier March 12 .
This story was updated at 3:50 p.m. EST .
Afterweeks of delays due to fuel valve concerns , NASA ?s space shuttle Discovery is officiallyset to blast off on March 11 , the space agency announced Friday .
Missionmanagers set the Wednesday launch date during a Flight Readiness Review atNASA ?s Kennedy Space Center in Florida , where they decided the evidence wasfirm enough that suspectfuel valves should pose no problem for Discovery ' splanned flight .
" Theyfelt they had all the data and information they needed to support launching on March 11 , " NASA spokesman Allard Beutel told SPACE.com .
" Allthe extra testing gave engineers confidence enough to schedule a launchdate . "
Discoveryis now officially poised to lift off for its STS - 119 mission from a seasidelaunch pad at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral , Fla. , on Wednesday at9:20 p.m. EDT ( 0120 March 12 GMT ) .
Commander Lee Archambault will lead a crewof seven astronauts on a two - week construction flight to the InternationalSpace Station to deliver a new set of solar array wings .
Fuelvalve delays
Originallyslated to launch Feb. 12 , Discovery ?s mission has been repeatedly delayed overconcerns that the shuttle ?s three fuel control valves might be faulty .
Thevalves function like pop-up lawn sprinklers to route gaseous hydrogen throughplumbing lines that lead to a hydrogen reservoir in the shuttle ?s attachedexternal fuel tank .
They ensure the spacecraft ?s reservoir of liquid hydrogenpropellant is properly pressurized during launch .
Theconcerns arose after a valve on NASA ?s shuttle Endeavour cracked and chippedduring its November 2008 launch .
The damage did not affect Endeavour ?s launchinto orbit , but NASA wanted to be sure a similar problem would not endanger Discoveryor its astronaut crew .
" Wecompleted a lot of testing and a lot of analysis to understand the risks , " said Bill Gerstenmaier , NASA ?s associate administrator for space operations , ina briefing today .
" We 're fully ready to go fly .
It 's time to step back fromthe issue of the day and think about all the other things we need for flightreadiness . "
NASAordered a series of tests on the valves , and developed a new way to examinethem to search for any signs of cracks .
The new method , which involves placinga valve in a magnetic field and measuring the strength of the field around it , revealed cracks much tinier than the width of a hair in some of the valves .
After screening the three valves on Discovery , the mission management teamdecided to replace them with new valves that had been found to have no defects .
Engineersalso thoroughly modeled what would happen to the shuttle if any of the valvesdid crack during the launch , and found the chances of any serious damage to theorbiter were very remote .
" We 'reputting valves in the vehicle that have no cracks , " said John Shannon , NASA space shuttle program manager .
" We also showed the risk on theconsequence side went down significantly from what we were speculating it wouldbe a couple weeks ago . "
Launchwindows
DuringDiscovery 'splanned 14 - day mission , the astronauts are due to install the new solararrays to outfit the space station with enough power to run science experimentsand support new , expanded long - duration crews of six .
The mission is set tofeature four spacewalks .
However , if the team is forced to delay Discovery 's launch date because of weather , managers may decide to remove up to two spacewalks from the flight to shortenit , allowing them to launch as late as March 16 .
The spacewalks , or EVAs , would n't be cancelled , but just rescheduled for later missions .
" Wecould give those EVAs up if we needed to get more launch time , " Shannonsaid .
Discovery ' screw includes pilot Tony Antonelli and mission specialists Joseph Acaba , SteveSwanson , Richard Arnold , and John Phillips .
Japan Aerospace Exploration Agencyastronaut Koichi Wakata will also ride aboard Discovery to take up position asa new flight engineer for the space station 's Expedition 18 .
He will relieveNASA astronaut Sandra Magnus , who has been on the station for more than fourmonths .
Wakata is set to return to Earth aboard next station shuttle mission , STS - 127 , which is targeted to launch in June 2009 .
STANFORD , Calif . 
For 46 years , Francis Everitt , a Stanford University physicist , has promoted the often perilous fortunes of Gravity Probe B , perhaps the most exotic , “ Star Trek ” - ish experiment ever undertaken in space .
Finally , with emergency financial help from a pair of unusual sources , success is at hand .
Conceived in the late 1950s , financed by $ 750 million from NASA and launched into orbit in 2004 , the Gravity Probe B spacecraft has sought to prove two tenets of Einstein ’s theory of general relativity .
The first , called the geodetic effect , holds that a large celestial body like Earth will warp time the way a rubber sheet stretches when a bowling ball is placed on it .
The second , known as frame - dragging , occurs when the rotation of a large body “ twists ” nearby space and time ; turn the resting bowling ball , and the rubber sheet twists .
To measure these phenomena , Dr. Everitt and his Stanford team equipped Gravity Probe B with a special telescope attached to several gyroscopes .
They pointed the telescope at a “ guide star , ” IM Pegasi , and then spun up the gyros with their axes also fixed on the guide star .
If Einstein was right , the gyros would drift slightly over time to follow the space - time distortion .
The Stanford team collected 11 ½ months ’ worth of transmissions from Gravity Probe B , but tiny unforeseen drift in the gyros fouled the results .
Dr. Everitt had to ask NASA for extra time and money so his 11 - member team could figure out how to scrub the data .
GRAND HAVEN --
As a disabled U.S. Army veteran , Dan Higgins suffers severe nausea from pain medication for his damaged back .
The only thing that helps , he said , is marijuana .
Today he plans to be in Lansing as Michigan 's medical - marijuana law , approved by voters in November , takes effect .
On Monday , the state Department of Community Health begins accepting applications from those with doctors ' permission to use marijuana .
For Higgins , 34 , of Grand Haven , the law is based on compassion .
" It 's to give people their medication .
... I just can't keep the food down . "
But , he said , there 's this , too : " This is marijuana .
It 's not cocaine .
It 's not heroin . "
MARIJUANA AS MEDICINE
Key points of the law , which goes into effect today :
• Qualified users can possess 2.5 ounces of usable marijuana or grow as many as 12 plants .
Designated caregivers can provide that amount to a patient and supply as many as five patients .
• The state compiles a confidential database but will verify to police if an individual is registered .
• Registered users cannot use marijuana while driving ; possession is banned in school buses , schools and correctional facilities , and smoking is prohibited on public transportation or public places .
• Employers may prohibit use at work .
The ballot initiative took effect Dec. 4 , but no one could apply for six months while the Department of Community Health developed administrative rules .
The law provided medical - marijuana patients a defense to charges , but criminal penalties will be gone for those with an identification card .
While the proposal was framed as a way to help seriously ill patients , many area police leaders warned it was a step toward legalization and that it put motorists at risk and threatened families .
Kent County Undersheriff Jon Hess has worked with police agencies in California , Oregon and Washington , which have medical marijuana laws .
He said he has concerns because other states reported that marijuana laws have become " so watered - down . "
The Sheriff 's Department was trained in the new law and continues to study information from the Department of Community Health .
In other states , police report those busted for illegal possession of pot sometimes say they are legal medicinal users , and , Hess said , " I anticipate there will be those that try to use this as an excuse . "
In Ottawa County , the Sheriff 's Department has " opened a line of communication " with a Holland - area Compassion Club , one of numerous such groups across the state .
" We recognize that legislation has been changed allowing manufacture and use of marijuana under very specific guidelines , " Ottawa County Undersheriff Greg Steigenga said .
" It 's our intention to work within established guidelines as a law - enforcement agency that is also commissioned to enforce the law of illegal propagation of marijuana . "
Police are used to changes in the law , but this is a little unusual .
" We 'll work through it .
It 's something that 's new for the entire state , " Steigenga said .
He said the new law provides guidance for police and legal users and appeared fairly straightforward .
But he expected legal challenges .
So does Grand Rapids attorney Bruce Block , who has researched marijuana laws and put information on his Web site .
He also represents perhaps the area 's most high - profile alleged user , suspended Press columnist David Mayo , busted after police tracked growing equipment he bought from an advertiser in High Times magazine .
He sees a lot of problems , including driving laws that hold motorists responsible with any amount of drugs in their system .
" That 's one of the Catch 22s , " he said .
The federal government said it wo n't target medical - marijuana users or growers , but " technically , it is still illegal " under federal law , Block said .
Also , " Where do you get the seeds or the plants ? ...
If someone has a medical - marijuana card , they are basically buying from someone on the street .
People selling to them can still be busted , " Block said .
Greg Francisco , executive director of the Michigan Medical Marijuana Association , said the number of underground users is large and includes those from all backgrounds and professions .
He discounted the notion that prescribed drugs better relieve nausea and pain .
" I kind of believe the patients , " Francisco said .

I can't wait for the usual comments about how this means the opposite of how it appears , Obama 's extended super brilliant chess game , etc. :
WASHINGTON — The Obama administration said Friday that it would appeal a district court ruling that granted some military prisoners in Afghanistan the right to file lawsuits seeking their release .
The decision signaled that the administration was not backing down in its effort to maintain the power to imprison terrorism suspects for extended periods without judicial oversight .
In a court filing , the Justice Department also asked District Judge John D. Bates not to proceed with the habeas - corpus cases of three detainees at Bagram Air Base outside Kabul , Afghanistan .
Judge Bates ruled last week that the three — each of whom says he was seized outside of Afghanistan — could challenge their detention in court .
Tina Foster , the executive director of the International Justice Network , which is representing the detainees , condemned the decision in a statement .
“ Though he has made many promises regarding the need for our country to rejoin the world community of nations , by filing this appeal , President Obama has taken on the defense of one of the Bush administration ’s unlawful policies founded on nothing more than the idea that might makes right , ” she said .
Barclays Bank obtained a court order early today banning the Guardian from publishing documents which showed how the bank set up companies to avoid hundreds of millions of pounds in tax .
The gagging order was granted by Mr Justice Ouseley after Barclays complained about seven documents on the Guardian 's website which had been leaked to the Liberal Democrats ' deputy leader , Vince Cable .
The internal Barclays memos – leaked by a Barclays whistleblower – showed executives from SCM , Barclays 's structured capital markets division , seeking approval for a 2007 plan to sink more than $ 16bn ( £ 11.4 bn ) into US loans .
Tax benefits were to be generated by an elaborate circuit of Cayman islands companies , US partnerships and Luxembourg subsidiaries .
The documents had been leaked to Cable by a former employee of the bank , who wrote a long account of how the bank works .
The anonymous whistleblower wrote to Cable : " The last year has seen the global taxpayer having to rescue the global financial system .
The taxpayer has already had a gun put to their head and been told to pay up or watch the financial system and life as we know it disappear into a black hole .
" It is a commonly held view that no agency in the US or the UK has the resources or the commitment to challenge SCM .
SCM has huge amounts of resources , the best minds rewarded by millions of pounds .
Compare this with HMRC [ Her Majesty 's Revenue & Customs ] recently advertising for a tax and accounting expert with the pay at £ 45,000 .
" Through the use of lawyers and client confidentiality SCM regularly circumvents these rules , just one example of why HMRC will never , in its current state , be up to the job of combating this business . "
The Guardian 's decision to publish the documents came on a day when the chancellor , Alistair Darling , told parliament he had asked HMRC to publish shortly a draft code of practice on taxation for banks " so that banks will comply not just with the letter of the law but the spirit of the law " .
Barclays 's lawyers , Freshfields , worked into the early hours to force the Guardian to remove the documents from the website .
They argued that the documents were the property of Barclays and could only have been leaked by someone who acquired them wrongfully and in breach of confidentiality agreements .
The Guardian 's solicitor , Geraldine Proudler , was woken by the judge at 2 am and asked to argue the Guardian 's case by telephone .
Around 2.31 am , Mr Justice Ouseley issued an order for the documents to be removed from the Guardian 's website .
Cable said it was both " incongruous " and " offensive " that banks that rely on state support should avoid paying tax and therefore be " selling the taxpayer short " .
Although the taxpayer has not had to directly support Barclays by taking an equity stake , the bank had relied on the government 's special liquidity scheme to provide funding for loans .
" The banks are able to organise their activities in such a way that they can run rings around the Inland Revenue , " he told the Telegraph .
" It serves no other purpose than to reduce tax .
The fundamental point is that it is incongruous and offensive that banks which are either directly or indirectly dependent on the government should be systematically finding ways to avoid tax . "
Cable , who passed the documents to HMRC and the Financial Services Authority , told the Sunday Times this week : " The documents suggest a deeply ingrained culture of tax avoidance .
The Barclays team looks like the spider at the centre of a highly artificial web of non-transparent transactions through tax havens .
Reputable banks do n't turn tax avoidance into a profit machine . "
A Guardian spokesman said this morning that the paper would appeal against the order .
" Tax avoidance is a matter of high public and political interest .
These documents showed for the first time how major banks set up artificial schemes with the aim of earning hundreds of millions in tax - free money , which is why the Barclays whistleblower leaked them .
" All decisions about tax are taken in secret , hidden from public view .
It is not right for a judge to prevent daylight from shining on the few documents ever to have emerged which graphically demonstrate what HMRC is up against . "
CINCINNATI ( Reuters ) - After the September 11 attacks , President George W. Bush urged Americans to go shopping .
As he hands out $ 789 billion in economic stimulus , President Barack Obama has been less clear -- and Americans simply do n’t know whether they should save or spend .
A Macy 's department store is seen in San Francisco , California February 2 , 2009 .

“ It ’s a tough question , ” said Cincinnati electrician and small businessman Mike Cavanaugh .
“ I think that in general the government wants us to spend .
While saving may be better in the long run , spending I think can be contagious because we see each other doing it . ”
In Scottsdale , Arizona , business owner Bill Austin said the government ’s message has been mixed .
“ The government does n’t know what ’s going to fix this , but I think they believe that people should start spending again , ” Austin said .
But he ’s skeptical : “ Just me going out and spending money is n’t going to fix this . ”
After a year of being castigated for the consumerism that drove the nation ’s boom - and - bust housing market , Americans can be forgiven for not quite knowing whether they are doing the smart thing by spending or saving .
Obama , at his first news conference as president on Monday , dodged the question , arguing that consumers , like the government itself , need to do both .
“ Our immediate job is to stop the downward spiral , ” Obama said , suggesting that spending was the answer .
But he warned that thrift would be needed soon after .
“ Once the economy stabilizes and people are less fearful , then I do think that we ’re going to have to start thinking about , how do we operate more prudently ? ” Obama said .
At the Consumer Federation of America , where economists expend great effort trying to teach Americans to spend wisely and save well , executive director Stephen Brobeck laments the suggestion that Americans have a duty to spend the nation out of recession , and only later tighten their belts .
A NUANCED MESSAGE
“ We would prefer that our government leaders communicate a more nuanced message which distinguishes between economically insecure and economically secure families , ” Brobeck said .
People with lots of debt and no emergency savings should be working harder than ever to pay off their liabilities and save for an emergency fund , he said .
But luckier Americans can do their part to throw a little fuel on the fire .
“ It is in the country ’s interest for those households with discretionary income and job security to keep spending at past levels , ” Brobeck said .
For many Americans , the stimulus will come in the form of a fatter paycheck , as withholding taxes are cut .
Others will be hired for infrastructure projects approved under the plan .
But while Washington may be hoping the stimulus will send shoppers back to the stores , convincing Americans it is wise to spend again may be an uphill battle .
Magazines are full of tips for saving money , companies have cut back on advertising , and no one hesitates to boast about their frugal ways .
“ I watch my money closer now , as does my wife .
I cut out the morning iced coffee at McDonald ’s , even though it was not that expensive , ” said Cincinnati ’s Cavanaugh , adding that he was being just as cautious with his business .
“ I am doing the responsible thing and cutting back . ”
Kevin Hassett , an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute , said it may not matter what message the government is trying to send -- since people react predictably when the government gives them extra money .
“ You can break the response down into two types .
A little less than 40 percent take the money and consume it right away , ” Hassett said .
“ The rest of the people , a little more than half of Americans , do n’t really change their behavior much at all . ”
And while negotiations about the economic stimulus have been front - page news for weeks , polls show a dramatic cutback in U.S. consumer spending and lack of confidence about future finances , even if money is poised to pour into the system .
A poll released on Thursday showed 86 percent of Americans have cut spending or changed their saving or investment pattern , though just 30 percent say the thrift was driven by actual financial hardship .
The rest , 56 percent , cut back because they worry their financial situation may get worse in the future , according to the national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press .
Hassett said people are wise to be cautious , since individual tax bills will inevitably rise once the economy has recovered and Obama and Congress have to claw back money to tackle the gaping federal deficit .
“ So the right answer is to save , but that ’s bad for the economy , ” Hassett said .
“ Clearly what ’s good for the individual is n’t necessarily the thing that is going to give us the best GDP number this year . ”
It 's worth remembering the fictional newsman of the moment , Howard " I 'm mad as hell " Beale from Network , was actually mentally ill .
Now Beale 's closest modern analog is himself stumbling toward insanity .
It 's never been clear to what extent Glenn Beck is actually unhinged , and to what extent his Fox News Channel antics are pure clowning .
But it should n't matter much to the aspiring populist - demagogue - in - chief of our era : if he seems too far into the crazy side of the thin line between rage and psychosis , viewers will start to assume he really is mentally incompetent , and be less willing to take up pitchforks with him .
Which is why Beck probably should n't be pouring pretend gasoline on a hyperventillating volunteer ( some Red Eye staffer , naturally ) , as he did tonight in a deranged imitation of Barack Obama , then following that up with maniacal screaming against " games " ( uhh ... ) and in favor of " sanity " ( HA ! ) .
Beck may have run a disclaimer that the gas can was filled with water , and he may get all kinds of attention on various blogs ( we 'll plead guilty , preemptively here , to feeding the troll ) , but the disgruntled red - state housefraus who nod along to Beck 's show in the early evening do n't want to see a simulated lynching .
Or probably we 're wrong , they 'll eat this crap up , and Glenn Beck will fulfill his dream of being the Father Coughlin of our era .
God help us ( especially in getting a clear view of the train wreck ) .

Economics reporter , BBC News
The world economy is set to shrink by between 0.5 % and 1.0 % in 2009 , the first global contraction in 60 years .
In its gloomiest forecast yet , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) says that developed countries will suffer a " deep recession " .
The global economic body says " the prolonged financial crisis has battered global economic activity beyond what was previously anticipated " .
Just two months ago , the IMF predicted world output would increase by 0.5 % .
In the event of further delays in implementing comprehensive policies to stabilise financial conditions , the recession will be deeper and more prolonged
IMF EU to debate extra stimulus calls
What is a global recession ?
But in its report drawn up for the G20 group of finance ministers , the IMF now says that the whole world economy will shrink , and predicts that the advanced economies will suffer a decline in output of between 3 % and 3.5 % in 2009 , and barely grow in 2010 , with growth of between 0 % and 0.5 % .
The IMF says this will happen despite a big fiscal stimulus from many G20 countries designed to boost growth .
It says that the G20 as a whole is adding 1.8 % of GDP ( $ 780 bn ) to boost growth this year - but that the EU is lagging behind with only 1 % .
And it warns that the UK is building up the biggest fiscal deficit amongst all the G20 countries , which will amount to 11 % of GDP by 2010 .
Financial crisis unresolved
The IMF warns that the economic conditions could still deteriorate further if the banking crisis was not tackled head on by governments around the world .
" In the event of further delays in implementing comprehensive policies to stabilise financial conditions , the recession will be deeper and more prolonged , " the report says .
The global slowdown has affected exporters such as Bangladesh The IMF says its revised projections reflect " unrelenting financial turmoil , negative incoming data , sinking confidence , and the limited effect to date of policy responses with respect to the restoration of financial system health . "
Japan is forecast to decline the most , by 5.8 % this year , while the eurozone will contract by 3.2 % and the US by 2.6 % .
The most urgent problem in restoring the banking system to health is in the United States , where the Obama administration has yet to reveal details of its plan for private - public partnership to buy up to $ 1tn in toxic assets .
At the G20 finance ministers meeting at the weekend , restoring lending by tackling problems in the financial system was cited as the " key priority " - a message reinforced by G20 business leaders who met in London on Wednesday .
Warning on Eastern Europe Meanwhile , the IMF was also warns of a serious risk that emerging economies will be unable to secure external finance , as banks and investors in rich countries withdraw their money .
G20 LONDON SUMMIT
World leaders will meet next month in London to discuss measures to tackle the downturn .
See our in - depth guide to the G20 summit .
The G20 countries are Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , Mexico , Russia , Saudi Arabia , South Africa , South Korea , Turkey , the United Kingdom , the US and the EU .
The G20 make up 80 % of the world economy and 90 % of trade
Q&A : G20 Summit

" The risks are largest for emerging countries that rely on cross - border flows to finance current account deficits , " it says .
And this makes central and eastern European countries likely to be the " most adversely affected " - with the Baltic states , Hungary , Romania and Bulgaria " suffering the greatest damage " .
The IMF is already in negotiations about a rescue package for Romania .
East Asian countries , which rely heavily on manufacturing exports , have also been hard - hit by the decline of world trade , particularly in the IT sector .
In relative terms , the developing and emerging market countries as a whole , which are predicted to grow by just 1.5 % to 2.5 % , below the growth of population in many countries , have suffered the biggest downward revisions .
Fiscal stimulus
In addition to fixing the banking sector , many countries are now spending more public money to boost economic growth .
The IMF estimates that the G20 countries as a whole will spend an extra 1.8 % of GDP ( $ 780 bn ) in 2009 on fiscal stimulus , not far from its earlier recommendation that they spend at least 2 % of GDP on boosting growth .
Taking into account the " automatic stabilisers " , for example the increased spending on unemployment benefits that results from a slowdown , it says that in 2009 there will be a 2.4 % boost to GDP from fiscal expansion .
It says the fiscal expansion could add around 2 % to world growth in 2009 and create approximately 7 million new jobs ( or 19 million if China and India are included ) .
But the IMF warns that there is much less spending planned for 2010 , with extra government spending of only $ 580 bn ( 1.2 % of GDP ) across the G20 , and a total fiscal boost of only 0.4 % .
This has caused much dissent among G20 members , with the US , whose huge fiscal stimulus plan runs well into 2010 , urging other G20 countries to boost their spending further . .

Last week ’s Iraqi elections received lots of media coverage , but at MMW we were mostly fascinated by women candidates , especially since election rules require 30 % of the candidates be female .
The Huffington Post defines Iraq ’s exercise in democracy as rebellious , while the Gulf News qualified it as an act of political maturity .
I ’ll take a closer look at CNN and The Guardian .
There was mostly positive coverage at CNN .
This article shows how Iraqi women contributed to their society , even before the U.S. came and “ liberated ” them .
However , Nibras al - Mamuri , a secular female candidate running for Baghdad ’s provincial council proves contribution does not necessarily mean equality when she says , “ Although a woman ’s role in the Arab world is mainly that of a mother and child bearer , I want to prove that women are just as capable as men when it comes to challenging arenas . ”
That ’s nice .
You know what else would be nice ?
If she said women care as much about the future of Iraq as men , and that as child bearers and mothers they arguably have a lot more invested .
But her statement is bold and it even sounds a little like Hillary Clinton , which is what Americans want to hear .
Now that Clinton is the U.S. ’s Secretary of State , she can really start to mold female politics , paper dolls and cookie cutters and all .
At The Guardian , there ’s a video of an interview with two female candidates who wear headscarves .
The first woman says everything I wanted al - Mamuri to up there .
The other expands on this , giving a lot of relevant commentary and credibility to her candidacy by describing how the wars in Iraq affected women .
This article does a great job of showing how female candidates are welcomed or ostracized , depending on where they are in Iraq .
In Baghdad , the general consensus seems to be pretty sexist :
“ Women in our electorate are very lazy and we cannot rely on them to get things done , ” said Baghdad manager Ayad al - Dumaini , echoing a position that reflected the views of the dozen or so men standing with him .
“ But in the south I hear it is different .
Women in Basra play a much more important role in the family and are active in society . ”
Obviously , there ’s a lot of generalizing going on there , but the second part of his statement annoys me more than the first .
It ’s expected for a man in the Middle East to criticize women in government .
In the end it can be blamed on tradition , or called a societal taboo .
But to call a woman a lazy housewife is effin ’ rude .
To say Baghdad women are lazy in general , when they ’ve been through so much–who are the widowed left to care for children ?
Who are the mothers who lost their sons ?
Who takes care of the wounded and comforts the little ones ?— who are you , Mr. Dumaini , to say they are lazy ?
To accuse them of not fulfilling their role as mothers or caretakers sounds like it ’s coming from somewhere personal , which is why it feels like a personal jab at all women .
I feel offended by that statement .
I feel like it insults my mother .
And to the men who agree with him , to them I say , “ You put women in these boxes , and limit the role they can play , and then you complain that they are n’t fulfilling that role .
That is not evidence of anything except your own dissatisfaction with women in any sphere . ”
At least he does n’t attempt to stereotype all women , though .
Notice how he only refers to women from Baghdad .
Women from Basra are more “ domestic . ”
I do n’t get it , did Baghadiyas just stop cooking ?
I wish the article explained his statement .
You ca n’t just throw a rock like that around and hope that no one catches it .
The article goes on to talk about the provinces , and how fundamentalist mentality makes it the worst place for female candidates .
Intisar Fakhri gives us the impression that female candidates are just put on the ballot to satisfy the 30 percent rule , and not because they actually have an interest in running .
This not only paints a stark contrast to Nibras al - Mamuri , the woman quoted in CNN story , but it assumes that secular areas of Iraq produce better female candidates , which is saying a mouthful about Islam ( and women ’s rights in Islam ) .
It ’s problematic , and I wonder , would it have been so difficult to find a “ very religious ” candidate who absolutely believed she could make a positive impact in government ?
Regardless , this article does a good job of showing how contentious elections are in Iraq , for both women and men .
The threat is maximized for women of course , who have been pressured by extremists to step down , even in the form of death threats .
At the end of the article , an Iraqi nationalist leader confirms the threat , and it would seem this article is more about how fundamentalists threaten democracy in Iraq than the role women play in it
That thought is crushed in the following paragraph , and the end of the article , with the observation that more women feel pressured to run for office than pull out .
So between these two articles , one gets the impression that some Iraqi women are outspoken and ambitious while others shun the political limelight , not only because they are expected to , but because they ’d rather not be in it .
I can live with that .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The world has moved closer to the threat of a pandemic of a new kind of flu , with 149 people suspected to have died from it in Mexico and new cases being detected around the globe .
Just how bad is this new flu strain , how far will it go and how long will the outbreak last ?
Here are some questions and answers about the outbreak :
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED ?
HOW MANY ARE INFECTED ?
All deaths so far have been in Mexico , where 20 of the 149 reported fatalities have been confirmed to be from the H1N1 swine flu virus .
There are 1,600 suspected cases in Mexico and 64 confirmed cases in the United States , and a few cases in Canada , New Zealand , Britain , Spain and Israel .
WHY ARE THERE ONLY DEATHS IN MEXICO ?
No one is sure .
It is important to remember that health officials are now taking a snapshot of the past -- they are not reporting on new infections at this point , just tracking down old infections and they are only finding them where they are looking .
The Mexican authorities looked in hospitals , where serious cases will , of course , be found .
U.S. health officials found their cases during routine screening of people with flu - like symptoms , most in walk - in clinics , so they have naturally found milder cases .
Influenza experts say they fully expect to find deaths in other places , including the United States and elsewhere , as the search goes on .
One problem is that people die of respiratory diseases regularly and the cause is often not determined .
WHY WOULD IT KILL SOME AND NOT OTHERS ?
Seasonal influenza kills 250,000 to 500,000 people every year in a normal year and all sorts of factors determine who dies .
Elderly people often die but sometimes perfectly healthy adults and children die .
Sometimes flu makes people susceptible to bacterial infections , called secondary infections , and if the virus and the bacteria are circulating at the same time in the same place there can be clusters of deaths .
WHAT KIND OF FLU IS IT AND HOW IS IT SPREADING ?
The virus is an influenza A virus , carrying the designation H1N1 , but it contains DNA from avian , swine and human H1N1 viruses .
It appears to have evolved the ability to pass easily from one person to another , unlike most swine H1N1 viruses which only very occasionally infect people and usually only infect one person and then stop there .
Flu viruses are all passed on by sneezing , coughing or when people pick up the virus on their hands .
This one likely originated in pigs , but the Mexican government and the World Health Organisation have ruled out any risk of infection from eating pork .
HOW SERIOUS IS IT ?
The Geneva - based WHO has declared the flu a “ public health emergency of international concern ” and raised the threat level for a pandemic , a global epidemic of new disease .
H1N1 swine flu poses the biggest risk of a large - scale pandemic since avian flu re-emerged in 2003 , killing 257 out of 421 infected in 15 countries .
It is not clear yet whether this virus could actually become a pandemic .
HOW IS THIS FLU DIFFERENT FROM ORDINARY FLU ?
The swine flu is characterized by common flu symptoms -- sudden fever , muscle aches , sore throat and dry cough -- but may cause more severe vomiting and diarrhoea .
New flu strains can spread fast because no one has natural immunity and a vaccine can take months to develop .
This strain is confusing because it is an H1N1 -- a type that has been around since the 1918 “ Spanish Flu ” pandemic that killed at least 40 million people globally .
Usually if a new flu strain is related to one that has been around for years , people have some immunity and they no longer can cause pandemics .
But this new strain has taken on genetic elements from animal viruses , and this may be genetically unique enough to pose a pandemic threat .
HOW BAD COULD IT GET ?
A 1968 a “ Hong Kong ” flu pandemic killed about one million people globally .
The 1957 - 58 pandemic killed about 2 million .
The 1918 pandemic killed between 40 million and 100 million , according to some estimates .
However , the WHO says the world is now better prepared to withstand a flu pandemic .
Vaccines and antiviral drugs are available that were not around during previous pandemics .
In 1918 , there was a first wave of mild flu in April .
It then seemed to disappear during the Northern Hemisphere ’s summer but came back severely in August .
WHO and CDC officials say it is possible this virus could behave in the same way , or completely differently .
ARE THERE ENOUGH DRUGS AND VACCINES ?
Most countries have been stockpiling supplies of two antiviral drugs -- Tamiflu , known generically as oseltamivir and made by Roche AG and Gilead Sciences Inc ; as well as Relenza , known generically as zanamivir and made by GlaxoSmithKline and Australia ’s Biota Inc . .
A third company , BioCryst Inc. is working to licence its experimental flu drug peramivir .
Older flu drugs called amantadine and rimantadine do not work very well any longer against any influenza strain except sometimes in combination with newer drugs .
There is no vaccine yet against this new strain and health officials say the seasonal flu vaccine is unlikely to provide any protection against it .
The CDC and WHO are working with companies to start making a new vaccine if it is needed , but the process takes months .
WHAT CAN I DO ?
Wash your hands .
It is proven to be the best way to protect against infection with a range of germs , including flu .
Experts generally agree that face masks , especially the surgical masks now seen on the street of Mexico City , offer very little protection .
Flu viruses can float on little particles of spit or mucus , in general no further than three to six feet ( 1 to 2 metres ) , but they then settle on surfaces and can be transferred to the mouth , eyes or nose .
Law - enforcement officers find stun guns useful .
But they 're not for everyone .
In fact , in Michigan , they 're not for anyone -- besides law - enforcement officers and a few other professionals .
For most people , possessing an electric stun gun is a felony in this state , punishable by up to four years in prison .
A 27 - year - old Muskegon woman is facing the consequences of that law .
Shena Connor of Muskegon is charged with possessing a stun gun after police arrested her following a reported argument with another woman .
Connor was arraigned last Thursday before Chief 60th Judge Andrew J. Wierengo III .
She was scheduled for a preliminary examination April 15 and is free on a $ 5,000 personal recognizance bond .
Connor was arrested April 1 after Muskegon police responded to a report of an " armed subject " in the parking lot of the downtown Seaway Shell gas station , 275 W. Muskegon , according to a police report .
The caller , a woman sitting in one parked car , said she had been threatened with a stun gun by another woman from another car , according to Detective Sgt. Monica Shirey .
According to the police report , in the course of an argument between the two women , Connor allegedly got out of her car holding a stun gun , stood near the window of the other woman 's car and verbally threatened to stun her .
After police arrived , they searched Connor 's car and allegedly found a stun gun , Shirey said .
She was arrested , taken to jail and later charged with the felony .
More and more police agencies are getting stun guns .
Muskegon County commissioners last month approved the purchase of 15 for county sheriff 's deputies .
The devices look and function much like a handgun .
A user pulls the trigger , releasing two probes that are shot out of a cartridge .
The probes , which are attached to insulated wires , penetrate clothing and pierce the skin .
Then , 50,000 volts of electricity confuse communication between the brain and affected muscles , causing intense pain and brief paralysis .
Each shot sends a 5 - second current , a period that can be extended by holding a finger on the trigger .
Put your camera on a 2 second timer and then just run as fast as you can and as far as you can .

Some critical comments from a supporter on the ending of the Enfield Visteon occupation , which was recommended by the Unite union , despite there being no clear offer to the workers on the table .
The occupation was an inspiration for many - the spirit of the workers who refused to submit to being blatantly robbed by their bosses seemed to be what many had been waiting for , for far too long - the early possible signs of a resurgence of class struggle .
Now that the occupation is ended without any clear victory in sight , some reflection is needed on the strengths and weaknesses of what has happened .
It is always easy to be wise after the event , and necessary to be careful not to forget who initiated this struggle and took the risks .
Any criticisms are as much of ourselves as supporters as of the occupiers .
Still , we 'll never get very far in developing our struggles if we do n't reflect on where we went wrong and how we all might do things better next time .
The union pursuaded the workers to end the occupation today ( Thursday Apr 9th ) without any details of the rumoured deal being made known to them .
They are told all will be revealed on Tuesday .
The obvious question is - why then not wait until Tuesday to decide whether to leave the factory ?
There will be different answers from different interested parties .
Some workers may say they are tired from constant occupation and / or that they have been pursuaded / pressured by the union that the bosses have insisted the occupation must end to guarantee the unspecified possible deal .
The union may also claim that there could be legal penalties for failing to comply with the undertaking given in court on Monday to leave the factory by noon today .
But none of this appears very convincing or in the workers ' interest ; they have surrendered their greatest bargaining asset , the possession of the plant , its machinery and stock .
So the negotiations restart on Tuesday from a weakened position for the workers .
The picketing that is planned to replace the occupation will be less effective in preventing repossession of Visteon property .
And legal threats can probably be applied to enforce restrictions on picketing activity too .
The rough conditions in the factory should n't be underestimated , but another few days might have made all the difference to the outcome that may determine the workers ' long - term financial future .
( The Ford pension fund is already 100s of millions in the red . )
It had already been suggested that a rota system could 've been set up , with help from supporters , to ease the strain of manning the occupation .
The union may claim that the undertaking they gave in court on Monday - that the occupation would end by noon today - left them open to legal penalties ; but even the judge queried if they could guarantee the obedience of the occupiers .
One would think that all the union would 've needed to do to protect themselves is to say that they had made an effort to pursuade the occupiers to leave .
The occupiers themselves could have stayed with no legal sanctions hanging over them other than a standard possession order common in squatting cases .
The agreed undertaking with Visteon was that they would not seek possession while negotiations continue .
Visteon - and the union - made that conveniently obsolete by agreeing to postpone revealing any details of the deal until Tuesday ( if there even is any deal ) .
One can speculate that if a really satisfactory deal was on offer the union would already be shouting it from the rooftops .
The union and the left have already begun to claim this struggle as a victory on the grounds that it forced the company to the negotiating table and that it has inspired other workers .
These are partial truths , though any real assessment would have to be made after any deal is sealed .
But the fact that the workers have been maneuouvred by the union into a vulnerable position where they could easily be screwed is something not to be glossed over , as the left will want to .
This false optimism is only a means of repressing reflection on limits and strengths of what has happened , and a recipe for a repeat of the same errors in the future .
In the final meeting of occupiers no real opposition was expressed to the union 's direction to walk out .
This despite some occupiers in earlier conversation expressing a desire to carry on until a decent deal is struck .
The same union convenors , who in the beginning had said they and the other occupiers would never leave until a satisfactory deal was agreed , were now obliged to convince the workers they must leave with nothing guaranteed , only rumours of a possible mysterious deal to come .
Some in the meeting voiced serious criticisms of the union for keeping them in the dark about developments and not giving enough support to the occupation , but most were by now either relieved or resigned to walking out .
The union 's authority to ultimately decide the fate of the workers was not challenged .
Early on in the occupation , when it was mentioned that the union might pressure an end to the occupation against workers ' wishes , a couple of workers replied " ah , but we are the union " , as if the workers ' collective voice could control the union structure .
But once negotiations were organised by officials - on the other side of the world - and the whole process becomes remote and secret from the workers in the hands of specialists , they become dependent not on what they know , but on what they 're told .
And we know from long experience that the union hierarchy has its own vested interests to protect that often do n't coincide with that of the workers .
As the occupiers came out , the SWP - never ones to miss an opportunist photo - opportunity - swamped the crowd with their placards and chanted ' the workers united will never be defeated ' .
Under the circumstances , this had a hollow and ironic ring .
It began to feel , as nearly every strike has in the past 20 + years - like one more predictable stitch up by union bureaucrats - more interested in helping Nu Labour manage capitalism in crisis than feeling the need to win even modest gains for workers .
Even if a passable deal is struck next week , one could see the ending of the occupation as unnecessarily risky and bad strategy for the workers and an unsatisfactory capitulation to pressure from both Visteon and union bosses .
But it is often awkward to stick one 's neck out ; given the general identification with the union , many supporters felt sensitive about being openly critical of the union and its underlying agenda , for fear of being seen to be divisive .
But at the end of the day it 's no good repressing these criticisms - or glossing them over for the sake of some image of unity - when only the explicit recognition of these realities may prevent defeat .
It was a real contrast to see how much energy and resources went into the organising of the G20 protests compared to how much support the Visteon occupation was given .
This is partly an indication of the difference in priority , for some , given to activist protest on the one hand and class struggle on the other - and partly that many useful G20 resources had already returned to their sources outside London .
It is only now that the union - as the occupation ends - provided a caravan , brazier , toilets etc .
Documents uncovered by Visteon workers at Basildon suggest that closures have been planned for several years with the intention of restarting production with cheaper labour - and that the creation of spin off companies like Visteon is part of a long - term strategy to restructure and trim away the less profitable parts of the car industry .
So the lessons and outcome here are important for whoever is next in line for the chop .
24 hr picketing will continue , and a Ford / Visteon Supporters Group has been set up .
================
Another supporter responded to the above ;
Agreed .
I guess we have to answer the question why workers did not dare to stay inside despite the union advice .
there is the personal - moral element : the state threatened Kevin , our rep and work - mate , and the union got him out by agreeing that we would leave ( if that is actually true is a different question ) .
There is the ' organic union corruption ' element : we managed to get good lawyers and we flew your mechanic to a meeting with the big - wigs to the big apple - now how can you not collaborate with us by following our advice ?!
The legal question is such a complex and threatening thing , it seems to need specialists to understand it , either in form of well - paid lawyers or in form of semi-professional squatter advisors .
The main support by the ' anarchist ' left was ' specialised ' , e.g. in form of computer technical support , or media contacts or legal advise .
may be a focus on ' how to make decisions in bigger groups , how to spread information more equally " would have been more fruitful than getting bogged down with all the legal stuff .
It was so obvious how the relation of the occupiers with their occupation changed during the week .
at the beginning even Kevin would refer the invited journalist to the security guards at the main gate in order to ask for permission to enter the factory .
The next day , after some back and forth with the security guards the workers just pushed open the gates , and a dozen of scruffy anarchist could enter the plant .
The union 's decision to declare that the ' unknown legal person ' in court are ' unite members ' changed the atmosphere : outsiders had to leave the plant , in the end there was only X allowed to stay inside ( because he has been inside right from the first minute ) , but during the meeting with the union official Wednesday night even he had to stay outside .
On top of the legal attack there is the state in form of the job centre starting to individualise people .
all workers get individual letters , during the last days they had to appear at the job centre , filling out their first ever dole claim , they have to sort out their mortgages .
no attempt to undermine this form of decomposition as ' unemployed ' .
Most pressing unanswered question relate to the material power : what about southampton not having enough parts to continue production ?
what about the rumors that visteon want to open a shadow company and keep production in the UK , may be even inside the plant in enfield ?
What about the plan to shift some of the machines to Berlin ?
What is the situation at the Visteon Enfield suppliers , one of them 3 M , the company where workers in France boss - napped the management only some weeks ago ?
What is actually behind the rather empty promise of the Ford workers reps to black Visteon parts - what are Ford workers willing to do ?
Without being able to answer these questions it will be difficult to give workers ' better advice ' .
In france there was an attempt to transform some of the factories in struggle against closures into something like nods for wider discontent against job cuts , e.g. by holding a struggle conference of workers affected by job cuts in one of the plants .
If , for example , some city cleaners and sacked call centre workers would have started to link their situation with the one in Enfield , it could have bridged the ( geographical ) gap to the ' London ' class situation .
The question now is whether we can encourage the workers to develop a more collective way to deal with the probably pathetic outcome of the Tuesday negotiations ...
This was posted on wsws today , quite good report about a factory occupation in France .
I will print it out and take it along to the rally tomorrow ...
http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/apr2009/occu-a10.shtml
I will show an even greater connection between energy prices , interest rates , and the financial sector , based in large part on a review of minutes of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) from the end of 2002 to 2007 .
It appears the Fed ’s inflation expectations were very closely linked to petroleum prices .
Because of this , the rise in oil prices led the Fed to raise interest rates in an attempt to control inflation , which in turn had unintended consequences .
Hamilton acknowledges early on in his report that the proportion of income spent on energy is an important determinant of consumer spending patterns .
The theory is fairly simple : if energy expenditures rise faster than income , then the share of income for other things besides purchasing energy must decline , such as spending on mortgage payments for a second home in Las Vegas .
In other words , rapid , large increases in energy prices may curtail consumption enough to trigger larger financial problems – like the bursting of a housing bubble – that when aggregated across an economy may cause or contribute significantly to a recession .
Last week , Dave Murphy ( EROI Guy ) explored how increasing energy prices during the run up to 2008 's $ 147 bbl peak affected purchasing power of consumers and subsequently the solvency of the establishment that relied on that purchasing power .
He mentions James Hamilton :
The US and the world 's finance system uses an operating approach called Structured Finance .
This is a system for the management of credit using assets such stock and real estate as collateral for highly leveraged lending .
The products of this lending are ' Structured ' into securities .
This finance system makes money by borrowing funds at low rates such as LIBOR + 1 percent ( 2.5 % ) and lending at higher rates such as 6 % .
The system keeps the difference .
Here is a graph illustrating the relationship between the Funds target rate which represents the lowest - cost borrowed money and the 30 year conventional mortgage rate .
Figure 1
The difference or spread between the funds and mortgage rates at any given time represents return to the finance system .
When the spread narrows as it did from 2005 - 2007 , there is danger to the system .
Rates follow a ' yield curve ' : lowest rates are short term and the higher rates are longer term .
There is substantial risk that the system may be ' underwater ' if short term rates rise after longer term loans are made at a low rate .
The return from the longer termed security is inadequate to service the system 's short - term money costs .
Structured finance is organized around the flow of funds .
It applies the pricing effect of ' velocity of money ' to capital assets rather than to consumables .
Velocity of money is the rate of turnover of transactions within any given place and time .
Repeat transactions have the same effect as a proportionate increase in the money supply .
This effect was observed and described as the ' Quantity of Money ' theory by Irving Fisher , derived from Ludwig von Mises , John Stuart Mill and originating with Copernicus :
If changes in the quantity of money affect prices , so will changes in the other factors — quantities of goods and velocity of circulation — affect prices , and in a very similar manner .
Thus a doubling in the velocity of circulation of money will double the level of prices , provided the quantity of money in circulation and the quantities of goods exchanged for money remain as before ...
Raising the price of small items by virtue of everyone in town buying them repeatedly requires pocket change .
Raising the price of millions of houses by tens or hundreds of thousand of dollars each or raising share prices of gigantic multinational corporations requires tremendous financial horsepower -- which is the end purpose of structured finance .
By raising asset prices , collateral values are also raised .
This allows more lending against that increase in collateral -- which then drives prices even further in a virtuous cycle .
Clever American financiers invented a sort of financial perpetual motion machine .
The Funds rate is a target set by the Federal Reserve system which is tasked with managing the nation 's money supply .
Its most important role is to control inflation .
Eight times a year , the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) which is made up of the seven members of the Board of Governors , the president of the New York Fed and four presidents of other Fed system banks meets in Washington to examine the performance of the economy and set short term interest rate targets .
Records are published of these meetings and made public .
These records are available online and a relevant summary is also posted on my blog .
Figure 2
Figure 2 illustrates the Fed 's response to inflation by its raising short - term interest rates .
Increases act as a governor on demand by increasing the cost of credit .
In recessionary periods , the Fed decreases credit rates in order to stimulate lending .
The ' Open Market Desk ' at the New York Fed performs this job by trading Treasury securities to commercial banks .
The background of our current situation lies in the remarkable period prior to 2002 .
Fed Governor ( at the time ) Ben Bernanke mentioned this period in remarks given in 2004 :
Several writers on the topic have dubbed this remarkable decline in the variability of both output and inflation " the Great Moderation . "
Similar declines in the volatility of output and inflation occurred at about the same time in other major industrial countries , with the recent exception of Japan , a country that has faced a distinctive set of economic problems in the past decade .
A component of this Great Moderation was low and stable petroleum prices .
Figure 3 based on EIA Data
As can be seen , from 1990 until the end of 2001 , energy prices remained within a volatility range between $ 20 - 25 with short periods lower or higher .
The average price for the period was $ 21.04 .
Energy prices and interest rates have a lengthy historical relationship .
Figure 4 plots short term interest rates from 1955 alongside US recessions with energy prices in constant 1982 dollars .
Figure 4
Created by superimposing oil prices in 1982 dollars from here on graph by research.stlouisfed.org
The Fed is careful to watch energy prices as price increases directly contribute to inflation .
As can been seen in the plot , rising interest rates and energy prices have preceded US recessions since 1973 .
Even the 1991 ' Mystery Recession ' was accompanied by a spike in energy prices after Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait .
During FOMC meetings from 2003 - 2006 the committee cited rising energy prices and the inflationary effects of this rise at almost every meeting .
Beginning in 2004 , the Fed steadily increased the Funds rates starting in June .
The year over year increase in energy cost can be seen in Figure 3 : 2002 average price was $ 26.11 , 2003 average was $ 31.12 and the 2004 period was set to average $ 41.44 .
This remark from the December 29 , 2002 meeting is typical of the period .
Note that the Fed uses different methods to gauge inflation :
Core consumer price inflation , as measured by the consumer price index ( CPI ) and the chain - weighted personal consumption expenditure ( PCE ) index , continued to edge lower through the end of the year .
However , the sizable run-up in energy prices last year boosted overall consumer price inflation somewhat on a year - over - year basis .
At the producer level , core prices for finished goods declined in November and December , but for the year as a whole the jump in energy prices pushed overall producer prices for finished goods up slightly .
( Per - barrel price at the time of the meeting was $ 29.46 )
http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/minutes/20030129.htm
Overall inflation in 2003 was low with the exception of a steady rise in energy prices that are noted in all but one of the FOMC meetings .
The Funds rate for 2003 was an extraordinarily accommodative 1.25 - 1 % :. :
Total twelve - month consumer inflation was unchanged over the period owing to accelerations in food and energy prices .
( $ 43.15 ) http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/minutes/20031209.htm
Total consumer price inflation , however , was boosted in January by a surge in energy prices . ( $ 36.75 ) http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/minutes/20040316.htm
In the United States , the core consumer price index advanced at a faster rate in the first quarter than it had in the fourth quarter , reflecting the pass - through of higher energy prices and a leveling off of goods prices after sizable declines last year .
( $ 40.28 ) http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/minutes/20040504.htm
At the June , 2004 meeting the Governors voted to increase rates by 0.25 % .
They would do so at each subsequent meeting .
In light of the strength of economic activity and recent indications of somewhat increased price pressures , the members focused particular attention on the outlook for inflation .
They referred to statistical and anecdotal evidence that on the whole pointed to some recent acceleration of consumer prices and to some increase in near - term inflation expectations .
Factors cited in this regard included large increases in prices of energy and intermediate materials , both of which appeared to be passing through at least in part to core consumer prices .
( $ 38.03 ) http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/minutes/20040630.htm
A year and a half later , in February 2005 , the acceleration of inflation was an increased concern .
Energy - cost for that year would average $ 51.62 a barrel .
Rate increases had not slowed the increase in fuel prices but begun to constrain housing , which is credit sensitive .
The emphasis at meetings was on sharply higher crude oil prices .
The first hints of softening in the housing sector was noted in February 2005 :
Moreover , the recent rebound in spot crude oil prices , and especially the substantial advance in prices of crude oil futures contracts for delivery well into the future , suggested that a significant unwinding of higher energy costs might not be in prospect .
Several participants indicated that , in current circumstances , they viewed an upside surprise to inflation as potentially more harmful than an equivalent downside surprise , partly because such an outcome could well impart additional upward momentum to inflation expectations .
( $ 54.19 ) http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/minutes/20050322.htm
In August , Katrina had hit the Gulf coast and its effects were noted in the minutes along with consequential energy price increases .
Participants questioned the effect of higher energy prices on business investment .
Inflation was a concern .
The Funds rate was 3½ percent :
Participants ' concerns about inflation prospects generally had increased over the intermeeting period .
The surge in energy prices , in particular , was boosting overall inflation , and some of that increase would probably pass through for a time into core prices .
This posed the risk that there could be a more persistent influence on inflation should inflation expectations rise .
Indeed , some recent survey evidence on such expectations had been troubling , and widening federal deficits were mentioned as a factor that could further stir inflationary concerns .
( $ 65.59 ) http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/minutes/20050920.htm
By the end of 2005 the increase in oil and energy prices had become a preoccupation of the Federal Reserve .
The end of 2005 turned out to be the peak of the housing bubble :
The funds rate had increased over the year from 2.25 to 4 % .
Here , the Fed makes one of its rare acknowledgments of the effects of its interest rate increases on housing :
Activity in the housing market remained brisk despite a rise in mortgage interest rates .
Starts of new single - family homes dropped back somewhat in October from September 's very strong pace , but permit issuance remained elevated .
New home sales reached a new high in October , and existing home sales eased off only a little from the high levels recorded during the summer .
Other available indicators of housing activity were on the soft side :
An index of mortgage applications for purchases of homes declined in November , and builders ' ratings of new home sales had fallen off in recent months .
In addition , survey measures of home buying attitudes had declined to levels last observed in the early 1990s .
( $ 59.41 ) http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/minutes/20051213.htm
At the January 31 , 2006 meeting , there was more comment on interest rate effects on mortgage lending .
Keep in mind that loan originations are by non- bank businesses that do not report to the Fed : After this meeting , Ben Bernanke replaced retiring Alan Greenspan as Fed Chairman :
In some areas , home price appreciation reportedly had slowed noticeably , highlighting the risks to aggregate demand of a pullback in the housing sector .
For instance , the effects of a leveling out of housing wealth on the saving rate were difficult to predict , but , in the view of some , potentially sizable .
Rising debt service costs , owing in part to the reprising of variable - rate mortgages , were also mentioned as possibly restraining the discretionary spending of consumers .

In subsequent meetings during 2006 the steady rise in energy prices was noted : " registering a large increase in January that was driven mostly by a spike in energy prices . " , " retail gasoline prices surged , leading to a jump in overall energy prices for the month " , " sharp increases in the prices of petroleum - based products " .
At the July 29 , 2006 meeting the funds rate was raised 5 ¼ % .
At this point , FOMC meetings contained two narratives , the steady increase in fuel prices and the ongoing deterioration in the housing sector :
In their discussion of the major sectors of the economy , participants observed that housing construction activity had declined notably in recent months as indicated by lower housing starts and permits ; moreover , higher inventories of unsold homes , a sharp rise in cancellations of new home sales , and reports from construction companies suggested that the weakness was likely to be extended .
Several participants pointed out that the decline was broadly in line with expectations in light of the tightening in monetary policy and the rapid run-up in home prices and residential construction in recent years .
Participants also observed that the evidence to date indicated that the slowdown was orderly but were mindful of the possibility of a sharper downturn in the sector .
The growth of consumer spending had dropped off significantly in the second quarter from a robust pace earlier in the year .
The slowdown was attributed in part to higher energy prices and also to a likely downshift in home price appreciation and higher interest rates .
A reduction in the attractiveness of home equity borrowing was mentioned as possibly contributing to the slowdown .

At the Treasury Department , the likelihood of a displacement was under discussion as early as 2005 .
The focus was both the effects of rising rates as well as a fuel price spike :
Secretary Paulson on this arrival in summer 2006 ( DATE ) told Treasury staff that it was time to prepare for a financial system challenge .
As he put it , credit market conditions had been so easy for so long that it was inevitable that credit problems had built up that would lead to problems if conditions reversed .
From summer 2006
Treasury staff had worked to identify potential financial market challenges and possible policy approaches , both near term and over the horizon .
The longer - range policy discussions eventually turned into the March 2008 Treasury Blueprint for Financial Markets Regulatory Reform that provided a high - level approach to financial markets reform .
Consideration of near - term situations included sudden crises such as terror attacks , natural disasters , or massive power blackouts ; market - driven events such as the failure of a major financial institution , a large sovereign government default , or huge losses at hedge funds ; or slower - moving macroeconomic developments such as energy price shocks , a prolonged economic downturn that sparked wholesale corporate bankruptcies , or a large and disorderly movement in the exchange value of the dollar that led to financial market difficulties .
None of these were seen as imminent in mid-to - late 2006 , and particularly not with the magnitude that would eventually occur in terms of the impact on output and employment .
http://www.econ.yale.edu/seminars/macro/mac08/Swagel-090409.pdf
That impact would be considerable ; in February , 2007 , Freddie Mac stopped accepting certain sub - prime mortgage securities for purchase .
The crisis was officially underway : A barrel of West Texas Intermediate in Cushing , Oklahoma cost $ 59.28 .
http://timeline.stlouisfed.org/index.cfm?p=timeline
A number of conclusions can be drawn from these documents .
One is that energy contributed to Fed actions .
Another is that the current crisis has developed similarly to other US recessions .
Even the geopolitical background - Mideast tension and war - is similar to other recessionary periods .
The sequence of events is :
A rise in energy prices -> increased inflation -> higher short term interest rates -> a slowdown in credit - sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing and lending -> a general slowdown in the economy as a whole .
Mr. Bernanke outlines the sequence in his ' Great Moderation ' address quoted previously .
The large difference this time compared to other ' energy crises ' is that there are no gas lines or odd - even rationing which would focus public attention on energy rather than on finance .
In the past , inflation was constrained by punishingly high short term money costs along with new petroleum supplies introduced from North Sea and Prudhoe Bay sources .
Currently , inflation has been constrained by punishingly high energy costs .
The yearly average price for crude in 2008 was $ 90.89 !
This would imply short term rates of 15.25 % .
Oil from a new North Sea or North Slope does not appear available , today .
The current year ( 2009 ) average is a relatively inexpensive $ 42.91 for the first three months .
What is troubling is the absence of the mention of energy anywhere in the public discussion .
Outside of relatively obscure records of Fed policy making , it is difficult to find ' oil prices ' or even ' interest rate increases ' in statements or announcements by either the Federal Reserve , its officers or the Treasury .
I will leave to others whether this absence is in the public interest .
A significant difference between the current crisis and recessions past has been the growth of and reliance upon structured finance .
An " unintended consequence " is its demonstrated vulnerability to what has to be considered a routine increase in short - term interest rates .
The housing bubble and the follow - up ' petroleum bubble ' illuminates one flaw - - it works too well !
It inflates asset prices to levels unsupportable by fundamentals .
One reason for the 2008 oil price acceleration was the flow of funds or quantity of money ' effect on the fuel market .
The turnover or velocity of transactions in both the spot and futures markets by hedge funds and other structured finance participants had a large inflationary effect .
As in housing , once the velocity of transactions slowed - due to unsupportable pump prices stifling demand - the inflating effect of the turnovers was removed and prices reversed .
( CNN ) -- Remember the dire predictions surrounding the " millennium bug ? "
The doom - and - gloom scenarios bandied about by security analysts on how computers could act when their clocks turned to January 1 , 2000 ?
Computer users will not know that Conficker.c has infected their machine .
Well , researchers are hoping that a potential April Fools ' time bomb -- the Conficker .c that is supposed to hit computers on April 1 -- turns out to be equally unfounded .
But realizing that hope alone is not a prudent option , here is a primer on the worm so you can adequately prepare yourself -- and your computer .
What is Conficker.c and what do analysts fear it may do ?
Conficker .c is a worm , a malicious program thought to have already infected between 5 million and 10 million computers .
Those infections have n't spawned many symptoms , but on April 1 a master computer is scheduled to gain control of these zombie machines , said Don DeBolt , director of threat research for CA , a New York - based IT and software company .
What happens on April Fool 's Day is anyone 's guess .
The program could delete all of the files on a person 's computer , use zombie PCs -- those controlled by a master -- to overwhelm and shut down Web sites or monitor a person 's keyboard strokes to collect private information like passwords or bank account information , experts said .
More likely , though , said DeBolt , the virus may try to get computer users to buy fake software or spend money on other phony products .
Experts said computer hackers largely have moved away from showboating and causing random trouble .
They now usually try to make money off their viral programs .
Watch more on the worm »
How does the Conficker .c work ?
Conficker .c imbeds itself deep in the computer where it is difficult to track .
The program , for instance , stops Windows from conducting automatic updates that could prevent it from causing damage .
The program 's code is also written to evolve over time and its author appears to be making updates to thwart attempts to neuter the worm .
Who wrote the program ?
It 's unclear who wrote the program , but anti-work researchers -- a group calling itself the Conficker Cabal -- are looking for clues .
First , they know that some recent programs have come from Eastern European countries outside the jurisdiction of the European Union , said Patrick Morganelli , senior vice president of technology for Enigma Software .
Worm program authors often hide in those countries to stay out of sight from law enforcement , he said .
In a way , the Conficker Cabal is also looking for the program author 's fingerprints .
DeBolt said security researchers are looking through old programs to see if their programming styles are similar to that of Conficker C .
The prospects for catching the program 's author are not good , Morganelli said .
" Unless they open their mouth , they 'll never be found , " he said .
So , the most effective counter - assault simply may be damage control .
How can I tell if my computer 's infected ?
One quick way to see if your computer has been infected is to see if you have gotten automatic updates from Windows in March .
If so , your computer likely is fine , DeBolt said .
Microsoft released a statement saying the company " is actively working with the industry to mitigate the spread of the worm . "
Users who have n't gotten the latest Windows updates should go to http://safety.live.com if they fear they 're infected , the company 's statement says .
People who use other antivirus software should check to make sure they 've received the latest updates , which also could have been disabled by Conficker .c .
How did the worm evolve ?
The first version of Conficker -- strain A -- was released in late 2008 .
That version used 250 Web addresses -- generated daily by the system -- as the means of communication between the master computer and its zombies .
The end goal of the first line was to sell computer users fake antivirus software , said Morganelli .
Computer security experts largely patched that problem by working with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers to disable or buy the problematic URLs , he said .
A second variant , Conficker.b , was released in January and infected millions more machines .
The Conficker , strain C , will generate 50,000 URLs per day instead of just 250 when it becomes active , DeBolt said .
What is being done to fight Conficker ?
Members are searching for the malicious software program 's author and for ways to do damage control if he or she can't be stopped .
They 're motivated in part by a $ 250,000 bounty from Microsoft .
OTTAWA —
The federal government barely recorded a surplus for January , as steep falls in corporate tax and GST revenue were offset by a 3 % reduction in program spending .
With two months left in the 2008 - 09 fiscal year , Ottawa has a budget surplus of $ 496 - million , or 95 % down from the same year - ago period , according the Department of Finance ’s monthly Fiscal Monitor publication .
The recent budget projected a small deficit for this fiscal year , ending on Tuesday , of $ 1.1 - billion .
For January , Ottawa posted a $ 37 - million surplus , or a 97 % drop from the same month a year ago .
This was based on revenue of $ 19.6 - billion , down nearly 10 % from year ago .
The fall was spearheaded by a whopping 44.4 % plunge in corporate tax receipts , and a 26.5 % decline in GST revenue .
Also , personal income tax declined by 1 % , which the department said was a result of measures incorporated in the Jan. 27 budget .
Revenue from the air travel security fee dropped 7 % , based on fewer Canadians travelling .
Expenses for the month , however , dropped slightly , by 3 % , to $ 17.1 - billion , based on decreases in spending at certain departments and agencies – in particular at Agriculture Canada .
Transfers to individuals and other levels of government , meanwhile , both increased , by 4.7 % and 4.9 % respectively .
For the 10 - month period up to Jan. 31 , there is a budget surplus of $ 496 - million , well below the $ 9.6 - billion Ottawa recorded for the year - ago timeframe .
Revenue is down 1.7 % , powered by a 21 % fall in corporate tax receipts and 14.6 % less GST cash .
Program spending , however , is up 4.7 % , on higher transfers to households and other levels of government .
Parliament ’s independent budget watchdog suggested this week the economy would contract 8.5 % in the first quarter – which could translate into further drops in revenue for the last two months of this fiscal year , and a year - end deficit that is close to the budget projection .
Meanwhile , the Fiscal Monitor noted that in January , Ottawa issued $ 19 - billion of government debt , mainly bonds and treasury bills , to help finance activities , such as efforts to improve credit conditions in financial markets in the midst of a global credit crisis .
For the fiscal year up to Jan. 31 , Ottawa has issued $ 89 - billion of market debt – whereas in the year - ago period , Finance had removed nearly $ 30 - billion of bonds and treasury bills from the marketplace .
The increase also reflects a recent move in which the department took over responsibility for debt issues on behalf of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. , Business Development Bank of Canada and Farm Credit Canada .

On Friday , EFF and the law firm of Fish and Richardson filed an emergency motion to quash [ pdf ] and for the return of seized property on behalf of a Boston College computer science student whose computers , cell phone , and other property were seized as part of an investigation into who sent an e-mail to a school mailing list identifying another student as gay .
The problem ?
Not only is there no indication that any crime was committed , the investigating officer argued that the computer expertise of the student itself supported a finding of probable cause to seize the student ’s property .
The warrant application [ pdf ] cites the following allegedly suspicious behavior :
Should Boston College Linux users be looking over their shoulders ?
[ efoods ]
In his application , the investigating officer asked that he be permitted to seize the student ’s computers and other personal affects because they might yield evidence of the crimes of " Obtaining computer services by Fraud or Misrepresentation " and " Unauthorized access to a computer system . "
Aside from the remarkable overreach by campus and state police in trying to paint a student as suspicious in part because he can navigate a non-Windows computer environment , nothing cited in the warrant application could possibly constitute the cited criminal offenses .
There are no assertions that a commercial ( i.e. for pay ) commercial service was defrauded , a necessary element of any " Obtaining computer services by Fraud or Misrepresentation " allegation .
Similarly , the investigating officer does n’t explain how sending an e-mail to a campus mailing list might constitute " unauthorized access to a computer system . "
During its March 30th search , police seized ( among other things ) the computer science major ’s computers , storage drives , cell phone , iPod Touch , flash drives , digital camera , and Ubuntu Linux CD .
None of these items have been returned .
He has been suspended from his job pending the investigation .
His personal documents and information are in the hands of the state police who continue to examine it without probable cause , searching for evidence to support unsupportable criminal allegations .
Next up ?
An emergency court hearing as soon as the court will hear us in which we will ask that the search warrant be voided and the student ’s property returned .
Stay tuned …

It often happens that a disc only month old is damaged , in which case you take it back to the store where you bought it , since it is already under warranty .
However , it can always happen only to start up your old computer as every time before and suddenly , you hear a strange sound , which your disc most probably made .
It really is not the nicest of feelings knowing that you have just lost hundreds of gigabytes of information .
Hard discs do not last forever .
But , there is no need to start panicking immediately .
You should think about the possibilities to save the most important information .
Naturally , there are specialized companies that are specialized with saving the information .
But , it is often very expensive and out of the question , so we often decide in favor of some alternative and rather strange decisions , which may work from time to time .
The solution we are describing today includes disc freezing .
Disc freezing works mostly if your disc is broken and you hear a strange clicking sound in it .
In most cases , the head of the disc moves from the center so you can hear strange noises , and in case you freeze it , it will fix the head for a while .
The first thing you need to do is take the disc out and put it in a closed little plastic box to avoid sweating .
After that , put it in the refrigerator and wait from an hour until 24 hours , depending on how long you can wait and how frozen you want it to be .
That means that if you keep it in the refrigerator for a longer time , you will be able to retrieve more information .
After keeping your disc in the refrigerator long , enough take it out and connect it to the computer as soon as possible .
Start the computer as soon as possible as well .
If your computer does recognize the disc , try to save as much information as you can in a hurry , because the disc will not work anymore once it gets warm .
You may repeat this process several times to save more information until all – or most of your data will be stored in a safe place .

The Israeli military said Wednesday that internal investigations concluded that the army “ operated in accordance with international law ” throughout last winter ’s war in the Gaza Strip against Hamas fighters who terrorized Israeli civilians and , according to the army , exploited Palestinians as human shields .
The Israel Defense Forces conceded that Palestinian civilians died because of mistakes in intelligence and targeting , but said the military did not find any case in which a soldier deliberately shot a civilian .
International human rights organizations have called for independent investigations into war crimes allegations against the Israelis .
Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi appointed five colonels to investigate soldiers ’ conduct during the operation , known in Israel as Operation Cast Lead .
They examined “ tens ” of cases involving claims that the military had targeted United Nations and other international facilities , as well as medical facilities and personnel .
They also studied incidents involving particularly high numbers of civilian casualties , use of weapons containing phosphorus , and damage to infrastructure and destruction of buildings by ground forces .
“ The investigations revealed a very small number of incidents in which intelligence or operational errors took place during the fighting , ” the army said .
“ These unfortunate incidents were unavoidable and occur in all combat situations , in particular of the type which Hamas forced on the IDF by choosing to fight from within the civilian population . ”

Defense Minister Ehud Barak expressed regret for the suffering of innocent people but said the Israeli army did not fear investigations and was one of the world ’s most moral forces .
Like many disputes during the war , the number of victims has been a matter of intense disagreement .
In March , the army said that of the 1,166 Palestinians killed during the operation , 709 were “ Hamas terror operatives . ”
A further 162 men , the military said , “ have not been yet attributed to any organization . ”
And it said that 295 of those who died -- about a quarter of all fatalities -- had been “ uninvolved civilians . ”
Left - wing Israeli legislator Ilan Gilon said that “ calling the death of 295 civilians an ‘ operational malfunction ’ is a cynical perception of human life . ”

One of the actions the army classified as a mistake occurred Jan. 6 in the Gaza City neighborhood of Zeitoun .
Intelligence had provided information about a target believed to be a weapons cache .
The army ’s standard warning by phone and other measures was issued to the right address , but the air force was given different coordinates and 21 members of a family were killed .
Concerning the use of white phosphorus , the army has maintained that all use of such munitions was in keeping with international law .
Still , it discontinued the use of phosphorus relatively early because of criticism .
Human Rights
Watch has charged that Israel ’s use of phosphorus was indiscriminate , caused unnecessary suffering and death , and constituted evidence of war crimes .
Allegations of war crimes have persisted since the fighting ended in January .
A number of soldiers have come forward to say that in some cases civilian Palestinian lives were not respected .
The Israeli government has pledged its legal support to any officials or soldiers who might be charged abroad .
News reports from Oslo said Wednesday that a group of lawyers filed a complaint accusing 10 Israelis of war crimes in Gaza under Norway ’s new universal jurisdiction law .

Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , Barak and opposition leader and former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni were among the 10 .
Israeli and international rights organizations have urged Israel to cooperate with a U.N. inquiry led by Richard Goldstone , a South African judge who formerly was chief prosecutor for the war crimes tribunals on Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia .

If conservatives do n’t want to be seen as bitter people who cling to their guns and religion and anti-immigrant sentiments , they should stop being bitter and clinging to their guns , religion and anti-immigrant sentiments .
It ’s been a week now , and I still do n’t know what those “ tea bag ” protests were about .
I saw signs protesting abortion , illegal immigrants , the bank bailout and that gay guy who ’s going to win “ American Idol . ”
But it was n’t tax day that made them crazy ; it was election day .
Because that ’s when Republicans became what they fear most : a minority .
The conservative base is absolutely apoplectic because , because ... well , nobody knows .
They ’re mad as hell , and they ’re not going to take it anymore .
Even though they ’re not quite sure what “ it ” is .
But they know they ’re fed up with “ it , ” and that “ it ” has got to stop .
Here are the big issues for normal people : the war , the economy , the environment , mending fences with our enemies and allies , and the rule of law .
And here ’s the list of Republican obsessions since President Obama took office : that his birth certificate is supposedly fake , he uses a teleprompter too much , he bowed to a Saudi guy , Europeans like him , he gives inappropriate gifts , his wife shamelessly flaunts her upper arms , and he shook hands with Hugo Chavez and slipped him the nuclear launch codes .
Do these sound like the concerns of a healthy , vibrant political party ?
It ’s sad what ’s happened to the Republicans .
They used to be the party of the big tent ; now they ’re the party of the sideshow attraction , a socially awkward group of mostly white people who speak a language only they understand .
Like Trekkies , but paranoid .
The GOP base is convinced that Obama is going to raise their taxes , which he just lowered .
But , you say , “ Bill , that ’s just the fringe of the Republican Party . ”
No , it ’s not .
The governor of Texas , Rick Perry , is not afraid to say publicly that thinking out loud about Texas seceding from the Union is appropriate considering that ... Obama wants to raise taxes 3 % on 5 % of the people ?
I ’m not sure exactly what Perry ’s independent nation would look like , but I ’m pretty sure it would be free of taxes and Planned Parenthood .
And I would have to totally rethink my position on a border fence .
I know .
It ’s not about what Obama ’s done .
It ’s what he ’s planning .
But you ca n’t be sick and tired of something someone might do .
Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota recently said she fears that Obama will build “ reeducation ” camps to indoctrinate young people .
But Obama has n’t made any moves toward taking anyone ’s guns , and with money as tight as it is , the last thing the president wants to do is run a camp where he has to shelter and feed a bunch of fat , angry white people .
Look , I get it , “ real America . ”
After an eight - year run of controlling the White House , Congress and the Supreme Court , this latest election has you feeling like a rejected husband .
You ’ve come home to find your things out on the front lawn -- or at least more things than you usually keep out on the front lawn .
You ’re not ready to let go , but the country you love is moving on .
And now you want to call it a whore and key its car .
That ’s what you are , the bitter divorced guy whose country has left him -- obsessing over it , haranguing it , blubbering one minute about how much you love it and vowing the next that if you cannot have it , nobody will .
But it ’s been almost 100 days , and your country is not coming back to you .
She ’s found somebody new .
And it ’s a black guy .
The healthy thing to do is to just get past it and learn to cherish the memories .
You ’ll always have New Orleans and Abu Ghraib .
And if today ’s conservatives are insulted by this , because they feel they ’re better than the people who have the microphone in their party , then I say to them what I would say to moderate Muslims : Denounce your radicals .
To paraphrase George W. Bush , either you ’re with them or you ’re embarrassed by them .
The thing that you people out of power have to remember is that the people in power are not secretly plotting against you .
They do n’t need to .
They already beat you in public .
Three years ago Larry Brilliant joined Google to head up its philanthropic arm : today he announced that he 's parting ways with the internet giant .
In an announcement , the 64 - year - old said he was leaving Google.org to join a new organisation set up by former eBay president Jeff Skoll .
" Looking back over the past three years , I 'm incredibly proud of the work done by the team at Google.org to support wonderful projects and people , " said Brilliant in a statement on Google 's blog .
" These two organizations are neither competitors nor strangers , but rather friends and colleagues … in the coming months and years we can expand that relationship even more . "
Dr Brilliant – a former World Health Organisation executive who has worked on a number of public health initiatives – will head the Skoll Urgent Threats Fund , a group supporting initiatives to solve problems such as climate change , water scarcity and pandemics .
The fund is the brainchild of Skoll , the billionaire founding president of eBay who now runs his own philanthropic organisation , the Skoll Foundation , as well as Participant Media – the behind campaigning films such as An Inconvenient Truth , Syriana and Good Night and Good Luck .
" This new organisation is designed to make serious headway on these issues by identifying and supporting the most innovative initiatives and solutions out there , " said Skoll in a statement .
" I can't think of anyone better prepared to shape and lead this effort than Larry Brilliant . "
Dr Brilliant said he would remain an advisor to Google , where he has been overseeing its philanthropic efforts since being persuaded to take up the role of executive director in 2007 .
In that time , the group has announced major projects focused on renewable energy and pandemic prediction , as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of investments in a wide range of other schemes .
However , earlier this year he stepped aside into an advisory role – handing to Google executive Megan Smith as the organisation started to rein in its focus a little ( one insider explained it to me as trying to make better use of the skills and technologies that Google could offer up … others described it as making Google.org " more Googley " ) .
When I interviewed him last year , Brilliant explained how he'd needed some persuasion to overcome his worries about joining .org in the first place .
" I 'd be dishonest if I said I did n't have concerns , " he admits .
" I was particularly concerned at the impatience of engineers - especially because I 've run internet companies .
" I used to teach my students that their schemes would n't be successful until two things happened : that they would be able to run without you , and that you knew the names of the grandchildren of the people you started the project with : that 's because it takes a generation . "
There 's no suggestion that any sense of impatience from Google has precipitated this change , but it's also clear that some of the subjects that really motivated Brilliant – the sort of big , global health challenges that he 's taken on in the past – were not quite as a priority for Google.org as they were in the past .

The Financial Fiasco of Two - Thousand Eight ( FFTTE )
--- Financial rescue or Gang Rape of the Taxpayer ?
WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THE U. S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM
A SHORT HISTORY OF THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM FROM 1930
It has been more than three - quarters of a century since the start of the Great Depression .
That horrific period began with a collapse of the financial system .
Before it was over , 40 % of all commercial banks ( nearly 10,000 of them ) had been permanently closed , many a result of Roosevelt ’s “ banking holiday ” .
A so - called New Deal began and sweeping changes were made to the financial system .
The Glass - Steagall Act ( enacted in 1933 --- 1999 )
http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/testimony/1998/19980617.htm
forced the divestiture by commercial banks of most of their other non-depository activities such as insurance , investment banking ( broker , dealer , and underwriter ) , etc .
Since checkable deposits were rapidly becoming the more popular form of medium of exchange money ( referred to as M - 1 money nowadays ) , deposit insurance was enacted with the establishment of agencies such as the FDIC ( About the FDIC - http://www.fdic.gov/anniversary/about.html).
Beginning with the McFadden Act 1927 , through current http://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/learning/when/1920s.html
Even prior to the Great Depression , Congress had passed the McFadden Act to prevent the concentration of financial power .
Interstate branching by commercial banks was no longer allowed by the passage of this Act .
Interest rates , primarily those paid and charged by commercial banks , came under the jurisdiction of the FED in the now long departed Regulation Q as well as federal usury ceilings on loans .
The Federal Reserve System ( FED ) , the central bank of the United States , was reorganized .
Essentially , the power of the 12 District Banks was made subservient to the Board of Governors , whose power was significantly increased .
The list of changes made by the Roosevelt lead New Dealers goes on and on .
Some of this legislation proved helpful and continues on today .
Much of the change that occurred in the 1930s has gradually been eliminated or significantly overhauled by legislative , regulatory , and judicial activities .
The separation of commercial banking activities from other activities such as investment banking is now gone and thru the establishment of holding companies , many financial services are housed under the roof of giant holding companies such as Citigroup .
In theory , fire walls of separation between the subsidiaries of the holding company were to be established and maintained , but in practice , those walls have often proven to be more like combustible papier - mâché .
Interest rate ceilings on deposits are a thing of the past .
Usury ceilings on consumer loans at the federal level have been eliminated .
The formerly - called thrift institutions ( credit unions , savings banks , and savings and loan associations ) have been given the power to create checkable deposits , that part of M - 1 or medium of exchange money that facilitates around 90 % of the legitimate transactions of the American economy ( the other illegitimate part of the economy is referred to as the underground economy where activities are illegal and indictable ) .
Deposit insurance has been gradually raised from $ 2,500 in January 1934 to the newly established ceiling of $ 250,000 .
Congress was not directly responsible for all of the changes .
The inflation of the 1970s , especially the roaring inflation of the late 1970s , caused enormous and rapid changes in the landscape of the financial markets .
The explosion of change in the markets led to many new financial products and processes such as : securitization , asset - liability management , the growth and increased use of the external currency markets ( e.g. Eurodollars ) , stripping of coupon bonds , adjustable rate mortgages , heightened cash management practices such as swept balances , an increasing variety of derivatives , etc. etc .
These changes grew to enormous importance as inflation peaked at the end of 1979 beginning of 1980 at an annualized rate approaching 20 % .
The era of managing interest rate risk ; the sinister and for many , the hard - to - understand risk that faces both the investors and those seeking to acquire the credit , was placed on a par with the management of the many other types of financial risks such as credit or default risk .
Along with the inverse relationship of interest rates to security prices and the born - again version of the Fisher effect , Rational expectations , concepts such as duration became the hot topics as rampaging inflation drove market interest rates upward to near record levels and caused the collapse of the prices of virtually all financial securities ( Fisher Effect - http://byrned.faculty.udmercy.edu/2003%20Volume,%20Issue%203/Fisher%20Effect.htm) .
To quell the chaos , Paul Volcker was called to lead the FED out of its errant ways and to restore the fight against inflation to the numero - uno priority of monetary policy .
By the spring of 1980 , the FED ’s new policy of monetary restraint forced the nation into one of its sharpest declines in history .
While not lasting as long as the Great Depression of the 1930s , it was very intense and lasted two and one - half years .
The inflation rate was driven down to 4 - 5 % , but the unemployment rate peaked above 10 % .
The rest of inflation was to be eliminated more gradually , with a “ soft landing ” a few years later .
Social engineering of the financial system has increased to more precarious heights from its relatively humble New Deal beginnings .
Legislation such as the Community Reinvestment
Act have forced financial institutions such as commercial banks and other depositories , mortgage bankers , and other financial intermediaries to make what would normally be classified as bad or junk loans , especially in the area of residential mortgage lending .
Vested interests , in this case community activists such as those from groups like Acorn , effectively use the CRA to force financial mortgage lenders to make significant numbers of what traditionally were called bad loans .
THE CONVERSION OF THE U. S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM INTO A POWDER KEG WAITING FOR SPARKS TO SET IT OFF
This brief review of the U.S. financial system contains the elements of the construction of a powder keg waiting to be ignited .
The two major sparks that have ignited this powder keg will be spelled out initially , followed by the various factors that gave rise to the increasingly explosive financial powder keg , that was finally ignited .
The two major sparks , so to speak that caused the ignition are the cartelization of the U.S. petroleum industry that occurred mostly between the mid-1990s and was pretty much completed by 2002 .
The second factor was the ill advised policy of monetary restraint of the FED which began in mid-2004 .
This was the second time in a period of around six years that the FED aided and abetted a collapse in the U.S. economy , the first being in the first three quarters of 2000 .

ENERGY COSTS
As we spelled out in a previous issue of this newsletter and referenced in the prelude , the recartelization of the American oil industry and environmental resistance have kept the energy industry being able to develop and expand to meet the needs of consumers .
American businesses and households have been trapped in a virtual killing field of high - energy costs ; with little hope of any relief in the near term .
While critics lump the U.S. and China together as the primary polluters of the global environment , France has been noted as the poster child for all that is right in terms of energy conservation .
The truth is that France has chosen to rely on nuclear energy for much of its electrical production .

RISING MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES
In addition to the rising energy costs and insecurity in the labor markets , households are now facing an additional burden of rising interest rates , affecting their mortgages .
As short - term rates are driven up by the Federal Reserve actions in the Federal Funds rates , it influences other short - term interest rates to rise as well .
In the area of variable rate mortgages ( ARMs ) , the Fed ’s actions are gradually triggering the adjustment clauses in these mortgages .
This increases the monthly payments , reducing further the disposable income available to purchase other goods and services and also reduces the cushion protecting homeowners from defaulting on mortgages .
In this very newsletter , again back in January 2006 , we warned of the dire results of two “ Killing Fields ” that were devouring the public ’s discretionary income .
Those two factors that were to ignite the explosion of the financial system were the historically high energy prices reflected in the price of crude oil peaking around $ 145 per barrel and rising mortgage payments resulting from the FED ’s ill advised policy of monetary restraint in 2004 .
The financial fiasco came to be , with the collapse of the housing market and the revelation of unacceptably bad behavior of the financial services industry led by the greed kings , the investment banking industry .
The ( Re ) cartelization of the U.S. Oil Industry
As the 1970s and 1980s clearly showed us , when the world economy grows ; in unison , the demand for energy , especially oil , surges .
Recall that in 1973 , OPEC took control of the production and pricing of its crude oil production from the so - called Seven Sisters , ordering them to cut production and raise prices by 300 % from $ 3.50 per barrel to $ 14.00 per barrel .
Again in 1978 OPEC reduced production and doubled prices from $ 19 to $ 38 per barrel .
In real dollars , that price was not surpassed until 2008 .
In the first illustration
How does world expansion affect demand for normal goods such as energy ( income elasticity ) ?
How does price elasticity of demand decrease as demand increases ?
The first graph helps show how this in turn can translate into increased market / monopoly power of firms .
In the second illustration
How does the contraction of the world economy affect the demand for normal goods ( income elasticity ) ?
Typically , these oil shocks would last less than two years as the threat of escalating inflation would cause the FED to launch a policy of monetary restraint that would slow the economy and reduce the market power of OPEC as a result .
The cartelization of the U.S. oil industry in the 1990s changed that pattern .
With 12 of the oil companies ( mostly the large ones like Exxon and Mobil ) combining into 4 giants , they would “ bow to the market forces ” and raise their prices to OPEC levels .
Alas : so much for the beauty of competitive free market capitalism .
Karl Marx cheered heartily from his grave .
Rates of return on equity for the giants like ExxonMobil rose to the 35 % range – hardly a result of managerial genius .
Along with the environmentalist ’s pressure to reduce reliance of other competing fossil fuels such as coal , the oil companies had a field day in expropriating the consumer surplus and destroying their discretionary disposable income .
This cartelization of the U.S. oil industry was responsible for extending the period of the 2003 oil shock to nearly 5 years .
What do you suppose this would do to the millions who would be facing interest rate resets and rising monthly mortgage payments as the Fed launched a policy of monetary restraint in mid-2004 ?

The FED and its Ill - Advised Policy of Monetary Constraint Beginning in mid-2004
The corporate mindset of the FED changed significantly in 1980 as they were severely criticized for allowing inflation to accelerate to the brink of run away inflation in the late 1970s .
The FED would no longer be reactive , not proactive but would become preemptive in coping with potential inflation .
It showed this in 1998 when it began a policy of monetary restraint , fearing what they believed was an overheated economy growing at what their Chairman considered an unsustainable rate .
Phrases like irrational exuberance and the wealth effect were uttered by the Federal Reserve Chairman and were repeated on hundreds of newscasts .
March 2008 – Newsletter
http://byrned.faculty.udmercy.edu/2008%20Volume,%20Issue%201/2008%20Volume%20Issue%201.htm
Enter the FED in 2004
Now , cloaked in paranoia concerning inflation and still on a guilt trip emanating from the late 1970s when they failed to stem accelerating inflation , they shifted to a pre-emptive strategy instead of a reactive or proactive one .
The FOMC ( Federal Open Market Committee ) , the real focus of the FED ’s authority and power , divined that with any significant growth , inflation could not be far behind .
Despite deflationary effects of significant growth rates in productivity , paranoia drove the FOMC to slow the economy .
Asset prices became a topic of interest for FED officials , among them Alan Greenspan .
Housing prices were especially of concern to the former chairman .
“ Our forecasts and hence policy are becoming increasingly driven by asset price changes .
The steep rise in the ratio of household net worth to disposable income in the mid-1990s , after a half - century of stability , is a case in point .
Although the ratio fell with the collapse of equity prices in 2000 , it has rebounded noticeably over the past couple of years , reflecting the rise in the prices of equities and houses . ”
Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan
Reflections on central banking
At a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City , Jackson Hole , Wyoming
August 26 , 2005

­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­
The rapidly rising tax revenues resulting from several years of tax rate increases recommended by the Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin were turning the Federal Government Budget deficit into a surplus and applying a heavy duty braking to the U.S. economy .
A growing trade deficit was also applying additional braking to the economy .
Shortly after the FED joined the orgy of policy restraints , the economy collapsed in the third quarter of 2000 .
It fell from a real growth rate of 7.3 % in the Fourth Quarter of 1999 to a negative real growth rate of 0.5 % in the Third Quarter of 2000 – not 2001 .
Apparently the FED learned nothing from that experience since they repeated their mistake again in mid-2004 with the same results on economic growth .
This time , their pressuring of short - term interest rates triggered the resetting of interest rates on ARMS and the resulting glut of foreclosures ensued .
Now the borrowers , already stripped of discretionary income by record high energy prices , could not cope .
This included prime , and above prime borrowers , not just sub - prime borrowers .
The first collapse in 2000 was a result of bad economic policy by the FED ( monetary policy ) and by Congress ( fiscal policy ) .
The FED once again began a policy of monetary restraint in 2004 , in order to preempt what it saw as a potential problem of inflation .
The culprit was a supply side shock coming from OPEC ’s restriction of supply in the face of a rising world demand for oil and its refined products .
This time around , the upward movement of prices was supported by the newly cartelized U.S. oil industry that would “ go - along ” with the “ market - forces ” .
The data shows clearly that this time , most of the other non-oil related markets were much more competitive , especially at the retail level and firms had a difficult time in passing on the energy related costs .
The CPI data shows that prices at the retail level did not reflect the rise in those at the producers ’ level as shown in the PPI data .
In some industries such as light vehicles , already anemic profits suffered intensely as a result .
Nonetheless , the FED decided to pursue a restrictive monetary policy .
Fortunately , by 2003 , fiscal policy had turned expansive , but the trade balance was still in large deficit and depressing .
The FED influenced the Fed Funds rate upward from 1 % to 5.25 % or a 425 % increase .
Other short - term interest rates followed , such as the one year Libor .
This began to trigger the resetting of ARMs mortgages and the foreclosures that soon followed .
This was bad policy by the FED based upon increasingly irrelevant theories of how the economy works .
Now , after all the damage , the FED has reversed itself and influenced the Fed Funds rate back down to below 1.00 % in December of 2008 .
Let ’s ask the questions :
If the FED ( Federal Open Market Committee - FOMC ) had not pursued that restrictive policy of monetary restraint five years ago which was based on pre-empting inflation , would ARMs interest rates have been reset upward and mortgage payments increased and the flood of foreclosures occurred ?
We think not .
Bad theory leads to bad policies and disastrous consequences .
It caused the collapse of the U. S. economy in 2000 ( not 2001 ) and caused the FFTTE now occurring .
Had the FTC ( Federal Trade Commission ) opposed the recartelization of the American oil industry in the 1990s , could rising mortgage payments in the last five years have been made more easily ?
Again , these were bad policies by government agencies mandated to help not harm the economy .
The sparks of bad policy by the FED and the FTC ignited the powder keg and gave us the Financial Fiasco of 2008 ( FFTTE ) .
Like most problems in life , some of the roots of the current financial chaos began years ago and are often lost among those of more recent origin .
After having briefly reviewed the more recent history of the U.S. financial system , this issue of the newsletter will now list the more important factors that turned the financial system into a powder keg waiting to be ignited by one or more sparks .
The sparks consist of a much shorter list that will be examined shortly .
Despite all the newscasts and the ranting and raving of the so - called experts , both legitimate and the think - they - ares and wannabes , confusion still reigns .
Even with the passage of legislation estimated to cost three quarters of a trillion dollars , critics are already calling for its repeal since it does little to identify and address the underlying problems that caused the financial fiasco of 2008 ( Financial Fiasco of Two - Thousand Eight --- FFTTE ) .
Now we find the auto industry holding its hand out for rescue from it and the UAW ’s misbehavior over the decades .
The so - called financial legislation is loaded with what are often referred to as “ earmarks ” virtually unrelated to the ongoing financial chaos .
We ask for your patience as this issue of the newsletter attempts to systematically clarify why it all happened .
The Roots of the Financial Fiasco of 2008 ( FFTTE )
How the powder keg that finally exploded was constructed .
1 ) The use and abuse of LEVERAGE
In the financial services industry , firms use a high degree of what is called , financial or debt leverage ( high ratio of debt or liabilities to assets which is the same as a low capital to asset ratio ) to offset low operating leverage ( or ratio of profits to assets ) .
To earn a reasonable return on owners ’ equity ( or the ratio of profits to owners ’ equity ) , the low capital ratios are necessary .
But this results in a vulnerability to bankruptcy and hence requires the avoidance of any serious degree of risk taking .
This basic condition has obviously been ignored at best and not understood by highly rewarded executives , at worst .
The same can be said for the regulators and for Congress that habitually passes laws treating these business firms as though they were not - for - profit charities .
2 ) The GREED FACTOR
Research shows the long - term real rates of return on the average of stock ( equity capital investment ) is about nine or ten percent over long periods of time .
Yet firms are expected to provide rates of return of 20 or 25 percent , if not higher .
This can only be achieved with market power ( lack of significant competition in the firm ’s product markets ) or chasing yield which means bearing high degrees of risk .
The 30 to nearly 35 percent return on equity of some major oil companies in the last few years , is not due to the genius of their corporate leaders , but rather it is due to the re-cartelization of the American oil industry that occurred in the 1990s as the anti-trust authorities ( Anti-Trust Division of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission ) stayed on the sidelines for the most part , mumbling about the Chicago School of economic thinking , for their failure to act .
The major oil companies in the U.S. were just “ bowing to the market forces ” as they raised oil prices to $ 147 per barrel in July 2008 .
These are the “ market forces ” that they had successfully emasculated by eliminating much of the competition by mergers and acquisitions in the 1990s .
Such mergers and acquisitions helped reward investment bankers at firms such Lehman Brothers , Merrill - Lynch and Goldman Sachs , with over $ 100 billion in bonuses during the three years just before they pleaded for a bail out , to which the FED and Treasury Department with Congressional approval , promptly undertook .
The bonuses were not taken back nor were households with foreclosed homes ever aided .
Much of these huge bonuses of the investment banking firms were contingent upon high levels of profits , not attainable without incurring risk , whether perceived or not ( e.g. mortgage backed securities ) .
In the case of the federal agencies such as Fannie Mae , insuring formerly uninsurable mortgages were pressured by Congressmen from both Houses of Congress , and community groups like ACORN , using legislation such as Community Reinvestment
Act to threaten mortgage lenders to make bad loans or else law suits would soon follow .
It is not risk if it never will materialize .
Of course it was risk and it did materialize .
3 ) The DEMISE of the COMMERCIAL LOAN DOCTRINE of bank management
Commercial banks , as do other depositories ( such as credit unions and savings banks ) not only have low capital ratios as examined above , but also have liabilities that are very short term in maturity .
The checkable deposits that they create in the process of credit creation are payable on demand .
The time deposits , while not checkable and not payable on demand have on average , very short term maturities .
The time deposits include passbook savings deposits as well as certificates of deposits .
Some depositories , primarily large commercial banks , incur other liabilities , usually called borrowed or purchased funds .
These other liabilities are usually short term in maturity and carry higher yields , and if they become a significant source of funds , are frowned upon by regulators .
In their heyday , significant reliance on these funds to maintain required reserves at mandated levels , caused those banks to be called , go - go banks .
Because of the average shortness of maturity of their liabilities , and their low capital ratios , adherence to the commercial loan doctrine called for bank lending to be short term and self - liquidating .
Short term lending was standard practice to match the short term maturity of their liabilities and self liquidating to compensate for the low capital ratios , and as a consequence , their inability to bear serious degrees of risk from whatever source .
Working capital loans and not competing with the bond and stock markets to supply long term funds , was the intent of the commercial loan doctrine .
As the money markets developed , bank management philosophy changed to what many analysts called the Shiftability Doctrine .
Dedicate a portion of the assets to money market securities , which are short term in maturity and low in both credit and interest rate risk , and the rest of the portfolio can be shifted to longer maturities , on the average .
Of course , as time has shown , when liquidity is needed and short term securities such as Treasury bills are sold , quite often every institution is doing the same and the prices of those securities fall sharply .
Such liquidity is akin to road service in inclement weather .
The earliest the service will be there to help you is the following day , since everyone else is calling for the same service .
Money markets have at times behaved like the real estate market in the last two or three years .
With all the foreclosures , the supply greatly increases and gluts the market causing housing prices to decline by 15 % and even more in some markets .
As the financial markets further developed , other sources of funds materialized : federal funds , Eurodollars , repurchase agreements , brokered CDs , etc .
Now the argument was that liquidity could be purchased by issuing new types of liabilities , allowing an even greater latitude of maturities on the asset side , and banks especially , shifted to the now popular asset - liability management philosophy ( ALM ) .
This lengthening of the asset maturities led such institutions into the lair of the insidious interest rate risk , reflected in the inverse relationship of financial securities prices to interest rates , as we shall see shortly .
The parallel development of marking to the market and in certain accounting applications , the lower of cost or market , exacerbated the threat of insolvency .
This occurred when interest rates rose either as a result of inflation ( the Fisher effect to be examined shortly ) , or from the FED ’s restrictive monetary policy which we have seen , helped collapse the economy in the very late 1990s and again in May 2004 through August 2007 .
4 ) Another risk to threaten solvency : The INCREASE IN INTEREST RATE RISK
Owning equity or long - term debt securities for investment purposes and for trading purposes is inherently risky in terms of interest rate risk ( inverse relationship of security prices to interest rates ) even if those securities credit or default risk , or its equivalent beta for stock , is very low .
The longer the term to maturity and the lower the coupon rate or its equivalent , the greater the percentage decline in the market price of the security for a one - percent rise in interest rates .
Two components of Interest Rate Risk
The two components of interest rate risk are the price risk and the reinvestment risk .
The price risk is greater the longer the time to maturity and the lower the coupon rate .
The reinvestment risk is greater the higher the coupon rate .
This is what helps drive the inverse relationship .
The combination of the coupon rate and the time to maturity determine the duration of the financial asset .
Of course , the determination of these values is more precise for debt securities such as bonds where there is a contractual relationship and much less precise for equities such as common stock , where there is no contractual guarantee of the cash flow .
Interest rate risk should not be confused with credit or default risk .
The only link between the two is a result of the risk premium reflecting the probability of default .
The higher that probability , the higher is the coupon rate and hence , the smaller the interest rate risk .
Other than that , the two types of risks , interest rate risk and credit or default are not related .
Long - term U.S. Government bonds have little credit or default but have a significant degree of interest rate risk .
You can eliminate the reinvestment risk part of interest rate risk by investing in zero coupon or pure discount debt securities such as bonds since there is nothing to reinvest , but as the coupon interest rates decreases , the price risk increases .
Variable or adjustable rate loans reduce interest rate risk but often increase the credit risk , since some of the interest rate risk is shifted and shared by the borrower ( potential for higher monthly payments ) instead of being borne entirely by the lender ( real interest rate falling as inflation increases ) .
But for sharing in the bearing of interest rate risk , the borrower must be given a reward in the form of a lower interest rate for an initial period of time ( usually 2 , 3 , or 5 years ) before the rate can be adjusted upward ( or downward ) usually once or twice per year , and the payment increased ( or decreased ) .
More to follow later ...
5 ) TRANSFORMATION of the FINANCIAL LANDSCAPE resulting from the roaring inflation of the 1970s .
The decade of the 1970s caused a tremendous change in the financial landscape , both in terms of the markets and the way both borrowers and lenders reacted to inflation .
After the Korean War inflation , the American economy experienced a twelve year period of near price level stability ( 1952 - 1964 ) .
Virtually all the economic sectors were lulled into sleep concerning the issue of inflation .
So what , you say .
When inflation is occurring , the nominal or the market rates of interest you observe diverge from their real or price level adjusted interest rate counterparts .
The real interest rate becomes less than its nominal interest rate counterpart , by the actual rate of inflation .
By 1979 nominal mortgage rates were near 20 % and the inflation rate averaged for that entire year , about 15 % .
This meant that real mortgage interest rates were about 5 % .
In those days , most were fixed rates and were often for periods running 30 years in maturity .
As the public began to understand and adjust to such high inflation rates , any delusion that the nominal or market rates were the same as their real interest rates counterparts , had dissipated .
The behavior pattern of most of the public was approaching that of Rational Expectations .
Writing around 1900 , an American economist , Irving Fisher , argued that the nominal or market interest would be higher than its real interest rate counterpart by the actual rate of inflation , so the real interest rate was not influenced by inflation , only the nominal or market rates of interest were so influenced .
The participants in markets would adjust the nominal interest rate upward by the expected rate of inflation when inflation was occurring and expected to continue .
They would adjust the nominal interest rate downward when deflation was occurring , and expected to continue .
The market expectations of inflation would be correct and equal the actual rate of inflation .
This is the Fisher Effect .
The same reasoning is found in the Rational Expectations theory as referred to a bit earlier .
As inflation continued into the late 1970s , market rates of interest increasingly reflected these high and rising inflation rates .
That is why mortgage rates rose toward 20 % nominal levels and Treasury Bill rates rose well above 14 % nominally .
In reality , their real interest rate counterparts were much lower , by the actual rate of inflation .
Given the inverse relation of security prices to ( nominal or market ) interest rates , the security prices in all financial markets , including the bond and stock markets fell dramatically .
The Bears were in charge and inflation had vanquished the Bulls .
6 ) TOO BIG TO FAIL and TOO SMALL TO CARE doctrines
With the collapse of most of the savings and loan industry and some other depositories in the late 1970s and early 1980s , the collapse of the ( wholly owned by the U.S. Government ) Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation ( FSLIC ) was not far behind .
There were three such federally owned insurance corporations , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) , the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation ( FSLIC ) , the National Credit Union Administration ’s ( NCUA ) insurance subsidiary .
Only the FSLIC failed , although the FDIC showed signs of going the same path and was saved by the collapse of market rates of interest and the economic recovery that began in mid-1982 .
A problem that continues on today is that insufficient premiums were collected to fund widespread failures of the depositories .
Even worse , the FSLIC adopted the TOO BIG TOO FAIL Doctrine .
At the time , the insured portion of deposits was only up to $ 40,000 ( http://www.fdic.gov/about/strategic/report/2000AnnualReport/pg97.html).
FSLIC exceeded that limit and of course ran out of funds and began to borrow from the U. S. Treasury .
FSLIC went belly up , so to speak .
The resulting bail out of FSLIC and its debt in the amount of $ 124 billon is still carried by the Treasury today as part of the National Debt .
( http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/banking/2000dec/brv13n2_2.pdf)
The Cost of the Savings and Loan Crisis : Truth and Consequences
( 2000 )
The savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s produced the greatest collapse of U.S. financial institutions since the Great Depression .
Over the 1986–1995 period , 1,043 thrifts with total assets of over $ 500 billion failed .
The large number of failures overwhelmed the resources of the FSLIC , so U.S. taxpayers were required to back up the commitment extended to insured depositors of the failed institutions .
As of December 31 , 1999 , the thrift crisis had cost taxpayers approximately $ 124 billion and the thrift industry another $ 29 billion , for an estimated total loss of approximately $ 153 billion .
The losses were higher than those predicted in the late 1980s , when the RTC was established , but below those forecasted during the early to mid-1990s , at the height of the crisis .
In this most recent Financial Fiasco of 2008 or FFTTE ( or as cynics say , Phhhttt in the vernacular ) , the U.S. Treasury has been mandated by Congress to bail out far less worthy belly uppers such as the investment banker gang , ignoring the huge bonuses paid to the very people that were promoting the sales of the junk securities that are so much a part of the Financial Fiasco of 2008 ( FFTTE ) .
TOO BIG TOO FAIL or TOO MUCH PAC MONEY TO BE LOST
So much for pushing the argument that “ the National Debt is too large ” , when the same politicians bellowing out this argument are signers of the so called Bailout Bill which will raise that debt significantly and lead to the argument that taxpayers must come up with more bail out money in the form of higher taxes .
“ Do not do what we do , do what we say ” .
“ Talk the talk but do not walk the walk ” .
The interpretation of the “ lower the National Debt argument ” must be , increase the tax burden of the taxpayers .
What about the several million households that lost their homes in foreclosure ?
TOO SMALL TOO CARE
As the soon to be beheaded , Marie Antoinette advised her advisors , “ If they have no bread , give them cakes ” or as found in Scripture , do as Dives did to Lazarus and give them crumbs .
All of those fat bonuses paid to the investment bankers , earned mostly from their sales efforts that helped cause the FFTTE ( phhhtt ) , would go a long way toward healing the households who lost their homes .
7 ) CONFUSING HEDGING with SPECULATION or perhaps cloaking speculation with a veil of hedging
“ If it looks like a duck , walks like a duck and , and quacks like a duck , it is probably a duck ” , goes the popular saying .
One of the first and most infamous of the so - called hedge funds , LTCM ( Long - Term Capital Management http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management), managed and counseled by so - called experts including some Nobel prize winners , was allowed to become so large and so risk laden , that the FED , our beloved central bank , bailed them out under the now seemingly etched in granite , TOO BIG TOO FAIL Doctrine .
What was learned from that episode ?
Apparently nothing ...
Perhaps something was learned by the street - wise big hitters .
If you are going to fail , be big and fail big , otherwise the Doctrine of TOO SMALL TO CARE will be invoked instead of the TOO BIG TO FAIL Doctrine .
Hedging is an act of reducing risk and paying a cost to achieve a greater degree of financial certainty .
Speculation is an act of taking on risk ( financial uncertainty ) , usually for a fee or reward .
They are not the same .
Securitization , the using futures contracts , and other such efforts can be used to hedge , but they can also be used to speculate .
It is not the job of the FED , or the Treasury Department , or Congress to bail out speculators .
Much of the price excesses in the real estate and oil markets were a result of speculative activities that did not prevent price excesses but that aided in those excessive price swings .
The literature concerning destabilizing speculation is neither new nor scarce .
Destabilizing Speculation – nothing new under the sun …
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/1997/199722/199722pap.pdf
The 1934 U.S. Congress established Federal margin authority with three apparent objectives : to reduce the use of “ excessive ” credit in securities transactions ; to protect investors from over - leveraging ; and to reduce the volatility of stock prices .
The Congress evidently believed that a federal margin policy could be used to control the amount of credit allocated to “ unproductive ” investment in the stock market and thereby reduce the effects of destabilizing speculation on stock prices .
The view prevailing in Congress held that there existed a fixed pool of credit available to support investment activities , and any credit that was used to purchase stocks was credit that was unavailable to finance productive investments in new plant and equipment .
Moreover , it was widely believed that stock - related credit supported the activities of speculators whose trading activities allegedly created unnecessary volatility in the stock market .
8 ) EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS and those who claim they can consistently beat the market
There is a heavily researched , widely accepted , and highly credible theory that no one ( nor no group ) can consistently beat the market .
It is called the Efficient Market Hypothesis or EMH .
A similarly researched and widely held theory of much value is the Capital Asset Pricing Model or CAPM .
These theories support the growing use of indexing and undermine the belief that expert analysts and active fund managers can consistently beat the market .
Yet these analysts continue to urge buying and selling and churn fund assets as though they can consistently beat the market .
“ A Random Walk Down Wall Street ” by Burton Malkiel and similar literature should be a required reading for all investors and Congressional members of both the House and Senate .
Lots of upward and downward swings in the market bring lots of commissions and fees to the brokers and dealers and their firms .
Investors are charged for both buying and selling securities .
Why has n’t much of this trading been computerized to avoid the need for trades to be “ touched ” by employees of the investment banking firms and fees and commission charged for each “ touch ” ?
Have we not gone through a computer and information technology revolution ?
Their billing of customers certainly reflects this revolution .
Why are the services of analysts housed in the same firms as the brokers and dealers who benefit from and charge commissions and fees on every purchase and sale of securities ?
Could it be to generate “ buy ” and soon after “ sell ” recommendations , leading to significant commissions and fees ?
What about all the various types of buy recommendations before the FFTTE ?
When the market fully recovers – and then some , as it will , what about all of the sell recommendations that drove the market downward by nearly one - third ?
What about all the fees the investment bankers received on mergers and acquisitions that more than anything else , reduce competition in markets such as crude oil , thereby preventing the free market capitalist system from achieving those great goals of equity and efficiency , the economic welfare conditions given the public when competition is vigorous ?
Huge bonuses to the investment banking industry rest heavily on reducing competition through mergers and acquisitions and the ignorance of investors who believe analysts who can readily beat the market in a consistent manner .
If this is not so , why the recent record crude oil prices and prices at the pump and why the current collapse of the markets and why the need to bail out those same investment banking firms ?

9 ) CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Conflicts of interest abound in the financial services industry .
Investment bankers are allowed to trade on their account while at the same time act as brokers and dealers for their customers in the same securities .
Rating agencies have been cited in investigations by the SEC for altering their review methods in order to generate more revenue for their firms .
Conflicts of interest are not new but in recent years have made the headlines .
The accounting profession has had its Enron type scandals .
They must bill the clients they audit .
The problem was exacerbated by combining auditing with management consulting .
This increased the pressure on the auditors as more fees were at stake with management consulting bundled with auditing .
It is akin to self regulation , which often means no regulation .
10 ) Accounting practices such as marking to market and lower of cost or market can accelerate swings in the financial markets , especially downturns which are aggravated by such practices .
So - called conservatism makes it even worse as a practice of lower of cost or market is applied to the asset side of the balance sheet but rarely to the liability side , exaggerating a downturn and reducing the owners ’ equity as a result .
Accounting is not a precise science ; rather it is an art of estimating .
When is revenue realized ?
What method of depreciation is appropriate ?
What inventory valuation method best estimates the real cost of goods sold ?
The problem becomes even more daunting when the value of the dollar is changing due to inflation or deflation .
The very measuring stick they use is changing .
Minimizing taxes in earlier years to take advantage of the time value of money is ever present especially when tax rates are high .
Show Wall Street analysts the best numbers to encourage buy recommendations , transfer pricings to reduce overall tax liabilities are similar problems facing accountants .
11 ) DERIVATIVES : the savior of hedgers or the cause of financial dysentery ?
Derivatives have been around a long time .
They enable farmers and cereal manufactures to make certain the uncertain .
Farming is risky enough without having to face the potential of severe price fluctuation at harvest time .
Cereal grain futures enable the farmer to focus on farming and the cereal manufacturer to focus on cereal making .
A similar argument can be made for business engaging international trade .
The foreign exchange futures market can reduce the risk .
In the financial world , fluctuations in asset values are especially correlated with changes in interest rates as explained above .
Lending funds to finance mortgages for long periods of time , is very risky ( interest rate risk ) .
This is true even when the borrower is a prime borrower .
Mortgage initiators can securitize mortgages and reduce and eliminate the interest rate risk for themselves .
Adjustable rate mortgages or ARMs can also reduce this risk for the lender whether or not the mortgages are securitized and whether or not the borrower was classified as sub - prime or prime .
Much of the securitization of mortgages involves mortgage pools .
Many of these pools are insured by federal agencies ( such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ) on a “ with ” or “ without ” recourse basis .
The former insures the originator against interest rate risk and the latter against both interest rate and credit or default risk .
Some of these pools are financed by certificates of participation but some are financed by such securities as bonds .
They have become known as collateralized debt obligations or CDOs , etc .
Now we are venturing into the derivatives on derivatives .
Futures options have been around for a while .
They combine two types of derivatives , the futures contracts and the options contract .
What is important to know is that for gamblers , indistinguishable from speculators , the derivatives on derivatives increase the leverage and benefit those who want to speculate , more that those who want to hedge .
Unfortunately , there is no guarantee that speculation is a stabilizing factor .
It can be a de-stabilizing factor .
Some , not most , of the run up in oil prices was caused by speculation .
While not strictly a derivative , short selling of stocks has exacerbated downward swings in the stock market by speculators , where for a period of time , they are akin to self - fulfilling prophecies .
A problem with derivatives is that they can mask the degree of risk of the underlying asset .
When rating agencies are under pressure to generate fees , this masking can take on an art form .
What is a sub - prime mortgage ?
It depends upon the definer .
Not all agree .
Does it depend upon the borrower or the characteristics of the loan agreement , or both ?
As a rating agency , which definition is most influential in your rating methodology when it comes to a CDO or collateralized debt obligation ?

12 ) The New Paradigm and the sparks that ignited the powder keg
This Newsletter was started nearly six years ago in order to apply what the editors and others have argued is a New Paradigm of behavior model that is increasingly useful in examining the behavior of the macro economy ( http://byrned.faculty.udmercy.edu/2003%20Volume,%20Issue%201/Newsletter%20Introduction.htm).
As competition has increased in much of the economy ( some notable exceptions such as crude oil and its refining ) , the biases toward recessions and inflationary episodes it had resulting from lack of competition , have lessened .
This means that monetary and fiscal policies based upon the old model of demand side macroeconomics is at best of little value and at worst it can result in harmful macroeconomic policy effects .
This happened in 1998 - 99 when the FED adopted a policy of monetary constraint and aggravated an economy that was already stressed by rising federal government surpluses due to several years of tax rate increases often referred to as Rubinomics ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubinomics), after one of the Secretaries of the Treasury who convinced Congress of the wisdom of such a policy .
The rising trade deficit also increased the stress on the overall economy .
The U.S. economy collapsed in the third quarter of 2000 , NOT 2001 .
The following is from the 2003 Newsletter ( note : data from NIPA has been adjusted since publication )
http://byrned.faculty.udmercy.edu/2003%20Volume,%20Issue%204/Newsletter%20Volume%202003%20Issue%204%20(4th%20Newsletter)%2011-22-03.htm
FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY – TWIN POLICY DISASTERS
In the first issue of this newsletter we argued that there were two major occurrences leading to recession :
(1) Significant rise in federal receipts as a percent of National Income …
( 2 ) … and the FED ’s change to a monetary policy of restraint , leading to rising short - term interest rates .
The “ twin policies ” brought the nation ’s economy to its knees : witness a positive growth of 7.1 percent to a three - quarter long recession , where the GDP collapse bottomed out at a negative 1.6 percent ( real GDP ) .
As pointed out above , the U.S. economy collapsed as a result of bad economic policy by the FED ( monetary policy ) and by Congress ( fiscal policy ) .
The FED once again began a policy of monetary restraint in 2004 , in order to preempt what it saw as a potential problem of inflation .
The culprit was a supply side shock coming from OPEC ’s restriction of supply in the face of a rising world demand for oil and its refined products .
This time around , the upward movement of prices was supported by the newly re-cartelized U.S. oil industry that would “ go along ” with the “ market forces ” .
Something to keep in mind …
The Federal Reserve pays 90 % of its profits as taxes to the U.S. Treasury
In 2007 , there were $ 365 billion paid in corporate taxes to the Federal Government .
The Federal Reserve paid $ 35 billion of that total , or nearly 9.5 % of the total of all corporate taxes collected .
Some Alternative Solutions to Ill - Conceived Bailouts
1 ) Give the Fed the power to suspend marking to the market and the lower of cost or market rule .
Give the FED the power to protect from bankruptcy ( chapter 11 ) when liquidity crises occur .
If the argument is that the Treasury and the FED will make lots of profits , from , the acquisition of troubled assets , then was n’t the mark down misleading and unjustified ?
2 ) Bring back a version of the Glass - Steagall Act : the goal – to separate investment banking from other financial services like the depositories , and insurance companies .
3 ) Eliminate investment bankers trading on their own account .
4 ) Legislation to restrict rating agencies from altering methodologies for rating the securities .
5 ) A new rule for FED instituting monetary policy to avoid their mistakes in 1998 and again in 2004 .
Preemption assumes the FED through the FOMC understands the way the economy and the financial markets work .
They obviously do not .
Some objective rule should replace much of the FED ’s independence .
6 ) Modernize the trading of stocks , bonds and other securities so that investment bankers do not touch and therefore charge fees and commissions on every trade .
Such modernization should incorporate the advances generated by the revolution in information technology .
7 ) Implement greater restrictions and clearer guidance to the anti-trust authorities on merger and acquisitions when markets would become less competitive including Four Firm Concentration Ratio and Herfindahl Index measures .
8 ) Clarify rules on speculation in areas such as futures contracts and short selling .
9 ) Shift the management of depositories such as commercial banks back toward the commercial loan doctrine .
10 ) Eliminate the forecasting of profits by firms and their need for “ guidance ” to investors .
FINAL COMMENTS …
If the argument is that the Treasury will make lots of profits , then was n’t the mark down misleading ?
Why not a move to chapter 11 , until market prices reflect reality and not a credit crunch ?
For those who will not see such a return when the liquidity crunch is over , too hell with them – let them go under .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
Obliquely answering the hundreds of " tea bag " protests around the country on tax day , President Barack Obama said Wednesday that he 's already delivered the most progressive tax cut in history , with 95 % of families getting a tax break in every paycheck .
Americans need a " government that is working to create jobs and opportunity for them , rather than simply giving more and more to those at the very top in the false hope that wealth will trickle down , " Obama said .
DANGER ZONE : The Rumble III underwater volcano has reduced in height by 100 m after a ' catastrophic ' eruption , according to scientists .
There has been an enormous eruption in an underwater volcano about 300 kilometres from the Bay of Plenty and similar in size to Mt Ruapehu .
Rumble III , which is part of the 250 - kilometre South Kermadec Ridge , rises 2300 metres from the sea floor .
Until 2007 , its summit was within about 200m of the sea surface .
However , scientists on a research ship that has just spent two weeks investigating underwater volcanoes have found a " startling change " in the shape of the summit , which has reduced in height by about 100m .
Cornel de Ronde , co-chief GNS scientist on the voyage , said the volcano had endured a " fairly catastrophic " eruption .
A map made in 2007 showed an 800 m - wide crater near the top , but the new map now showed the crater had been filled and the nearby summit cone had shrunk .
" This suggests there has been a major eruption that collapsed the summit cone and filled the adjacent crater , " Dr de Ronde said .
All through college I loved writing short stories .
But because I am a cad , when I found out how unprofitable the medium was I switched to blogging and TV scripts .
Turns out there 's still one way to market a short story : Pack it with references .
Not thought - out T.S. Eliot ones , but marginal - pop - culture ones .
Your story does n't have to be good if it 's about Vampire Weekend , the Tipping Point and Twitter .
I first noticed this trick last month in a terrible short story in the New Yorker , " Raj , Bohemian . "
Gripped by recognizable , almost - trendy concepts ( the protagonist watches pre-release bootleg movies , gets to hot clubs before " a single mention on a blog " fills it with guys in stripeys , and the whole story revolves around his offense at being targeted by stealth marketers as an " early adopter " )
I read the whole thing , even as the style devolved into undergrad tripe that , without all the forced relevance , could never have made it into the New Yorker .
Today I saw the same trick in a story promoted on Boing Boing .
Hyperbolic sci- fi author Cory Doctorow said the piece ( " Mallory " by Leonard Richardson ) " reads like the first three paragraphs of Snow Crash , but extended , remixed , and oh , so sweetly . "
I know , that blurb should have driven me away , but my editor Nick Denton is a fan of cyberpunk so I checked whether it was good enough for Gawker .
It 's bad enough for Gawker .
I see why Doctorow loved it : while the style was even more cloying than his ( which admittedly can be said of all of cyberpunk and its descendant genres ) , it uses literally ten times the insider references that the Internet 's in crowd loves to read .
Richardson phrase - drops " NSA data miners , " " glitch metal , " the habit of pretending to read a friend 's blog , and Katamari Damacy all in the first scene .
He also writes some of the worst sentences I 've seen since freshman year : " Vijay was neither ready nor un - . "
" He dropped the fake cell phone like a piece of bread he'd just discovered was moldy . "
" ' Stop being such a drama queen , ' said Keith .
' It makes us actual queens look bad . ' "
While this story does end up better than the New Yorker piece , the first act is almost entirely made of references calibrated to dazzle rather than to truly inform ; presumably Doctorow would n't have gotten to the rest of the story if he did n't slog through the beginning and find himself perversely ( or in his particular case , sincerely ) liking the schlock .
Like dry popcorn with enough salt , you might finish such a story by force of habit .
Trained by blogs , news feeds and TV , you feel like you 're learning something just because familiar phrases are flashed at you .
You keep looking for a pattern and end up wasting your time .
When concept - dropping invades otherwise good writing , it can cripple a promising talent .
Diablo Cody , scolded by some critics for overloading her script with painful references like " honest to blog , " still won her Best Screenplay Oscar .
The film , with disparate scenes patched together by twee indie music , still got nominated for best motion picture and best direction .
While I assume the Academy recognized the more deserving parts of the film — non-clichéd supporting characters well portrayed by skilled actors , a touching story with much redeeming dialog — making allowances for concept - dropping seemed to validate it as a trick for drawing in more easily amused audiences while still entertaining those seeking a truly great film .
Before the awards , Cody had already written another screenplay full of mockable lines .
Cody not only borrows specific cultural touchstones but also uses a sickly caricature of real banter .
Her method of stealing relevance has expanded to a larger theft of an entire cultural vernacular .
One sentence stands out : " I 'm a hard - assed , Ford - tough mama bear .
It 's like , do n't y'all touch my daughter .
I 'll piss on you like Calvin . "
Here she 's almost redeemed the technique , synthesizing a corporate - approved slogan with the bootleg sticker often seen on it .
But does the meaning of a Calvin pissing on a Chevy logo really say what Cody 's character means ?
Is taking sides in a brand war analogous to protecting one 's young ?
Or could Cody take out all the referential filler and end up with a better line ?
Maybe Cody 's producers will pull her back .
But the millions of would - be entertainers on YouTube , or writing spec scripts in LA , or opening for Dane Cook , want a hook .
And because slapping together some references is so much easier than carefully crafting a story , it 's all we 'll be left with as all non-referential fiction gets pegged as " too literary . "
Working with business and government leaders , we showed how market incentives can be levers for change .
Problem Decades ago , sulfur dioxide pollution – mostly from coal - fired power plants – was causing acid rain and snow , killing aquatic life and forests .
A debate ensued : Regulation would direct all plant owners to cut pollution by a set amount , but this method , critics argued , would be costly and ignore the needs of local plant operators .
Solution
We devised a cap - and - trade approach , written into the 1990 Clean Air Act .
It required cutting overall sulfur emissions in half , but let each company decide how to make the cuts .
Power plants that lowered their pollution more than required could sell those extra allowances to other plants .
A new commodities market was born .
Results Sulfur emissions went down faster than predicted and at one - fourth of the projected cost .
Since its launch , cap and trade for acid rain has been regarded widely as highly effective at solving the problem in a flexible , innovative way .
Any fool can criticize , condemn and complain … and most fools do .
~ Dale Carnegie
At some point somebody ’s going to have something to say about something you ’ve written , and you might not like it .
Your first reaction could be any one of these :
“ Why is everyone smarter than me ? ” or “ That ’s it , I ’m quitting , ” or even …
“ I ’m gonna find out where you live and head over to deliver a boot full of whoop - ass . ”
Criticism comes with the territory when you put your work out there for people to read , so you ’d better figure out ways to handle it confidently so that it does n’t send you into a spiral of hurt or anger .
Here are my top 5 .
1. Enjoy it .
Someone ’s said something bad about your writing ?
So what .
No schools have burned down and no hospitals have exploded , so do n’t take it so damn seriously .
Your writing has been read and people are talking about it – is n’t that what you wanted ?
Criticism is no big deal , so instead look at it with a playfulness , humor or even camaraderie .
What could you do that would defuse things or put a human , humorous spin on things ?
2. Nobody ’s right .
You wrote about your experience , your perspective and your ideas , and that ’s just as it should be .
Whoever criticized your writing ( whether in a constructive or destructive way ) is talking from their point of view based on their experience .
And that ’s just fine too .
Everyone looks at ‘ reality ’ through a filter based on what they ’ve learned , and this filter puts a unique spin on everything you see and experience in the world .
That means that every opinion is valid , nobody ’s right and it ’s okay for people to disagree with you .
Kind of gets you off the hook does n’t it ?
3 . Some people just wo n’t get it .
Believe it or not but some folks out there are idiots .
Some folks are struggling , others are bitter and some others are just plain angry .
Some people will read what you ’ve written , fly off the handle and spew abuse for the simple reason that they can .
Criticizing your writing is especially easy online as it’s an instant medium – in mere moments someone can appease their anger and scratch that itch by venting in your direction .
This is n’t personal and it is n’t even about your words – it ’s about them and where they are .
4 . Look for a new idea .
You get your ideas from the people and the world around you , so be curious .
What is there in the criticism that ’s new to you ?
What new idea has been presented or where are the points of difference ?
Knowing that nobody ’s right , there ’s always another way to look at things .
Take a look and see what you can learn – there just might be something incredibly useful .
5 . Let it go .
The moment you feel your hackles rising , let it go .
If you let it upset you what follows is anger , and to quote Yoda , that leads to the dark side .
Be sure to notice when you feel that piece of criticism being internalized and interrupt it .
Look at the other 4 tips or find your own way of accepting things with grace .
Your work ’s out there and it ca n’t be changed , and sometimes the very best thing to do is let it go and start on your next idea .
Marijuana prohibition is unique among American criminal laws .
No other law is both enforced so widely and harshly and yet deemed unnecessary by such a substantial portion of the populace .
Police made about 870,000 arrests for marijuana in 2007 ( the latest year national data is available ) .
Roughly 775,000 , or 88 percent , of those arrests were for nothing more than simple possession of small amounts of marijuana .
Millions of Americans have never been arrested or convicted of any criminal offense except this .
Punishments range widely across the country , from modest fines to a few days in jail to many years in prison .
Even being incarcerated for just one day can cause a person to get fired from his or her job .
And in today ’s economy , losing a job can lead to months of unemployment .
A parent ’s marijuana use can be the basis for taking away his or her children and putting them in foster care .
It ’s no wonder that so many Americans support decriminalizing and even legalizing marijuana .
Seventy - two percent say that for simple marijuana possession , people should not be incarcerated , but fined : the generally accepted definition of “ decriminalization . ”
Even more Americans support making marijuana legal for medical purposes .
Support for broader legalization is around 40 percent , although it depends on how one asks the question .
Support is around ( and in some polls greater than ) 50 percent in some Western states and among Americans age 18 to 30 .
This is , in some respects , no surprise .
More than 100 million Americans have tried marijuana , including almost 60 percent of those aged 45 to 49 .
The vast majority know it did n’t kill them or anyone else they know , or derail their lives , or even lead to regular use .
That includes three presidents in a row ; Barack Obama , when asked if he had inhaled , responded “ I inhaled frequently ” and “ that was the point . ”
Critics say decriminalizing marijuana will increase availability and use .
Really ?
Close to 100 million Americans have already used marijuana .
Half of all teens try marijuana before graduating from high school .
Almost anyone who wants to use marijuana can do so now .
Moreover , studies around the world have found that the relative harshness of drug laws matters surprisingly little .
After all , rates of illegal drug use in the United States are the same as , or higher than , Europe , despite our more punitive policies .
And 13 U.S. states have decriminalized marijuana , but marijuana use rates in those states go up and down at roughly the same rates as in other states .
Other claims by opponents of reform do n’t stand up either .
The Institute of Medicine and other research bodies have concluded there is no evidence that marijuana is a “ gateway ” drug — certainly no more so than alcohol or tobacco .
While some people use marijuana to excess , most people who smoke marijuana never become dependent .
And unlike alcohol , no one has ever died from a marijuana overdose , marijuana is not associated with violent behavior , and marijuana is only minimally associated with reckless sexual behavior .
There are , of course , some risks associated with using marijuana .
These risks , however , should be weighed against the harms associated with current marijuana policy .
Every comprehensive , objective commission that has examined marijuana throughout the past 100 years has concluded that criminalization of adult marijuana use does more harm than marijuana use itself , including President Nixon ’s 1972 marijuana commission , the National Academy of Sciences ’ 1982 marijuana report , and recent government reports in Canada and the United Kingdom .
As drug war violence rises in Mexico and along the U.S. - Mexican border , more and more policymakers are calling for a national debate on reforming our country ’s failed marijuana policies .
Many parts of Mexico today are like Chicago during the days of alcohol Prohibition and Al Capone — times 50 .
The U.S. Joint Forces Command recently warned that the Mexican government is in danger of becoming a weak and failed state and could descend into chaos , which could cause tens , perhaps hundreds , of thousands of Mexicans to flee into the United States .
In the border city of El Paso , Texas , where several Mexican mayors live and commute to work out of fear their families will be killed if they live in Mexico , the city council passed a resolution in January calling on Congress to debate drug legalization as a way of reducing prohibition - related violence .
In February , the Latin- American Commission on Drugs and Democracy , a high - level commission co-chaired by former presidents of Brazil , Colombia and Mexico , called for a “ paradigm shift ” in global drug policy , including decriminalizing marijuana and “ breaking the taboo ” on open and robust debate about all drug - policy options .
The attorney general of Arizona , citing evidence that Mexican drug trafficking organizations get 60 percent to 80 percent of their revenue from marijuana , has suggested that national policymakers debate legalizing marijuana as a way to cripple both Mexican and U.S. gangs .
Although he was careful to say he was n’t advocating legalization , he nevertheless asked the right question : Should marijuana be taxed and regulated like alcohol ?
It ’s a question being debated almost weekly now on CNN , MSNBC and Fox News .
It ’s starting to pop up in congressional hearings , too .
With strong poll numbers in support of reform , rising state and federal deficits , overflowing prisons , and a national security crisis on our southern border , we may very well be at a tipping point on this issue .
Now is the time for policymakers , columnists and leaders in both the conservative and progressive movements who support reform to speak out .
Hundreds of thousands of Americans a year are arrested for marijuana .
Doors are kicked in .
Children are put into foster care .
Cars , houses and bank accounts are seized without trial .
Yet it ’s hard to find a presidential candidate or Supreme Court justice who has n’t smoked marijuana .
Reform will happen .
It ’s just a question of how many tax dollars will be wasted before elected officials catch up with the American people .

Skylon would be totally reusable
An innovative UK launcher concept is to get 1 m euros ( £ 900,000 ) of investment from the European Space Agency ( Esa ) .
The Skylon spaceplane would take off from a conventional aircraft runway , carry over 12 tonnes to orbit and then return to land on the same runway .
The money will help prove the vehicle 's core technologies , including its Sabre air - breathing rocket engine .
Reaction Engines , the company behind the project , believes its reusable launcher could fly within 10 years .
Alan Bond , the Oxfordshire firm 's managing director , said : " Traditional throw - away rockets costing more than a $ 100 m per launch are a drag on the growth of this market .
" The Holy Grail to transform the economics of getting into space is to use a truly reusable space - plane capable of taking off from an airport and climbing directly into space , delivering its satellite payload and automatically returning safely to Earth . "
The Skylon concept 's key enabling technology is its Sabre propulsion system .
It is part jet engine , part rocket engine .
It burns hydrogen and oxygen to provide thrust - but in the lower atmosphere this oxygen is taken from the atmosphere .
At high speeds , this requires Sabre be able to cope with 1,000 - degree gasses entering its intake .
These need to be cooled prior to being compressed and burnt with the hydrogen .
Reaction Engines ' breakthrough is a remarkable heat exchanger pre-cooler .
Arrays of extremely fine piping plunge the hot intake gases to minus 130C in just 1/100th of a second .
Skylon would operate like more traditional transportation systems
The Esa money comes from the agency 's technology development programmes and contributes to a total programme of investment in Skylon worth almost £ 6 m .
It will enable Reaction Engines to build a full test pre-cooler at its facility at Culham .
Other aspects of the Skylon design will be investigated by EADS Astrium , the German space agency ( DLR ) and the University of Bristol .
Europe already has a very capable expendable rocket system in the Ariane 5 , but Esa constantly has one eye on the future and the technologies that will provide the next generation of launch systems .
Guaranteed access to space for its member states is one of Esa 's primary objectives , but lowering the cost of that access is also important .
The " brochure price " for an Ariane 5 is about 160 m euros ( £ 140 m ) .
' Good position ' " People are looking for the technologies which are going to enable us to really transform the economics of putting stuff up into space , " said UK science minister Lord Drayson .
" Britain is well placed here .
The Skylon project is a good example ; but I 'd also point to Surrey Satellite Technology Limited with their microsatellites that are a fraction of the price of conventional satellites .
" We 're in a promising position as a country to be working on those areas of technology that are applicable to the future of space research , " he told BBC News .
Lord Drayson said the coming year was an exciting one for the UK as it finessed its policies in the light of an important review being undertaken into space activity and exploration .
The minister said it was possible a new structure - meaning a dedicated UK space agency - was needed to oversee this future .
" We need to ask ourselves , ' are we as well organised as we can be to make the best from this good position we 've got ? '
We have n't made any decisions about this yet because I 'm waiting for this review to come to me . "

Cavendish celebrates a surprising win .
Photo : Graham Watson
Mark Cavendish proved the skeptics wrong yet again .
After most experts believed he could n’t get over the late - race climbs , the Columbia - Highroad rider sprinted to a dramatic victory to win the 100th Milan - San Remo .
Here are excerpts from his post - race press conference :
Question :
What does it mean to you to win a classic ?
Mark Cavendish : Each race is special , each time you cross the line is important .
The different types of races , when you win stages , you prove you ’re a great sprinter .
When you win a one - day classic , you prove you ’re a great rider .
I wanted to prove that I am more than a great sprinter , that I am a great rider , and that ’s what I did today .
Q : Some sprinters said you could n’t get over the climbs ?
MC : Absolutely , I knew what they were saying after Tirreno .
Tom Boonen said I was getting dropped on all the climbs .
If you count the times I got dropped in Tirreno , it was one time , no other times .
I knew I had to play it easy in Tireno , because I knew I had good form and a good team .
One of the sweetest things today was seeing Tom Boonen go past me backwards on the climbs .
Q : How much did your work with Erik Zabel help you ?
MC : Without his help I would n’t have won today .
We did recon twice , I knew exactly where I had to be at each time , when I could go hard where .
His knowledge got me through the bike race .
The team worked perfectly , they knew that I knew what I had to do .
We had 3 - 4 guys who could have won , but they sacrificed their chances to let me help me win .
It ’s a real special day for us both .
Q : Haussler seemed to surprise everyone in the final sprint , how did you manage to win ?
MC : When he went , he took everyone by surprise .
There was a small opener on left that I could have followed him , but it was too close to the barriers .
I had to wait for gap to open .
It was touch and go if could get him .
I got on his slipstream and just got him on the line .
It was a close call .
I ’m glad I did it .
Q : You were saying it was not possible that you could win , did you believe that you could win ?
MC : I said maybe I cannot win , I never said it was impossible , everything is possible .
I knew it would be hard , if I could play a little poker in the last weeks .
Play along about what other people thought about me , what they thought my weaknesses were .
But when the people that mattered had the faith in me , that was myself and my teammates .
Tommy Lövkvist , such a stronger attacker , took me on the second wheel in Cipressa .
George Hincapie guided me to the Poggio , and then went full - gas and led me to fourth wheel with 400 m , that was perfect
Q : Where do you go next after this victory ?
MC : More wins .
Every time I put my leg over the bike , I want to be first across the line .
Now I ’ve achieved this target , I ’ve got to set new targets .
I have to keep racing aggressively .
I have the right environment , the right people around me .
I hope to make the most of it .
Q : How important was it to make it over the Maniè ?
MC : I was lucky there .
I started the climb in top 10 , which was perfect .
As it happened , it did n’t go too hard up there .
I felt really good up that climb , then I knew I was capable of getting over the capi , the Cipressa and the Poggio in good position .
Q : What does this mean to you to win this race ?
MC : I just won a monument .
It ’s my first monument I ’ve ever ridden .
It ’s one of the races you watch growing up .
I take a lot of desire to win from the fact that a lot of people write me off .
The commentator on British Eurosport was adamant that Haussler got him at the line , because they could n’t believe he ’d won it .
That ’s how it is , a lot of people cannot believe that I can do what I can do .
When the right people put faith in me , it ’s so special .
The guys put so much faith in me today .
It worked .
Q : Tomorrow , will your win knock soccer off the front pages in England ?
MC : No chance , it ’s only the Olympics and Tour de France in the national news .
I do n’t care about this , I ’m doing because I love to race , love to be with my teammates , and love doing what I ’m doing .
This is what ’s important to me .
Q : Today you climbed better than Armstrong , what do you say about that ?
MC : It ’s a big surprise , why ?
I ’ve worked hard on my climbing .
At San Remo , it ’s not about being the best climber .
It ’s about being positioned on the climbs .
I was in best position because of my teammates .
Q : Haussler almost won , how did you manage it ?
MC : I was just concentrated on crossing the line first .
It does n’t matter if you win by one kilometer or by one centimeter .
When you win , you win .
Q : Mario Cipollini spoke to you , what does that mean ?
MC : He congratulated me .
He ’s a nice guy .
After I made a fuck - up last year in California and lost him as a friend forever ( ed – when he passed Cipollini in the prologue pedaling with one leg ) , he ’s a real nice guy .
I ’m glad when someone of that statue in the sport can be happy for me , that makes me really happy also .
Q : You were crying at the finish , is this the most emotional you ’ve ever been in a race ?
MC : I cried when I won the world championships for first time , at the first stage of Tour de France , and today .
These are three big things and big targets of mine .
They were realistic goals , but everything had to go right on this day .
They were all different .
World ’s on the track , the stage in the Tour , this is a one - day monument , this are the biggest things you can do in the different disciplines , so it makes me really happy .
Q : You live in Italy , can you tell us something about your life here ?
MC : Since 2006 , I came and stayed part of the year in Quarrata with Max Sciandri .
We ’ve became really good friends .
I like Italy .
I ’m not going to be out so much as I like .
It makes sense to stay on Isle of Man to prepare for the classics .
For the Tour , it makes perfect sense to train in Tuscany .
I love the life here .
The people down there treat me great .
The food , the weather , the people , everything is perfect .
If it were up to me , I ’d be out here a lot more than I am .
Q : You will race the world championships on the track , why ?
MC : The reason is it makes me so fast is the leg speed , for sure I get the leg speed from the track .
What people do n’t see is the fine details I put into my training and my lifestyle to be able to be here .
It made sense a little bit on the track to keep my leg speed .
For sure , I am doing 100 - 200 km in training , I am getting stronger in the climbs , but there ’s no point to get to the finish and not be able to sprint .
I do n’t gain financially and I do n’t get remembered for racing the track , but if you look at the fact it will benefit my road career , if it will keep my legs fast , it makes perfect sense .
Warning : spoilers here .
Season 2 of Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles just ended a bit less than a week ago , and now the big question is whether the show will be continued or not .
Apparently at the moment it 's still undecided so there 's still hope .
The general consensus is that the show is a good one and hopefully will get another season , but that it made a big mistake in the middle of the season by rolling three episodes in a row about Sarah Connor 's mental state , which turned out to be an extremely boring three hours where a lot of the best characters ( Cameron , John Henry ) barely showed up at all , and this resulted in a pretty big drop in viewers during the middle of the season .
I 've made a graph of the number of viewers for season 2 ( in millions ) to illustrate :
As you can see , the show actually maintained a fairly stable viewing base of 5 to 6 million throughout the first part of the season , and it was n't until those three episodes plus the move from Wednesday Monday to Friday came along that it suddenly plummeted into dangerous territory .
The lowest rating it received ( 2.96 million ) was actually the first good episode after the disastrous three , and perhaps due to word of mouth from that it began to pick up a bit of steam , though perhaps too late .
However , there are a number of reasons why the show should get a third season in spite of this .
Here they are in no particular order .
- The Terminator brand is huge and there is a lot of sustained interest in the story itself , even when nothing in particular is being produced .
In this sense it 's similar to a number of fairly popular characters and shows such as Star Trek and Wolverine .
Here are a few shows / characters ( and even one company ) compared to Terminator over the last few years from Google Trends .
Terminator vs. Battlestar Galactica
Terminator vs. Wolverine
Terminator vs. Jon Stewart
Terminator vs. Star Trek
Terminator vs. Starbucks
Terminator vs. X - Men
Terminator vs. StarbucksTerminator vs. X -
Men
The third season is going to be incredible , if it happens .
There were no intentions of this being a series finale .
It was absolutely a season finale .
There 's a plan where this can go and it's so good ....
You have this episode where John Connor travels to a future where John Connor never existed .
I do n't know if people completely get it because we work on a string theory , which we 've dealt with during the season .
We dealt with that with Jessie , in the future that she came from there was Charles Fisher , who tortured everyone .
In the future I came from , he never existed .
I do n't remember him .
We were still together within these parallel futures but they were still different and they still had their own paths .
This is the same concept .
For John Connor to travel to a future where he never existed , where Kyle Reese never left , where Derek and Kyle are still fighting side by side , where Allison ( the human Cameron was based on ) is still very much present , what becomes of John ?
What better situation for somebody to grow up in and become the future leader than that ?
Than to be fighting in what he 's been trying to prevent ?
Not just being the top dog , being listened to for everything , but having to actually listen and follow .
This last one vs. X - Men is probably the most telling as the two are just about equal when no content is being made , Terminator leaps a bit ahead when it has a tv show to its name , and when a major film is put out there 's a huge spike which is what we 're going to see with the new Terminator movie as well .
This long - term brand is also reflected in the ratings the show received during season 1 , which ranged from 7.1 million to 18.3 million for the show 's very first episode .
Unfortunately this was also the year where the writer 's guild strike happened so only nine episodes could be filmed , and then there was a fair amount of dead space in between this and season 2 .- Expanding on the first point : Terminator : Salvation is coming out , and promises to be huge .
There 's no sense pretending it's not : Christian Bale is the lead character , Hamilton and Schwarzenegger are rumoured to be lending their voices , and , well , it 's Terminator .
Even Terminator 3 grossed over half a billion .
Fox should be able to capitalize on the interest brought about from the movie by rerunning Terminator : SCC chronicles episodes during the summer for those that have n't seen them but have had their curiosity piqued after watching the new movie , which creates a nice lead in to season 3 which would begin in the fall .
Canceling the show , however , would result in a loss of opportunity to capitalize on this , and for what ?
For one extra hour that may or may not have a popular show replace it .
A show with the name Terminator can't just be whipped up on the spot , whereas this one just needs the green light to continue for another year . -
The show is fiction , but aside from time travel it deals with an alternate reality that is actually very possible , and the debate it raises over the role of robots and artificial intelligence is something that is good , even necessary , for humanity as a whole .
There are generally two views over the role of robots in the future : one is the so - called American version ( Terminator , I , Robot , The Matrix ) , a dystopian one where robots attain a certain level of consciousness and decide that they need to oppose or wipe out humanity for one reason or another , and the other is the so - called Japanese version ( Astroboy ) where robots are mostly helpful and misunderstood , and humans come across as being much more negative .
Naturally this is a big generalization as shown by programs like Star Trek where artificial intelligence is portrayed very positively ( Data on Star Trek : TNG , the doctor on Voyager , plus parts of I , Robot ) .
What is particularly interesting about season 2 is that this season 's portrayal of the varied motivations of the various terminators is a distinct possibility - Catherine Weaver is a T - 1000 and has no problems with killing people she deems to be in her way , but at the same time does n't hold the same motives as Skynet and is working to aid John Connor .
Robots that are capable of learning and reassessing what they know should in theory also be capable of making their own judgments about these issues too , and it's also conceivable that self - aware robots could be taught ethics .
The scenes related to this with Ellison and John Henry are particularly interesting :- After the ending of Season 2 , Season 3 promises to be extremely interesting .
As Brian Austin Green in the link above says ( here it is again ) :
It 's also worth noting that a lot of very good shows have taken a year or two to really get into a good groove .
What if Star Trek : TNG had been canceled after one or two seasons thanks to some episodes like We'll Always Have Paris :
( Picard goes on vacation and meets an old flame , yay )
the Dauphin
or how about
Salia thinks she will never see Wesley again , but he hurries to the transporter room to say goodbye and give her a last taste of chocolate mousse .
She reverts back into her natural form to beam down through the planet 's thick atmosphere , and Wesley is amazed at how beautiful she is .
Dah -ta
Day - ta
( Wesley makes an appearance for the first time , falls in love with a girl , and there 's a shapeshifting alien that does something too .
Or she was the alien .
Or something . )
Wikipedia 's summary of the end of the episode shows just how mind - numbingly lame it was .
Not to mention Shades of Gray , a clip show where Riker almost dies , relives a bunch of clips we 've already seen before , and finally is saved by Doctor Pulaski ( remember her ?
The fuzzy - haired doctor for a single season that called Datainstead of ? ) by stimulating his emotions .
In short , a few bad episodes in the first one or two seasons does not a cancel - worthy show make .
Next reason :- A lot of the characters in the show are a treat to watch : Garret Dillahunt as John Henry and Cromartie before that , Brian Austin Green is great as Derek Reese , Summer Glau is naturally great as Cameron , and Shirley Manson as Catherine Weaver - admittedly a bit awkward in the beginning ( What ?
All of a sudden there 's a T - 1000 that runs a company ?
But kills employees for fun ? ) , she has become one of the best characters in the show as her reasons for being in the series have become more and more clear and as her character has turned out to be much more complex and interesting than previously thought .
I think we all thought in the beginning that she was just another T - 1000 out to get John Connor and for some reason was taking her sweet time doing it as well , and only later did the character begin to make sense .
Her interacting with John Henry is also great to watch .
Finally , one mention of my favourite character : James Ellison .
Why ?
For a simple reason : he 's the only main character in the show that was n't born into his role in some way .
Sarah Connor is the mother of John Connor , John Connor is the saviour of humanity , a lot of other characters are from the future and the robots were designed from the beginning to be super - human , but James Ellison is the only character that earned his role as a main character by starting out as a regular agent and eventually finding out the truth behind the case he was working on .
In that sense he reminds me a bit of Sam Gamgee ( or perhaps Pippin or Merry ) from Lord of the Rings - not the smartest or strongest characters , nor chosen by destiny , but regular people that have managed to work themselves into something much bigger than themselves when they could have just stayed at home and remained oblivious to what was really going on in the world .
BETWEEN THE LINES Syndicated Radio Newsmagazine
Corporate Media " Embedded " with Wall Street as Economic Crisis HitInterview with Danny Schechter , media critic and filmmaker , conducted by Scott HarrisAs widespread anger still lingers about $ 165 million in bonuses paid to employees at the failed insurance giant AIG -- bailed out by more than $ 170 billion in taxpayer funds -- another , larger set of bonuses is being investigated .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich , Democrat of Ohio , chairman of the domestic policy subcommittee of the House Oversight and Government Reform panel , has opened an inquiry into about $ 3.6 billion in bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch employees , 22 times larger than bonuses paid by AIG .
The bonuses were set in December , after the government allocated $ 10 billion in bailout funds to help save the firm from collapse by brokering its sale to Bank of America .
Americans generally were taken by surprise when the economic collapse struck last fall .
Much of the blame , critics say , can be placed on Congress , which deregulated the industry then turned a blind eye to reckless casino games played with subprime mortgages and credit default swaps .
But the corporate media also played a pivotal role with its decision not to aggressively report on these dodgy financial practices , which triggered the current economic meltdown .
The business media 's cozy relationship with Wall Street movers and shakers was briefly exposed when the Daily Show 's Jon Stewart skewered the CNBC business cable channel .
Stewart bluntly criticized CNBC's Jim Cramer , Rick Santelli and others for their uncritical reporting of Wall Street 's dangerous scams and fawning coverage of corporate billionaires .
Between The Lines ' Scott Harris spoke with filmmaker and author Danny Schechter , who examines the corporate media 's failure to investigate Wall Street 's irresponsible schemes , which brought on the economic collapse .

A formmer police officer has been jailed for 12 months for .
Gambling addict John Fleet stole the slips , worth a combined £ 59.21 ( $ 96 ) , from the body of Stephen Lawrence who had died suddenly at his home of natural causes .
Fleet , with Devon and Cornwall Police , was sent to help with the removal of the body and the court heard he took the two slips and cashed them the following day .
He was caught when Mr Lawrence ’s sister , Diane Adams , later visited the same bookmakers and was told by staff a man had collected her brother ’s winnings .
The court heard Fleet , who has resigned from the force , then contacted Mrs Adams to try to get her to withdraw the complaint .
He also changed the police log to say the incident was dealt with and was closed .
The 28 - year - old pleaded guilty to theft and perverting the course of justice .
He was sentenced to two months for the theft and 12 months for perverting the course of justice , to run concurrently .
The representation of Norm Coleman has filed paper work with the Minnesota Supreme Court appealing the decision of the Election Contest Court .
The filings came in the form of three documents , each of which I will highlight below .
The first document is the Notice of Appeal :
TO : Clerk of the Appellate Courts
Minnesota Judicial Center
25 Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr Blvd .
St. Paul , MN 55155 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that the above - named Contestants appeal to the Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota , pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 209.10 subd .
4 , from the final judgment of the contest court entered on the date shown above , declaring Contestee the recipient of the highest number of legally cast votes in the General Election held November 4 , 2008 , for the purpose of electing a United States Senator for the State of Minnesota , as well as from all orders relating thereto as subsumed therein .
Dated : April 20 , 2009 ... Dear Clerk of Appellate Courts : Enclosed for filing in the above - referenced matter are the following documents : 1 . Original and 2 copies of the Notice of Appeal to Supreme Court ; 2 . Certified copy of the Contest Court 's Judgment ; 3 Original and 2 copies of the Appellants ' Statement of the Case ; 4 . Affidavit of Service upon Ramsey County ; and 5 . Affidavit of Service upon opposing counsel .
Also enclosed is our check in the amount of $ 500 to cover the filing fee .
Source : Notice of Appeal to Supreme Court via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
The second document contains 10 items that more or less summarize the appeal .
Some of these items are simply procedural while others contain useful information .
Section 5 is by far the most relevant as it directly lists the claims that the Coleman campaign is actually appealing ; I 've excerpted all of section 5 and the headings of the other 9 sections below :
1. COURT OF CASE ORIGINATION AND NAME OF PRESIDING JUDGE 2 .
JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT
3 . TYPE OF LITIGATION AND STATUTE AT ISSUE 4 .
DESCRIPTION OF CLAIMS , DEFENSES , ISSUES LITIGATED AND RESULT BELOW 5 . ISSUES PRESENTED ON APPEAL I .
Whether the trial court erred in excluding evidence regarding ( a ) the disparate application by election officials of the statutory standard governing absentee ballots and ( b ) the presence of illegal votes in the certified totals from election night ?
II .
Whether the trial court violated the constitutional protections of equal protection and due process when it declared that Respondent received the highest number of " legally cast votes " where the record demonstrated that , by the trial court 's rulings , the number of " illegally cast " ballots counted on election day and during the recount greatly exceeded the margin between the candidates and it cannot be determined for which candidate those illegal votes were counted ?
III .
Whether the trial court violated the constitutional protections of equal protection and due process when it imposed a strict compliance standard for the rejected absentee ballots rather than applying a substantial compliance standard to reflect those actually applied by election officials ( as well as this Court 's longstanding policy favoring enfranchisement ) ?
IV .
Whether the trial court erred in declining to order inspections of precincts in which double - counting was alleged to have occurred ?
V. Whether the trial court erred in ruling that missing ballots from Minneapolis Precinct 3 - 1 were properly included in the tally officially cast votes ?
6 . RELATED APPEALS 7 . CONTENTS OF RECORD 8 .
ORAL ARGUMENT 9 . TYPE OF BRIEF 10 .
NAMES , ADDRESSES , ZIP CODES AND TELEPHONE NUMBERS OF ATTORNEYS FOR APPELLANT AND RESPONDENT
Dated : April 20 , 2009 Source : Statement of the Case of Appellants via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
The most interesting point of appeal comes from section 5.2 and seems to highlight Norm Coleman 's attempt to invalidate the election , rather than prevail as the top vote - getter .
This marks the first time , that I can recall , where the Coleman campaign has sought relief that would not result in him being declared the winner .
The other four items in this section do however encompass the potential addition or subtraction of votes , that could result in Coleman taking the lead , albeit it unlikely .
The final document is simply the judgment entered by the ECC last Monday that asserted Franken 's victory by 312 votes .
I assume , that when filing an appeal , you must file the judgment which you are actually appealing .
Any future court filings will be filed on the MN Supreme Court litigation page ; a change from the previous ECC litigation website .
I have no idea when the actual litigation process will begin , although , according to MN § 209.10.4 , " the appeal from an election contest relating to the office of state senator or representative takes precedence over all other matters before the Supreme Court . "
MN § 209.10.4 further pertains " to a contest regarding a statewide office " as noted within MN § 209.09 ; this classification includes the US Senate Election .
Although the appeal will have precedence , I would still expect the Franken campaign to push for an expedited schedule .
Update [ 7:38 PM CT ] : I found other relevant law ( § 209.09 ) that applied to § 209.10.4 and thus establishes the election contest appeal as paramount to MN Supreme Court 's duties .
I 've updated the article to clarify and reflect these changes .
Government Decides Who Protests
At G20 : Violent anarchists allowed to smash up buildings despite announcing target in advance , yet anti-poverty group barred from protesting
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Thursday , April 2 , 2009
The British authorities seemed to have little problem with allowing a group of violent black bloc anarchists smash up the RBS building while provoking police yesterday , despite the group announcing their target in advance , yet a legitimate anti-poverty organization has had its “ accreditation ” to protest at the G20 removed on the orders of Downing Street .
This once again underscores the completely undemocratic power of the government to decide who is allowed to protest against them and who is not .
When you have to get permission from the government to exercise a God - given right , as in China or Russia , then we know we are already living in a police state .
The freedom to protest is not one that has to be “ accredited ” by the state , a license to protest as it were , it is an innate human right .
Apparently , if you wear black hoods and scarves , smash up private property and provoke police , then that ’s absolutely fine and you ’ll be left largely untouched .
But God forbid if you ’re a middle of the road anti-poverty group that just wants to peaceably march down the street .
“ An anti-poverty group expressed “ outrage ” after its accreditation to attend Thursday ’s G20 summit was suddenly withdrawn on Wednesday , ” reports the Telegraph .
“ The World Development Movement said it had no idea why the decision was taken but claimed it was on the orders of 10 Downing Street . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ The group , which was part of last weekend ’s huge ( and peaceful – ed ) Put People First Alliance which held a rally in London , said the Foreign Office received a note from 10 Downing Street telling it to revoke the accreditation . ”
Benedict Southworth , the group ’s director , said that the decision was part of the government ’s plan to “ stage - manage events and prevent voices of dissent and disagreement being heard . ”
The black bloc anarchist assault on the Royal Bank of Scotland building yesterday certainly had an air of being stage - managed .
The target was announced in advance , the authorities knew that the building was a prime target , and yet it was the only one in the street not boarded up .
A cafe across the street was boarded up and yet the RBS building was left completely vulnerable to attack .
Stage - managed ?
Press photographers outnumber anarchists as the RBS siege is perfectly “ produced ” for a live television audience .
Cue a relatively small gaggle of black - bloc anarchists , followed by an similarly sized press corps to photograph every angle of every smashed window , and you have the makings of a stage - managed event to instantly be consumed by the watching middle classes thus enlisting their support for a police state crackdown .
In this instance , the police stood back and let them do pretty much whatever they liked , which is highly suspicious within itself , but the week is far from over and a wider crackdown could ensue now that public acquiescence has been garnered through repeated footage showing the hostility of the anarchists .
We ’re not saying for a minute that every anarchist group is working at the behest of the authorities as provocateurs , nor that the majority are not legitimate protesters expressing their right to free speech , but as we have documented , this particular black bloc sect are at best completely infiltrated by provocateurs who can routinely be relied upon to provide the media with violent footage with which to demonize legitimate protesters at every major global summit stretching back nearly two decades .
To emphasize our point that a lot of these people are merely hired thugs , whenever someone asks them what they are actually proposing to replace the evils of capitalism , they have no idea , as the video below highlights .
Meanwhile , people who actually have a defined cause and merely want to exercise their right to free speech as a public platform to draw attention to the issue , and have already proven they are a peaceable group , are barred from doing so by the government removing their “ accreditation ” to protest .
Why are the authorities so keen on stifling peaceful protesters while giving free reign to people who dress up like terrorists , attack buildings and provoke cops ?
Whose interests do the violent actions of the black bloc benefit ?
The interests of the general public in using free speech as a means of political change ?
Or the interests of the authorities in providing the perfect pretext with which to crush and outlaw that free speech ?
You ca n’t overthrow the entire system by smashing one bank and starting a bonfire .
Real political change takes generations of struggle , decades of building respected educational platforms , and a gargantuan grass - roots movement focused on taking power on the local level and expanding upwards .
Throwing a brick through a window is n’t going to achieve anything other than making the vast majority of the general public despise you even more , and support the very systems of power that you are supposedly opposing .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
We have documented numerous different occasions where the leadership of the black bloc anarchists were actually working with the authorities to provide a pretext for a police state crackdown .
Following the SPP protests in Canada two years ago , Quebec provincial authorities were forced to admit that three rock - wielding black mask - wearing “ anarchists ” were in fact police infiltrators used to gather information on protesters .
Video shows two of the provocateurs pick up rocks and try to incite violence before they are outed as cops by legitimate demonstrators .
The two thugs then tried to slip behind police lines before their fellow officers were forced to stage their arrest .
Again , the fact that they were cops in disguise was later admitted by authorities .
Watch the video .
Alex Jones ’ film Police State 2 : The Takeover exposed how the black bloc anarchists were completely infiltrated and provocateured by the authorities during the violent 1999 WTO protests in Seattle .
The authorities declared a state of emergency , imposed curfews and resorted to nothing short of police state tactics in response to a small minority of hostile black bloc hooligans .
Police allowed the black bloc to run riot in downtown Seattle while they concentrated on preventing the movement of peaceful protestors .
The film presents clear evidence that the black bloc anarchist group was actually controlled by the state and used to demonize peaceful protesters .
Watch the video below .
At the WTO protests in Genoa 2001 a protestor was killed after being shot in the head and run over twice by a police vehicle .
The Italian Carabinere also later beat on peaceful protestors as they slept , and even tortured some , at the Diaz School .
It later emerged that the police fabricated evidence against the protesters , claiming they were anarchist rioters , to justify their actions .
Some Carabiniere officials have since come forward to say they knew of infiltration of the so called black bloc anarchists , and that fellow officers acted as agent provocateurs .
At the Free Trade Area of Americas protests in Miami in late November 2003 , more provocateuring was evident .
The United Steelworkers of America calling for a congressional investigation , stated that the police intentionally caused violence and arrested and charged hundreds of peaceful protestors .
The USWA suggested that billions of dollars supposedly slated for Iraq reconstruction funds are actually being used to subsidize “ homeland repression ” in America .
The leadership of the black bloc has been completely usurped by the authorities and anyone who still professes to be a member of the group is either supremely naive or completely stupid .
To dress up like terrorists , all in black with ski masks and bandanas ( like the police ) immediately sends out a negative message to the watching public and demonizes legitimate protesters .
More violence is expected throughout the rest of the week in London and if the police are ordered to institute a brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrators then we can thank the black bloc anarchists , both the provocateurs and the useful idiots who ape their violence , for providing them with the perfect pretext to do so .

Comment on this article
Russian Translation
I 'm pleased to announce that Denis Bulichenko has translated this article into Russian !
It has been published in RSDN .
The complete article will soon be available on - line .
I 'm deeply indebted to you , Denis .
Introduction
Standard C++ does not have true object - oriented function pointers .
This is unfortunate , because object - oriented function pointers , also called ' closures ' or ' delegates ' , have proved their value in similar languages .
In Delphi ( Object Pascal ) , they are the basis for Borland 's Visual Component Library ( VCL ) .
More recently , C# has popularized the delegate concept , contributing to the success of that language .
For many applications , delegates simplify the use of elegant design patterns ( Observer , Strategy , State [ GoF ] ) composed of very loosely coupled objects .
There can be no doubt that such a feature would be useful in standard C++.
Instead of delegates , C++ only provides member function pointers .
Most C++ programmers have never used member function pointers , and with good reason .
They have their own bizarre syntax ( the ->* and .* operators , for example ) , it 's hard to find accurate information about them , and most of the things you can do with them could be done better in some other way .
This is a bit scandalous : it 's actually easier for a compiler writer to implement proper delegates than it is to implement member function pointers !
In this article , I 'll " lift the lid " on member function pointers .
After a recap of the syntax and idiosyncrasies of member function pointers , I 'll explain how member function pointers are implemented by commonly - used compilers .
I 'll show how compilers could implement delegates efficiently .
Finally , I will show how I used this clandestine knowledge of member function pointers to make an implementation of delegates that is optimally efficient on most C++ compilers .
For example , invoking a single - target delegate on Visual C++ ( 6.0 , . NET , and . NET 2003 ) generates just two lines of assembly code !
Function Pointers
We begin with a review of function pointers .
In C , and consequently in C++ , a function pointer called my_func_ptr that points to a function taking an int and a char * and returning a float , is declared like this :
float ( * my_func_ptr ) ( int , char *) ; //
To make it more understandable , I strongly recommend that you use a typedef .
//
Things can get particularly confusing when // the function pointer is a parameter to a function .
//
The declaration would then look like this : typedef float ( * MyFuncPtrType ) ( int , char *) ; MyFuncPtrType my_func_ptr ;
Note that there is a different type of function pointer for each combination of arguments .
On MSVC , there is also a different type for each of the three different calling conventions : __cdecl , __stdcall , and __fastcall .
You make your function pointer point to a function float some_func ( int , char *) like this :
my_func_ptr = some_func ;
When you want to invoke the function that you stored , you do this :
( * my_func_ptr ) ( 7 , " Arbitrary String " ) ;
You are allowed to cast from one type of function pointer to another .
But you are not allowed to cast a function pointer to a void * data pointer .
The other allowable operations are trivial .
A function pointer can be set to 0 to mark it as a null pointer .
The full range of comparison operators are available ( == , != , < , > , <= , >= ) , and you can also test for null pointers using ==0 or via an implicit cast to bool .
Interestingly , a function pointer can be used as a non - type template parameter .
This is fundamentally different from a type parameter , and is also different from an integral non -type parameter .
It is instantiated based on name rather than type or value .
Name - based template parameters are not supported by all compilers , not even by all those with support for partial template specialization .
In C , the most common uses of function pointers are as parameters to library functions like qsort , and as callbacks for Windows functions , etc .
They have many other applications as well .
The implementation of function pointers is simple : they are just " code pointers " : they hold the starting address of an assembly - language routine .
The different types of function pointers exist only to ensure that the correct calling convention is used .
Member Function Pointers
In C++ programs , most functions are member functions ; that is , they are part of a class .
You are not allowed to use an ordinary function pointer to point to a member function ; instead , you have to use a member function pointer .
A member function pointer to a member function of class SomeClass , with the same arguments as before , is declared like this :
float ( SomeClass ::* my_memfunc_ptr ) ( int , char *) ; //
For const member functions , it 's declared like this : float ( SomeClass : :* my_const_memfunc_ptr ) ( int , char *) const ;
Notice that a special operator ( ::* ) is used , and that SomeClass is part of the declaration .
Member function pointers have a horrible restriction : they can only point to member functions of a single class .
There is a different type of member function pointer for each combination of arguments , for both types of const-ness , and for each class .
On MSVC , there is also a different type for each of the four different calling conventions : __cdecl , __stdcall , __fastcall , and __thiscall .
( __thiscall is the default .
Interestingly , there is no documented __thiscall keyword , but it sometimes shows up in error messages .
If you use it explicitly , you 'll get an error message stating that it is reserved for future use . )
If you 're using member function pointers , you should always use a typedef to avoid confusion .
You make your function pointer point to a function float SomeClass :: some_member_func( int , char *) like this :
my_memfunc_ptr = & SomeClass::some_member_func ; //
This is the syntax for operators : my_memfunc_ptr = & SomeClass :: operator ! ; //
There is no way to take the address of a constructor or destructor
Some compilers ( most notably MSVC 6 and 7 ) will let you omit the & , even though it is non-standard and confusing .
More standard - compliant compilers ( e.g. , GNU G++ and MSVC 8 ( a.k.a. VS 2005 ) ) require it , so you should definitely put it in .
To invoke the member function pointer , you need to provide an instance of SomeClass , and you must use the special operator ->* .
This operator has a low precedence , so you need to put it in parentheses :
SomeClass *x = new SomeClass ; ( x->*my_memfunc_ptr ) ( 6 , " Another Arbitrary Parameter " ) ; //
You can also use the .* operator if your class is on the stack .
SomeClass y ; ( y.*my_memfunc_ptr ) ( 15 , " Different parameters this time " ) ;
Do n't blame me for the syntax -- it seems that one of the designers of C++ loved punctuation marks !
C++ added three special operators to the C language specifically to support member pointers .
::* is used in declaring the pointer , and ->* and .* are used in invoking the function that is pointed to .
It seems that extraordinary attention was paid to an obscure and seldom - used part of the language .
( You 're even allowed to overload the ->* operator , though why you want to do such a thing is beyond my comprehension .
I only know of one such usage [ Meyers ] . )
A member function pointer can be set to 0 , and provides the operators == and != , but only for member function pointers of the same class .
Any member function pointer can be compared with 0 to see if it is null .
[ Update , March 2005 :
This does n't work on all compilers .
On Metrowerks MWCC , a pointer to the first virtual function of a simple class will be equal to zero ! ]
Unlike simple function pointers , the inequality comparisons ( < , > , <= , >= ) are not available .
Like function pointers , they can be used as non - type template parameters , but this seems to work on fewer compilers .
Weird Things about Member Function Pointers
There are some weird things about member function pointers .
Firstly , you can't use a member function to point to a static member function .
You have to use a normal function pointer for that .
( So the name " member function pointer " is a bit misleading : they 're actually " non-static member function pointers " . )
Secondly , when dealing with derived classes , there are some surprises .
For example , the code below will compile on MSVC if you leave the comments intact :
class SomeClass { public : virtual void some_member_func( int x , char * p ) { printf ( " In SomeClass " ) ; } ; } ; class DerivedClass : public SomeClass { public : //
If you uncomment the next line , the code at line ( * ) will fail ! // virtual void some_member_func( int x , char * p ) { printf ( " In DerivedClass " ) ; } ; } ; int main ( ) { //
Declare a member function pointer for SomeClass typedef void ( SomeClass : :* SomeClassMFP ) ( int , char *) ; SomeClassMFP my_memfunc_ptr ; my_memfunc_ptr = & DerivedClass::some_member_func ; // ---- line (*) }
Curiously enough , & DerivedClass : : some_member_func is a member function pointer of class SomeClass .
It is not a member of DerivedClass !
( Some compilers behave slightly differently : e.g. , for Digital Mars C++ , & DerivedClass : : some_member_func is undefined in this case . )
But , if DerivedClass overrides some_member_func , the code wo n't compile , because & DerivedClass : : some_member_func has now become a member function pointer of class DerivedClass !
Casting between member function pointers is an extremely murky area .
During the standardization of C++ , there was a lot of discussion about whether you should be able to cast a member function pointer from one class to a member function pointer of a base or derived class , and whether you could cast between unrelated classes .
By the time the standards committee made up their mind , different compiler vendors had already made implementation decisions which had locked them into different answers to these questions .
According to the Standard ( section 5.2.10/9 ) , you can use reinterpret_cast to store a member function for one class inside a member function pointer for an unrelated class .
The result of invoking the casted member function is undefined .
The only thing you can do with it is cast it back to the class that it came from .
I 'll discuss this at length later in the article , because it's an area where the Standard bears little resemblance to real compilers .
On some compilers , weird stuff happen even when converting between member function pointers of base and derived classes .
When multiple inheritance is involved , using reinterpret_cast to cast from a derived class to a base class may or may not compile , depending on what order the classes are listed in the declaration of the derived class !
Here 's an example :
class Derived : public Base1 , public Base2 // case ( a ) class Derived2 : public Base2 , public Base1 // case ( b ) typedef void ( Derived : : * Derived_mfp ) ( ) ; typedef void ( Derived2 ::* Derived2_mfp ) ( ) ; typedef void ( Base1 : : * Base1mfp ) ( ) ; typedef void ( Base2 ::* Base2mfp ) ( ) ; Derived_mfp x ;
For case ( a ) , static_cast < Base1 mfp > ( x ) will work , but static_cast < Base2 mfp > ( x ) will fail .
Yet for case ( b ) , the opposite is true .
You can safely cast a member function pointer from a derived class to its first base class only !
If you try , MSVC will issue warning C4407 , while Digital Mars C++ will issue an error .
Both will protest if you use reinterpret_cast instead of static_cast , but for different reasons .
But , some compilers will be perfectly happy no matter what you do .
Beware !
There 's another interesting rule in the standard : you can declare a member function pointer before the class has been defined .
You can even invoke a member function of this incomplete type !
This will be discussed later in the article .
Note that a few compilers can't cope with this ( early MSVC , early CodePlay , LVMM ) .
It 's worth noting that , as well as member function pointers , the C++ standard also provides member data pointers .
They share the same operators , and some of the same implementation issues .
They are used in some implementations of stl: : stable_sort , but I 'm not aware of many other sensible uses .
Uses of Member Function Pointers
By now , I 've probably convinced you that member function pointers are somewhat bizarre .
But what are they useful for ?
I did an extensive search of published code on the web to find out .
I found two common ways in which member function pointers are used :
contrived examples , for demonstrating the syntax to C++ novices , and implementations of delegates !
They also have trivial uses in one - line function adaptors in the STL and Boost libraries , allowing you to use member functions with the standard algorithms .
In such cases , they are used at compile - time ; usually , no function pointers actually appear in the compiled code .
The most interesting application of member function pointers is in defining complex interfaces .
Some impressive things can be done in this way , but I did n't find many examples .
Most of the time , these jobs can be performed more elegantly with virtual functions or with a refactoring of the problem .
But by far , the most famous uses of member function pointers are in application frameworks of various kinds .
They form the core of MFC 's messaging system .
When you use MFC 's message map macros ( e.g. , ON_COMMAND ) , you 're actually populating an array containing message IDs and member function pointers ( specifically , CCmdTarget : :* member function pointers ) .
This is the reason that MFC classes must derive from CCmdTarget if they want to handle messages .
But the various message handling functions have different parameter lists ( for example , OnDraw handlers have CDC * as the first parameter ) , so the array must contain member function pointers of various types .
How does MFC deal with this ?
They use a horrible hack , putting all the possible member function pointers into an enormous union , to subvert the normal C++ type checking .
( Look up the MessageMapFunctions union in afximpl.h and cmdtarg.cpp for the gory details . )
Because MFC is such an important piece of code , in practice , all C++ compilers support this hack .
In my searches , I was unable to find many examples of good usage of member function pointers , other than at compile time .
For all their complexity , they do n't add much to the language .
It 's hard to escape the conclusion that C++ member function pointers have a flawed design .
In writing this article , I have one key point to make :
It is absurd that the C++
Standard allows you to cast between member function pointers , but does n't allow you to invoke them once you 've done it .
It 's absurd for three reasons .
Firstly , the cast wo n't always work on many popular compilers ( so , casting is standard , but not portable ) .
Secondly , on all compilers , if the cast is successful , invoking the cast member function pointer behaves exactly as you would hope : there is no need for it to be classed as " undefined behavior " .
( Invocation is portable , but not standard ! )
Thirdly , allowing the cast without allowing invocation is completely useless ; but if both cast and invocation are possible , it 's easy to implement efficient delegates , with a huge benefit to the language .
To try to convince you of this controversial assertion , consider a file consisting solely of the following code .
This is legal C++.
class SomeClass ; typedef void ( SomeClass : :* SomeClassFunction ) ( void ) ; void Invoke ( SomeClass * pClass , SomeClassFunction funcptr ) { ( pClass ->* funcptr ) ( ) ; } ;
Note that the compiler has to produce assembly code to invoke the member function pointer , knowing nothing about the class SomeClass .
Clearly , unless the linker does some _extremely_ sophisticated optimization , the code must work correctly regardless of the actual definition of the class .
An immediate consequence is that you can safely invoke a member function pointer that 's been cast from a completely different class .
To explain the other half of my assertion , that casting does n't work the way the standard says it should , I need to discuss in detail exactly how compilers implement member function pointers .
This will also help to explain why the rules about the use of member function pointers are so restrictive .
Accurate documentation about member function pointers is hard to obtain , and misinformation is common , so I 've examined the assembly code produced by a large range of compilers .
It 's time to get our hands dirty .
Member Function Pointers - why are they so complex ?
A member function of a class is a bit different from a standard C function .
As well as the declared parameters , it has a hidden parameter called this , which points to the class instance .
Depending on the compiler , this might be treated internally as a normal parameter , or it might receive special treatment .
( For example , in VC ++ , this is usually passed using the ECX register ) .
this is fundamentally different to normal parameters .
For virtual functions , it controls at runtime which function is executed .
Even though a member function is a real function underneath , there is no way in standard C++ to make an ordinary function behave like a member function : there 's no thiscall keyword to make it use the correct calling convention .
Member functions are from Mars , ordinary functions are from Venus .
You 'd probably guess that a " member function pointer " , like a normal function pointer , just holds a code pointer .
You would be wrong .
On almost all compilers , a member function pointer is bigger than a function pointer .
Most bizarrely , in Visual C++ , a member function pointer might be 4 , 8 , 12 , or 16 bytes long , depending on the nature of the class it 's associated with , and depending on what compiler settings are used !
Member function pointers are more complex than you might expect .
But it was not always so .
Let 's go back in time to the early 1980's .
When the original C++ compiler ( CFront ) was originally developed , it only had single inheritance .
When member function pointers were introduced , they were simple : they were just function pointers that had an extra this parameter as the first argument .
When virtual functions were involved , the function pointer pointed to a short bit of ' thunk ' code .
( Update , Oct 04 : A discussion on comp.lang .c++. moderated has established that CFront did n't actually use thunks , it was much less elegant .
But it could have used this method , and pretending that it did , makes the following discussion a bit easier to understand . )
This idyllic world was shattered when CFront 2.0 was released .
It introduced templates and multiple inheritance .
Part of the collateral damage of multiple inheritance was the castration of member function pointers .
The problem is , with multiple inheritance , you do n't know what this pointer to use until you make the call .
For example , suppose you have the four classes defined below :
class A { public : virtual int Afunc ( ) { return 2 ; } ; } ; class B { public : int Bfunc ( ) { return 3 ; } ; } ; // C is a single inheritance class , derives only from A class C : public A { public : int Cfunc ( ) { return 4 ; } ; } ; // D uses multiple inheritance class D : public A , public B { public : int Dfunc ( ) { return 5 ; } ; } ;
Suppose we create a member function pointer for class C .
In this example , Afunc and Cfunc are both member functions of C , so our member function pointer is allowed to point to Afunc or Cfunc .
But Afunc needs a this pointer that points to C:: A ( which I 'll call Athis ) , while Cfunc needs a this pointer that points to C ( which I 'll call Cthis ) .
Compiler writers deal with this situation by a trick : they ensure that A is physically stored at the start of C .
This means that Athis == Cthis .
We only have one this to worry about , and all 's well with the world .
Now , suppose we create a member function pointer for class D .
In this case , our member function pointer is allowed to point to Afunc , Bfunc , or Dfunc .
But Afunc needs a this pointer that points to D:: A , while Bfunc needs a this pointer that points to D:: B .
This time , the trick does n't work .
We can't put both A and B at the start of D .
So , a member function pointer to D needs to specify not only what function to call , but also what this pointer to use .
The compiler does know how big A is , so it can convert an Athis pointer into a Bthis just by adding an offset ( delta = sizeof ( A ) ) to it .
If you 're using virtual inheritance ( i.e. , virtual base classes ) , it 's much worse , and you can easily lose your mind trying to understand it .
Typically , the compiler uses a virtual function table ( ' vtable ' ) which stores for each virtual function , the function address , and the virtual_delta : the amount in bytes that needs to be added to the supplied this pointer to convert it into the this pointer that the function requires .
None of this complexity would exist if C++ had defined member function pointers a bit differently .
In the code above , the complexity only comes because you are allowed to refer to A :: Afunc as D:: Afunc .
This is probably bad style ; normally , you should be using base classes as interfaces .
If you were forced to do this , then member function pointers could have been ordinary function pointers with a special calling convention .
IMHO , allowing them to point to overridden functions was a tragic mistake .
As payment for this rarely - used extra functionality , member function pointers became grotesque .
They also caused headaches for the compiler writers who had to implement them .
Implementations of Member Function Pointers
So , how do compilers typically implement member function pointers ?
Here are some results obtained by applying the sizeof operator to various structures ( an int , a void * data pointer , a code pointer ( i.e. , a pointer to a static function ) , and a member function pointer to a class with single - , multiple - , virtual - inheritance , or unknown ( i.e. , forward declared ) ) for a variety of 32 , 64 and 16 - bit compilers .

The compilers are Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 to 7.1 ( . NET 2003 ) , GNU G++ 3.2 ( MingW binaries , www.mingw.org), Borland BCB 5.1 ( www.borland.com), Open Watcom ( WCL ) 1.2 ( www.openwatcom.org), Digital Mars ( DMC ) 8.38n ( www.digitalmars.com), Intel C++ 8.0 for Windows IA - 32 , Intel C++ 8.0 for Itanium ( www.intel.com), IBM XLC for AIX ( Power , PowerPC ) , Metrowerks Code Warrior 9.1 for Windows ( www.metrowerks.com), and Comeau C++ 4.3 ( www.comeaucomputing.com).
The data for Comeau applies to all their supported 32 - bit platforms ( x86 , Alpha , SPARC , etc. ) .
The 16 - bit compilers were also tested in four DOS configurations ( tiny , compact , medium , and large ) to show the impact of various code and data pointer sizes .
MSVC was also tested with an option ( / vmg ) that gives " full generality for pointers to members " .
( If you have a compiler from a vendor that is not listed here , please let me know .
Results for non-x86 processors are particularly valuable . )
Amazing , is n't it ?
Looking at this table , you can readily see how easy it is to write code that will work in some circumstances but fail to compile in others .
The internal implementations are obviously very different between compilers ; in fact , I do n't think that any other language feature has such a diversity of implementation .
Looking in detail at the implementations reveals some surprising nastiness .
The Well - Behaved Compilers
For almost all compilers , two fields I 've called delta and vindex are used to adjust the provided this pointer into an adjustedthis which is passed to the function .
For example , here is the technique used by Watcom C++ and Borland :
struct BorlandMFP
{ // also used by Watcom CODEPTR m_func_address ; int delta ; int vindex ; // or 0 if no virtual inheritance } ; if ( vindex==0 ) adjustedthis = this + delta ; else adjustedthis = *( this + vindex - 1 ) + delta CALL funcadr
If virtual functions are used , the function pointer points to a two - instruction ' thunk ' to determine the actual function to be called .
Borland applies an optimization : if it knows that the class only used single inheritance , it knows that delta and vindex will always be zero , so it can skip the calculation in this most common case .
Importantly , it only changes the invocation calculation , it does not change the structure itself .
Many other compilers use the same calculation , often with a minor reordering of the structure .
// Metrowerks CodeWarrior uses a slight variation of this theme .
//
It uses this structure even in Embedded C++ mode , in which // multiple inheritance is disabled !
struct MetrowerksMFP
{ int delta ; int vindex ; // or - 1 if no virtual inheritance CODEPTR func_address ; } ; //
An early version of SunCC apparently used yet another ordering : struct { int vindex ; // or 0 if a non-virtual function CODEPTR func_address ; // or 0 if a virtual function int delta ; } ;
Metrowerks does n't seem to inline the calculation .
Instead , it 's performed in a short ' member function invoker ' routine .
This reduces code size a little but makes their member function pointers a bit slower .
Digital Mars C++ ( formerly Zortech C++ , then Symantec C++ ) uses a different optimization .
For single - inheritance classes , a member function pointer is just the address of the function .
When more complex inheritance is involved , the member function pointer points to a ' thunk ' function , which performs the necessary adjustments to the this pointer , and then calls the real member function .
One of these little thunk functions is created for every member function that 's involved in multiple inheritance .
This is easily my favorite implementation .
struct DigitalMarsMFP
{ //
Why does n't everyone else do it this way ?
CODEPTR func_address ; } ;
Current versions of the GNU compiler use a strange and tricky optimization .
It observes that , for virtual inheritance , you have to look up the vtable in order to get the voffset required to calculate the this pointer .
While you 're doing that , you might as well store the function pointer in the vtable .
By doing this , they combine the m_func_address and m_vtable_index fields into one , and they distinguish between them by ensuring that function pointers always point to even addresses but vtable indices are always odd :
// GNU g++ uses a tricky space optimisation , also adopted by IBM's VisualAge and XLC .
struct GnuMFP { union { CODEPTR funcadr ; // always even int vtable_index_2 ; // = vindex * 2+1 , always odd } ; int delta ; } ; adjustedthis = this + delta if ( funcadr & 1 ) CALL (* ( * delta + ( vindex + 1 ) / 2 ) +
4 ) else CALL funcadr
The G++ method is well documented , so it has been adopted by many other vendors , including IBM 's VisualAge and XLC compilers , recent versions of Open64 , Pathscale EKO , and Metrowerks ' 64 - bit compilers .
A simpler scheme used by earlier versions of GCC is also very common .
SGI 's now discontinued MIPSPro and Pro64 compilers , and Apple 's ancient MrCpp compiler used this method .
( Note that the Pro64 compiler has become the open source Open64 compiler ) .
struct Pro64MFP { short delta ; short vindex ; union { CODEPTR funcadr ; // if vindex== - 1 short __delta2 ; } __funcadr_or_delta2 ; } ; //
If vindex==0 , then it is a null pointer - to - member .
Compilers based on the Edison Design Group front - end ( Comeau , Portland Group , Greenhills ) use a method that is almost identical .
Their calculation is ( PGI 32 - bit compilers ) :
// Compilers using the EDG front - end ( Comeau , Portland Group , Greenhills , etc ) struct EdisonMFP { short delta ; short vindex ; union { CODEPTR funcadr ; // if vindex=0 long vtordisp ; // if vindex !=0 } ; } ; if ( vindex==0 ) { adjustedthis =this + delta ; CALL funcadr ; } else { adjustedthis = this + delta + *(*( this +delta+vtordisp ) + vindex * 8 ) ; CALL *(*( this +delta+funcadr ) + vindex *8 + 4 ) ; } ;
Most compilers for embedded systems do n't allow multiple inheritance .
Thus , these compilers avoid all the quirkiness : a member function pointer is just a normal function pointer with a hidden ' this ' parameter .
The Sordid Tale of Microsoft 's " Smallest For Class " Method
Microsoft compilers use an optimization that is similar to Borland's .
They treat single inheritance with optimum efficiency .
But unlike Borland , the default is to discard the entries which will always be zero .
This means that single - inheritance pointers are the size of simple function pointers , multiple inheritance pointers are larger , and virtual inheritance pointers are larger still .
This saves space .
But it 's not standard - compliant , and it has some bizarre side - effects .
Firstly , casting a member function pointer between a derived class and a base class can change its size !
Consequently , information can be lost .
Secondly , when a member function is declared before its class is defined , the compiler has to work out how much space to allocate to it .
But it can't do this reliably , because it does n't know the inheritance nature of the class until it 's defined .
It has to guess .
If it guesses wrongly in one source file , but correctly in another , your program will inexplicably crash at runtime .
So , Microsoft added some reserved words to their compiler : __single_inheritance , __multiple_inheritance , and __virtual_inheritance .
They also added a compiler switch : /vmg , which makes all MFPs the same size , by retaining the missing zero fields .
At this point , the tale gets sordid .
The documentation implies that specifying /vmg is equivalent to declaring every class with the __virtual_inheritance keyword .
It is n't .
Instead , it uses an even bigger structure which I 've called unknown_inheritance .
It also uses this whenever it has to make a member function pointer for a class when all it 's seen is a forward declaration .
They can't use their __virtual_inheritance pointers because they use a really silly optimization .
Here 's the algorithm they use :
// Microsoft and Intel use this for the ' Unknown ' case .
//
Microsoft also use it when the /vmg option is used // In VC1.5 - VC6 , this structure is broken !
See below .
struct MicrosoftUnknownMFP {
FunctionPointer m_func_address ; // 64 bits for Itanium .
int m_delta ; int m_vtordisp ; int m_vtable_index ; // or 0 if no virtual inheritance } ; if ( vindex=0 ) adjustedthis = this + delta else adjustedthis = this + delta + vtordisp + *(*( this + vtordisp ) + vindex ) CALL funcadr
In the virtual inheritance case , the vtordisp value is not stored in the __virtual_inheritance pointer !
Instead , the compiler hard - codes it into the assembly output when the function is invoked .
But to deal with incomplete types , you need to know it .
So they ended up with two types of virtual inheritance pointers .
But until VC7 , the unknown_inheritance case was hopelessly buggy .
The vtordisp and vindex fields were always zero !
Horrifying consequence : on VC4 - VC6 , specifying the /vmg option ( without / vmm or / vms ) can result in the wrong function being called !
This would be extremely difficult to track down .
In VC4 , the IDE had a box for selecting the /vmg option , but it was disabled .
I suspect that someone at MS knew about the bug , but it was never listed in their knowledge base .
They finally fixed it in VC7 .
Intel uses the same calculation as MSVC , but their /vmg option behaves quite differently ( it has almost no effect - it only affects the unknown_inheritance case ) .
The release notes for their compiler state that conversions between pointer to member types are not fully supported in the virtual inheritance case , and warns that compiler crashes or incorrect code generation may result if you try .
This is a very nasty corner of the language .
And then there 's CodePlay .
Early versions of Codeplay 's VectorC had options for link compatibility with Microsoft VC6 , GNU , and Metrowerks .
But , they always used the Microsoft method .
They reverse - engineered it , just as I have , but they did n't detect the unknown_inheritance case , or the vtordisp value .
Their calculations implicitly ( and incorrectly ) assumed vtordisp=0 , so the wrong function could be called in some ( obscure ) cases .
But Codeplay 's upcoming release of VectorC 2.2.1 has fixed these problems .
The member function pointers are now binary compatible with either Microsoft or GNU .
With some high powered optimisations and a massive improvement in standards conformance ( partial template specialisation , etc ) , this is becoming a very impressive compiler .
What have we learned from all of this ?
In theory , all of these vendors could radically change their technique for representing MFPs .
In practice , this is extremely unlikely , because it would break a lot of existing code .
At MSDN , there is a very old article that was published by Microsoft which explains the run-time implementation details of Visual C++ [ JanGray ] .
It 's written by Jan Gray , who actually wrote the MS C++ object model in 1990 .
Although the article dates from 1994 , it is still relevant - excluding the bug fix , Microsoft has n't changed it for 15 years .
Similarly , the earliest compiler I have ( Borland C++ 3.0 , ( 1990 ) ) generates identical code to Borland 's most recent compiler , except of course that 16 bit registers are replaced with 32 bit ones .
By now , you know far too much about member function pointers .
What 's the point ?
I 've dragged you through this to establish a rule .
Although these implementations are very different from one another , they have something useful in common : the assembly code required to invoke a member function pointer is identical , regardless of what class and parameters are involved .
Some compilers apply optimizations depending on the inheritance nature of the class , but when the class being invoked is of incomplete type , all such optimizations are impossible .
This fact can be exploited to create efficient delegates .
Delegates
Unlike member function pointers , it 's not hard to find uses for delegates .
They can be used anywhere you 'd use a function pointer in a C program .
Perhaps most importantly , it 's very easy to implement an improved version of the Subject / Observer design pattern [ GoF , p. 293 ] using delegates .
The Observer pattern is most obviously applicable in GUI code , but I 've found that it gives even greater benefits in the heart of an application .
Delegates also allow elegant implementations of the Strategy [ GoF , p. 315 ] and State [ GoF , p. 305 ] patterns .
Now , here 's the scandal .
Delegates are n't just far more useful than member function pointers .
They are much simpler as well !
Since delegates are provided by the .NET languages , you might imagine that they are a high - level concept that is not easily implemented in assembly code .
This is emphatically not the case : invoking a delegate is intrinsically a very low - level concept , and can be as low - level ( and fast ) as an ordinary function call .
A C++ delegate just needs to contain a this pointer and a simple function pointer .
When you set a delegate , you provide it with the this pointer at the same time that you specify the function to be called .
The compiler can work out how the this pointer needs to be adjusted at the time that the delegate is set .
There 's no work to be done when invoking the delegate .
Even better , the compiler can frequently do all the work at compile time , so that even setting the delegate is a trivial operation .
The assembly code produced by invoking a delegate on an x86 system should be as simple as :
mov ecx , [ this ] call [ pfunc ]
However , there 's no way to generate such efficient code in standard C++.
Borland solves this problem by adding a new keyword ( __closure ) to their C++ compiler , allowing them to use convenient syntax and generate optimal code .
The GNU compiler also adds a language extension , but it is incompatible with Borland's .
If you use either of these language extensions , you restrict yourself to a single compiler vendor .
If instead , you constrain yourself to standard C++ , it 's still possible to implement delegates , they are just not as efficient .
Interestingly , in C# and other .NET languages , a delegate is apparently dozens of times slower than a function call ( MSDN ) .
I suspect that this is because of the garbage collection and the .NET security requirements .
Recently , Microsoft added a " unified event model " to Visual C++ , with the keywords __event , __raise , __hook , __unhook , event_source , and event_receiver .
Frankly , I think this feature is appalling .
It 's completely non-standard , the syntax is ugly and does n't even look like C++ , and it generates very inefficient code .
Motivation :
The need for extremely fast delegates
There is a plethora of implementations of delegates using standard C++.
All of them use the same idea .
The basic observation is that member function pointers act as delegates -- but they only work for a single class .
To avoid this limitation , you add another level of indirection : you can use templates to create a ' member function invoker ' for each class .
The delegate holds the this pointer , and a pointer to the invoker .
The member function invoker needs to be allocated on the heap .
There are many implementations of this scheme , including several here at CodeProject .
They vary in their complexity , their syntax ( especially , how similar their syntax is to C# ) , and in their generality .
The definitive implementation is boost : : function .
Recently , it was adopted into the next version of the C++ standard [ Sutter1 ] .
Expect its use to become widespread .
As clever as the traditional implementations are , I find them unsatisfying .
Although they provide the desired functionality , they tend to obscure the underlying issue : a low - level construct is missing from the language .
It 's frustrating that on all platforms , the ' member function invoker ' code will be identical for almost all classes .
More importantly , the heap is used .
For some applications , this is unacceptable .
One of my projects is a discrete event simulator .
The core of such a program is an event dispatcher , which calls member functions of the various objects being simulated .
Most of these member functions are very simple : they just update the internal state of the object , and sometimes add future events to the event queue .
This is a perfect situation to use delegates .
However , each delegate is only ever invoked once .
Initially , I used boost : : function , but I found that the memory allocation for the delegates was consuming over a third of the entire program running time !
I wanted real delegates .
For crying out loud , it should be just two ASM instructions !
I do n't always ( often ? ) get what I want , but this time I was lucky .
The C++ code I present here generates optimal assembly code in almost all circumstances .
Most importantly , invoking a single - target delegate is as fast as a normal function call .
There is no overhead whatsoever .
The only downside is that , to achieve this , I had to step outside the rules of standard C++.
I used the clandestine knowledge of member function pointers to get this to work .
Efficient delegates are possible on any C++ compiler , if you are very careful , and if you do n't mind some compiler - specific code in a few cases .
The trick : casting any member function pointer into a standard form
The core of my code is a class which converts an arbitrary class pointer and arbitrary member function pointer into a generic class pointer and a generic member function .
C++ does n't have a ' generic member function ' type , so I cast to member functions of an undefined CGenericClass .
Most compilers treat all member function pointers identically , regardless of the class .
For most of them , a straightforward reinterpret_cast <> from the given member function pointer to the generic member function pointer would work .
In fact , if this does n't work , the compiler is non-standard .
For the remaining compilers ( Microsoft Visual C++ and Intel C++ ) , we have to transform multiple - or virtual - inheritance member function pointers into single - inheritance pointers .
This requires some template magic and a horrible hack .
Note that the hack is only necessary because these compilers are not standards - compliant , but there is a nice reward : the hack gives optimal code .
Since we know how the compiler stores member function pointers internally , and because we know how the this pointer needs to be adjusted for the function in question , we can adjust the this pointer ourselves when we are setting the delegate .
For single inheritance pointers , no adjustment is required ; for multiple inheritance , there 's a simple addition ; and for virtual inheritance ... it 's a mess .
But it works , and in most cases , all of the work is done at compile time !
How can we distinguish between the different inheritance types ?
There 's no official way to find out whether a class used multiple inheritance or not .
But there 's a sneaky way , which you can see if you look at the table I presented earlier -- on MSVC , each inheritance style produces a member function pointer with a different size .
So , we use template specialization based on the size of the member function pointer !
For multiple inheritance , it 's a trivial calculation .
A similar , but much nastier calculation is used in the unknown_inheritance ( 16 byte ) case .
For Microsoft's ( and Intel 's ) ugly , non-standard 12 byte virtual_inheritance pointers , yet another trick is used , based on an idea invented by John Dlugosz .
The crucial feature of Microsoft / Intel MFPs which we exploit is that the CODEPTR member is always called , regardless of the values of the other members .
( This is not true for other compilers , e.g. , GCC , which obtain the function address from the vtable if a virtual function is being called . )
Dlugosz 's trick is to make a fake member function pointer , in which the codeptr points to a probe function which returns the ' this ' pointer that was used .
When you call this function , the compiler does all the calculation work for you , making use of the secretive vtordisp value .
Once you can cast any class pointer and member function pointer into a standard form , it 's easy ( albeit tedious ) to implement single - target delegates .
You just need to make template classes for all of the different numbers of parameters .
A very significant additional benefit of implementing delegates by this non-standard cast is that they can be compared for equality .
Most existing delegate implementations can't do this , and this makes it difficult to use them for certain tasks , such as implementing multi-cast delegates [ Sutter3 ] .
Static functions as delegate targets
Ideally , a simple non-member function , or a static member function , could be used as a delegate target .
This can be achieved by converting the static function into a member function .
I can think of two methods of doing this , in both of which the delegate points to an ' invoker ' member function which calls the static function .
The Evil method uses a hack .
You can store the function pointer instead of the this pointer , so that when the invoker function is called , it just needs to cast this into a static function pointer and call that .
The nice thing about this is that it has absolutely no effect on the code for normal member functions .
The problem with it is that it is a hack as it requires casting between code and data pointers .
It wo n't work on systems where code pointers are larger than data pointers ( DOS compilers using the medium memory model ) .
It will work on all 32 and 64 bit processors that I know of .
But because it 's Evil , we need an alternative .
The Safe method is to store the function pointer as an extra member of the delegate .
The delegate points to its own member function .
Whenever the delegate is copied , these self - references must be transformed , and this complicates the = and == operators .
This increases the size of the delegate by four bytes , and increases the complexity of the code , but it has no effect on the invocation speed .
I 've implemented both methods , because both have merit : the Safe method is guaranteed to work , and the Evil method generates the same ASM code that a compiler would probably generate if it had native support for delegates .
The Evil method can be enabled with a #define ( FASTDELEGATE_USESTATICFUNCTIONHACK ) .
Footnote :
Why does the evil method work at all ?
If you look closely at the algorithm that is used by each compiler when invoking a member function pointer , you can see that for all those compilers , when a non-virtual function is used with single inheritance ( ie delta=vtordisp=vindex=0 ) , the instance pointer does n't enter into the calculation of what function to call .
So , even with a garbage instance pointer , the correct function will be called .
Inside that function , the this pointer that is received will be garbage + delta = garbage .
( To put it another way -- garbage in , unmodified garbage out ! )
And at that point we can convert our garbage back into a function pointer .
This method would not work if the " static function invoker " was a virtual function .
Using the code
The source code consists of the FastDelegate implementation ( FastDelegate.h ) , and a demo .cpp file to illustrate the syntax .
To use with MSVC , create a blank console app , and add these two files to it .
For GNU , just type " g++ demo.cpp " on the command line .
The fast delegates will work with any combination of parameters , but to make it work on as many compilers as possible , you have to specify the number of parameters when declaring the delegate .
There is a maximum of eight parameters , but it 's trivial to increase this limit .
The namespace fastdelegate is used .
All of the messiness is in an inner namespace called detail .
Fastdelegate s can be bound to a member function or a static ( free ) function , using the constructor or bind ( ) .
They default to 0 ( null ) .
They can also be set to null with clear ( ) .
They can be tested for null using operator ! or empty ( ) .
Unlike most other implementations of delegates , equality operators ( == , != ) are provided .
They work even when inline functions are involved .
Here 's an excerpt from FastDelegateDemo.cpp which shows most of the allowed operations .
CBaseClass is a virtual base class of CDerivedClass .
A flashy example could easily be devised ; this is just to illustrate the syntax .
using namespace fastdelegate ; int main ( void ) { //
Delegates with up to 8 parameters are supported .
//
Here 's the case for a void function .
//
We declare a delegate and attach it to SimpleVoidFunction ( ) printf ( " -- FastDelegate demo --
A no-parameter delegate is declared using FastDelegate0
" ) ; FastDelegate0 noparameterdelegate( &SimpleVoidFunction ) ; noparameterdelegate ( ) ; // invoke the delegate - this calls SimpleVoidFunction ( ) printf ( "
-- Examples using two - parameter delegates ( int , char *) --
" ) ; typedef FastDelegate2 < int , char *> MyDelegate ; MyDelegate funclist [ 10 ] ; // delegates are initialized to empty CBaseClass a ( " Base A " ) ; CBaseClass b(" Base B " ) ; CDerivedClass d ; CDerivedClass c ; // Binding a simple member function funclist [ 0 ] .bind ( &a , & CBaseClass :: SimpleMemberFunction ) ; //
You can also bind static ( free ) functions funclist [ 1].bind( &SimpleStaticFunction ) ; // and static member functions funclist [ 2].bind( &CBaseClass:: StaticMemberFunction ) ; // and const member functions funclist [ 3] . bind ( &a , & CBaseClass :: ConstMemberFunction ) ; // and virtual member functions .
funclist [ 4 ].bind ( &b , &CBaseClass :: SimpleVirtualFunction ) ; //
You can also use the = operator .
For static functions , // a fastdelegate looks identical to a simple function pointer .
funclist [ 5 ] = & CBaseClass :: StaticMemberFunction ; //
The weird rule about the class of derived // member function pointers is avoided .
//
Note that as well as . bind ( ) , you can also use the // MakeDelegate ( ) global function . funclist [ 6 ] = MakeDelegate ( &d , &CBaseClass :: SimpleVirtualFunction ) ; //
The worst case is an abstract virtual function of a // virtually - derived class with at least one non-virtual base class .
//
This is a VERY obscure situation , which you 're unlikely to encounter // in the real world , but it 's included as an extreme test .
funclist [ 7 ] .bind ( &c , &CDerivedClass :: TrickyVirtualFunction ) ; // ...BUT in such cases you should be using the base class as an // interface , anyway .
The next line calls exactly the same function .
funclist [ 8 ] .bind ( &c , &COtherClass :: TrickyVirtualFunction ) ; //
You can also bind directly using the constructor MyDelegate dg( &b , & CBaseClass : : SimpleVirtualFunction ) ; char *msg = " Looking for equal delegate " ; for ( int i=0 ; i< 10 ; i++) { printf ( " %d : " , i ) ; //
The == , != , <= , < , > , and >= operators are provided // Note that they work even for inline functions . if ( funclist [ i] ==dg ) { msg =
" Found equal delegate " ; } ; //
There are several ways to test for an empty delegate //
You can use if ( funclist [ i ] ) // or if (!funclist.empty ( ) ) // or if ( funclist [ i ]!=0 ) // or if ( !! funclist [i ] ) if ( funclist [ i ] ) { //
Invocation generates optimal assembly code. funclist [ i ] ( i , msg ) ; } else { printf ( " Delegate is empty
" ) ; } ; } } ;
Non-void return values
Version 1.3 of the code adds the ability to have non-void return values .
Like std::unary_function , the return type is the last parameter .
It defaults to void , which preserves backwards compatibility , and also means that the most common case remains simple .
I wanted to do this without losing performance on any platform .
It turned out to be easy to do this for any compiler except MSVC6 .
There are two significant limitations of VC6 :
you can't have void as a default template argument .
you can't return a void .
I 've got around it with two tricks :
I create a dummy class called DefaultVoid .
I convert this to a void when required .
Whenever I need to return void , I return a const void * instead .
Such pointers are returned in the EAX register .
From the compiler 's point of view , there is absolutely no difference between a void function and a void * function where the return value is never used .
The final insight was the realization that it is not possible to convert from a void to a void * within the invocation function without generating inefficient code .
But if you convert the function pointer the instant that you receive it , all the work is done at compile time ( i.e. , you need to convert the definition of the function , not the return value itself ) .
There is one breaking change : all instances of FastDelegate0 must be changed to FastDelegate0 <> .
This change can be performed with a global search - and - replace through all your files , so I believe it should not be too onerous .
I believe this change leads to more intuitive syntax : the declaration of any kind of void FastDelegate is now the same as a function declaration , except that ( ) is replaced with <> .
If this change really annoys anyone , you can modify the header file : wrap the FastDelegate0 <> definition inside a separate namespace newstyle { and } typedef newstyle : : FastDelegate0<> FastDelegate0 ; .
You would need to change the corresponding MakeDelegate function too .
Passing a FastDelegate as a function parameter
The MakeDelegate template allows you to use a FastDelegate as a drop - in replacement for a function pointer .
A typical application is to have a FastDelegate as a private member of a class and use a modifier function to set it ( like a Microsoft __event ) .
For example :
// Accepts any function with a signature like : int func( double , double ) ; class A { public : typedef FastDelegate2 < double , double , int > FunctionA ; void setFunction ( FunctionA somefunc ) { m_HiddenDelegate = somefunc ; } private : FunctionA m_HiddenDelegate ; } ; //
To set the delegate , the syntax is : A a ; a.setFunction ( MakeDelegate ( &someClass , & someMember ) ) ; // for member functions , or a.setFunction ( & somefreefunction ) ; // for a non-class or static function
Natural syntax and Boost compatibility ( new to 1.4 )
Jody Hagins has enhanced the FastDelegateN classes to allow the same attractive syntax provided by recent versions of Boost .
Function and Boost .
Signal .
On compilers with partial template specialization , you have the option of writing FastDelegate < int ( char * , double ) > instead of FastDelegate2 < char * , double , int > .
Fantastic work , Jody !
If your code needs to compile on VC6 , VC7.0 , or Borland , you need to use the old , portable syntax .
I 've made changes to ensure that the old and new syntax are 100 % equivalent and can be used interchangeably .
Jody also contributed a helper function , bind , to allow code written for Boost .
Function and Boost .
Bind to be rapidly converted to FastDelegate s.
This allows you to quickly determine how much the performance of your existing code would improve if you switched to FastDelegate s.
It can be found in " FastDelegateBind.h " .
If we have the code :
using boost : : bind ; bind( & Foo:func , & foo , _1 , _ 2 ) ;
we should be able to replace the " using " with using fastdelegate : : bind and everything should work fine .
Warning :
The arguments to bind are ignored !
No actual binding is performed .
The behavior is equivalent to boost : : bind only in the trivial ( but most common ) case where only the basic placeholder arguments _1 , _2 , _3 , etc. are used .
A future release may support boost : : bind properly .
Ordered comparison operators ( new to 1.4 )
FastDelegate s of the same type can now be compared with < , > , <= , >= .
Member function pointers do n't support these operators , but they can be emulated with a simple binary comparison using memcmp ( ) .
The resulting strict weak ordering is physically meaningless , and is compiler - dependent , but it allows them to be stored in ordered containers like std:set .
The DelegateMemento class ( new to 1.4 )
A new class , DelegateMemento , is provided to allow disparate collections of delegates .
Two extra members have been added to each FastDelegate class :
const DelegateMemento GetMemento( ) const ; void SetMemento( const DelegateMemento mem ) ;
DelegegateMemento s can be copied and compared to one another ( == , != , > , < , >= , <= ) , allowing them to be stored in any ordered or unordered container .
They can be used as a replacement for a union of function pointers in C .
As with a union of disparate types , it is your responsibility to ensure that you are using the same type consistently .
For example , if you get a DelegateMemento from a FastDelegate2 and save it into a FastDelegate3 , your program will probably crash at runtime when you invoke it .
In the future , I may add a debug mode which uses the typeid operator to enforce type safety .
DelegateMemento s are intended primarily for use in other libraries , rather than in general user code .
An important usage is Windows messaging , where a dynamic std:: map< MESSAGE , DelegateMemento > can replace the static message maps found in MFC and WTL .
But that 's another article .
Implicit conversion to bool ( new to 1.5 )
You can now use the if ( dg ) {...} syntax ( where dg is a fast delegate ) as an alternative to if ( !dg.empty ( ) ) , if ( dg!=0 ) or even the ugly but efficient if ( !!dg ) .
If you 're just using the code , all you need to know is that it works correctly on all compilers , and it does not inadvertently allow other operations .
The implementation was more difficult than expected .
Merely supplying an operator bool is dangerous because it lets you write things like int a = dg ; when you probably meant int a = dg ( ) ; .
The solution is to use the Safe Bool idiom [ Karlsson ] : a conversion to a private member data pointer is used instead of bool .
Unfortunately , the usual Safe Bool implementation mucks up the if ( dg==0 ) syntax , and some compilers have bugs in their implementations of member data pointers ( hmm , another article ? ) , so I had to develop a couple of tricks .
One method which others have used in the past is to allow comparisons with integers , and ASSERT if the integer is non-zero .
Instead , I use a more verbose method .
The only side - effect is that comparisons with function pointers are more optimal !
Ordered comparisons with the constant 0 are not supported ( but it is valid to compare with a function pointer which happens to be null ) .
License
The source code attached to this article is released into the public domain .

Frankly , writing the article was about ten times as much work as writing the code .
Of course , if you create great software using the code , I would be interested to hear about it .
And submissions are always welcome .
Portability
Because it relies on behavior that is not defined by the standard , I 've been careful to test the code on many compilers .
Ironically , it 's more portable than a lot of ' standard ' code , because most compilers do n't fully conform to the standard .
It has also become safer through being widely known .
The major compiler vendors and several members of the C++
Standards commitee know about the techniques presented here ( in many cases , the lead compiler developers have contacted me about the article ) .
There is negligible risk that vendors will make a change that would irreparably break the code .
For example , no changes were required to support Microsoft 's first 64 bit compilers .
Codeplay has even used FastDelegates for internal testing of their VectorC compiler ( it 's not quite an endorsement , but very close ) .
The FastDelegate implementation has been been tested on Windows , DOS , Solaris , BSD , and several flavors of Linux , using x86 , AMD64 , Itanium , SPARC , MIPS , .NET virtual machines , and some embedded processors .
The following compilers have been tested successfully :
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 , 7.0 ( .NET ) , 7.1 ( .NET 2003 ) and 8.0 ( 2005 ) Beta ( including / clr ' managed C++ ' ) .

Here is the status of all other C++ compilers that I know of which are still in use :
Open Watcom WCL : Will work once member function templates are added to the compiler .
The core code ( casting between member function pointers ) works on WCL 1.2 .
LVMM : The core code works , but compiler has too many bugs at present .
IBM Visual Age and XLC : Should work , because IBM claims 100 % binary compatibility with GCC .
Pathscale EKO : Should work , it is also binary compatible with GCC .
All compilers using the EDG front - end ( GreenHills , Apogee , WindRiver , etc. ) should also work .
Paradigm C++ : UNKNOWN , but seems to be just a repackaging of on an early Borland compiler .
Sun C++ : UNKNOWN .
Compaq CXX : UNKNOWN .
HP aCC : UNKNOWN .
And yet some people are still complaining that the code is not portable !
( Sigh ) .
Conclusion
What started as an explanation of a few lines of code I 'd written has turned into a monstrous tutorial on the perils of an obscure part of the language .
I also discovered previously unreported bugs and incompatibilities in six popular compilers .
It 's an awful lot of work for two lines of assembly code !
I hope that I 've cleared up some of the misconceptions about the murky world of member function pointers and delegates .
We 've seen that much of the weirdness of member function pointers arise because they are implemented very differently by various compilers .
We 've also seen that , contrary to popular opinion , delegates are not a complicated , high - level construct , but are in fact very simple .
I hope that I 've convinced you that they should be part of the language .
There is a reasonable chance that some form of direct compiler support for delegates will be added to C++ when the C++0 x standard is released .
( Start lobbying the Standards committee ! )
To my knowledge , no previous implementation of delegates in C++ is as efficient or easy to use as the FastDelegates I 've presented here .
It may amuse you to learn that most of it was programmed one - handed while I tried to get my baby daughter to sleep ...
I hope you find it useful .

History
The government - owned Norwegian Broadcasting ( NRK ) has set up its very own BitTorrent tracker to distribute their TV - shows .
After a successful test last year they plan to release more DRM - free TV - shows via BitTorrent , using the same tracker software currently in use at The Pirate Bay .
For its tracker , NRK has chosen the beerware licensed Opentracker software currently favored by The Pirate Bay .
One of the reasons NRK set up their own tracker is so they can gather more statistics on their viewers downloading habits .
“ With our own tracker we will get better statistics and gather important data about how this technology works .
And as we did with our early tests we ’ll also try to share the knowledge as we grow this service , ” NRK ’s Eirik Solheim writes in an article announcing the tracker .
The decision to go with BitTorrent was an easy one according to the broadcaster , as tests with traditional downloads crushed their servers .
BitTorrent on the other had allows them to distribute their shows to millions of people without having to invest in extra bandwidth or hardware .
“ This type of distribution is reliable , cheap and popular with our audience , ” Solheim told Torrent Freak .
“ The main problem is the rights issues .
We hope to be able to make television shows with a creative commons license in the future .
That will make it easier for us to allow full freedom for our audience , ” He added .
NRK understands that the traditional distribution methods are changing , and that their viewers want to consume television shows wherever and whenever they want .
The way people consume music and video has changed , and NRK does n’t want to fall behind .
“ It is important for us to start experimenting with new distribution methods .
We do n’t want to do like the music industry .
Running around thinking that people will keep driving down to a record store when they can have the content delivered with the push of a button at home , ” Eirik Solheim said in an interview last year .
It is great to see traditional broadcasting companies starting to experiment with BitTorrent and we hope that many others will follow .
Making TV - shows available online will only increase the viewership , and with BitTorrent it can be done relatively cheaply too .
Maryland started a similar project this month on the eastbound span of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Annapolis using hot pink panels .
Pennsylvania began experimenting with distance dots in 2000 , but stopped adding them to roads in 2003 because transportation officials said they were not deterring the worst offenders .
Although many drivers might see tailgating as nothing more than an annoyance , it is a significant factor in many accidents , safety officials said .
In Minnesota , rear - end collisions accounted for 28 percent of all crashes last year and resulted in 22 deaths , according to the State Office of Traffic Safety .
And the number of rear - end crashes in the state increased to 24,820 last year , from 22,206 in 2002 .
“ It ’s truly dangerous , ” said Pat Hackman , executive director of Safe Communities of Wright County , a nonprofit traffic safety organization .
“ And some people might say , ‘ Do n’t we have bigger problems than this ? ’
And we certainly do .
But I do n’t think you quite understand how this is contributing to the bigger problems that we have . ”
The idea of the dots on the highway here , explained on roadside signs , is for drivers to keep a distance of two dots between vehicles .
The 225 feet between dots represents a driving interval of three seconds at the speed limit of 55 miles per hour .
Gordy Pehrson , traffic safety coordinator in the Office of Traffic Safety , said he hoped the dots would have a “ halo effect , ” with drivers taking the lesson to other roads as well .
So long , and thanks for all the fish balls off them .

I do n't care !
Get them hooked onto meth or something , that 'll keep the bastards going .
Anyway .
Time for some Star Wars themed bizarre linkage : A New Sith , or Revenge of the Hope .
Enjoy , nerds !
OK , so out of some masochistic need to destroy any will to live I have left , I decided to see what else the Huffington Post has to say about autism and vaccinations .
Given the incredibly inaccurate and misleading article penned by Jim Carrey , and knowing that leading antivaxxers David Kirby and RFK Jr. also write for HuffPo , I was expecting to see things I would n't be terribly happy about .
But I had no idea .
This article was just posted supporting Jenny McCarthy and her campaign , which , if successful , will bring back measles and polio to our children .
Read it if you dare .
It was so transparently antiscience that I had to know who wrote it , and what do I see ?
" Dr. Patricia Fitzgerald " .
Oh great , I thought .
A doctor .
So what 's her specialty ?
Why , click her bio !
It says she 's " a licensed acupuncturist , certified clinical nutritionist , and a homeopath .
She has a Master ’s Degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine and a Doctorate in Homeopathic Medicine . " kaBLAM !
Yup .
When I read that my brain asploded ^*.
I am embarrassed I ever wrote anything for HuffPo , which is now a cesspool of misleading misinformation .
Funny though ; I still get people asking me " What 's the harm in believing in things that are n't real ? "
What 's the harm ?
Polio .
Smallpox .
Pertussis .
Mumps .
Measles ( with possibility of encephalitis and permanent brain damage ) .
Hib.
Death .
Death .
That 's the harm .
The antivax movement , the people who promote homeopathic water , the people who want you to poke you with needles ... they are peddling nonsense that does n't work .
And worse , when they convince someone that their fantasy is correct and the entire scientific and medical establishment is wrong , that person will be denied treatment that may actually do some good .
These folks may honestly care about others , and may be honestly trying to help .
I 'm sure that 's the case for Fitzgerald , who seems sincere .
But sincerity does n't make you right .
And in the case of the antivaxxers it can make you -- and everyone else -- sick .
Very sick indeed .
^*I keep wondering how you get a doctorate in homeopathy .
Maybe the less you study the more powerful your learning is .
Or you could grind up the people who passed the exams the year before , mix one molecule of them with water , and drink up !

The Liberty Restoration Project blog has posted an advisory released last November by the United States Army Reserve .
“ The United States Army Reserve Command is publishing this Force Protection Advisory to advise all Army Reserve personnel of the planned protests at all Federal Reserve Banks and office locations within the United States on 22 November 2008 , ” the document reads .
“ This message provides situational awareness and recommended mitigation measures . ”
Click image to see larger version .
According to the Army Reserve , the folks gathered and exercising the First Amendment in response to the Federal Reserve ’s loan sharking operation are essentially terrorists .
The Army “ established relationships ” with local law enforcement and the FBI and encouraged them to “ update alert rosters , ” according to the document .
In 2003 , Jim Garamone , writing for the American Forces Press Service , noted that the “ Northern Command cooperates with the other unified commands and shares intelligence with them ” and also has forged “ relationships [ that ] cut across federal , state and local agencies , and include players from law - enforcement , emergency services , intelligence agencies and the military . ”
In 2008 , Air Force Gen. Victor E. Renuart Jr. , commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command and NorthCom , told attendees of the National Homeland Defense Foundation symposium in Colorado Springs , Colorado , “ that effectively defending the homeland and responding to natural or man-made disasters requires an integrated approach that involves federal , state and local governments , and even international and private organizations , ” the latter a reference to InfraGard , the private sector Gestapo with shoot to kill orders issued by the FBI ( see The FBI Deputizes Business ) .
“ We believe those relationships will be key to our success , ” Air Force Gen. Ralph Eberhart told Garamone .
Northcom and the Army Reserve ’s mission apparently also include reporting “ all potential protest activities to the Army Reserve Operations Center . ”
The Army Reserve falls under the Pentagon ’s Continuity of Operations program “ that ensure [s ] the execution of mission - essential functions … during a national security or domestic emergency ” ( see Militarizing the US “ Homeland ” : NORTHCOM ’s Tasking ) .
In addition to Northcom “ cooperation ” with local law enforcement in regard to entirely legal and peaceful demonstrations , a document sent to Alex Jones earlier this month exposes an effort by Homeland Security to work with law enforcement in Missouri to demonize supporters of Ron Paul , Chuck Baldwin , and Bob Barr .
Ron Paul is quite specific in his call for the Federal Reserve to be closed down .
Paul told Alex Jones on March 12 that “ the people responsible for the economic crisis should not be hailed as saviors and given more power to fix the problem that they created , but arrested and criminally prosecuted , ” as Paul Joesph Watson reported for Prison Planet .
In 2005 , NBC obtained a secret 400 - page Defense Department document listing more than 1,500 “ suspicious incidents ” across the country related to peaceful anti-war demonstrations .
“ The Defense Department document is the first inside look at how the U.S. military has stepped up intelligence collection inside this country since 9/11 , which now includes the monitoring of peaceful anti-war and counter - military recruitment groups , ” NBC reported .
In the wake of the false flag terror attacks on September 11 , 2001 , Donald Rumsfeld and the Pentagon established the Counterintelligence Field Activity .
CIFA illegally conducted broad domestic operations that targeted antiwar and other dissident domestic groups and logged these in the TALON database .
After the unit received negative publicity , the Pentagon ’s senior intelligence official , James R. Clapper , recommended to Sec. Def .
Gates that the counterintelligence field office be dismantled and that some of its operations be placed under the authority of the Defense Intelligence Agency .
On November 22 , 2008 , Alex Jones led a rally at the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas Texas .
The Dallas protest is specifically mentioned in the official Army document .
Ron Paul ’s brother was also in attendance .
OTN interview of Alex Jones at the End the Fed rally in Dallas Texas , November 22 , 2008 .
As the documents here demonstrate , the Pentagon as of late 2008 was still in the business of gathering intelligence on entirely legal and non-violent political activity and organizations around the country .
As the MIAC document reveals , the feds and their state and local “ partners ” consider groups in opposition to the Federal Reserve a threat .
Now the Pentagon as well has targeted this opposition with “ situational awareness and recommended mitigation measures . ”
If the above documents are indeed legitimate , they reveal how the Pentagon and the Army Reserve are protecting the Federal Reserve against End the Fed and other organizations engaged in constitutionally protected protest against a cartel of international bankers posing as a department of the federal government .

Boot from a ( jaunty ) live -cd and run the following code ( in this example the partition to convert is on / dev/ sda1 ) to convert the partition :
Mount the partition and change the type of the converted partition in fstab : change " " to " " like in the example below : change it to : and save the changes .
This step might be optional but when I upgraded from Intrepid to Jaunty the upgrade process did not install / update the new grub stage .
So if you do n't run either of the following code examples you might get an ( fatal ) error 13 when booting the machine .
Use this code to refresh grub when you dohave a separate / boot partition ( in this example the root partition is sda1 ) Use this code to refresh grub when youhave a separate / boot partition ( in this example the / boot partition is sda1 ) That 's it , after you reboot you you will be running from anfile system .
As a side note , all the files that where present before the conversion will not benefit from the conversion as they were written to disk usingtechnology .
Only newly created or overwritten files will be using the truetechnology ( so now , using update - manager will be extra beneficial ) .
Asandare compatible with each other having files written to disk inmode on yourfile system do not impose any risks ( and most if not allsectors could eventually disappear even without defragging ) .

The Paragon Space Development Corp. is the company that is currently working on sending a mini-greenhouse to the Moon , preferably by 2014 , according to company officials .
The constructions will hitch a ride to Earth 's natural satellite on the back of a rover / lander currently being constructed by Odyssey Moon , as part of the Google Lunar X Prize competition .
Details of this collaboration will be presented today in Tucson , Arizona , at a news conference held by Paragon .
The two companies are currently working together to construct the future craft 's thermal shield , which is supposed to be strong enough to allow the lander / rover to land safely on the Moon .
At the same time , the partners need to build the outer shield of the ship in such a manner that it will accommodate the envisioned biosphere , dubbed the “ Lunar Oasis . ”
“ It 's all very aggressive .
But it is n't fun if it is n't aggressive , ” PSDC chief executive officer Taber MacCallum said .
“ We are thrilled to have Paragon join the team with their expertise in thermal and biological systems .
I am incredibly inspired by our hope to grow the first plant on another world , ” Bob Richards , the founder and chief executive officer at Odyssey Moon , told in a news release .
“ People of all ages will get excited about the idea of growing a plant on the moon .
Imagine a bright flower on a plant in a crystal clear growth chamber on the surface of the moon , with the full Earth rising above the moonscape behind it ; these are the ideas that got me interested in space , ” MacCallum 's wife , Jane Poynter , added in the same release .
She is also a founder and president of Paragon .
“ The first plant to grow from seed and complete its life cycle on another world will be a significant step in the expansion of life beyond the earth .
The sooner we do it , the better , ” NASA 's Ames Research Center planetary scientist Chris McKay stressed in the same document .
The idea is not that far - fetched , considering the fact that plants already seem to grow very well in the zero - gravity environment of the space .
That is to say , the atmospheric conditions on the Moon will not pose too great of a threat to the mini-biosphere .
The only things that could interfere with the growth of the plant would be if an asteroid fell on top of the crystal container , or if a severe storm tipped it over and broke it .
Sand could also cover it during large storms and prevent the sunlight from hitting it .
A disgruntled and frustrated Rush Limpbot washed up in the surf to give evil - eyes to President Obama as he photo - opped with Italy ’s Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , Russia ’s President Dmitry Medvedev , and President Hu Jintao of China , as they find ways to success at the G20 summit in London , Thursday , while Obamacorns magically erupt out of the sea .
LONDON — With the one day super conference coming to an end with what critics are dubbing “ Obamacorns ” magically appearing out of the sea , U.S. President Obama said , “ I think we did okay .
We have agreed on a series of unprecedented steps to restore growth and prevent a crisis like this happening again .
We have created as fundamental a reworking of resources to these international financial institutions as anything we ’ve done in the last several decades . ”
“ Holy Shit , ” whistled Italy ’s Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , “ The guy just kicks it into another gear . ” German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed .
“ We have a very , very good , almost historic compromise ” that will provide the world with “ a clear financial markets architecture .
And President Obama is such a gentleman , ” she crooned , “ he keeps his hands to himself . ”
The group announced a global supervisory body to sniff out problems before they turn into full - fledged shit - storms , and pledged 1.1 trillion pieces of agreed upon valuable paper , what twentieth century historians called munnies , to aid countries they previously shat upon with nonchalant regularity .
Oh .
The “ Obamacorns “ — the sparkly - white pony - things with single horns that filled the atmosphere at the summit with great expectations — were last seen running into the London row houses followed by a phalanx of press trucks .
And Rush Limpbot ?
Who gives a rat ’s ass .

From Mark Probst ’s Live Journal :
On Amazon.com two days ago , mysteriously , the sales rankings disappeared from two newly - released high profile gay romance books : " Transgressions " by Erastes and " False Colors " by Alex Beecroft .
Everybody was perplexed .
Was it a glitch of some sort ?
The very next day HUNDREDS of gay and lesbian books simultaneously lost their sales rankings , including my book " The Filly . "
There was buzz , What ’s going on ?
Does Amazon have some sort of campaign to suppress the visibility of gay books ?
Is it just a major glitch in the system ?
Many of us decided to write to Amazon questioning why our rankings had disappeared .
Most received evasive replies from customer service reps not versed in what was happening .
As I am a publisher and have an Amazon Advantage account through which I supply Amazon with my books , I had a special way to contact them .
24 hours later I had a response :
In consideration of our entire customer base , we exclude " adult " material from appearing in some searches and best seller lists .
Since these lists are generated using sales ranks , adult materials must also be excluded from that feature .
Hence , if you have further questions , kindly write back to us .

Hello everyone , my name is Nao Zook from NIS America .
Today , we are very excited to announce our upcoming PSP title !
It ’s called “ Holy Invasion of Privacy , Badman !
What Did I Do To Deserve This ? ”
Now , I know the title is super long .
In fact , it just might be the longest , and craziest , title in videogame history !
But actually , we at NISA are pretty happy with this name .
So anyway , you must be wondering what this game is all about .
“ Holy Invasion of Privacy , Badman ! ” is a strategy game with an RPG feel to it .
You play as the God of Destruction , and you must save Badman , the underground overlord from various heroes .
Badman is helpless and whiny , but once in a while he finds the cajones to question your actions .
Sounds like Badman is a real pain in the butt , huh ?
But he ’s also got some hilarious lines , so we ’re sure you ’ll have fun with him .
Now , in the actual game you appear as a pickaxe .
Okay , we know , it ’s just a pickaxe .
But you ’re the friggin’ God of Destruction !
It ’s your duty to crush all these pesky heroes invading YOUR underground turf !
In order to defeat them , you just dig and dig and dig … this is how you produce the monsters and demons that will serve and fight for you .
They have their own Demon Ecosystem , so as they eat each other they will grow and reproduce .
The key to this ecosystem is keeping things balanced .
Once the balance in the ecosystem breaks , you will lose a great amount of your fighting force to use against the heroes .
So you have to pay attention to what happens to your demon army .
This game is very simple , but still offers plenty of depth .
( Literally !
You have to dig pretty deep to save Badman ’s empire ! )
“ Holy Invasion of Privacy , Badman ! ” boasts a retro- style visual flair that matches its throwback game style perfectly .
And we think lots of people will be attracted to Badman , and wo n’t be able to stop themselves from spending many sleepless nights with him !
Finally , we are planning to release a demo version of the game on PSN soon , so keep your eyes open !
Here is the tentative package art and a few screenshots from “ Holy Invasion of Privacy , Badman ! ”
Enjoy !
Read the full press release after the break .
HOLY INVASION OF PRIVACY BADMAN : WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS ?
COMING TO PLAYSTATION PORTABLE IN JULY 2009
Santa Ana , CA ( Apr 7 , 2009 ) – NIS America announced today that the retro classic themed strategy game “ Holy Invasion of Privacy Badman : What Did I Do to Deserve This ? ” will be arriving in North America in July 2009 .
As a critically acclaimed strategy game in Japan , Badmanwill make its presence felt in the west this summer .
From its retro-classic art style to its simple , yet intuitive game play , Badmanis the anti-trend of games today .
However , for players looking for a refreshingly new game experience , Badmanoffers more than plenty .
About Holy Invasion of Privacy , Badman !
The goal of the game is clean and simple :
As the God of Destruction , you must create a dungeon that is difficult and powerful enough to fend off human hero invasions .
The dungeon must have a self - sustaining ecosystem , so players must strategically dig and create a dungeon with a balanced food chain .
Periodically , human heroes will invade the dungeon in order to bring peace and harmony to the world , but they are your enemies .
You must destroy the heroes before they capture the Overlord and take him back to the surface .

Haskell で匿名関数を表現するのに \ を使うのはバックスラッシュがラムダ文字 λ に似てるかららしい。でもこれ は
Windows とかだと円記号になってしまって台無しである。それにバックスラッシュは相当多くの言語で一意にエスケープの意味を持つので混乱する。
匿名関数をラムダ lambda と呼ぶの は Lisp の影響だが 、Peter Norvig の Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming によると Lisp で匿名関数を lambda と書くのは以下のような由来らしい 。
- Russel と Whitehead の Principia Mathematica では のように束縛変数の上にキャレットを置く書き方をしていた
- Church がその記法を ^x( x+x ) と変え た
- キャレットの下に何も無いのが変だと思ったので形が似ている Λx ( x+x ) と変えた（大文字ラムダ ）
- やっぱり Λ は他の記号と見間違えやすいので小文字にして λx ( x+x ) とした
- McCarthy が Lisp を作ったときにそのラムダ表記を借りて lambda とし た
Haskell も Church の最初の記法にさかのぼればよかったのになあと思った。
Tomorrow might not be the best day to go to Best Buy , as two independent sources ( one of which we 've used in the past ) have warned us of extensive store - level layoffs .
UPDATE
Advertisement
One industry source described the firings as " huge , " the other as " massive . "
I think we get the point .
In the wake of Circuit City 's death , Best Buy is firing a lot of store - level employees starting in meetings at 7 am tomorrow morning ( which is not a huge surprise , as 4,000 members of Best Buy corporate - level have already been offered buy - outs ) .
Advertisement
Apparently , store management was informed today .
The unlucky employees to be fired will be informed tomorrow ( Saturday ) .
UPDATE : One source has updated that " Salaried management positions ( GMs , Sales Managers , Operation managers , etc , ) will be looked at being cut ... It 's a nation - wide [ cutback ] to further reduce overhead , and the stores have already been prepped for it , but announcements will happen tomorrow .
Many cuts are being given the opportunity to drop to $ 12/hr , but maintain a position . "
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 " 8 K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
UPDATE 2 : We 've gotten a lot more confirmation since this story was published .
One leadership - level employee clarifies that few to no specific layoffs are necessarily happening , but to stay , you 'll of course need to take a paycut :
"1) No employees are getting fired ( to my knowledge ) , everyone is being retained .
2 ) Some employees are getting their pay cut to $ 12.00 ( me ) , but Best Buy will be " bridging " the gap between your current pay and the drop for 9 months .
So say you made $ 14 an hour , you will now get a check at the beginning of each month for $ 14 - $ 12 , $ 2 * 38 hours a week * 4 weeks a month .
Really not a bad deal , think of another company that has ever done this , giving you 9 months to get promoted or find a new job .
[ Ed note : I really do n't understand corporate metrics ]
3 ) None of the changes go into effect until June .
4 ) The positions that are being cut are sales seniors ( a sub - supervisor role ) , and they are merging some departments to have one supervisor control multiple areas .
These changes will be announced later in April .
5 ) No changes to management have been announced yet .
6 ) Employees were also offered a severance package , not a very good one .
2 weeks of pay per year of employment with at least 6 months of COBRA . "
The space news site SpaceFlightNow has an incredible article up right now about how , in December of 1988 , not three years after the destruction of the Space Shuttle Challenger , NASA almost lost Atlantis .
Holy crap .
You have to read this article .
Insulation from one of the solid rocket boosters fell and slammed into the orbiter 's underside , damaging ( it was found later ) over 700 tiles along half the length of Atlantis !
Yikes .
Seriously , yikes .
When the crew onboard did a camera check of the tiles , they found the damage and were obviously seriously concerned .
They reported it to Mission Control , who looked at the video and said there was no cause for concern .
Astronauts Mike Mullane and Robert Gibson knew better .
In fact , they thought that re-entry might very well kill them .
It did n't , but it was a near thing .
One tile was totally gone , allowing the ( non-vital ) metal underneath it to partially melt .
Never heard this story , have you ?
I 'm not surprised .
This Atlantis mission was blacked - out because it was done for the Department of Defense ; the Shuttle was doing secret military work .
This is a point of contention for many people , since NASA is a civilian agency , but there you go .
The video the astronauts took of the orbiter 's belly had to be encrypted and somewhat low - res , so ground controllers did n't get a good view of the damage ... but they should have seen enough to raise alarms .
Gibson did n't argue with ground control :
... the resolution on the encrypted video was that bad that [ ground control ] based a conclusion on it that was in gross error .
...
If I had said hey , I think this is important enough for us to break the encryption and send you guys clear video , oh , it would have been pandemonium down there at DOD .
But in hindsight , oh man , that 's what we should have done .
In 1988 there was no safe haven on orbit for the Shuttle , so even if the orbiter were so damaged it would be destroyed on re-entry , not much could be done about it .
I would think NASA would tell the astronauts if this were the case ; there might be some things that can be done to maximize the safety of the crew 's return -- changing the re-entry angle to take pressure off the damaged right wing comes to mind , though it 's not clear how much that would help -- and talking to the astronauts is the only way to do that .
So it looks like the people on the ground really thought the damage was n't critical .
As the whole world found out 15 years later , insulation hitting tiles can indeed be critical , when we lost Columbia in 2003 .
NASA is a big agency , and it has loads of innovative people , creative people , people who spend their whole lives dreaming of space exploration .
But it is also a government agency , capable of incredible inertia and groupthink .
I hope that the folks at NASA have learned these lessons well .
In the next few years NASA may once again get the chance to have its reach exceed its grasp as it did during the magnificent Apollo era , and it would be a loss for everyone if bureaucracy and red tape were to shorten that reach .
In an article published on Slate yesterday , editor Dahlia Lithwick does a great job documenting the genesis of the wingnut assault on Yale Law Dean Harold Koh , which reached a sort of apex yesterday when Fox News actually accused the Obama administration of trying to impose Sharia law in the United States .
Lithwick writes :
It 's 11:45 a.m. on April 1 , and if you run a Google News search on Harold Koh , dean of Yale Law School and President Obama 's pick for legal adviser to the State Department , here 's what you 'll find : 13 pieces on far - right Web sites characterizing Koh as dangerous and anti-American ; several Fox News stories , updated several times daily , one of which describes the anti-Koh screeds as " burning up the Internet " ; and a measly two blog posts defending Koh from these attacks .
By the time you read this , I suspect that Fox News will have a scrolling red banner that reads , " Obama 's Koh pick imperils us all " ( and ... wait for it ... BINGO ! ) , the anti-Koh pieces will number 18 , and the pro-Koh blog posts will number three .
And yet by my most recent tally , every one of the anti-Koh rants dutifully repeats a canard that first appeared in a hatchet piece in the New York Post by former Bush administration speechwriter Meghan Clyne .
She asserts that Koh believes " Sharia law could apply to disputes in US courts . "
The evidence for her claim ?
" A New York lawyer , Steven Stein , says that , in addressing the Yale Club of Greenwich in 2007 , Koh claimed that 'in an appropriate case , he did n't see any reason why Sharia law would not be applied to govern a case in the United States . ' " Needless to say , if the future lawyer for the State Department wanted to apply Shariah law willy - nilly in American courtrooms , it would be a terrifying prospect .
As Lithwick writes , it turns out that the story spun by Mr. Stein was completely false ; Koh never proposed imposing Sharia law in the U.S.
The organizer of the event at which Koh spoke wrote a letter to the editor of the New York Post debunking the allegations :
I was the organizer of the Yale Club of Greenwich event on March 13 , which Meghan Clyne references .
The account given by Steve Stein of Dean Koh 's comments is totally fictitious and inaccurate .
I was in the room with my husband and several fellow alumni , and we are all adamant that Koh never said or suggested that sharia law could be used to govern cases in US courts .
The subject of his talk was Globalization and Yale Law School , so , of course , other forms of law were mentioned .
But never did Koh state or suggest that other forms of law should govern or dictate the American legal system .
Hopefully , your readers are interested in the facts .
Robin Reeves Zorthian President ,
Yale Alumni Association of Greenwich
Still , despite the obvious malice behind the assault on Koh , it continues unabated in the wingnut - o- sphere and on Fox and on Glenn Beck 's program .
Lithwick writes that the silence of the mainstream media in the face of these vicious attacks is effectively complicity in the face of character assassination , and she 's right .
Reporters may not feel like it's their obligation to come to Harold Koh 's defense .
But if they continue to let falsehoods about the Koh's of the world stand , one day some of them will find that they have become the targets of Rupert Murdoch 's media empire .
When that happens , will they wish they had spoken up when they still had a chance ?

The 2009 Word of the Year : Bezzle
What seems to spook people now is the possibility that everybody in charge of everything is a fraud or a crook .
Legitimacy has left the system .
- Jim Kunstler
I nominate " bezzle " for 2009 Word of the Year .
For seven unrelenting months now , beginning in September of 2008 , we have been carpet - bombed daily with news of fraud , embezzlement , and at the very least egregious over compensation for incompetence in the executive suites of America .
Expect the revelations to continue for quite some time .
These are just two examples : CEO Compensation , Perks Surge Despite Firms ' Troubles Companies may be floundering , but ...
T he notion that Stephen Harper should lead his party in the next federal election is a matter of wide consensus among Conservatives , but the same cannot necessarily be said of Jack Layton and the NDP .
A column that concluded it was premature for the prime minister to consider a walk in the snow drew positive responses from many Conservatives last week .
Some of the most vocal criticism it inspired came from people who had concluded from the column headline that it was an invitation for Harper to quit and had not taken the time to actually read it .
There are also Conservative supporters who simply cannot countenance the notion that they might lose the next election and who react viscerally to any suggestion that their party is fallible .
The bottom line , though , is that there is no serious Conservative appetite for a change in leadership before the election , including among the Prime Minister 's potential successors , who mostly have no inclination – should Conservative fortunes deteriorate further – to risk becoming Harper 's Kim Campbell .
A column about a major shift in NDP focus that could see that party ensure the survival of the minority Conservative government over the coming months drew a very different response .
Some New Democrats were so adamant that their party would never lift a finger to prolong the life of the Harper regime that they argued the column was based on a figment of my imagination .
Layton 's post - Easter change of heart was not widely reported on but in a published interview last week , Brian Topp , the NDP 's national campaign director , laid out some of the rationale behind it .
" The New Democrat caucus tried to do a big thing – tried to replace the government .
And it did n't happen .
That 's the most memorable thing our team has done so far in this Parliament .
Undertakings that do n't succeed do n't build support , " he told The Globe and Mail , adding : " As they have done in every minority Parliament since the 1920s , the New Democrats are saying they will look for ways to make progress on the agenda the NDP committed to pursue during the last election .
That includes using the NDP 's balance of power position in Parliament to try to make progress . "
If the reaction to my column is typical of the grassroots reception to the new NDP tack , co-operating with the Conservatives will be a hard sell with many New Democrats .
Some of them are suggesting that the only viable way to justify extending the life of the Harper government would be to use the time to change leaders .
While most New Democrats do not blame Layton for being left at the altar of the coalition , there is a growing feeling that he has taken the party as far as he could .
Current polls do suggest that he is facing diminishing returns in the next election .
A leadership campaign would certainly give the NDP the much - needed pre-election exposure it has so desperately come to crave since Michael Ignatieff has become Liberal leader .
Opening up the leadership at a time when the party is in a position of relative strength might also attract more interesting candidates than one that takes place against the backdrop of an election setback .
As things stand today , at least one prominent potential successor to Layton , Outremont 's Thomas Mulcair , might not even have a seat in Parliament after the next election .
And he could be just one of many NDP casualties .

Today I wanted to bring you some more money saving tips while I toil away on the eCookbook I ’m working up for you !
I had hoped to have this post up earlier but its been one of those crazy days .
Sometimes I feel certain I could be a rich woman if I sold tickets to witness the things I go through in the course of trying to get a post up !

Save Money When Eating Out
We very seldom eat out and this is entirely my fault .
I ca n’t help it , though !
Every time we get the check , I look at the total and find myself mentally adding up how many dinners I could have made at home for the same amount of money .
Most of the time , eating out with a family of four costs the same amount of money as putting four to six suppers on the table .
It is really easy to feed a family of four for under ten dollars a meal at home and feeding them for five dollars is entirely doable as well .
One of the great things about our economy right now ( yes , I just said ONE of the MANY great things !
– there is always a bright side if you look for it ! ) is that you can get some amazing deals at restaurants if you only look !
We are now able to eat at our favorite steak house for about twenty dollars , all four of us !
We have eaten for even less in the past two weeks .
How do you do this ?
Plan ahead when eating out and choose your restaurant by the deals the offer .
Check the restaurant ’s website .
Sign up for any email newsletters they may have and you will more often than not receive great coupons .
Most have a loyalty club of some sort as well .
I signed up for Logan ’s and Ruby Tuesday ’s newsletter and get coupons often from them in my email .
You ’d be amazed how many restaurants are offering this now !
Find the restaurants offering deals for kids !
Many more places are offering kids eat free programs but some are only on certain days of the week so call ahead .
Even with two kids , getting kid ’s meals free can easily save over fifteen dollars .
I recently found a great post listing some restaurants where kids eat free or cheap on a locally run website , Two Thrifty Sisters , you can view that post here .
Eat out before four o’clock or on weeknights , this is when you can find the best deals .
I find the lack of crowds and wait time much more enjoyable , too !
My friend , Mary Anne calls this “ Eatin ’ out with the paw paws and mee maws ” and I ca n’t think of a finer crowd to dine with !
Sign up for the Pizza chain ’s newsletters .
Pizza Hut and Papa Johns send out regular coupons in email .
Call the restaurant and see if they have any weekday or weeknight specials
Check the search engines for restaurant deals .
Do n’t forget to hit up your favorite fast food websites !
I was recently craving my yearly heart attack meal at Captain D’s and went online to see if they had any deals ( Captain D ’s food is amazingly good but about as greasy as they come… still SO GOOD ! ) .
I signed up for their newsletter and within minutes had a coupon for a free adult dinner .
Got my arteries clogged for free !
Many major fast food chains are doing this now so it pays to visit their websites and nose around a bit .
Other Ways To Save
Buying a side of beef
This is touted as a miracle worker when it comes to saving money and I have always wanted to do it !
My problem is finding someone to buy it from .
When we were little my mother ’s father gave each family a calf at Christmas and that provided our beef for the entire year .
I still remember seeing our freezer filled to the brim with packages of meat wrapped in white paper .
I ’ve scoured the internet for a place to purchase a side of beef in my area to no avail .
Hopefully some of you will have better luck at this .
If you do let me know !
Food Programs That Help
Many people are n’t aware of the programs out there which serve as sort of “ food co-operatives ” in order for families to be able to buy boxes of groceries at a discount .
Many of these programs have no pre-qualifications and welcome anyone to participate .
They simply exist to help families save money and still put great meals on the table .
One such program is Angel Food Ministries .
This program allows participants to purchase a box of food for around $ 30.00 .
The food included is set to feed a typical family of four for a week or a senior citizen for a month .
Tipnut wrote a great article on this which can be viewed here and goes into more detail 🙂
There are other such programs as well though .
Please visit the following links for more information on programs such as this and if you know of another one , please let us know about it in the comments !

Freezer Cooking Problem – Where Do I Find The Space ?
Thanks again to my sister in law , Tina for her great freezer cooking posts last week .
Many of you have emailed or commented asking how to freezer cook with very limited freezer space so I thought I ’d show you my favorite method .
I recently mixed up three batches of Cheesy Chicken and Corn Casserole and here is how I froze it :
Measure out even portions into Gallon ( or quart for two people ) sized freezer bags .
Write Instructions on Bags
Smooth them out flat , removing as much air as possible .
Freeze flat
Once frozen , stand them up and stack like bookends .
This takes up very little space !
To bake , simply thaw the bag in your fridge the night before and when you are ready pour it into your baking dish .
This is a frozen bag .
Okay so it was n’t exactly flat .. but it was awfully close !
My writing translates to : Pour in dish .
Bake at 350 for 30 min .
Add cheese .
Bake til melted .
🙂
Told ya I have horrendous handwriting .
I also had enough to fill two little loaf pans with casserole for my Grandmother to have as a quick and easy dinner one night .
I just filled up my little loaf pans and went ahead and topped them with cheese and wrote instructions directly on the foil for Grandmama .
The most important thing when it comes to saving money on groceries is to PLAN AHEAD .
By planning in advance , shopping sales , using coupons and other saving strategies as well as plotting your meals around what you have on hand already , anyone can drastically reduce grocery costs .
Southern Savers has recently become my ultimate go to source and I never hit the grocery store without her specials and suggestions printed out and tucked into my purse !
What are your great money saving tips when it comes to feeding your family ?
I want to hear them !
Please share with us in the comments below !
I ’m a little behind this week in my comments and emails and want to thank you all so much for taking the time to send them to me and post here .
Like all of you , I need motivation , too !
Your comments are the fuel that keeps me running at full steam !
I am so very grateful to each and every one of you .
Gratefully ,
Christy 🙂

By now , you ’ve heard about the leaked workprint of X - Men Origins : Wolverine .
You ’ve heard that it ’s been downloaded more times than a Megan Fox sex tape would be should the male species ever become that lucky .
I ’ve seen that workprint .
FBI , you can call the dogs off .
Just because I watched the early version of X - Men Origins : Wolverine ( it officially hits theaters on May 1 ) , does n’t mean I downloaded it personally .
Just wanted to spare myself the cavity search .
Oh , and chill out Hugh Jackman — I ’ll still splurge on a ticket to see the final product .
Spoiler alert :
There will be spoilers in this review .
I am also in no way an X - Men expert .
I would classify myself somewhere in between clueless and fanboy .
You also should know that there were some unfinished effects shots and that ten minutes of footage filmed during re-shoots has since been added to the film to help cover up its narrative shortcomings .
David Benioff — who also wrote the Kite Runner , yay , and Troy , nay — penned the script .
My major complaint with both the script and the film is that both are too short .
I think that Benioff and director Gavin Hood assumed the audience would slouch down in their cushy movie theater seats already possessing vast knowledge of not only the title character , but the supporting cast of characters as well .
97 minutes is a Jim Carrey comedy — not an epic comic book origins story .
For example , the lovestory between Logan / Wolverine and Kayla Silver Fox ( Lynn Collins ) felt off .
I thought the backstory behind the Bruce Banner - Betsy Ross lovestory in last summer ’s The Incredible Hulk worked much better .
In fact , the Logan - Kayla relationship felt like a poor man ’s version of the lovestory in the Bourne series .
That ’s a shame , because I enjoyed the performances of both Collins and Jackman .
Additionally , I think the Wolverine / Sabertooth prologue was rushed .
The childhood event which sets the plot in motion was more confusing than it was compelling .
I ’m hoping they addressed that sequence in the re-shoots .
The subsequent action footage of the two fighting in some of recent history ’s biggest wars was pretty cool .
I thought that was a nice transition to their lives as modern - day mercenaries .
As far as other important characters like Deadpool ( Ryan Reynolds ) and Gambit ( Taylor Kitsch of Friday Night Lights ) , we hardly got to know them .
We also hardly got to know the villain , William Stryker , whose backstory was spoken and not shown .
They could have done some awesome flashbacks there .
Danny Huston turned in a strong performance and deserved better .
Gambit might even deserve his own movie .
Kitsch stole the show when he was onscreen , even though I half expected him to start drunkenly ranting about Lyla Garrity .
The whole thing just felt rushed .
If you did n’t grow up loving Wolverine or grow fond of him during the X - Men trilogy , then I really do n’t see how anyone could have become too attached to him .
I thought Liev Schrieber ’s ( yes , that dude from Scream ) Sabretooth was a pretty solid villain .
That is , until he helped his brother Wolverine defeat Deadpool , er , Weapon XI , Stryker ’s scientifically engineered super mutant , there at the end .
Reynolds was so good as Deadpool , that I honestly felt robbed when I only got to see 10 minutes of him onscreen .
Well , unless you count where he comes back with his mouth sealed shut a la Neo in The Matrix as the ridiculous - looking Weapon XI .
The train completely fell off the tracks at that point .
During one part of the final showdown , Wolverine deflected Weapon XI ’s Cyclops - like laser beams with his adamantium claws .
Then , after the brothers defeated Weapon XI , things really got retarded .
Sabretooth just up and left .
Stryker shot Wolverine in the head from behind with adamantium bullets .
Wolverine was out cold after that , very slowly regenerating even though his memory would apparently not due to the adamantium .
Even though Stryker had just ordered Weapon XI to decapitate Wolverine — something that was talked about as the only way to kill Sabretooth and Wolverine throughout the entire film ! — he simply walked away when he finally had the chance to cut his enemy ’s head off .
Then when he was about to shoot Silver Fox , he got close enough to allow her to touch him .
He did this even though he knew she could manipulate the thoughts of anyone she touched .
Again , Huston deserved better .
I enjoyed some of the twists .
Like the Silver Fox one where she is forced by Stryker to betray Wolverine in order to save her sister , Emma Frost .
I even enjoyed some of the bit players like Will .
I. Am ’s John and Meriadoc Brandybuck ‘s Bolt .
The Dukes character in the Eddie Murphy fatsuit even gave me a few chuckles .
Overall , the strong performances ( except for Danniel Henney ’s Agent Zero , I thought he was awful ) could n’t save this film .
The action sequences were uninspiring and unoriginal , and the plot was rushed .
If the action sequences end up looking real good and the re-shoots turn out well , this will end up being a fun summer popcorn movie worth splurging on once .
For now , I ca n’t give X - Men Origins : Wolverine any higher than a C. ranking it somewhere between the last Mummy movie and Iron Man .
Here ’s hoping that David Goyer ’s X - Men Orgins : Magneto and Zak Penn ’s X - Men : First Class turn out better .
I doubt those films will , though .
Who knows if they will even get greenlit if this one flops .
I guess part of me is just scared the series will never recover from the curse of the Rat Daddy .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran ’s top authority said on Wednesday U.S. President Barack Obama was pursuing the same “ wrong path ” as George W. Bush in supporting Israel and described the Jewish state as a “ cancerous tumour . ”
Iran 's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks during Friday prayers in Tehran September 19 , 2008 .

The comments by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the final say on policy in the Islamic Republic , are likely to disappoint the new U.S. administration which wants to engage Iran but has called on Tehran to “ unclench its fist . ”
“ Even the new president of America , who has come to power with slogans about changing Bush ’s policies , is defending state terrorism by talking about unconditional commitment to Israel ’s security , ” Khamenei said .
Khamenei , speaking at a conference on the Palestinian issue in Tehran , said Obama was following the same “ wrong path ” of his predecessor in the White House .
The United States has long called on Iran to end its opposition to peace - making in the Middle East and to stop supporting organisations like Lebanon ’s Hezbollah and the Palestinian Hamas group that Washington considers terrorist .
Iran says these groups are fighting an illegal occupation on Palestinian land and does not recognise Israel ’s right to exist .
One Iranian analyst said Khamenei may be restating Iran ’s tough line to make clear Tehran would not easily give up regional policies that could be bargaining chips in any talks .
“ He is saying you also have to change if you want us to change , ” said the analyst , who asked not be named .
“ Iran can not afford letting go of its regional policies .
It can not happen that easily . ”
Breaking with Bush , Obama ’s administration has talked of engaging with Iran on a range of issues including its disputed nuclear ambitions .
But a senior U.S. official said on Monday Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was doubtful Iran would respond to any offers of engagement when they are made .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said last month Iran would agree to talks if they were based on mutual respect but has also previously listed conditions for any opening , such as saying Washington must withdraw troops from around the world .
Ultimately , any decision will depend on Khamenei , who has so far not directly addressed the issue of Obama ’s overtures but has in the past said U.S. governments could not be trusted .
‘ STANDING FIRM ’
“ Another big mistake is to say that the only way to save the Palestinian nation is by negotiations , ” Khamenei said .
“ Negotiations with whom ?
With an occupying and bullying regime , who does not believe in any other principle other than force ?
...
Or negotiations with America and Britain who committed the biggest sin in creating and supporting this cancerous tumour ... ? ” he added .
“ The way to salvation ( for Palestinians ) is standing firm and resisting , ” the supreme leader said .
Khamenei also said the Holocaust , in which six million Jews died at the hands of the Nazis , was used to “ usurp ” Palestinian land and said the West and Israel showed the weakness of their cause by not allowing anyone to question the Holocaust .
Ahmadinejad , who previously caused Western ire by saying the Holocaust was a “ myth , ” said : “ The story of the Holocaust , a nation without a homeland and a homeland without a nation ... are the big lies of our era . ”
“ The continuation of the Zionist regime even on one inch of the land of Palestine , because of the nature of that regime , means the continuation of crime , occupation , threat and insult to the nations , ” the president told the conference .
He repeated a call for a referendum among Palestinian Muslims , Jews and Christians around the world to determine what government to establish on all land that now includes Israel .

During an interview over the weekend , Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) called for armed overthrow of the U.S. government .
What is the issue that has Bachmann calling for marches in the streets ?
She is worried about the danger of a cap and trade system to combat global warming which she denied as a human caused problem .
According to Smart Politics , Bachmann said , “ I ’m a foreign correspondent on enemy lines and I try to let everyone back here in Minnesota know exactly the nefarious activities that are taking place in Washington . ”
She also reiterated her claim that global warming is not man made during the interview , which brought her to call for armed overthrow of the government over President Obama ’s cap and trade plan .
Bachmann said , “ I want people in Minnesota armed and dangerous on this issue of the energy tax because we need to fight back .
Thomas Jefferson told us ‘ having a revolution every now and then is a good thing , ’ and the people – we the people – are going to have to fight back hard if we ’re not going to lose our country .
And I think this has the potential of changing the dynamic of freedom forever in the United States . ”

Here is her full interview with WWTC 1280 :
You may remember Bachmann for her memorable appearance on MSNBC ’s Hardball during the presidential campaign where she called for a McCarthy like investigation into anti-American activity .
She also claimed that Barack Obama held un-American views .
After her appearance , she claimed that she was entrapped by Chris Matthews .
Here is the video :
We all know that Bachmann is Glenn Beck level crazy .
In fact , she has been a guest on his program , but if you thought that she was the only Republican who does n’t believe in global warming , you ’d be mistaken .
The notable non-believers include Rep. Ron Paul , Rep. Dana Rohrabacher , and Sen. James Inhofe .
However , none of the other members who doubt global warming have called for an armed revolution against the government .
This is what puts Rep. Bachmann in a class by herself .
It is fine to oppose the policy and people are free to disagree with the science , but calling for overthrow of the government over cap and trade is insane .
For the second time in just over a year , the dice are silent in the gaming world .
News has reached us that Dave Arneson , co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons , passed away last night at the age of 61 .
While not as famous as Gary Gygax , who passed away in March of last year , Arneson was a driving force behind * D& D '*s creation and his contribution to the world of adventure gaming should not be underestimated .
It was Arneson 's spark that transformed Gygax 's game Chainmail into the first edition of D&D , and begat everything that followed .
Arneson had to fight to get credit for his contributions , filing multiple lawsuits ( later resolved out - of - court ) against Gygax over crediting and royalties .
He nonetheless did return to TSR in the mid-'80s to work with Gygax again .
Following that , he began a second career as an educator , working in several schools with a particular focus on how to use gaming as an instructional tool .
Arneson suffered a stroke in 2002 and was soon after diagnosed with cancer .
He finally lost his battle with cancer last night , surrounded by his family , in St. Paul , Minnesota .
Gamers everywhere owe him a certain debt of gratitude for his work .
He will be sorely missed .
Almost 100,000 civilians have fled the war zone in northern Sri Lanka .
Journalists are generally not given access to fleeing civilians .
But Swaminathan Natarajan of the BBC's Tamil service managed to speak to Vinoo , a young mother who made this difficult journey and is now in a government - controlled camp in Vavuniya .
We were staying near Puttumatalan hospital .
On the night of the 20th there was heavy shelling .
I thought , I wo n't survive .
There was continuous shelling from midnight to the early morning .
Many civilians have made a harrowing journey from the war zone During that time we took shelter inside a bunker .
At around 6 am , when I came out of the bunker , I saw people running all around amid shelling .
I also joined them .
But soon I got injured in the legs and arms .
My husband got injured in his head .
Some shrapnel is still inside his head .
Still , we came out of the LTTE ( Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ) - controlled area along with our son .
My mother and brother also started with us , but I do n't know what happened to them .
I have lost all contact with them .
The LTTE had built a bund and because of that structure it was difficult to move .
People had to walk through neck - deep water .
Some children fell down in the water .
It was difficult to cross that area .
I do n't know how to describe that .
We were trying to escape for the past month .
We packed a few of our belongings and tried to escape at an opportune moment .
But we were prevented by the LTTE from escaping from the area .
Once we crossed over to the government - controlled areas we were checked in at a few checkpoints .
They completely checked everything .
They made a detailed account of the jewels I was wearing and took note of the cash I had with me .
After the checking we were kept in a military camp , in a place called Chalai .
From there we were taken to a school .
From there we were brought to Vavuniya by bus .
Before reaching Vavuniya we were checked again in the Omantai checkpoint .
There has been no proper food for the past three days .
Yesterday afternoon we got something to eat .
Today , only in the late afternoon , we got food .
But the amount is very little .
We three shared a single meal .
I have not been given any clothes .
So I am still wearing a dress which got wet and is covered by mud and dirt .
I have not taken a bath for the past three days .
It is very difficult here .
My husband 's bandage needs to be changed immediately .
In the LTTE - controlled areas life is very difficult .
There is a huge shortage of food .
There is heavy fighting and many are dying every day .
Some days it is difficult to get a single meal .
So we planned to escape to the government - controlled areas .
We were not bothered to take any of our belongings .
We made three attempts in one month to escape but all of them were thwarted by the LTTE .
Now we have come to safety .

How to build the Warré Garden Hive
The Warré ( or ' People 's Hive ' , as its inventor named it ) is a popular alternative to other vertical hives and is used by some commercial beekeepers , especially in France .
In the right conditions , it can produce a good crop of honey and requires very little intervention by the beekeeper when compared with conventional hives .
phplist admin The Warré ( or ' People 's Hive ' , as its inventor named it ) is a popular alternative to other vertical hives and is used by some commercial beekeepers , especially in France .
In the right conditions , it can produce a good crop of honey and requires very little intervention by the beekeeper when compared with conventional hives .
These plans are recommended as being clear and easy to follow .
The Warré Garden Hive Construction Guide 2.0 requires only moderate skills and uses low - cost materials .
If you can put up a set of shelves , then you can make a serviceable beehive !
What is " Balanced Beekeeping " ?
Balanced beekeeping is a continuous quest for the improvement of our relationship with bees .
It recognises that keeping bees is not natural , because in nature , only bees keep bees .
It acknowledges that our desire for honey may not be matched by the bees ' willingness to give it up .
It recognises that the bees have their own lives and they would probably prefer that we left them alone , however much we are kindly disposed towards them .
It is a search for the best ways to be with bees .
Pop - up campers have come a long way in terms of comfort and built - in technology , but for the most part the design has remained unchanged .
Of course , it was only a matter of time until someone came up with something new and exciting and in this case , it could change how people look at their " home away from home . "
I guess calling it a pop-up is slightly misleading , as it expands outward rather than upward , but it is interesting nonetheless .
Once parked the Mobile Mini House unfolds , much like a Japanese Hand Fan , and covers a full 252 degrees .
When opened , you can live comfortably knowing you have a bathroom , bedroom , kitchen , office and living room at your disposal .
The rooms are divided by a system lightweight walls that slide along a pair of tracks laid into the floor .
The individual components of each room are either folded to save space or stored somewhere that can be easily accessed during set - up .
Once fully extended and everything has been arranged to your liking , a membrane can be stretched over the entire thing to keep the bugs and weather on the outside .
The Mobile Mini House is still in the design phase and may never be anything but a computer rendering , but should it be produced I would be very interested .

Upon talking to those who are living a debt - free lifestyle because they have taken the hard road and paid of all of their debt , we can glean some important motivators which we can use to help spur us towards our goals .
For some it can seem disappointing to hear this because it may not appear that there is any way that they can join the ranks of those who have traveled this path successfully .
But the idea to keep in mind is that these people were once in the same position ( some worse ) and were able to work their plan in spite of their circumstances .
So , what was it that they did that you are not ?
How were they able to reach their goal ?
It all comes down to desire and focusing on the benefits of a debt - free lifestyle .
Consider these benefits for yourself :
The Paid off Mortgage .
What would it be like to no longer have a mortgage payment ?
How would it make you feel to know that each month you do not have to write that big check ?
Imagine what you could do with that money to help prepare for retirement .
Think about being able to afford college for your children .
All of these can become a reality without a mortgage payment every month .
Necessities Paid for .
When you are living a debt - free lifestyle , you no longer struggle to pay for things that you need .
Budgeting is not a chore .
But , probably most importantly , you will find yourself in the position of being able to live off of one income , not two .
This is especially true given the economic climate that surrounds us today with jobs being lost all around you .
Stay home with Children .
If there are children in the family , imagine being able to stay home and raise them .
This is especially important as they are younger .
They will benefit from you being there for them when they need you not when you can give them time after you are home from work and are exhausted .
Take the Job of Your Dreams .
What would it be like to be able to take a job doing what you always wanted to do regardless of the income from that job ?
How would that make you feel about your career ?
This can be a reality if you work hard to live a debt - free lifestyle .
Act on Your Dreams .
Your dreams have a much better opportunity to become reality when you are unfettered by debt .
Being able to do things that you always wanted but could not afford can become a reality .

Al Franken has started using the title ' senator - elect . '
Franken : Call me ' Senator - elect '
Democrat Al Franken has started using the title “ senator - elect , ” despite the fact that his contest with Sen. Norm Coleman ( R - Minn . ) has not yet been decided .
A Minnesota court is currently hearing Coleman ’s challenge to the recount .

A press release sent out by his staff Monday announcing a series of town halls with local mayors reads : “ Sen. - elect Franken held the first in a series of roundtable discussions with Minnesota Mayors today in St. Paul .
Franken and metro-area mayors discussed the economic realities facing their cities , budget cuts , President Obama 's measures for economic stimulus , and how to grow Minnesota ’s economy . ”
The Democratic mayor of St. Paul is also quoted in the release referring to Franken as the victor .
“ Right now , Washington is debating matters of enormous consequence to Minnesota ’s economy , ” Mayor Chris Coleman says in the release .
“ Senator - elect Franken understands what our cities need to prosper , and we ’re ready for him to go to Washington to be a voice for us . ”
Since taking the lead in the recount , Franken has insisted that he is the rightful winner of the Minnesota Senate race but did not use the phrase in a press release until Monday .
Franken staffers and attorneys have used the phrase but often drawn flack from Republicans for doing so .
Franken spokeswoman Jess McIntosh told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that “ when people call Al ' senator , ' he corrects them . ”
“ It happened all the time , ” she added .
Franken himself has resisted using the title , even though he has declared himself the winner .
“ I won the recount , ” Franken said at a press conference after the initial recount concluded .
“ You can call me Al . ”
The GOP has promised to mount a filibuster — which would require 60 votes to overcome — if Democrats attempt to seat Franken before Coleman exhausts his legal remedies .
“ Al Franken ’s ' Senat or - for - a - day ' public relations stunt is not a replacement for proven leadership , ” said Coleman press secretary Luke Friedrich in a statement .
“ We have all seen that Al Franken has no regard for the Minnesota election process , but pretending to be a senator before we know who really won is just another sign of desperation from a candidate who ’s worried about what will happen if all the votes are counted . ”

What to Know About Giving a Deposition — Some Tips to Keep in Mind
It ’s like you ’re in an alternate universe in which Al Gore was president and Sanjaya won American Idol .
Peter Steinfels writes all about it in The New York Times .
Phil Zuckerman spent 14 months in Scandinavia , talking to hundreds of Danes and Swedes about religion .
It was n’t easy .
Anyone who has paid attention knows that Denmark and Sweden are among the least religious nations in the world .
Polls asking about belief in God , the importance of religion in people ’s lives , belief in life after death or church attendance consistently bear this out .
Zuckerman writes all about his findings in the book Society Without God .
How weird is this alternate non-religious universe ?
Thoughtful , well - educated Danes and Swedes reacted to Mr. Zuckerman ’s basic questions about God , Jesus , death and so on as completely novel .
“ I really have never thought about that , ” one of his interviewees answered , adding , “ It ’s been fun to get these kinds of questions that I never , never think about . ”
This indifference or obliviousness to religious matters was sometimes subtly enforced .
“ In Denmark , ” a pastor told Mr. Zuckerman , “ the word ‘ God ’ is one of the most embarrassing words you can say .
You would rather go naked through the city than talk about God . ”
One man recounted the shock he felt when a colleague , after a few drinks , confessed to believing in God .
“ I hope you do n’t feel I ’m a bad person , ” the colleague pleaded .
Are you shitting me ?
This is so not fair .
In my world , religion has the power and we still have to argue about evolution and gay marriage .
We find out that Scandinavia was “ a society — a markedly irreligious society — that was , above all , moral , stable , humane and deeply good . ”
We find out “ many of his interviewees spoke of death , without fear or anxiety , and their notable lack of existential searching for any ultimate meaning of life . ”
They did n’t like the word “ atheist , ” though .
And why would they ?
Why would they need a word to describe something that is so obvious to everyone ?
It ’s what Sam Harris was alluding to a couple years ago in his remarks at the Atheist Alliance International conference when he said we need to drop the “ a - word ” label .
Scandinavia has kept some of the cultural aspects of religion — baptisms and marriages in church — but without any of the superstitious beliefs that go along with them .
I ’m ok with that .
How long will it take for America to become more like Sweden and Denmark ?
( And why do I even have to ask that question ? )

This is the design specification for Notify OSD .
If you are a software developer looking for advice on making your software compatible with Notify OSD , see NotificationDevelopmentGuidelines
This specification contains some issues not yet resolved .
Your feedback is welcome at NotifyOSD / Comments .
To improve the user experience for notifications in Ubuntu and Kubuntu , the Desktop Notifications Specification and the KNotification API should be implemented in a consistent way , with non-interactive , non-directional , non-overlapping notification bubbles that can be clicked through and look beautiful .
For compatibility with this system , Ubuntu and Kubuntu software should be patched so that it does not rely on notifications being interactive or pointing to notification area icons , and when an unpatched program incorrectly requests a notification with actions it should be shown as an alert box .
Any notification configuration should be handled by individual applications .
Visual confirmation of hotkey changes to volume , screen brightness , and backlight brightness should also be presented in bubbles the same way as notifications .
Canonical Ltd’s Design team and Desktop Experience team are the upstream developers for this work .
Notify OSD is hosted on Launchpad .
Work for Lucid
Rationale
There are many reasons that a computer may want to notify you of things not directly related to what you are doing right now .
Software updates may be available ; you may have received a new instant message ; your 300 - page print job may have finally finished ; you may have only ten minutes of battery left .
Sometimes these events need a response or at least acknowledgement , or do n’t need to be read immediately , in which case they should be presented in an alert box or some other window .
For cases where a notification is best read immediately but there is no applicable response , however , the most appropriate mechanism is a non-interactive notification bubble .
( For more details on the various notification mechanisms and when to use each one , see NotificationDesignGuidelines . )
Ubuntu previously used notification - daemon , which presented notification bubbles as interactive and therefore risked accidental clicks .
The previous bubbles were also rather unattractive , so replacing the notification system gave us the opportunity to make them beautiful .
And presenting volume , brightness , and similar changes in the same way as notifications decreases visual variety , and introduces a consistent appearance for non-interactive things .
Use cases
Examples of notification bubbles and other forms of notification :
Ten seconds after waking from sleep , your notebook successfully connects to your company ’s wireless network .
A notification bubble appears , with a wireless icon and the text “ Connected to Yoyodyne ” .
You and your colleague Camila are collaborating on a presentation over instant messaging .
Whenever Camila says something while the presentation window is in front , what she says appears in a notification bubble with her buddy icon .
If she says something else within a few seconds of the bubble appearing , the bubble grows smoothly to accommodate the new text , and its disappearance is delayed .
As soon as you switch back to Camila ’s chat window , her notification bubble disappears .
You begin giving your presentation to the management team .
Five minutes in , Camila sends you another instant message : “ Hope it 's going well ! ;-) ” .
Fortunately , this time no notification bubble appears to disrupt your presentation .
Twenty minutes into your presentation , while you are answering a question and not looking at the screen , your battery reaches a critically low level .
An alert box appears , floating over the presentation , warning you of this fact .
You quickly connect the notebook to a colleague ’s power supply .
The alert box disappears by itself .
With the presentation over , you disconnect from the power supply and return to your office .
A notification bubble appears showing that the notebook has switched to battery power .
You browse the company intranet while waiting for your e-mail program to launch .
This being a Monday , you have over 100 new messages , and because your e-mail program is in the background it notifies you of this using a bubble .
At the same time , the envelope icon in the top panel darkens to indicate the new messages .
You open the envelope menu to switch back to your Inbox .
Examples of confirmation bubbles :
Your secondary display is a little too bright , so you want to dim it without affecting your primary display .
Looking at the secondary display , you press the Reduce Brightness key on your keyboard .
An overlay appears on that display , showing the brightness reducing .
Immediately after changing the brightness , you increase the sound volume , also with the keyboard .
The brightness overlay is replaced instantly by a volume overlay .
After a few seconds , the overlay fades away .
You change the volume again , this time using the volume menu in the top panel .
No overlay appears , because visual feedback is provided by the menu itself .
Targeted environments
It is most important for Notify OSD to work correctly with Compiz in either Ubuntu or Kubuntu , Metacity composited in Ubuntu , and kwin composited in Kubuntu .
Other targets are Metacity non-composited , kwin non-composited , xfw m4 non-composited , and xfw m4 composited .
System nomenclature
Notify OSD should be packaged under the name notify - osd .
When running , its process should also be called notify - osd .
Bubble appearance and layout
Notify OSD should display two types of bubbles , which this specification calls confirmation bubbles ( confirmation of e.g. change in sound volume , change in display brightness , or ejecting a CD ) and notification bubbles ( e.g. instant message , unrequested change in Internet connectivity ) .
For the purpose of this specification , the term leading means “ left ” whenever the system is using a left - to - right language , and “ right ” whenever the system is using a right - to - left language .
The term trailing means “ right ” whenever the system is using a left - to - right language , and “ left ” whenever the system is using a right - to - left language .
All mockups in this specification are of LTR layouts .
Inside the bubble
Regardless of type , a bubble should appear as a rectangle of color # 131313 ( regardless of theme ) with opacity 80 % , corner roundness 0.375 em , and a drop shadow of # 000000 color and 0.5 em spread .
The bubble should blur whatever is behind it with a Gaussian blur of 0.125 em .
A bubble should be 24 ems wide ( not including the drop shadow ) .
Its height depends on the contents , but should be a minimum of 5 ems , and a maximum just tall enough to display 10 lines of body text ( which means the maximum height of a bubble with a title is greater than of a bubble without a title ) .
Furthermore , the bottom limit is 6 ems from the top of the bottom panel , if there is one , or otherwise 6 ems from the bottom of the screen ( as if there was a 5 - em bubble at the bottom plus 0.5 em margin on each side ) .
Regardless of font and screen size , a bubble must not be so tall that it extends beyond the bottom limit .
Bubbles feature an icon , and / or some text or a gauge .
All text elements should have a drop shadow of # 000000 color and 0.125 em spread .
Icon
Any icon should be scaled so that its largest dimension is 3 ems , while retaining the icon ’s original aspect ratio .
This means that vector and bitmap icons should be simple , without fine detail or thin strokes , and all icons should be square or nearly square whenever possible .
If the icon is a bitmap , Sinc / Lanczos scaling should be used to minimize jagginess .
If the bubble has no text , the icon should be horizontally centered within the window .
Otherwise , the icon should be horizontally and vertically centered within a 3 - em square that is flush with the leading side , with 1 em margin to the trailing side .
Icons representing alerts , warnings or errors should use an x or ?
symbol with smooth gradient ranging from light red ( # ff6363 ) at the top to dark red ( # cc0000 ) at the bottom .
Other than that , all icons and gauges should use one color theme : a smooth gradient ranging from light gray ( #ececec ) at the top to medium gray ( # 9b9b9b ) at the bottom .
Every icon should also use a black 2 px outline with 30 % opacity .
There should also be a 1px white highlight with 40 % opacity on the top and left edges to improve the definition .
Different opacity values of this scheme ( excluding the black outline ) are allowed , for example to depict an inactive / disabled state or different levels of intensity ( e.g. brightness ) .
All icons and gauges should use gently rounded corners with the recommended roundness of 0.1 em radius and the roundness should not exceed 0.25 em radius .
This set is subject to change .
Text layout
If there is text , it consists of a title and / or a body .
Both of these should use the standard application typeface , aligned to the leading side , and should wrap to multiple lines if necessary .
If a word is wider than the line , it should wrap following usual Pango rules for the current interface language .
Both title and body text should appear to the trailing side of the icon .
If there is no body text , the title text should be vertically centered with the center of the icon .
If there is body text , the title text should be top - aligned with the top of the icon , and the body text should begin immediately underneath .
This applies even if body text is added to a bubble that previously had only a title : the title text should move from its centered alignment to top alignment as the body text appears .
Title text
The title should be the standard application font size , of color # ffffff , and bold weight .
In the title text , any string of one or more consecutive whitespace characters ( U+0020 SPACE , U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION , U+000A LINE FEED ( LF ) , U+000C FORM FEED ( FF ) , or U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN ( CR ) ) , even if a mixture of those , should be treated as a single space .
Leading and trailing whitespace should not be presented .
If the title would take up longer than three lines , it should be truncated at just enough characters to fit an ellipsis character “ … ” at the end of the third line .
Body text
The body should be 0.9 × the standard application font size , of color #eaeaea , standard weight , and should not contain any extra formatting .
In the body text , any string of one or more consecutive whitespace characters that contains at least one newline ( U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN ( CR ) , U+000A LINE FEED ( LF ) , or U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN ( CR ) immediately followed by U+000A LINE FEED ( LF ) ) , even if a mixture of those , should be treated as a single newline .
Then for each line in the text , any string of one or more consecutive ( non-newline ) whitespace characters , even if a mixture of them , should be treated as a single space , and leading and trailing whitespace should not be presented .
Gauge
If a notification bubble has a gauge , the gauge should display the old value for 500 ms before switching to the new value for the remainder of the time , as a visual indication of what the change was .
Interaction
Whenever a pointer moves into a bubble , whatever is behind the bubble should instantly become no longer blurred , and the bubble itself should instead receive a 2 - pixel Gaussian blur and reduce to 40 % opacity .
( The bubble should not blur from the pointer being in the bubble area when it first appears , because you are unlikely to be aware of where the pointer is — it may not even be visible .
And once you become aware , it is simple to move out then in again . )
When the pointer leaves the bubble , the bubble should instantly return to its normal appearance .
Other than that hover effect , bubbles should not directly respond to input devices in any way .
Outside the bubble
If any windows are open , a bubble should appear on whichever display contains the largest fraction of the area of the focused window at the moment the bubble starts appearing .
If no windows are open , a bubble should appear on whichever display the pointer is on at the moment the bubble starts appearing .
( Except with MPX , a display has only one pointer .
A touch - only display has an invisible pointer , so whenever it is touched it becomes the display that the pointer is on . )
Each display should show up to one confirmation bubble , plus up to one notification bubble , at a time .
There should be a gconf key determining which of three positioning schemes are used .
In all three schemes , the right edge of any bubble should be 0.5 em from the trailing edge of the display .
A notification bubble should be positioned near the bottom right corner , such that if the bubble grows to its maximum height , it is 0.5 em from the bottom of the display ( or from the top of any panels at the bottom of the display ) .
A confirmation bubble should use a slot immediately above that notification bubble slot .
The bottom of a confirmation bubble should be 0.25 em above the vertical center of the display .
The top of a notification bubble should be 0.25 em below the vertical center of the display .
( So if a confirmation bubble and a notification bubble are visible simultaneously , there should 0.5 em gap between them . )
Notification bubbles should use the top right corner : the top of a notification bubble should be 0.5 em from the top of the display ( or from the bottom of any panels at the top of the display ) .
Confirmation bubbles should use the bottom right corner : the bottom of a confirmation bubble should be 0.5 em from the bottom of the display ( or from the top of any panels at the bottom of the display ) .
Bubble behavior
Animations and durations
Notification bubbles Confirmation bubbles Critical Non-critical
When it appears
After all other pending critical notifications , before all non-critical ones .
After all other pending notification bubbles .
Replaces any earlier confirmation bubble immediately .
How it appears Fades in over 200 ms if first in a series , or 300 ms if subsequent .
Fades in over 700 ms if first in a series , or 300 ms if subsequent .
Fades in over 100 ms .
Appears if screensaver inhibited yes no yes Standard duration 10000 ms + 250 ms / ( line of body text ) 5000 ms + 250 ms / ( line of body text ) 2000 ms Extended by input
If between 1000 and 3000 ms there are any modifier keypresses or ≥ 10 non-modifier keypresses or ≥ 1 click , extend by 2000 ms .
Very difficult to implement .
no Extended by confirmation bubble appearing Resets to previous duration , minus 1000 ms .
This has no effect because it waits to leave at the same time as the confirmation bubble anyway .
n/a
Visible merging with enough room to show all body text
Over 250 ms , bubble grows initially linearly but decelerates as it reaches its new size ; at the same time , if there was no body text previously , the title fades out ( because it is about to appear in a new position ) .
Then over another 250 ms ( regardless of how much text is involved ) , the new text fades in ; at the same time , the new icon ( if any ) cross - fades in .
n/a
Visible merging with overflow
Old text displays for bubble ’s normal duration .
Then over 250 ms ( regardless of how much text is involved ) , text that will no longer appear in its current position scrolls up , with oldest text scrolling off the top and new text scrolling onto the bottom ; at the same time , the new icon ( if any ) cross - fades in .
n/a
Extended by visible merging + 500 ms + 250 ms / ( line of body text ) n/a Visible replacement
Over 300 ms , the old contents fade out .
Then over another 300 ms , the new contents fade in .
Changes instantly .
Extended by visible replacement + 2000 ms + 250 ms /( line of body text ) Resets .
Maximum duration 15000 ms ( overriding all the above )
How it disappears
Over 300 ms , fades out .
If a bubble is replaced with one that has the same icon and the same title text , and the new body text is an extension of the old body text , this should not be presented as a normal replacement ; instead the bubble should be presented as if the old and new bubbles were being merged .
If a pointer is over the area where a bubble is about to appear , it should appear as normal , ignoring the pointer unless it leaves and then re-enters the area .
In all other cases where a pointer is over a bubble , however , the bubble ’s duration should pause until the pointer leaves .
For example , if a notification bubble has been fully visible for 2000 ms when a pointer enters , it should switch to its mouseover appearance until the pointer leaves , then switch back to its normal appearance and display for a further 3000 ms .
If the only bubble on a display is fading out when another bubble would appear below it , the newer bubble must instead wait until the older one has completed fading out .
Sound
If a notification bubble has a sound associated with it , that sound should be played starting from the moment the bubble has finished fading in .
Merging notifications
Notify OSD should merge two notifications into a single notification if all of the following are true :
they come from the same program
they have the same title , or lack of title
they have the same actions , or lack of actions
the first is not already open as a fallback alert box
the first has not already been displayed as a bubble for so long that merging the second into it would cause the newly - calculated duration to be greater than the maximum duration
both of them have indicated that they allow merging
the second notification is not specified as a replacement of any other notification .
When merging notifications , the icon and sound ( if any ) of the latter notification should be used .
The body text of the latter should be appended to the body text of the former , with a line break inserted between them if there was none already .
For example , if the notification in queue position 4 has title “ andrew_p ” and body text “ Hey Coral ” , while the notification in queue position 7 has the same icon and title “ andrew_p ” and body text “ Are you still in Oregon ? ” , then the body text of the notification at position 4 should be changed to
Hey Coral
Are you still in Oregon ?
and the notification at position 7 should be deleted from the queue .
If the earlier bubble is already being displayed and not yet in the process of fading out , the bubble contents should be changed as described above .
Overflow of long messages
If a bubble ’s body text — either initial , or after merging — would take up more than ten lines inside the bubble , the body text should be presented as :
the first line of text ; an ellipsis ( … ) on a line by itself ; the last eight lines of text .
The transition from the non-overflow presentation to the overflow presentation , i.e. the arrival of an eleventh line of text , should be :
the first line should stay where it is ;
the second line should cross -fade into the ellipsis that replaces it ;
the third line should scroll up into oblivion , with following lines ( including the new eleventh line ) following the third line upward .
Flood prevention
A notification should be discarded from the queue if there are more than 50 notifications ahead of it in the queue .
Furthermore , a notification should be discarded from the queue if , after any merging , there are more than ten notifications from the same program ( as identified by its D - Bus ID ) before it in the queue .
“ Do not disturb ” mode
Applications should be able to send a signal to gnome - session — in the same way that they can currently inhibit logout , account switching , suspending , or screensaver — to inhibit non-critical notifications .
< doc:item > < doc:term>16</doc:term > < doc:definition > Inhibit non-critical notifications .</doc:definition > </doc:item >
As a trial during Lucid , whenever an application inhibits notifications , Notify OSD should display a notification : “ Further notifications have been disabled . ”
Whenever non-critical notifications are being inhibited , they should be queued as normal , so that ( subject to flood prevention ) they can be displayed when the inhibition ends .
Fallback alert boxes
For cases where applications have expected the notification system to allow interactivity without checking whether it actually does , and cases where applications have expected the notification system to display a notification indefinitely , Notify OSD should show an alert box as a fallback .
The alert box should appear centered on whichever display the first pointer is on at the moment it is due to appear .
Because they require a response but should not block the queue , multiple alert boxes may be open at once .
An alert has custom text and buttons .
The title of the alert should be the name of the process that is invoking the notification .
The icon should always be the dialog - warning icon .
The text should be presented uniformly in the standard application font size .
The first button should be positioned in the bottom right corner of the alert .
Immediately to its leading side should be a “ Cancel ” button that has no action .
Any other buttons should be positioned from leading side to trailing side , starting at the bottom leading corner of the alert .
None of the buttons should be set as the default ( because the system ca n’t detect that any of them are safe as a default ) .
Activating any button should close the alert , and then perform the associated action if any .
Logging notifications
For debugging and anorak purposes , each notification ( but not each confirmation bubble ) should be logged in the file “ $ HOME/.cache/notify-osd.log ” ( bug 332950 ) .
The log should take this form :
[ timestamp , process - name ] title body body body [ timestamp , process - name , appended ] title body body body [ timestamp , process - name , replaced ] title body body body
The timestamp should be in the format defined by RFC 3339 .
The log should be cleared whenever you log out or log in .
( Note : logging to this file is enabled when the LOG environment variable is set to 1 . )
Critical and non-critical queues and do - not - disturb mode
Every notification , whether it is to be presented as a bubble or as a fallback alert box , should be treated as if it is in one of two queues : critical or non-critical .
All pending critical notifications should appear before any pending non-critical notification bubbles appear ; and within each queue , notifications should appear in chronological order .
( This means , for example , that a fallback alert box should not appear until earlier notification bubbles have finished displaying .
This prevents a later interactive notification from appearing inappropriately before an earlier non-interactive one from the same program . )
Whenever a program is inhibiting the screensaver , Notify OSD should be in do - not - disturb mode .
While in this mode :
All notifications should be logged as normal .
Critical notifications , and all confirmation bubbles , should appear as normal .
Any non-critical notification bubble that was already being displayed , at the moment Notify OSD entered do - not - disturb mode , should remain for its scheduled duration .
Normal processing of the non-critical notification queue should stop , so that no further notification bubbles appear .
Once it has been in the queue for 30 seconds , any non-critical notification that would be rendered as a fallback alert box should ( for compatibility ) appear as normal , except that it should open explicitly unfocused and in the background .
Once it has been in the queue for 30 seconds , any non-critical notification that would be rendered as a bubble should be discarded from the queue and never displayed .
When Notify OSD leaves do - not - disturb mode , normal processing of the non-critical notification queue should resume .
Treatment of the Desktop Notifications Specification 1.1
Notify OSD should function as an implementation of the Desktop Notifications Specification 1.1 , as follows .
org.freedesktop.Notifications.GetCapabilities
The system should return the capabilities { " body " , " body - markup " , " icon- static " , " x- canonical - append " , " x- canonical - truncation "} .
( For why it should return " body - markup " , see “ Sanitizing body text ” . )
org.freedesktop.Notifications .Notify
If actions is supplied and / or expire_timeout is set to “ 0 ” , the notification should be presented as a fallback alert box :
If body is not supplied , summary should be used as the text of the alert .
If body is supplied , the system should sanitize it , concatenate it with the summary with a blank line between them , and use the combination as the text of the alert .
The default action should be given the label “ OK ” , and used as the first button for the alert .
This action should be supplied regardless of whether the application requests it , because notification - daemon sends it even if it was not declared , and some applications rely on that behavior .
Any other actions should be supplied as buttons for the alert .
All hints , and all other parameters ( including replaces_id ) , should be ignored .
In all other cases , the notification should be presented as a bubble :
If the hint “ x- canonical - private - synchronous ” is supplied , it should be treated as a confirmation bubble ; otherwise , it should be treated as a notification bubble .
If replaces_id is supplied , and it matches a bubble that is currently visible , it should be presented as a replacement of that existing bubble .
If the matching bubble is in the queue and not yet visible , the new bubble should take the old bubble ’s place in the queue .
If app_icon is supplied , and it is a valid icon , the notification bubble should use that as its icon .
Otherwise , if the icon_data hint is set , the notification bubble should use that as its icon .
( The reference to “ image_data ” in the Desktop Notifications Specification is an error . )
If the hint “ x- canonical - private - icon - only ” is supplied , the bubble should use the icon-only layout .
Otherwise :
The system should assume summary to be raw plain text , and use it as the title text of the bubble .
If body is supplied , the system should sanitize it , and then use it as the body text of the bubble .
If the hint “ x- canonical - append ” is supplied with a string value “ allowed ” , and replaces_id is not specified , the bubble should be treated as if it allows merging .
If the hint “ sound - themed ” is supplied with a string value that is a valid sound name , that sound should be associated with that notification bubble .
If the hint “ urgency ” is supplied with a value of 2 ( and the hint “ x-canonical - private - synchronous ” is not supplied ) , the bubble should be in the critical queue .
Otherwise , it should be in the non-critical queue .
All other hints , and all other parameters ( including expire_timeout ) should be ignored .
Sanitizing body text
The Desktop Notification Specification states that “ Body text may contain markup .
The markup is XML - based , and consists of a small subset of HTML along with a few additional tags …
Notification servers that do not support these tags should filter them out . ”
Unfortunately , the specification does not state explicitly whether body text may contain markup if the server does not return the capability “ body - markup ” .
And even if that was not allowed , notification - daemon supports markup , so many programs use it without first checking whether the server supports it .
The specification also does not specify how clients should transmit < or > characters that are not intended to be interpreted as HTML tags .
And if this is supposed to be done using character references , the specification also does not specify whether character references should be recognized for all characters , or just for < , > , and & .
This leaves us in a situation similar to RSS 2.0 : “ Here ’s something that might be HTML .
Or maybe not .
I ca n’t tell you , and you ca n’t guess . ”
Meanwhile , notification - daemon uses Pango markup directly , which means it interprets not only the markup defined in the Desktop Notification Specification , but also the extra elements and attributes recognized by Pango .
Because it would be extremely difficult to find and fix all programs that use markup without checking ( much more difficult than finding and fixing those that use actions without checking ) , Notify OSD must instead accept markup and ignore it .
This in turn means that it must advertise that it accepts markup ( " body - markup " ) — even though this markup has no effect on the bubble text — so that clients can deduce that they need to escape non-markup < , > , and & characters .
To provide a reasonable amount of compatibility until the Desktop Notification Specification is revised to be more precise , Notify OSD should try to guess whether < > and & characters are being used as plain text or HTML , as follows :
If the text contains a < character that is immediately followed by a letter or by a / character , and a > character occurs later in the string , the sequence from that < character to the soonest - following > character inclusive should be treated as an HTML tag and removed .
Repeat for all such remaining sequences .
All other < and > characters should be assumed to be literal .
Then :
If the text contains a “ & ” character , and a “ ; ” character occurs later in the string , the sequence from that “ & ” character to the soonest - following “ ; ” character should be presented as follows : String Presented as & amp ; & & # 38 ; & & #x26 ; & & lt ; < & # 60 ; < & # x3 C ; < & # x3 c ; < & gt ; > & # 62 ; > & # x3E ; > & # x3e ; > & apos ; ' & quot ; " anything else unaltered Repeat for all such remaining sequences .
All other & characters should be assumed to be literal .
This Desktop - Notification - Specification - specific sanitizing should happen before the normal whitespace filtering for body text .
Applications should be highly encouraged to escape “ < ” , “ > ” , and “ & ” characters ( e.g. as “ < ” , “ gt ; ” , and “ & ” respectively ) in text they receive from external sources ( such as instant messages or song metadata ) .
org.freedesktop.Notifications.CloseNotification
The relevant notification should disappear immediately , without fading out .
org.freedesktop.Notifications.GetServerInformation
The system should return out_name = “ Notify OSD ” , out_vendor = “ Canonical Ltd ” , out_version = “ 1.0 ” , and out_spec_ver = “ 0.9 ” .
org.freedesktop.Notifications.NotificationClosed
Should be implemented as specified .
org.freedesktop.Notifications.ActionInvoked
This signal should never be emitted .
Treatment of the KNotification API
Notify OSD should function as an implementation of the KNotification class ( but not the previous KNotify class ) .
The API should let applications know whether the notification system allows actions .
Treatment of hotkeys
Volume changes
Now covered in the Sound specification .
Brightness and backlight changes
When you change the display ’s or keyboard backlight ’s brightness using keyboard hotkeys , the change in brightness should be shown in a confirmation bubble with a gauge .
To make clearer which key was pressed , if the bubble was not already open , the gauge should show the old value for half a second before switching to the new value .
If you press the reduce - brightness key when the volume is already at zero , or the increase - brightness key when the volume is already at maximum , the icon and gauge should flash .
Visually , the bubble should not contain any text .
But for accessibility purposes , the bubble should expose title text of the form “ Brightness : 60 percent ” or “ Backlight brightness : 20 percent ” , as appropriate .
Disc ejection
When you press the EJECT_KEY , a confirmation bubble should appear containing only the eject icon .
Implementation : Issue a notification using the “ x- canonical - private - icon - only ” and “ x-canonical - private - synchronous ” hints .
Visually , the bubble should not contain any text .
But for accessibility purposes , the bubble should expose the title text “ Eject ” .
Play , Pause , Stop , Previous , and Next
When you press the PLAY_KEY , PAUSE_KEY , STOP_KEY , PREVIOUS_KEY , or NEXT_KEY , a confirmation bubble should appear containing only the icon for that function .
Implementation : Issue a notification using the “ x- canonical - private - icon - only ” and “ x-canonical - private - synchronous ” hints .
Visually , the bubble should not contain any text .
But for accessibility purposes , the bubble should expose the title text “ Play ” , “ Pause ” , “ Stop ” , “ Previous ” , or “ Next ” as appropriate .
Treatment of hardware device detection
When a device is connected , a confirmation bubble should appear immediately , with a generic USB , Firewire , or miscellaneous ( e.g. eSATA ) device icon , title text “ Device connected ” , and no body text .
A further confirmation bubble should not appear when the device is fully identified .

Compatibility fixes accepted upstream
Ubuntu and upstream developers have made fixes to several programs to make their notifications compatible with Notify OSD and the Desktop Notifications Specification .
For designs of fixes that are now incorporated into the upstream projects , see PreviousCompatibility Fixes .
Compatibility fixes still to be maintained
Other compatibility fixes have not yet been implemented , or have been implemented in Ubuntu packages but not yet merged upstream .
These fixes are listed in this specification , alphabetically by package name , to assist in regression testing .
If you ’re the application developer or someone who can patch one of these programs , see NotificationDevelopmentGuidelines for guidelines and code samples .
Once a fix has been accepted upstream , please move its specification from this document to PreviousCompatibility Fixes .
amsn
When someone sends you an instant message while you are online , a notification bubble appears that , when clicked , displays the message .
The button should be made conditional on whether the notification server supports actions .
When someone sends you an instant message while you are offline , a notification bubble appears that , when clicked , opens the login page for your Hotmail in a Web browser .
What ’s the text ?
apport
When a system process crashes , an icon appears in the panel , and a “ Crash report detected ” bubble appears with the text “ An application has crashed on your system ( now or in the past ) .
Click on the notification icon to display details . ”
The icon and bubble should not appear ; instead an alert should appear unfocused .
Implementation : update - notifier src/crash.c
banshee
When a connection to Last. fm fails , a notification bubble appears with “ Account Settings ” and “ Join Last.fm ” buttons .
This should be converted to an error alert box with the same wording and buttons .
bluez - gnome
When from a Bluetooth device you try to connect to the computer , a “ Bluetooth Device ” bubble appears with the text “ Pairing request for device name ” and an “ Enter PIN code ” button that , when clicked , opens an authentication alert for entering the PIN .
Instead , the authentication alert should open unfocused directly , and request attention .
A bubble apparently appears when sending a file from a device to the computer , but this can not be reproduced currently .
bzr-gtk
When a merge or pull is complete , a notification bubble appears that never expires and contains an “ Inspect ” button that opens a visualizer and a “ Branch ” button that shows the branch in Nautilus .
Instead , the main Olive window should request attention when a merge or pull is complete , and the “ Inspect ” and “ Branch ” actions should be available from that main window .
debian - bts - applet
When a bug report you ’re interested in changes , a “ Bug # % d's %s changed ” notification bubble appears containing “ More info ” and “ Hide ” buttons , where the “ More info ” button opens the bug report in a Web browser .
Instead …
decibel - audio- player
When a new track starts playing , a notification bubble appears giving the song details , and containing a “ Skip track ” button .
The button should be made conditional on whether the notification server supports actions .
Launchpad # 328609
emesene
When a new message arrives , a notification bubble appears that , when clicked , reveals the message .
Instead , emesene should integrate with the messaging menu .
( Bug 345660 proposes instead making the action conditional on whether the notification server accepts actions . )
empathy
When you receive a message from someone :
The message should always appear in the MessagingMenu , if it is being used .
( The “ Use messaging indicators ” preference is neither understandable nor useful , and should be abolished . )
If the chat window for that person is not open , it should always open , unfocused and in the background .
( See for example the '' Ars Technica ' ' review of Ubuntu 9.10 . )
Depending on your preferences , a notification bubble should also appear containing the text of the message .
No notification bubble should be added or changed because someone is typing .
evolution
When the “ Mail Notification ” plug - in is turned on and new messages arrive , Evolution puts up a " New email " notification bubble which , when clicked , hides the notification area icon .
This should be replaced by the messaging menu .
Launchpad # 331571
firefox
Firefox uses custom notification boxes that do one thing when clicked .
We are working with Mozilla on ways to present these without using a custom notification system .
When all current downloads have completed , Firefox displays a “ Downloads Complete ” notification box containing an “ All files have finished downloading ” link that opens and focuses the Downloads window .
Our recommended replacement behavior is for the Downloads window to open unfocused if it is not open already , scroll to the bottom of its list ( if it is not scrolled to the bottom already ) , and request attention .
Alternatively , Firefox could have no special notification of completed downloads at all ( just as Safari and Opera do not , for example ) .
A last resort would be to continue showing the sliding XUL notification used in Firefox 3.0 .
When add - on updates are available , Firefox displays a notification box containing a link that opens the Add - ons window .
Instead , we recommend that the Add - ons window open in the background , with the new updates being advertised in a banner the same style as the existing “ 1 new add - on has been installed ” banner .
* An experimental plugin for integrating Firefox with libnotify can be downloaded from here https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9622
or as an Ubuntu Package from here http://packages.ubuntu.com/karmic/firefox-notify ( karmic )
gajim
When a new message arrives while gajim is in the background , a notification bubble appears that , when clicked , brings the relevant window to the front .
The action should be made conditional on whether the notification server supports actions .
Giver
When someone offers you a file , a notification bubble appears containing “ Accept ” and “ Decline ” buttons .
Instead , Giver should have a File Transfers window that morphs when necessary , as shown in the notification development guidelines ( bug 347081 ) .
gmail - notify
When a new mail is received , a notification square appears in the bottom - right corner informing about it .
If you click on it your inbox is shown in the web browser .
When the user clicks on the panel indicator , the same square appears informing whether the inbox is empty or there are new messages .
gmail - notify should instead be integrated with the messaging menu .
gnome - disk - utility
gnome - disk - utility should implement the hardware device detection bubbles as specified ( bug 345317 ) .
When the process of unmounting a volume is taking more than a few seconds ( because previously cached data is being written to it first ) , gnome - mount puts up a persistent notification warning you not to “ remove the media or disconnect the drive ” .
( What does gnome - disk - utility do currently ? )
Instead , gnome - disk - utility should open a progress window frontmost ( bug 332600 , bug 325315 ) :
The title and icon for the progress window should be the name and icon for the volume .
The other text should vary depending on whether the volume is to be ejected or disconnected ( as determined by whether hal regards it as “ removable ” or “ hotpluggable ” ) .
Removable volume Hotpluggable volume Primary text while unmounting ( standard application font ) Finishing up …
Finishing up …
Secondary text while unmounting ( Pango < small > )
To prevent data loss , wait until this has finished before ejecting .
To prevent data loss , wait until this has finished before disconnecting .
Primary text after unmounting ( standard application font )
It ’s now safe to eject “ Name Of Volume ” .
It ’s now safe to disconnect “ Name Of Volume ” .
The window should not change size when it switches to showing the post - unmount information .
Once the window has shown the post - unmount information for four seconds , it should close automatically .
gnome - power - manager
Gnome Power Manager puts up interactive notifications in many situations ( bug 329296 ) .
Five of these are unusual and important and should be acknowledged , so they should be presented as alert boxes instead :
“ Battery may be recalled ” , with text “ The battery in your computer may have been recalled by %s and you may be at risk .
For more information visit the %s battery recall website . ” , and buttons labelled “ Visit recall website ” and “ Do not show me this again " .
“ Battery may be broken ” , with text “ Your battery has a very low capacity ( %i % % ) , which means that it may be old or broken . ” and a button " Do not show me this again " .
( This will fix bug 155191 ( Battery Broken message cut off ) . )
“ UPS Discharging ” , with text " The AC power has been unplugged .
The system is now using backup power . " and a button " Do not show me this again " .
“ Sleep Problem ” , with text “ Your computer failed to hibernate .
Check the help file for common problems . ” or “ Your computer failed to suspend .
Check the help file for common problems . ” and containing a " Do not show me this again " button and a “ Visit quirk website ” button .
“ Power Critically Low ” , with text “ You have approximately X minutes of remaining battery life ( Y % ) .
Plug in your AC Adapter to avoid losing data . ” , or “ The battery is below the critical level and this computer will power - off when the battery becomes completely empty . ” .
Implementation : Tweak gpm-notify .c so that it uses the #else versions of the #ifdef HAVE_LIBNOTIFY functions .
The design of these alerts could be improved , but we should not spend time on this now , because the code will soon be replaced by Device Kit-power .
Once Device Kit - power is being used , the “ Power Critically Low ” alert should be reimplemented as a morphing alert box .
Two others should put up neither a notification bubble nor an alert , so their bubbles should be removed :
“ Sleep warning ” , “ Your laptop will not sleep if you shut the lid as a running program has prevented this .
Some laptops can overheat if they do not sleep when the lid is closed . ”
“ Battery Charged ” , “ Your laptop battery is now fully charged ” .
And one should be changed to be more useful ( bug 399492 ) :
“ Battery Discharging ” , “ The AC power has been unplugged .
The system is now using battery power . ” should be changed to “ Running on battery ” , “ 2 hours 15 minutes remaining ” , with the appropriate battery icon for the current charge level .
gnome - screensaver
The screensaver ’s “ Leave a Message ” function uses a persistent notification bubble to present the messages ( bug 333269 ) .
Instead , all messages left during a single session should be presented in a scrolling text view in a single “ While You Were Out ” dialog in the center of the screen , with an “ OK ” button that clears the message list and closes the dialog .
gnome - settings - daemon
Brightness and volume changes should be shown as confirmation bubbles instead of the existing overlays ( bug 333997 ) .
New in Gnome 2.26 , gnome - settings daemon warns about low disk space in a “ Low Disk Space ” critical notification bubble with text “ %d % % of the disk space on %s ' is in use ” ) .
If Disk Usage Analyzer ( baobab` ) is installed , the bubble contains an “ Analyze ” button that opens Disk Usage Analyzer .
Instead , this should be an alert box ( bug 337441 ) : ( This is a starting point for a smarter low disk space warning . )
When “ Accessibility features can be toggled with keyboard shortcuts ” is on , holding down the Shift key for 8 seconds uses a notification bubble to prompt to activate / deactivate Slow Keys , and pressing Shift five times consecutively uses a notification bubble to prompt to activate / deactivate Sticky Keys .
Instead these should open alert boxes ( bug 342567 ) , frontmost because they are in direct response to user input :
Take care that the secondary text varies between the activate and deactivate cases , as shown in these mockups .
The previous bubble for deactivating Sticky Keys began by saying “ You just pressed two keys at once , or pressed the Shift key five times in a row . ”
This sentence is dropped from the alert box design , because it is lame for the computer to feign ignorance about which of those two things happened .
Alternatively , the primary text should correctly begin with either the sentence “ You pressed two keys at once . ” , or the sentence “ You pressed the Shift key five times in a row . ” .
In all four alerts , the “ Settings … ” button should open and focus the “ Accessibility ” tab of the “ Keyboard Preferences ” window , and close the alert .
gnome - user - share
When you have received a file over a Bluetooth connection , a notification bubble appears , with “ Open File ” and “ Reveal File ” buttons .
Instead , an alert box should appear unconditionally , unfocused and in the background — using the icon of the actual file , and with “ Open ” and “ Reveal ” buttons next to the default “ OK ” button ( bug 337352 ) .
( A more sophisticated design , to better handle multiple incoming files , would be a “ Received Files ” window — listing all recently - received files , with options to open or reveal any of them at your leisure .
The window could request attention whenever a file transfer completes . )
gnoemoe
When you receive a message , a notification bubble appears that , when clicked , focuses the application .
This program appears to be unmaintained and unused , so probably can be ignored .
goobox
When a music track starts playing , a notification bubble appears containing “ Next ” and “ Stop ” buttons .
The button should be made conditional on whether the notification server supports actions .
Launchpad # 327714
gossip
When a contact comes online , a notification bubble appears containing a “ Chat ” button , though clicking anywhere else in the bubble does the same as clicking the button .
The actions should be made conditional on whether the notification server advertises that it accepts actions .
When someone adds you to their buddy list , a notification bubble appears that , when clicked , opens the subscription request dialog .
Instead , the subscription request dialog should open directly , unfocused and in the background .
When a new message arrives , a notification bubble appears containing a “ Show ” button , though clicking anywhere else in the bubble does the same as clicking the button .
The actions should be made conditional on whether the notification server advertises that it accepts actions .
# 328613
gshutdown
gshutdown produces a notification bubble warning you of impending shutdown , and containing a button “ Show Main Window ” .
Instead …
kerneloops
When there is a kernel oops , a notification bubble appears asking if you want to send the error to the Kernel Oops Web site , containing five buttons : “ Always ” , “ Yes ” , “ No ” , or “ Never ” , and “ Details ” .
Instead , this should be an alert box with four buttons , and an expandable section to show the error log ( bug 344377 ) .
Before After
When the error report is successfully submitted , a notification bubble appears saying that “ You can view your submitted oops here ” , where “ here ” is a link in notification servers that accept hyperlinks ( bug 347984 ) .
Instead , when “ Always ” or “ Yes ” is clicked in the initial alert , it should not disappear ; rather it should smoothly resize vertically and become a progress window with an indeterminate progress bar .
When the process is complete , the progress window should in turn morph into an alert notifying you that the report is complete and giving you the opportunity to view the report .
Before After
Even better would be for the progress window to use a determinate progress bar rather than an indeterminate one , and to include a “ Cancel ” button .
kopete
When a contact wants to add you to his contact list , a bubble application with the actions “ Add ” , “ Authorize ” , “ Block ” , and “ Info ... ” .
Instead , if the notification system does not allow actions , this should be shown as a dialog .
On connection errors , a bubble appears .
This bubble may contain a “ More Information ... ” button which shows a message box with a more detailed error message .
Instead , a placard should appear inside the main Kopete window giving a summary of the error , with a “ Details ” button to show the message box .
If the main Kopete window is not open at the time , a notification with no actions should also be sent .
When a chat message arrives , a bubble appears with “ View ” and “ Ignore ” buttons .
The buttons should be made conditional on whether the notification system allows actions , and Kopete should be integrated with the MessagingMenu .
kpackagekit
When a distribution upgrade is detected , a bubble appears with a “ Start upgrade now ” button .
Instead , a placard — with the text “ A new version of Kubuntu is available ” , and an “ Upgrade ” button — should appear near the top of the updates window whenever it is open for any other reason ( as it does in Update Manager ) .
When updates are available , a bubble appears with the actions “ Review and update ” , “ Not now ” , and “ Do not ask again ” .
Instead , the window that lists the updates should periodically open automatically , like Update Manager does ( see SoftwareUpdateHandling ) , with an option in KPackage Kit ’s “ Settings ” pane for controlling how often you are prompted about updates .
In case of error , a bubble appears with the actions “ Details ” and “ Ignore ” , where “ Details ” opens an error alert .
Instead , the error alert should open directly .
If an update requires restarting the system , a bubble appears with actions “ Restart ” and “ Not now ” .
Instead , this should be shown as a standard alert box with “ Restart ” and “ Not Now ” buttons .
If an update requires restarting the session , a bubble appears with actions “ Logout ” and “ Not now ” .
Instead , this should be shown as a standard alert box with “ Log Out ” and “ Not Now ” buttons .
kwalletmanager
When an application is in the background and asks to open the wallet because it requests a password , kwallet shows a bubble to tell the user about this .
The bubble contains two buttons : “ Switch to < application > ” and “ Ignore ” .
Instead , the application ’s window should just use the standard mechanism for requesting attention .
liferea
Liferea has a “ Show a popup window with new headlines . ” option that is on by default .
As a result , when updating feeds , Liferea puts up a flood of notification bubbles with “ Open Feed ” , “ Mark all as read ” , and “ Show details ” buttons .
These are annoying and unusable unless you are subscribed to very few feeds , but the presence of the option makes it difficult to remove .
Instead , the buttons should be made conditional on whether the notification server supports actions .
Launchpad # 328606
network - manager
Because Network Manager is a high - profile user of notification bubbles , it should be adjusted not just for compatibility with Notify OSD , but also to make its bubbles more elegant regardless of which notification system is in use .
When you are not connected but wireless networks are available , a “ Wireless Networks Available ” bubble appears , with text “ Click on this icon to connect to a wireless network ” and a " Do n't show this message again " button .
This bubble should be removed .
Instead , the network manager icon should flash with a glow effect five times over five seconds .
This clashes with the proposed appearance for when wireless is actually connecting .
When the computer is connecting to a wireless network , the wireless Network Manager icon should appear in offline state but with its base blinking on and off .
No notification bubble should appear .
Once you are connected to a wireless network , a notification bubble should appear with the connected wireless icon , title the name of the wireless network , and body “ Connection established ” .
( Launchpad # 330526 )
When connection to a wireless network fails for a reason other than incorrect authentication , a notification bubble should appear with disconnected icon , title the name of the wireless network , and body “ Connection failed ” .
When the computer is disconnected from a wireless network via software , a notification bubble should appear with disconnected icon , title the name of the wireless network , and body “ Disconnected ” .
If this disconnection leaves you with no active network connections , the body text should end with “ - you are now offline ” , and the bubble should use an urgency of 2 so as to be treated as critical .
( This is so that , for example , you will be notified of losing connection promptly while playing an online game ) .
When the computer is disconnected from a wireless network via hardware switch , a notification bubble should appear with wireless - disabled icon , title “ Wi - fi switched off ” , and no body .
When the computer is connecting to a wired network , the wired Network Manager icon should appear in offline state but with its base blinking on and off .
No notification bubble should appear .
Once you are connected to a wired network , a notification bubble should appear with the connected wired icon , title “ Wired network ” , and body “ Connection established ” .
( Launchpad # 330571 )
When connection to a wired network fails , a notification bubble should appear with disconnected icon , title “ Wired network ” , and body “ Connection failed ” .
When the computer is disconnected from a wired network via software , a notification bubble should appear with disconnected icon , title “ Wired network ” , and body “ Disconnected ” .
If this disconnection leaves you with no active network connections , the body text should end with “ - you are now offline ” , and the bubble should use an urgency of 2 so as to be treated as critical .
When a mobile broadband card is inserted or a 3G phone is connected in network mode , a “ New Mobile Broadband Device Detected ” bubble appears with text “ Model Name : - Click here to configure the device … ” and a “ Configure ” button .
Clicking the button or anywhere else in the bubble , opens a setup assistant .
Instead , the setup assistant should open unfocused directly ( bug 327427 ) .
When mobile broadband configuration is complete , a “ New Configuration Created ” bubble appears with text “ You can activate the connection by clicking this icon .
Use connection editor to add new and to change settings if necessary ” [ sic ] .
This bubble has no actions , but has the problem that it refers to “ this icon ” .
Instead , “ Connect immediately when setup is complete ” should be a checkbox horizontally centered at the bottom of the “ Summary ” page of the setup assistant .
When the computer is connecting to a mobile broadband network , the mobile broadband NetworkManager icon should appear in connecting state .
No notification bubble should appear .
Once you are connected to a mobile broadband network , a notification bubble should appear with the relevant network type icon , title the name of the mobile network , and body “ Connection established ” .
( Launchpad # 330608 )
When connection to a mobile broadband network fails , a notification bubble should appear with disconnected icon , title the name of the mobile broadband network , and body “ Connection failed ” .
When the computer is disconnected from a mobile broadband network via software , a notification bubble should appear with disconnected icon , title the name of the mobile broadband network , and body “ Disconnected ” .
If this disconnection leaves you with no active network connections , the body text should end with “ - you are now offline ” , and the bubble should use an urgency of 2 so as to be treated as critical .

pidgin
When a buddy signs on , or a message is received , the pidgin- libnotify plug - in shows a notification bubble containing a “ Show ” button , which in both cases opens the chat window for that person .
Both of these buttons should be made conditional on whether the notification server advertises that it accepts actions .
Implementation : an if block around the line notify_notification_add_action ( notification , " show " , _ ( " Show " ) , action_cb , NULL , NULL ) ;
In addition , Pidgin should be integrated with the messaging menu .
powerdevil
When powerdevil is about to suspend or shut down the machine because battery level is critical , it shows a bubble to notify the user .
The bubble contains a “ Cancel ” button to prevent powerdevil from continuing .
As with gnome - power - manager , this should be shown as a dialog instead .
quassel
When an highlighted message arrives , a notification bubble appears with a “ View ” button that brings the application to front and switch to the correct tab .
The “ View ” button should be made conditional on whether the notification system allows actions , chat windows containing new messages should request attention in the standard way , and Quassel should be integrated with the MessagingMenu .
software - sources
The “ Updates ” settings in Software Sources should be modified to reflect the automatic - opening behavior .

system-config - printer
When a printer is added successfully using a matching printer driver , a “ Printer added ” notification bubble appears containing the text “ `%s ' is ready for printing . ” and a “ Configure ” button .
Instead , the Properties window for that printer should open unfocused directly .
When a printer is added successfully using a non-matching printer driver , a “ Printer added ” notification bubble appears containing the text “ %s ' has been added , using the %s ' driver . ” and a “ Find driver ” button .
( system - config - printer 1.1 will also include a “ Print test page ” button . )
Instead , the Properties window for that printer should open unfocused .
When you try to view jobs on a printer that requires authentication , an “ Authentication required ” notification bubble appears containing the text “ Job requires authentication to proceed ” and an “ Authenticate ” button that brings up an alert box saying “ Authentication required for printing document ` %s ' ( job % d ) ” .
The notification bubble should be abolished , and the alert box should be invoked directly instead .
When a print job gets stuck for some reason ( for example , when a printer is out of paper ) , a notification bubble appears containing text “ There was a problem processing the document ” or similar , containing no buttons but staying open until it is clicked .
This should be converted to an error alert box with an “ OK ” button ( bug 343904 ) .

Mail Notification
When new mail arrives , Mail Notification notifies you in a variety of ways , some of which are not relevant to or appropriate for Notify OSD ( bug 332767 ) :
It has a setting for whether “ message popups ” should be “ Attached to the status icon ” or “ In the popup stack ” .
Notify OSD treats these identically , so when Notify OSD is being used , these settings should not be visible .
( Currently , the only way to detect whether positioning is available is to use GetServerInformation to specifically include “ notification - daemon ” or exclude “ Notify OSD ” . )
It has a setting for whether “ Expiration ” should happen “ Desktop default ” , “ Never ” , or “ After : ” a specified time .
With Notify OSD , “ Desktop default ” and all values of “ After : ” are treated identically , and “ Never ” produces an annoying alert box .
Therefore , when Notify OSD is being used , Mail Notification notifications should not specify a duration at all , and none of these settings should be visible .

Selling eggs and milk is n't the most profitable venture in the world , so supermarkets employ crafty tactics to ensure you buy pricier goods to pad their bottom lines .
Avoid overpaying with these simple tips .

Everything in the supermarket has been carefully placed , lit , and displayed to maximize profits .
What can you do to ensure you 're not the one paying the premium that A/C that much lower ?
Susan Koeppen of CBS ' The Early Show interviewed Consumer Reports ' Tod Marks to get the lowdown on navigating supermarkets to get what you want without paying extra .
What are some of the simple things you can do ?
Avoid the middle of the shelf :
" Prime selling space is right in the center , eye - level if you will , " Marks says .
In fact , companies sometimes pay thousands of dollars to have their products placed on the center shelf .
And , Koeppen continues , those items tend to be more expensive than the ones found high or low .
" The lower level and the high - on - top level , they 're kind of the low - rent districts , " Marks notes .
" You put commodities there — things that do n't bring in a lot of profits that people are going to buy , no matter what . "
Advertisement
You 'll notice this effect even when you 're staring at a shelf that is essentially packed with identical items .
Next time you 're near some staples like sugar or flour , look at the arrangement of the shelf .
A common arrangement is bargain brands on the floor , premium brands in the middle , and rest of the brands at the top .
Most people wo n't get all the way down to the floor to grab the sugar , some might reach up , but almost everyone just grabs what is right in front of them .
While there 's little conceivable difference between the items in question , you 'll end up paying a premium just for not bending or raising your arms .
Another budget breaker ?
Buying things that have been cut , shredded , diced , etc. for you ahead of time .
You pay an enormous premium for a minor convenience :
" Prices vary all the time " Marks pointed out , " but it 's not a stretch to say that you can pay anywhere from 300 percent to 600 percent or more for the convenience of pre-cut , pre-shredded or pre-anything produce . "
Koeppen noticed that a three pound bag of red apples was just a dollar a pound ; hand - picking your own from a bin made them $ 1.50 a pound ; but if you buy the apples already cut up , they 're a whopping $ 5 a pound .

How Supermarkets Lure You to Buy More [ CBS News ]
By Rajini Vaidyanathan
BBC News , Washington
It looks like something out of a James Bond film .
But the presidential seal on the side marks this hulking limo out as something not even the superspy will be able to get his hands on .
These are the first pictures of the new armoured limousine which will be used to ferry Barack Obama around .
Nicknamed " The Beast " , the Cadillac will make its debut on 20 January , as part of the inaugural parade .
It is traditional to show presidential cars off for the first time in this way .
' State of the art '
The Secret Service said the 2009 limo would provide it with a " valuable asset " in providing its occupant with the highest level of protection .
As expected , they are not giving too much away about the car , but Nicholas Trotta , their Assistant Director for the Office of Protective Operations is quoted in their news release : " Although many of the vehicle 's security enhancements cannot be discussed , it is safe to say that this car 's security and coded communications systems make it the most technologically advanced protection vehicle in the world . "
Observers say the car is likely to include bullet proof glass , an armoured body , a separate oxygen supply , and a completely sealed interior to protect against a chemical attack .
One of the specifications is that we do n't talk about the specifications
David Caldwell
General Motors
Some joke the car is so tough it could withstand a rocket - propelled grenade .
Its tyres are said to work flat , so the vehicle will keep going even if shot at .
While the car 's interior is a closely guarded secret , there is no doubt " The Beast " has been kitted out with the best and most up - to - date equipment .
David Caldwell , a spokesman for General Motors which makes Cadillac , told the BBC that the car is made to specifications that the company is given by the federal government .
" One of the specifications is that we do n't talk about the specifications , " he said .
But Mr Caldwell did reveal that the car has been made in keeping with the design of a contemporary Cadillac , and would include a hand - crafted interior .
When asked if it included such extras as an iPod dock , he said he could not comment specifically , but added that the limo would have " state of the art electronics " .

Last month , a very believable rumor started flying around in regard to Office 2010 shipping in 32 - bit and 64 - bit versions .
Check out ZDNet and Within Windows to see how the conclusion was drawn .
Everything pointed to Microsoft finally offering a 64 - bit flavor of its
Office suite , previous versions of which have only shipped in 32 - bit or 16 - bit flavors .
In an e-mail exchange with Ars today , a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed that Office 2010 will be available in both flavors : " Yes , Office will have two separate 32 - bit and 64 - bit versions .
Office 2010 will be the first to do this . "
That 's right , 64 - bit versions of Windows will no longer have to emulate a 32 - bit environment in order to run Office 2010 , provided that the user has the 64 - bit version installed .
With 64 - bit OS usage rapidly growing ( thanks to Vista , if you 're asking Microsoft ) , it 's good to see that the next version of Office , expected to arrive sometime next year , will come in both versions .
This should significantly help 64 - bit adoption , not only because Office is one of the most - used products , but because other vendors ( think Adobe or Sun ) are likely to follow in Microsoft 's footsteps when it comes to offering the next version of their products .
For those wondering , Office 4.3 was the last 16 - bit version , and Office 95 was the first 32 - bit version ( to match Windows 95 ) .
Screenshots of the alpha version of Office 2010 leaked in January .
Before Office 2010 arrives , though , Microsoft will ship Service Pack 2 for Office 2007 this month .
The company is opening up a bit more in regards to the next wave of its Office - related products , so keep an eye out on more news in the next few days .
Update
It looks like Microsoft is n't just talking more about Office 2010 , but Office 2007 as well .
SP2 now has a more specific date , thanks to the Microsoft Update Product Team Blog : April 28 .
That 's exactly two weeks from now , so try to sit tight !
This is the second installment in a three - part series .
Part 1 outlines the discussions that surround the evolution of the Linux kernel .
Part 2 takes a look at the current state of opinions on the standardization process .
When Microsoft won its bid to make Office Open XML an international standard last year , it was a pivotal moment for many in the FOSS community and beyond .
The process had been a highly contentious one , with protests from nations and corporations around the globe , and the International Organization for Standardization ’s ( ISO ’s ) final decision was met with considerable shock , disbelief and even outrage on the part of some .
Cynicism on the topic persists to this day , and debates can still be heard on the question of whether the standardization process is fundamentally broken .
At the heart of it all lies one central question :
Have standards become nothing more than a way to achieve vendor lock - in , or does openness still stand a fighting chance ?
‘ That All Looked Nasty ’
“ I stay away from standards bodies , ” Linus Torvalds , creator of the Linux kernel , told LinuxInsider .
“ That seems to be a whole rat ’s nest of backstabbing and politics , and I really do n’t want to have anything to do with it . ”
As for the OOXML case , “ anybody involved with that must have been crazy , ” he added .
“ That all just looked nasty . ”
Such standards are not even the ones that end up being most important , Torvalds asserted .
‘ Life Just Is n’t Long Enough ’
“ I ’m personally of the fairly strong opinion that the standards that tend to really matter are the so - called de facto standards which may have been ratified , but were done so after the fact , rather than up front , ” Torvalds explained .
“ The original POSIX.1 standard comes to mind — it turned out to be a pretty good and successful one , but largely because it mostly codified existing practice , rather than try to make up a new one . ”
Regarding the intersection between openness and standards , “ openness in itself ends up fostering standards , rather than necessarily the other way around , ” he said .
Torvalds does n’t spend too much time worrying about the question , however : “ My job is to do the best dang technology I can — or rather , to smooth the way so that others can , ” he explained .
“ I simply cannot be bothered to worry about standards bodies and vendor politics , etc .
Life just is n’t long enough . ”
True Standards vs. ‘ Marauding ’ Impostors
A true standard is “ open , not subject to heavy - handed litigation , widely used — voluntarily , easy to use and adaptable , ” Elbert Hannah , coauthor of the O’Reilly book , Learning the vi and Vim Editors , told LinuxInsider .
Current examples — at least in practice , if not strictly speaking — include MP3 , TCP / IP , vi/vim for editing , and POSIX , he agreed .
On the other hand , some examples of “ non-standards marauding as standards ” include Word , Windows , DOS , Intel chips and generic HD DVD , Hannah asserted .
“ The above are examples of things everyone uses , but were not widely adopted on merit but instead by leverage of powerful marketing presence , ” he explained .
“ They are not necessarily good or bad — they just never got to be voted on . ”
‘ This Does Not a Standard Make ’
It ’s not required that standards be free of owners , “ but it is absolute that if someone owns a standard they do n’t have absolute power and control — i.e. , they ca n’t dictate how the universe uses the standard , ” he stressed .
“ DARPA has been good with this ; others have n’t . ”
Today , standards “ seem to be more about locking in vendors with customers , Microsoft ’s OOXML debacle being a good example , ” Hannah asserted .
“ Microsoft claimed interest in an open and unified standard for documents , but under the covers , their idea of a standard skews heavily towards their software and platform .
“ This does not a standard make , ” he said .
“ I like the original model : Find a need , solve it , and let it be widely adopted , ” Hannah concluded .
“ It ’s important that for this to be ‘ real , ’ it has to be without undue influence from any interested third party .
Unfortunately , today powerful vendors push suspect ‘ standards ’ to the detriment of open and friendly technology . ”
‘ Codifying Corruption ’
Indeed , while “ the wonderful thing about standards is that there are so many of them , the problem with standards is that they can be mandated , ” Martin Espinoza , a blogger on Slashdot , told LinuxInsider .
It ’s important to remember , however , that “ Office documents were the de facto standard before there actually was one , ” Espinoza pointed out .
“ What the ISO is doing is codifying corruption .
By and large , the citizenry does not care about very large lies .
Comparatively small lies like this one are uninteresting . ”
In any case , Microsoft may have won the battle , but it lost the war , Montreal consultant and Slashdot blogger Gerhard Mack told LinuxInsider .
“ I ’m sure that they thought they would have a new standard that they were light - years ahead of the competition in supporting , ” Mack explained .
“ The reality is that did n’t happen . ”
‘ Not Since the Inquisition ’
Instead , “ OOXML got changed during the standards process so now there are no known products on the market that support it ” — including Microsoft ’s own Office 2008 , he noted .
This , of course , “ is on top of all the bad will they generated by trying to stack committees in their favor and attacking dissenting voices with a fervor not seen since the inquisition , ” he added .
For the moment , at least , “ the standards process hinders openness , ” Mack asserted .
“ Unfortunately , standards have become a tactical weapon that corporations use to their advantage .
We saw the results of that thinking with the OOXML push by Microsoft and when Rambus co-opted a standards process so that the standards required use of their patents . ”
‘ They Might Find Themselves Irrelevant ’
Looking ahead , standards organizations “ need to sit down and admit there is a problem , and then decide if they want to help or hinder industry progress , ” Mack said .
“ I ’m hoping the ISO recovers from this , ” he added .
“ They have been publicly humiliated by the debacle but refuse to admit anything went wrong .
Monty Python ’s ‘ Black Knight ’ imitation would actually be amusing if the stakes were n’t so high . ”
The group must not only “ rethink their fast - track process , ” but also “ they need to create a standard for how member countries select representatives , ” he concluded .
Otherwise , “ they may very well find themselves rendered irrelevant and pushed aside by people who need standards to actually foster interoperability . ”
FOSS Debates , Part 1 : Kernel Truths
FOSS Debates , Part 3 : Mission Control
A number of us have been saying for a while now that the Republicans ’ extremist , anti-American rhetoric was going to push someone to violence .
And it almost just did .
From WIRED :
Daniel Knight Hayden , 52 , was arrested by FBI agents who identified him as the Twitter user CitizenQuasar .
In a series of tweets beginning April 11 , CitizenQuasar vowed to start a “ war ” against the government on the steps of the Oklahoma City Capitol building , the site of that city ’s version of the national “ Tea Party ” protests promoted by the conservative - leaning Fox News .
“ START THE KILLING NOW !
I am willing to be the FIRST DEATH ! , ” read a tweet at 8:01 PM that day .
“ After I am killed on the Capitol Steps , like a REAL man , the rest of you will REMEMBER ME !!! , ” he added five minutes later .
Then : “ Send the cops around .
I will cut their heads off the heads and throw the[m ] on the State Capitol steps . ”
Hayden ’s MySpace page is a breathtaking gallery of right wing memes about the “ New World Order , ” gun control as Nazi fascism , and Barack Obama ’s covert use of television hypnosis , among many others .
AIG is just one piece of the derivatives mess .
Nonetheless AIG alone is so complex no one can figure it out .
In response , the Fed Calls Emergency Consultants To Untangle AIG .
“ I do n’t think the Fed has seen anything like this , ” former New York Fed general counsel and AIG executive Ernest Patrikis said in an interview .
“ AIG just got so complex in terms of private corporate matters that you just need that outside expertise . ”
Patrikis is now with the law firm of White & Case in New York .
In addition to hiring consultants , the Fed and the Treasury have retained Wall Street firms to help manage more than $ 2 trillion in bailout and emergency - loan programs .
Pacific Investment Management Co. runs a $ 259 billion program to backstop the commercial - paper market .
BlackRock Inc. , Goldman Sachs Asset Management , Pimco and Wellington Management Co. are managing the Fed ’s purchases of up to $ 500 billion of mortgage - backed securities .
JPMorgan Chase & Co. oversees a separate program under which the Fed may lend up to $ 540 billion to support money market mutual funds .
Last month , the House passed conditions for releasing the remaining $ 350 billion of financial - rescue funds , including a requirement that the Fed give details of the contracts and selection process for the mortgage - backed securities purchase program ’s managers .
The Senate is n’t planning to take up the legislation .
BlackRock is also managing and selling assets acquired in the Fed ’s $ 29 billion rescue of Bear Stearns Cos. , as well as securities called collateralized debt obligations the central bank purchased in the bailout of AIG , the largest U.S. insurer by assets .
Staff Overwhelmed
Such contracts show how the Fed ’s in - house staff has been overwhelmed by new responsibilities that the central bank has taken on in handling the crisis .
“ Once the government starts getting into the business of restructuring companies , there are competency deficits , ” said Phillip Phan , professor of management at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School in Baltimore .
“ It ’s inevitable they ’ll go back to Wall Street for advice . ”
Still , he said , “ the man in the street would say , ‘ We ’re paying to fix somebody else ’s mistake by paying the very people who are part of the system that produced the mistake . ’ ”
Babcock Shareholders Wiped Out
Babcock & Brown Ltd. will be forced by creditors to sell all its assets to repay debt , wiping out shareholders after its strategy of buying ports and property on credit imploded as the global financial crisis deepened .
Chief Executive Officer Michael Larkin will lead the sale process and hand the proceeds to banks over the next two to three years , Sydney - based Babcock said in a statement today .
The listed company , which had a peak market value of $ 7.8 billion , may be placed in administration and removed from the exchange , it said .
“ There was too much greed and arrogance and not enough transparency , ” said Tim Morris , an analyst at Sydney - based investment advisory Wise - Owl.com , the only researcher to rate Babcock ’s shares a “ sell ” at the start of 2008 .
“ The core of the problem was when they started repackaging assets and the only people making money was themselves .
When you start burning people , it ’s only a matter of time before the fire catches up with you . ”
Babcock , an owner of property , ports and power stations around the world , becomes the biggest Australian casualty of the global credit crisis , topping a list that includes Allco Finance Group Ltd. and Centro Properties Group .
Like Centro , Babcock averted liquidation because falling asset prices and scarce buyers makes this an unattractive option for creditors .
Babcock ’s holdings “ across all asset classes ” will be sold , with all proceeds over the amount needed to continue operating the business used to reduce debt , the company said .
Creditors have agreed to a restructure of existing debt facilities , with all interest payments and approximately A$ 2.12 billion of principal repayments to be on a “ Pay If You Can ” basis .
Babcock shares , down 99 percent in 2008 , have been suspended since Jan. 7 at the company ’s request and last traded at 32.5 cents .
The shares peaked at A$ 34.78 in June 2007 , when the company had a market value of about A $ 12 billion .
There will be “ no value ” for equity holders and “ negligible or no value ” for note holders after its survival plan , Babcock said in a statement on Jan. 23 .
Geithner ’s Bank Rescue May Emphasize Guarantees Over ‘ Bad Bank ’
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ’s strategy to aid the nation ’s banks will likely emphasize guarantees of toxic assets over proposals to create a so - called aggregator bank that would remove them from balance sheets , according to people familiar with the plan .
The government guarantees , which might be modeled on those already given to Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. , may be coupled with the purchase of preferred shares in the banks that would be later convertible into common stock , some of the people said .
The aggregator bank or ‘ bad bank , ’ has lost favor , in part because the potential costs involved , they added .
“ Our agenda is to begin to shape the architecture of a financial recovery plan that ’ll help get credit flowing again , ” Geithner said before a meeting yesterday with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and other members of the President ’s Working Group on Financial Markets .
Geithner will announce the plan on Feb. 9
The Obama administration has its work cut out for it .
U.S. banks have already racked up $ 745 billion in credit losses and have warned of more to come .
Shares of Bank of America , the country ’s largest bank , touched a 24 - year low yesterday amid concern it would be taken over by the government .
The stock recovered to end the day 3 percent higher at $ 4.84 .
Another advocate of dramatic action is Harvard University economist Jeremy Stein , tapped to join the White House ’s National Economic Council under director Lawrence Summers .
Stein , in a September op - ed piece in the New York Times , advocated that the government act as a “ deep - pocketed private investor that sees a bargain buying opportunity -- Warren Buffett on steroids ” to snap up the toxic assets .
He ’s also called for the government to conduct tough audits of the banks and to force those who are found insolvent to close or merge .
PITTSBURGH 
The man charged with killing three police officers here on Saturday was a contributor to racist Web sites , writing about his hatred of race - mixing , the economic collapse , Zionist conspiracies and his fondness for his “ AK ” rifle .
The police said the three officers were killed , and a fourth wounded , after they responded to a domestic disturbance call early Saturday at the home of Richard A. Poplawski , 22 .
The police said Mr. Poplawski shot the officers with his AK - 47 rifle .
He sometimes wrote about what he saw as a Zionist conspiracy , as in a March 13 post : “ One can read the list of significant persons in government and in major corporations and see who is pulling the strings .
One can observe the policies and final products and should walk away with little doubt there is Zionist occupation and  after some further research & critical thinking  will discover their insidious intentions . ”
After the Pittsburgh Steelers won the Super Bowl , Mr. Poplawski dismissed football as nothing but “ negroball . ”
Then , instead of celebrating the victory , he went out and did reconnaissance on how the police tried to control the crowds and posted his findings .

Microsoft has kicked off the latest installment of its Windows Brand Campaign .
It 's called Laptop Hunters , but there is more to this chapter than just consumers looking for a new laptop .
The campaign shows that Ballmer 's statement last week was more than just " Monkey Boy running his mouth again " and was actually foreshadowing what was to come .
Since laptop sales have taken off , and the economy has done the opposite , Microsoft wants everyone to know that PCs , and not Macs , are what consumers want in these troubled times .
The first commercial , which is embedded below , features Lauren , who wants to buy a 17 " laptop for under $ 1,000 .
The jab at Apple comes right after Lauren exits the Apple Store : " I would have to double my budget , which is just not feasible .
I 'm just not cool enough to be a Mac person . "
The ad ends with Lauren telling us " I 'm a PC , and I got just what I wanted . "
According to the Windows Team Blog , " the Laptop Hunters are not told they are taking part in an ad campaign by Microsoft .
Instead , they think they are participating in market research .
Each participant set their own budget for a laptop to meet their own unique needs .
We then provide the participant with cash and sent them out to find and purchase a laptop — all in a single day .
We followed them with a camera crew throughout the course of their hunt and recorded their experiences .
Everything is completely unscripted . "
Of course , that does n't mean it 's not edited .
With the new campaign comes a new website on Microsoft.com .
The site helps consumers pick a new Windows PC based on five categories :
Gamer : Something just short of a supercomputer .
Everything sharp , shiny and overclocked .
Jetsetter : Sleek , light and , above all , portable .
Everything you need , to go .
Socialite : Cosmopolitan , ready to take on the world and share it with the World Wide Web .
Designer : Made for media - pictures , audio , video , etc .
It 's ready to help you make it and watch it .
Parent : A little something for everyone .
Built to create and share memories .
I 'm happy Microsoft is finally hitting back against Apple , but on the other hand , I 'm not sure this is the best way to do it .
The timing is very good , but what it really comes down to whether consumers will be able to relate to Lauren and whomever else we are introduced to in the next few ads .
Here 's how the blogosphere has reacted to the new campaign :
ZDNet : " The sarcasm is amusing , but I already forsee a new " I'm a Mac " commercial spoofs on this one .
And unlike many Microsoft marketing managers , I do n't cotton to the idea that any time you can get someone talking about your products or ads , even if it is negatively , is still good news . "
Microsoft Pri0 : " The trip to the Apple store and " Lauren 's " explanation afterward is one of the more aggressive digs Microsoft has made at Apple in a commercial .
The implication , of course , is that Apple 's products are more expensive — and that wo n't fly in this economy . "
What are your thoughts on Microsoft 's bold move ?
Welcome to the third installment of stupid coding tricks !
As we learned from the T - SQL Mandelbrot and A Batch of Pi , stupid coding tricks are n't really about obfuscation per se ... just , well , stupid awesomeness .
Kinda like a quine , except even more useless .
Got a trick of your own ?
I 'd love to see it , so send it on in .
If you were to use The Daily WTF as a guide , your impression of XSL Transformations ( XSLT ) would probably be fairly low .
I mean , seeing article after article after article might have given the impression that XSLT is often not the right tool for the job ... or , perhaps , maybe not even a right tool .
Period .
But regardless of your opinions on XSLT , I 'm certain you 'll have a new appreciation after seeing what magic it can work on a boring old piece of XML .
Even if its variables are write - once and cannot vary .
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?>

Open it in a browser ( go ahead , try it yourself ) , and voilà !
You get XSLT Mandelbrot .
Hmmmmmmm , the special move does n't work , and the same thing works on all of them , you just stand there and press the space bar and punch them until they 're dead .
I just beat Xenu in a double flawless victory doing that .
So it hardly gets harder as it gets along .
And not much of an ending .
I like how they 're all like 200 feet tall .
Also , it was pretty obvious it was going to be Xenu just from his shape .
But I have to wonder , does Scientology actually have pictures of Xenu ?
I see pretty much the same depiction everywhere , basically a standard gray alien , but is that just a meme that took off ?
I do n't really care .
And not much of an ending .
There should be something .
I should at least get an achievement for pulling off a double flawless victory against Xenu or something .
Though actually god was the only one that was a challenge , he actually attacked me ( I still beat him 2 out of 2 , no need for a 3rd level ) , everyone else just stood there and took it , or jumped around and took it .
Nope , this is just a less good knockoff of Bible Fight .
I like winning that one as Noah .
Noah defeating god , that 's just funny .
The fighting mechanics of this are awful , it does n't acknowledge you ever doing the special moves , the AI is awful and the ending is nonexistent .

The HiRISE camera onboard NASA ’s Mars Reconaissance Orbiter has done it again – sent back a stunningly detailed image of a fascinating part of Mars , that is …
Anyone and everyone “ into space ” has heard of Olympus Mons , the largest volcano on Mars and , probably , in the solar system .
But fewer people know the names Ascraeus , Arsia and Pavonis , a trio of smaller volcanoes – sometimes referred to as the “ Three Princes ” - that lie to the SE of the mighty Olympus …
Pavonis
Mons is probably the most famous of the three , because it was featured heavily in Kim Stanley Robinson ’s beyond - superb Mars Trilogy sci- fi novels ( “ Red Mars ” , “ Green Mars ” and “ Blue Mars ” ) .
In Red Mars , the martian colonists used the summit caldera of Pavonis Mons as the base – literally – of Mars ’ first space elevator , which is why I ’ve loved it ever since –
Anyway , the latest batch of HiRISE releases features a close - up of an area near the summit of Pavonis Mons , and it features some gorgeous detail .
But it ’s also a little puzzling , because at first glance the image looks rather blurry and fuzzy , like it ’s out of focus .
To show you what I mean , here ’s a colourisation I did from the RGB slice … click on the image to bring up a full size version …
See ?
Does n’t it look blurry ?
It is n’t of course , because … well , I ’ll let the HiRISE site explain …
Pavonis Mons is one of the three giant Tharsis Montes shield volcanoes .
Its summit rises so far above the surface that the atmosphere is extremely thin , even for Mars .
Dust that reaches these heights ( for example , during major dust storms ) is hard to remove , so the upper parts of these volcanoes are covered by vast deposits of dust .
The dust is moved a little by the thin winds , producing ripples and other textures near the limit of HiRISE ’s resolution .
The fluffy , ripply surface looks “ smudged ” or out of focus , but by looking at some of the small impact craters you can see that the HiRISE camera is , indeed , properly focused .
It ’s the surface of Mars that is blurry !
The impact craters also show that the dust is not a thin veneer .
Instead , it is a thick coat , at least several meters ( yards ) deep .
This mantling of dust hides the details of the lava flows and vents , frustrating volcanologists but delighting those who study dust !
Ah , that explains it !
Here are another couple of my totally unscientific colourisations , to bring out some more of that fascinating surface detail …
I love that last one , you can see individual ripples of dust on the surface there … 🙂
But the wider angle view turned out to be even more intriguing than the colour strip , because away from the area imaged in colour are some truly fascinating and bewildering features .
I ’m no expert , I ’m just a fan , so I ’m going to just show what I found here and let you all just marvel at the power of HiRISE … and maybe someone on the HiRISE team will drop me a line to tell me what we ’re actually looking at !
( hint hint ! )
Ok , here goes … do n’t forget to click on the images to bring up full size versions …
What the frak is going on there ?!?!
It looks like a small crater , with several strange gullies in the slope on the left , trailing down to the crater floor , and some very disturbed … odd … weird looking terrain on the right .
And what ’s that thing sticking up into the air , down at the bottom there ( about the 7 o’ clock position ) , casting such a long shadow ?
Of course , I could n’t resist making a colourised version …
In another part of the image , there ’s another similar feature – a crater with a distinctly bizarre right hand side ( that ’s my orientation , the L - R thing , it does n’t relate to the actual HiRISE pic , ok ? ) …
And look , down at the bottom there – another protrubrance !
And then I saw this …
That small cluster of craters must have been made when either a single meteoroid broke up above the surface and hit the ground in a hail of stones , or a swarm of meteorites came in and shotgun - blasted the volcano ’s side .
Just amazing .
THAT ’s why I love HiRISE !
It just shows us one wonder after another , and it rewards people who take the time to , well , just look a little closer , with yet MORE wonders … 🙂

Do you remember when Fox News Channel thought comparisons between the U.S. government and Nazi Germany were insane and reprehensible ?
This was the channel ’s reaction when a couple of entries to a video contest sponsored by the progressive activist group MoveOn used Hitler analogies to criticize George W. Bush ( FAIR Action Alert , 1/16/04 ) :
News Corp‘s Fox News Channel started the controversy on January 4 , airing Republican National Committee chair Ed Gillespie ’s complaint about the Bush / Hitler comparison .
“ That ’s the kind of tactics we ’re seeing on the left today in support of these Democratic presidential candidates , ” Gillespie charged , calling such tactics “ despicable . ”
The whole next day ( 1/5/04 ) , this was a major story on Fox News Channel .
John Gibson asked , “ What about the hating Bush movement , the MoveOn.org and George Soros sponsoring these ads that compare Bush to Hitler ? ” — before being corrected that the ads were not sponsored by MoveOn ( or Soros , a funder of the group ) , and were taken down in response to complaints .
Sean Hannity accused a guest : “ You guys on the left are going so far over the cliff .
You ’re making comparisons to the president and Adolf Hitler . ”
Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway said on Hannity ’s show , “ This is the hateful , vitriolic rhetoric that has become the Howard Dean Democratic Party . ”
Bill O’Reilly cited the ads as evidence that “ right now in America the Democratic party is being held captive by the far , far left . ”
That was then , of course , and this is now .
Here ’s Fox News star Glenn Beck on April 1 ( Think Progress , 4/1/09 ) :
Our government is … marching us to a non-violent fascism .
Or to put it another way , they ’re marching us to 1984 .
Big Brother ….
Like it or not , fascism is on the rise .
Beck ’s rant came complete with footage of marching jackbooted Nazis .
No word yet from Fox News on how “ hateful ” and “ despicable ” such comparisons are .
The ultimate irony is that Beck ( FAIR Action Alert , 12/5/06 ) has threatened Muslim Americans with concentration camps — ” the razor wire will be coming , ” was how he put it ( CNN Headline News , 9/5/06 ) — if the “ good Muslims ” do n’t start “ lining up to shoot the bad Muslims in the head . ”
When it comes to fascism , Glenn Beck is not the kind of expert you want .

Germany has urged the UK to stick to its commitments
The UK is under growing pressure over the Eurofighter defence programme amid reports it wants to renegotiate the cost of a £ 1.4bn contract .
Government sources say Gordon Brown spoke to German Chancellor Angela Merkel about the issue this week as negotiations over its cost drag on .
The UK is prepared to buy 16 combat planes from the European consortium but is understood to want to pay less .
Germany and other European partners want a speedy outcome to negotiations .
Value for money
The German , Italian and Spanish governments are concerned that vacillation by the UK could endanger the future of the project and put jobs at risk .
But the UK is seeking greater value for money from the latest phase of the Eurofighter project as constraints on its defence budget increase .
The four countries - which launched the Eurofighter programme in 1988 - have been in talks over sharing 112 combat jets between them in a deal worth more than £ 100 bn .
The UK has committed to ordering 16 for its own use .
Under the original agreement , the four countries were to split 620 jets between them in three separate batches .
The BBC 's political correspondent Iain Watson said there is tension over the negotiations with sources suggesting the UK is determined to bear down on costs while its partners were more worried about securing the future of 100,000 jobs .
Manufacturers of the jet fighter , including UK defence firm BAE Systems , have warned of thousands of job losses from 2012 onwards if no agreement is reached .
Different roles
However , it is thought the talks , which have been going on for months - are advanced and the likelihood of the orders being cancelled is slim .
The global recession is forcing all countries to reconsider their defence budgets .
With an estimated cost per plane of £ 100 m , the Eurofighter programme has come under particular scrutiny .
The Royal Air Force ( RAF ) took delivery of its first quota of Eurofighter Typhoon jets in 2003 .
Last year it declared the Typhoon capable of carrying out ground attacks in addition to its original air defence role .
Critics say the Typhoon is an outdated Cold War weapon , unsuitable for modern wars against terrorists and insurgents .
But the RAF says the upgrade means the fighter will be able to operate more effectively in Iraq and Afghanistan .

Creative Commons has officially launched a Web tool to aid content creators who want to publish material under the highly permissive CC0 license .
The tool , which has been under development for over a year , has now reached 1.0 status and is accessible from the Creative Commons website .
Creative Commons was founded in 2001 by legal scholar and intellectual property reform advocate Lawrence Lessig to provide a legal framework for the free culture movement .
Creative Commons offers a spectrum of copyright licenses that enable content creators to concede intellectual property rights to varying degrees in order to encourage third - party use of creative works .
The organization has also developed technical tools that can be used to apply licensing metadata to digital content and to find material that is available under Creative Commons licenses .
In December 2007 , Creative Commons launched its CC0 license — its most permissive — which effectively enabled content creators to waive all rights associated with a creative work .
This is similar to dedicating a work to the public domain , but with stronger legal footing .
The goal behind the CC0 initiative is to establish a vehicle for extending the concept of a public domain dedication into a form that will be recognized internationally as legally sound .
The CC0 Web tool provides a simple form that guides content creators through the process of distributing their work under a CC0 license .
The form has several steps and includes the full text of the license for users to review .
It also has information icons that can be clicked to get additional contextual explanations of various aspects of the license and form .
Upon completion , the form will generate an XHTML blurb that can be embedded in a Web page to indicate the CC0 status of the work .
In addition to providing licenses , Creative Commons also provides simple " human- readable " summaries of the rights and obligations associated with each license .
The CC0 overview is succinct and indicates that a work has been dedicated to the commons through a waiver of rights under copyright law .
Increasing the international applicability of Creative Commons licenses is one of the organization 's major goals for this year .
Creative Commons CEO
Joi
Ito described it as an important part of the roadmap in an open letter he wrote earlier this year during the organization 's highly successful fundraiser .
Ito believes that Creative Commons will supply a " basic layer of interoperability " for the propagation of content and ideas .
CCCritics
Not everyone is impressed with the CC0 initiative , however .
License proliferation is a major concern that is often voiced by critics .
In the open source software community , the growing number of conflicting and incompatible licenses has created numerous challenges for developers .
Some fear that Creative Commons is paving the way for a similar problem in the free culture ecosystem .
Python expert and free software advocate Mark Pilgrim is among those who are skeptical about Creative Commons .
In the past , he has been a vocal critic of the organization 's non-commercial licenses and favors the GNU Free Documentation License for his own works .
With his usual biting wit , Pilgrim joked about CC0 today in messages posted to identi.ca .
" Since I joined the Creative Commons license - of - the - month club , I 've acquired new vim and vigor ! " he sarcastically remarked .
" Seriously , stop making new licenses .
I know your needs are extra-special and super - unique and nobody understands you but JUST FUCKING STOP . "
I can sympathize with his view to a certain degree , but it 's worth pointing out that the criticism might not entirely be deserved in this case .
The compatibility problems that are generally cited as the most undesirable effect of licensing proliferation are n't relevant here because CC0 is so permissive that it is compatible with everything .
CC0 serves specific functions that are n't addressed by other permissive licenses ( such as the BSD license ) by entirely eliminating the need to preserve copyright information or markings .
The only apparent downside of CC0 is that it generates some confusion about when it should be used and when public domain dedication should be used instead .

It is not enough to run tests and get OKs and not OKs , it is also important to have a nice way to report these results .
In this entry we are going to look at some of the ways TAP streams can be displayed in a nicer way that pure text report .

Welcome back
In preparation to the Test Automation classes in Oslo two weeks from now I am going over my comments I made last month in Frankfurt .
One of the missing items was showing how the results of the tests that are in TAP format can be presented better .
After all a textual report such as this : tap /01 - success .......... ok tap /02 - failure .......... 1/4 # Failed test ' this fails ' # at tap / 02 - failure .t line 8 . # Failed test ' 2+2 should be 4 ' # at tap / 02 - failure .t line 9 . # got : ' 4 ' # expected : ' 5 ' # Looks like you failed 2 tests of 4 . tap/02 - failure ..........
Dubious , test returned 2 ( wstat 512 , 0x200 ) Failed 2/4 subtests tap /03 - exception ........ 1/5 # planning 5 but running only 3 - with exception a real exception at tap / 03 - exception .t line 11 . #
Looks like you planned 5 tests but ran 3 . that goes on for several pages is still too much and hard to read .
Besides people with less technical background wo n't like it .
So let 's take a look at how one can improve this .
TAP the Test Anything Protocol Just a reminder , we are talking about test results in TAP format .
TAP originated from the Perl world but there are implementations of it in every major programming language and even in PostgreSQL .
Turning TAP into an IETF standard is on its way .
The basic idea is that there is a separation between the part that runs the tests and generates raw output and the tool that creates reports from this raw output .
The raw output has an " ok " or " not ok " line for every test unit or assertion with some additional information between those lines .
Something like this : 1..3 ok 1 - Accessing web page ok 2 - Title is correct not ok 3 - Clicking on link ' release software '
Test :: Harness Traditionally in the perl world the tests are executed either when running " make test " or " Build test " depending on the packaging system .
There is also a tool called " prove " that allows us to run some test files .
These all used the Test :: Harness module to execute the tests and then create a textual report .
People can also run the test script using the plan " perl " command and they will see the raw , unaltered output of the test script .
Other implementations have their own tools how to run the tests .
The problem earlier was that it was quite hard to replace the formatting options of Test : : Harness .
Since the release of TAP :: Harness 3 by Andy Armstrong about two years ago the back - end of the Harness became much cleaner that allows the implementation of various other formatting options .
HTML view of TAP using TAP :: Formatter ::HTML
First we are going to take a look at TAP :: Formatter : : HTML by Steve Purkis .
The simples way to use it and to show it is by passing it as the formatter option to " prove " .
The following command will run all the .t files in the t/ subdirectory merging the STDOUT and STDERR ( - m ) and running quietly ( - Q ) .
The output is a single HTML file using the JQuery Javascript library and a few external Javascript and CSS files .
prove -m - Q -- formatter=TAP :: Formatter::HTML t/ > output.html
In order to to show many parts of it I created several test script , ran the above command on it and placed the result on my web server .
Go ahead , check it out .
Collecting test data
As nice as that report is you do n't always want to install TAP :: Formatter : : HTML on every system you run your tests .
After all you might not even use Perl for generating the TAP stream .
In addition , later you might want to create additional reports based on historical test results .
For this , we should have a way to collect the results of the test in raw data format .
Move them to a central machine and generate the nice reports there , keeping the raw data files as well .
The archiving option of prove was created exactly for this : prove - a tap.tar.gz t/
This will run the tests and generate a tarbal from the resulting TAP stream along with a meta.yml file that contains some meta data on the execution .
You can take this tar .gz file and move it to another server .
A warning though , the TAP streams of each test file is saved in a file with the exact same name as the test file was .
So if you create the archive and the untar it in the same place you will overwrite your test scripts with the TAP streams .
Better to open it in another directory .
Generating report from the archived files
Once you have the tar.gz file on the central machine you should be able to create the HTML report .
Unfortunately I could not find a nice way to do it but Ash Berlin and Steve Purkis showed me a workaround :
First unzip the file using tar xzf tap.tar.gz
Then you can run the following command : prove -- exec ' cat ' - Q --formatter=TAP :: Formatter::HTML t/ > output.html
Yes , this will only work on Unix , maybe on windows one can replace ' cat ' with ' type ' but I have not tried it .
In any case I hope soon there will a better solution to this .
Smolder
There is another way to collect and display test archive which is starting to be a more integrated solution .
Michael Peters has developed Smolder more than a year ago but it made it to CPAN only a week ago after the QA Hackathon that was held in Birmingham .
Smolder is a web based application to collect and display TAP streams .
Once installed it can be launched with the " smolder " command .
By default it provides its own web server and uses SQLite so you do n't have to worry about further configuration .
Once you see it and decide that you 'd like to use it in production with many test systems reporting to it you 'll probably invest more in the installation , using Apache as the front - end server and MySQL as the database but at the beginning you can use the simple installation .
Once the system is setup you have a web based administrative interface to add projects , users and associate them with each other .
Every user can then upload archived tap results as generated by the - a flag of prove .
The system then provides various views of the tests results .
You can view the details of a single test run and you can already see some historical data as well .
Public Smolder Server I did not want to setup a public Smolder server on my machine but if you 'd like to see how it looks like you can visit the publicly accessible Smolder installation at Plusthree Not only that , but if you are running an open source project you can ask Michael if can still add your project to use this public server .
Personally I 'd really like to see some open source project that are not written in perl or related to the Perl community having some data there but of course Michael is the one who know if the machine still has capacity to add your project .
Setting up Smolder
So in order to install Smolder you 'll have to configure your CPAN shell and then type cpan install Smolder That should install all the dependencies .
Once you installed it , as of version 1.35 you have to do the following to start the server : First mkdir ~/.smolder echo " HostName smolder.local " > ~/.smolder/smolder.conf
In addition you have to change the /etc / hosts file so smolder .local will resolve to 127.0.01
You can of course use any name with at least one .
in it .
/etc /hosts needs to have the following line in it : 127.0.0.1 smolder.local
Then you can launch Smolder using the following command : smolder -c ~/.smolder/smolder.conf
It should tell you that it is ready to be accessed using your browser at http://smolder.local:8080/
Uploading TAP streams
You can create users , projects , associate them to each other and upload TAP streams to the server using your browser .
When you had enough of manual uploading you can take a look at the smolder_smoke_signal command that came with Smolder to upload your archived files .
This is the command you can use to do it .
smolder_smoke_signal -- server smolder.foo.com:port \ -- username myself -- password s3cr3t -- file tap.tar.gz \ -- project MyProject
Now you can setup your test machines or instruct your developers to upload their results after every test run .
This will give you plenty of data quickly .
Enjoy and show it around .

MADONNA'S recent failure to adopt another African child is indicative of a downwards trend in American adoptions .
The urge to have a child is a powerful one and many couples have looked abroad to find a new family member .
But foreign adoption has fallen from a peak in 2004 after a series of scandals over lax standards led to tighter rules in America .
Increasing wealth in developing countries that sent children for adoption and declining birth rates may possibly mean that there are fewer suitable candidates .
AP
There has been a spate of Larrabee information during the last two weeks .
Two GDC talks ( slides near the bottom of this page ) , a prototype library , and an article by Michael Abrash on the Dr. Dobb ’s website .
Dr. Dobb ’s Journal has been out of print since February , but for many years it was one of the leading software publications .
When initially published in 1976 ( as Dr. Dobb ’s Journal of Computer Calisthenics & Orthodontia ) it was the first journal focusing on software development for microcomputers .
Michael Abrash wrote many articles for Dr. Dobb ’s over the years , including a series on the Quake software renderer in the mid 90’s .
This series made a great impression on me ; when it was published I was considering a career change from microprocessor design to graphics programming .
At the time , I was working on Intel ’s P55C processor , publicly known as “ Pentium with MMX Technology ” .
This chip was notable both for being the first X86 processor with a SIMD ( single instruction multiple data ) instruction set , and for being the last CPU to use the in - order Pentium micro-architecture .
When Michael Abrash wrote the Quake articles game rendering was 100 % software , mostly written in assembly language .
Abrash was the uber - game programmer , having worked on DOOM , written the Quake renderer , and published ( in addition to his Dr. Dobb ’s articles ) many influential books about graphics programming , assembly and optimization ( the last of which is available online ) .
Within a few years ( around the time I finally made the jump from CPU design to game graphics programming ) , it seemed to many that graphics hardware and compiler improvements had made software rendering and hand - coded assembly obsolete .
This was mirrored by my own experience ; I was hired to my first game industry job on the strength of a software rasterization demo ( written mostly in assembler ) and by the time the game shipped , it required graphics hardware and contained very little assembly ( none written by me ) .
Abrash started applying his considerable skills to what he saw as the next unsolved hard problem : natural language processing .
But he could n’t stay away from graphics for long ; when Microsoft started working on the XBox console he got involved in its design .
In the early 2000 ’s , he figured out that there was a market for software renderers after all , mostly due to the mess of caps bits , unorthogonal feature support , and flaky compliance that characterized low - end graphics hardware at the time ( Intel was among the greatest offenders ; compounding the problem , its graphics chips sold very well so there were a lot of them out there ) .
With Mike Sartain ( another XBox designer ) , he wrote Pixomatic , a software renderer published by RAD Game Tools ( until then mostly known for the Miles sound library , perhaps the most widely - used middleware in the games industry ) .
Of course , he published another series of articles in Dr. Dobb ’s about the experience , where he discussed how he made use of SIMD instruction sets such as MMX and SSE when optimizing Pixomatic .
I found this particularly interesting due to my personal involvement with these instruction sets .
After working on the first MMX hardware implementation I helped define its successor , which was twice as wide ( 128 bits instead of 64 ) and added support for floating - point SIMD .
This instruction set was at first called MMX2 , then VX , and finally split into two separate instruction sets : SSE and SSE2 .
By this time SIMD instruction set extensions were becoming quite popular ; AMD had their own version called 3DNow ! , and PowerPC had the AltiVec instruction set .
Intel kept on adding new SIMD extensions : SSE3 , SSSE3 , SSE4.1 , SSE4.2 , and AVX .
As Abrash details in the Larrabee article , Larrabee got started when he decided to talk to Intel about some ideas for SIMD instructions to accelerate software rasterization .
As a result , Larrabee includes a powerful set of SIMD instructions .
Much wider than previous instruction sets ( 512 bits instead of 128 , or 256 in the case of AVX ) , Larrabee ’s instruction set contains several instructions tailored to software rasterization .
It is also general enough to allow for automatic code vectorization of a wide variety of loops .
Abrash had a key role in the design of the instruction set , bringing software rasterization back into the mainstream .
Besides a good instruction set , Larrabee also needed an efficient hardware design with a large number of cores .
Each of these cores needed to be very efficient in terms of performance - per - Watt and per-transistor .
Since the Larrabee team started out as a skunkworks , they could n’t afford to design a brand - new core so they looked at previous Intel cores , and the old in - order Pentium core ( almost the same one I used in the P55C ) was the one chosen .
What I find fascinating about this story is that Abrash managed to follow rasterization all the way around the Wheel of Reincarnation .
This term refers to the common process where a piece of computing functionality is first implemented in software , then moves to special - purpose hardware which gradually becomes more general until it rivals a CPU in complexity , at which point the functionality is folded back into software .
It was coined in a 1968 article by T. H , Myer and Ivan Sutherland ( the latter is widely considered the father of computer graphics ) .
We know GM is struggling these days and making their utmost efforts to recover from this so - called financial gloom .
It ’s leaving no stone unturned to give a better fight off its foreign competitors and the efforts to re size and re purpose the 2010 Cadillac SRX is enough to tell every story about that .
You need not to reckon it a confused auto transport wagon any more , as it ’s going to be replaced with a nice looking and pure crossover .
It is leaner this time with a fitted and distinctive engine lineup that is being considered the first ever turbo of a Cadillac in North America .
Most of GM ’s critics are reckoning the model as a true competitor for luxury crossover brand leader Lexus .
Now you will soon see it flying with edgy lines , smooth sheetmatel , eye - catching headlights and in - your - face grille , this new Cadillac will be loaded with lots of rakish looks .
The basic of this resizing and repurposing is quite simple , as to allure more and more well - off consumers that all like to value practical functionality and image .
Steve Shannon , who is GM ’s executive director for premium brands , says in this connection : “ in this every moment changing marketplace , you long for putting the chits down on more of a winning hand . ”
Though Cadillac is still a wagon , it has been based on the CTS and really gets some dashing looks with its aggressive looks and low stance , simply it is a luxury car with some additional functionality .

From the ' digging into GCC 4.4 ' files :
GCC 4.4 is a critically important component of the open source software landscape .
It officially was released last week and I blogged on it briefly , but felt the need to get more insight .
Fedora 11 which hit its preview release yesterday lists GCC 4.4 as one of its key features and Red Hat is a key contributor to GCC , so I asked Red Hat for their views on how GCC 4.4 will make a difference .
Tim Burke , Senior Director , RHEL Product Development told me that in his view the most significant new advancement in gcc 4.4 over gcc
4.3 is OpenMP 3.0 support ( gcc 4.3 had OpenMP 2.5 support ) .
Burke explained that , the significant
feature in OpenMP version 3.0 is the concept of tasks .
One can specify
whole sections of their code as separate tasks that can be run in
parallel .
( OpenMP 3.0 specifications can be found here :
http://www.openmp.org/mp-documents/spec30.pdf and a good overview of the OpenMP standard can be found here :
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openmp).
" OpenMP allows
programmers to more easily create efficient multi- threaded programs in
C/C++ , " Burke explained .
" With OpenMP 3.0 the user can explicitly section off code they
wish to run in parallel "
So what 's next for GCC from Red Hat 's point of view ?
A federal officer holds a tear gas rifle during a Black Lives Matter protest at the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse early Sunday , July 26 , 2020 , in Portland , Ore .
On the streets of Portland , a strange armed conflict unfolds night after night .
It is raw , frightening and painful on both sides of an iron fence separating the protesters on the outside and federal agents guarding a courthouse inside .
This weekend , journalists for The Associated Press spent the weekend both outside , with the protesters , and inside the courthouse , with the federal agents , documenting the fight that has become an unlikely centerpiece of the protest movement gripping America .

Update :
We just lived , breathed and experienced GM and Segway 's joint press conference , where they " unveiled " the P.U.M.A. one more time for effect .
Larry Burns and Jim Norrod from GM and Segway , respectively , talked up what they each brought to the table , and described the vehicle 's inception as a partnership .
Segway obviously brought the two - wheel mojo , and seems responsible for most of what 's being shown at the moment .
As opposed to the Segway 's tilt - and - cringe system of navigation , the P.U.M.A. has a more regular steering wheel , but while they 're currently demonstrating it with Segway - style acceleration , they plan on swapping that for " Nintendo - style " buttons behind the wheel for acceleration and braking .
For GM 's part , they plan to integrate its " connected vehicles " technologies to improve safety and efficiency -- and we might not see P.U.M.A. on the road until they can pull it off .
The car will not only communicate with other cars and with GPS , but will sense and stop for pedestrians .
They plan to show a connected version that will be available for test drives by Real Actual Humans this coming fall , and then next year will come the scariest of all unveilings : GM styling .
Right now this is just a chassis , GM plans on slapping on all sorts of " fashionable " candy shells , and if the incredibly unrealistic and " futuristic " renders we saw are any indication ( see the gallery below ) , we 'd really rather do without .
The biggest obstacle to commercialization , however , is the lack of infrastructure : P.U.M.A. in its current incarnation is designed for for bike lanes , and the first cities to get it will be ones with existing , comprehensive bike lanes -- not as much of an obstacle in Europe , but quite the stretch for most American cities .
Still , the mathematics are quite alluring , with a 35 mile range at 35 mph for a 35 cent charge -- even us mouth - breathing Statesiders can understand that .
We added a video after the break , along with a couple outdoor shots in the gallery .
The thing really does look and operate like a two - person , sit - down , Woz - free Segway .
You have been warned .
DEA does not investigate or target individual " patients " who use cannabis , but instead the Drug Trafficking Organizations ( DTOs ) involved in marijuana trafficking .
…
Again , the agency does not target individual users who are
engaged in " simple possession " of the drug - even though they too are violating federal law and entitled to no immunity .
Months ago , Judiciary Committee chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) sent a pointed inquiry to the DEA demanding an accounting of the costs and methodology behind the federal raids against medical marijuana dispensaries in California .
DEA ’s response ( pdf ) recently became available and contains some interesting information , including this :
It ’s not really news that DEA avoids arresting patients , but it ’s remarkable to see it in writing .
This serves to remind us that DEA in fact bears no legal obligation whatsoever to enforce federal marijuana laws in states that have approved medical use .
The organization ’s enforcement priorities with regards to medical marijuana are shaped by politics , not a sense of legal obligation , thus patients have been quietly left off the battlefield in recognition of the obscene PR fiasco that would result if they were visibly targeted .
Keep this in mind if Obama ’s pledge to end medical marijuana raids is met with resistance from anyone who claims that " federal law must be enforced .
" DEA ’s concession also helps to illuminate the complete incoherence of any argument that state - level marijuana reforms are rendered impotent in the face of incongruous federal drug laws .
Such reforms have enormous practical value by dramatically reducing the threat of arrest and conviction under state laws , which have always been the only real threat facing individual users .
This acknowledgment should end debate over the importance of state - level marijuana reform .
1. Pick Up Steals Wherever You Can
This can be one of the more tricky categories to master in any league .
I usually tend to lead leagues in steals by a mile or punt the category a month into the season .
The best thing to do is not to draft a team full of speedsters , since by definition a speedster will tend to lack in all the other major categories ( runs , RBIs , home runs , and average , which are all much more interconnected ) .
The key is to pick one or even two high steals guys , then try and give more focus to players who pick up 10 - 15 stolen bases on average .
If you can field a team of sluggers who put up respectable low double - digit steals , you ’ll be set for this elusive stat .
2. Even the Worst Teams Have Closers
It ’s not usually necessary to spend too many high - round picks on closers .
It may help you in strikeouts and ERA , but closers do n’t pitch too many innings anyways so their benefit in those categories is minimal ( though not to be completely ignored ! ) .
If you do n’t want to waste picks on the Mariano Riveras and Francisco Rodriguezs , research who has the inside track for closing jobs on bottom - feeder teams .
These guys may post higher ERAs and lower strikeouts , but they can still rack up 30 saves a year .
Just look at Brian Wilson on the Giants last year or Joakim Soria of the Royals before he broke out .
3. Focus on Pitching
This is a big point of debate with many fantasy baseball managers .
Some will swear by hitting , others by pitching .
Personally , I like consistency in my pitching corps .
Hitters often crawl out of the woodwork as the season progresses , so there are always good pick - ups on the waiver wire .
With pitching , it ’s a much more complicated and costly game to play if you want to scout free agency for a new starter every week .
4. Re-evaluate Your Needs as You Draft
All too often , managers will not be paying attention to who they already picked in the midst of a 30 - round draft .
Cheat sheets and power rankings are helpful in getting a general feel for players , but take notice if you ’ve already drafted three players projecting to hit .250 or if your pitchers ’
ERAs are creeping steadily higher .
The cheat sheets ca n’t be personalized to your team , so take notice of not only what positions you need to fill , but what categories you are already falling behind in mid-draft .
5. Try to Get At Least One Big Bopper
It ’s great to have a perfectly balanced team , but all too often that just does n’t happen .
You may have every position player hitting home runs in the double digits or even 20 - something range , but it ’s often those few big hitters that put teams in front of the all - important home run and RBI categories .
Nothing against guys who hit 30 dingers annually , but it feels good to have at least one guy on your team who can go for 40 or 50 to make up for a middle infielder who you need to keep on for average or steals .
I am always inspired by Junk Camp projects , like the rubber stamp photo holders .
Spring is here and Ki is sharing a flower trug tutorial made from a vintage feedsack .
We are big fans of repurposing feed sacks .
With two spindle dowels , a vintage feed sack , and a little webbing Ki created this easy , graphic flower trug for carrying cut flowers from the garden .
She used the webbing ( you could also use an organic twill tape or sturdy ribbon ) to create loops to fit snuggle over the spindles .
With one spindle on each end of the feed sack you can load your trug up with flowers and easily carry them with the spindle handles .
If you do n’t have decorative spindles , you could also use plain dowels and create a pocket hem at each end of the feed sack to conceal the dowels .
Here is a brief step by step :
Cut two spindles slightly longer than the width of the flower sack .
Open the seam on the bottom of the feed sack .
Fold under and press the raw edges on both ends .
Attach 4 loops to each end by sandwiching them between the front and back of the feed sack .
Top stitch openings on both ends .
Use reinforcement stitches over the loops .
Insert spindles and load up with flowers !
See the full flower trug tutorial for detailed instructions and step by step pictures .
If you love junk projects too , then you must join the Junk Revolution .
Here you will find a shop with great vintage junk finds and goods made by other artisans .
In the gallery you will find links to other artists , vendors , and shops that are part of the revolution .

That ’s just two lines from a commercial for Red House Furniture that uses race relations as a selling tool .
The ad has caused many to cry racism , despite the message being one of racial equality .
The makers of the ad followed up to the criticism , saying that the ad is “ racial ” and not racist , and that the absurdity of applying racial labels to furniture was making a broader point about racial labeling in general .
The Red House Furniture ad below .
Following that , the video from one of the ad ’s creators explaining the thinking behind the ad .
Have they gone to far , or is this ad actually very clever ?
Explanation :
What is Ruby Enterprise Edition ?
Ruby Enterprise Edition ( REE ) is a server - oriented distribution of the official Ruby interpreter , and includes various additional enhancements , such as :
REE has been out for about a year now and is already used by many high - profile websites and organizations , such as New York Times , Shopify and 37signals .
“ We switched to enterprise ruby to get the full benefit of the [ copy - on - write ] memory characteristics and we can absolutely confirm the memory savings of 30 % some others have reported .
This is many thousand dollars of savings even at today ’s hardware prices . ”
— Tobias Lütke ( Shopify )
And just like Phusion Passenger , Ruby Enterprise Edition is 100 % open source .
Changes
Now based on Ruby 1.8.6-p287
The previous REE released was based on Ruby 1.8.6-p286 .
This one is based on p287 , which fixes a few bugs in the ‘ dl ’ library .
Unfortunately there was n’t enough time to base REE on Ruby 1.8.6 - p368 , which was released last week .
This is planned for a future version .
Fixed a possible infinite looping bug in the garbage collector A long - standing , but rare , infinite looping bug in the garbage collector has been fixed .
If you ’ve ever seen Ruby Enterprise Edition freezing while using 100 % CPU , then that ’s probably this bug .
This bug only occurs under very rare circumstances involving deferred running of finalizers .
Users are strongly advised to upgrade to this release for this bug fix alone .
Upgraded to tcmalloc 1.2
The tcmalloc memory allocator has been upgraded from version 0.99.6 to 1.2 , which is slightly faster and has support for more platforms .
Upgraded to RubyGems 1.3.2
If you ’ve ever seen an error message in Phusion Passenger along the lines of “ Directory ‘/ nonexistent ’ not found ” , then what you ’ve seen is a bug in RubyGems 1.3.1 .
This bug has been fixed in RubyGems 1.3.2 .
Included Sparc optimization patches Darryl Gove ’s and Miriam Blatt ’s Sparc optimization patches are now included .
It has been reported that these patches make Ruby significantly faster and more stable on Sparc machines .
OpenSSL extension compilation on Gentoo fixed The Ruby OpenSSL extension did n’t compile correctly on Gentoo .

Spreeblick befindet sich heute im demonstrativen Streik .
Am heutigen Tag , dem 22 .
April 2009 , hat das Bundeskabinett ein Gesetz zur Sperrung von Websites beschlossen , die Kinderpornografie darstellen oder anbieten .
Wir unterstützen die Bundesregierung in ihrem Bestreben , dem Missbrauch von Menschen und speziell Kindern ein Ende zu bereiten , bezweifeln jedoch auf Grundlage vieler Expertenmeinungen , dass dieses Bestreben der wahre Grund für die angekündigten Sperrungen ist .
Die geplante technische Umsetzung auf Basis von Sperrlisten halten wir für laienhaft , wirkungslos und unter Umständen kontraproduktiv .
Wir fordern die Bundesregierung auf , die durch die Listen offensichtlich bekannten illegalen Websites zu schließen und ihre Urheber bzw .
Betreiber strafrechtlich zu verfolgen .
Wir lehnen Internetsperren ab , die ob ihrer Intransparenz und technischen Zweifelhaftigkeit eine Gefahr für die Demokratie in Deutschland sind .
Wir fühlen uns durch die von Fachleuten wiederholt in Frage gestellten Zahlen und Fakten , die das Familienministerium kommuniziert , als wählende Bürger belogen .
Wir halten Wahlkampf - Taktiken und politischen Populismus für äußerst unangemessen , wenn es um die Bekämpfung des Verbrechens der Gewalt an Minderjährigen gehen soll .

English version :
Spreeblick.com , a german weblog , is on a demonstrative strike today .
The reason : Today , the german federal cabinet passed a new law to filter websites based on a secret list compiled by the Federal Criminal Police Office .
The Federal Ministry for Family Affairs communicates the law as a remedy for the prevention of child pornography .
While we strongly support any attempt to stop the abuse of humans and children in particular , we doubt that this is the real reason for the law .
For months , experts of all fields have impeached the facts and figures that were communicated by the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs as well as the technical implementation of the filtering process .
We mistrust the planned non-transparent process , we regard it as ineffective and amateurish and we believe it is counterproductive and a possible thread to democracy .
Since illegal sites on a list must be known beforehand , we urge the government to shut those sites down and prosecute the operators of those sites .
In times of a nationwide election campaign , we regard political populism as highly inappropriate when it should be about the fight against the abuse of minors .
To support the cause , you can optionally enter your location , name , URL and comments on the map .

WFXT -TV : It all started with a question : " How much responsibility , if any , do you have for the financial crisis ? " Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) and a conservative Harvard law student debated over how Frank should have handled his role as the House Chairman of the Financial Services Committee .
Frank was at Harvard University for a speech at the Kennedy School of Government .
Frank said the student was n't backing up his claims , invoking some laughter from the crowd , and the student told Frank he was n't answering his question .
I am the great destroyer of evil and curtains .

POLICE : some could be lovelorn according to survey
But new figures may shed some light on why some members of the thin blue line may speak a little sharply when pulling over a motorist for a minor traffic violation .
A survey of Scotland ’s eight forces reveals that he , or she , could simply be lovelorn and a bit miserable .
It has emerged that members of the country ’s biggest force , Strathclyde , are the loneliest in the country .
Instead of being welcomed home by a spouse after their shift , they are likely to be heating up a TV dinner for one .
With more than half of its officers unmarried , Strathclyde is far behind other forces when it comes to marital bliss .
Israeli media said that the key sticking point is a demand by Israel that some of the Palestinian prisoners , once released , would not be allowed to return to their homes in the West Bank and instead would be deported either to Gaza or neighbouring Arab countries .
White House : No bow to Saudi
The White House is denying that the president bowed to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at a G - 20 meeting in London , a scene that drew criticism on the right and praise from some Arab outlets .
" It was n't a bow .
He grasped his hand with two hands , and he 's taller than King Abdullah , " said an Obama aide , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
The Washington Times called the alleged bow a " shocking display of fealty to a foreign potentate " and said it violated centuries of American tradition of not deferring to royalty .
The Weekly Standard , meanwhile , noted that American protocol apparently rules out bowing , or at least it reportedly did on the occasion of a Clinton " near - bow " to the emperor of Japan .
Interestingly , a columnist in the Saudi - backed Arabic paper Asharq Alawsat also took the gesture as a bow and appreciated the move .
" Obama wished to demonstrate his respect and appreciation of the personality of King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz , who has made one of the most important calls in the modern era , namely the call for inter - faith and inter-cultural dialogue to defuse the hatred , conflict and wars , " wrote the columnist , Muhammah Diyab .
The video shows Obama dipping toward the king as G - 20 leaders greet one another at the ExCel Centre in London .

A sample of the new battery material .
Researchers at MIT have designed a new battery that can recharge devices about 100 times faster than conventional lithium ion batteries .
The design could lead to electric car batteries that charge in 5 minutes ( compared with 8 hours in today ’s electric cars ) and cell phone batteries that charge in just 10 seconds .
Byoungwoo Kang and Gerbrand Ceder of MIT have improved the design of a “ nanoball battery , ” which has a cathode that is composed of nanosized balls of lithium iron phosphate .
As the battery charges , the nanoballs release lithium ions that travel across an electrolyte to the anode .
As the battery discharges , the opposite occurs , and the lithium ions are reabsorbed by the nanoballs in the cathode .
The key to the nanoball battery ’s quick charge time is the speed at which the lithium iron phosphate nanoballs in the cathode can release and absorb lithium ions .
In conventional lithium ion batteries , detaching the ions from the normal cathode takes a relatively long time .
By coating each nanoball with a thin layer of lithium phosphate , Kang and Ceder showed that they could detach the lithium ions from the nanoballs even quicker than previous studies have found .
To demonstrate the technology , the researchers fabricated a small battery that could be fully charged or discharged in 10 to 20 seconds , which would otherwise have taken six minutes .
The scientists ’ tests showed that the new material degrades less than other battery materials after repeated charges and discharges .
This means that the battery could be made with less material , which could possibly lead to smaller , lighter batteries .

The Los Angeles County coroner 's office is investigating two recent deaths that officials say could be related to the recent global swine flu outbreak .
However , no tests have come back positive for the swine flu , and medical examiners have not officially determined what caused the deaths .
[ Updated at 2:08 p.m. : The L.A. coroner 's office said this afternoon that further testing indicated neither of two flu - related deaths being investigated in Los Angeles County appeared to be linked to the swine flu .
Read full story : Coroner doubts 2 men died of swine flu
Updated at 9:30 a.m. : Coroner 's spokesman Craig Harvey said his office would collect specimens from the deceased and send them to the county public health department , which would determine whether either person died from the swine flu .
If so , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be notified , Harvey said . ]
Coroner 's spokesman Craig Harvey said Bellflower Medical Center reported the death of a 33 - year Long Beach resident Monday afternoon from symptoms resembling swine flu .
" It 's that diagnosis that needs to be confirmed , " Harvey said .
" An autopsy will be performed to establish the cause of death . "
The following is an excerpt from Everybody Must Get Stoned : Rock Stars on Drugs .
The book was inspired by Paul McCartney on Drugs , an article I wrote for 10 Zen Monkeys in January of 2007 .
In researching this particular section , I relied heavily upon two great sources : Please Kill Me : The Uncensored Oral History of Punk ( An Evergreen book ) by Legs McNeil and Gillian McCain and High Times magazine .
Other major sources for the book included Celebrity Stoner and a great book titled Waiting For The Man : The Story of Drugs and Popular Music by Harry Shapiro .
During the latter half of the twentieth century , rock stars were privileged with the opportunity to experience just about every imaginable thrill .
They were young , they were aggressive , many of them were wealthy , they were in a culture where thumbing your nose at authority was the rule rather than the exception , and they were treated like sex gods by members of the opposite or desired gender .
And , of course , there were plenty of drugs around to get crazy with .
These are some of the twisted highlights or low - lights of rock star behavior related to drugs .
In 1969 - 1970 , Iggy Pop and his seminal proto-punk band the Stooges lived together outside Detroit in a house they nicknamed " Fun House . "
( They also named an album for it . )
Besides writing and recording music , they were injecting massive amounts of drugs , mostly heroin .
When setting up a hit , the Stooges would squirt the blood out of their syringes and shoot it all over the walls and ceilings .
After a while , enough blood had accumulated on the apartment 's walls to create a sort - of degraded smack addict 's Jackson Pollock mural .
Ron Asheton , the only Stooge member who was not a junkie and who lived elsewhere , described it " ... a lot of times there would be fresh stuff .
Then it would dry on to the table or on the floor ....
I wish I was smart enough to take pictures of it because it would have been a masterpiece .
" Dee Dee Ramone found himself at a party in London , hanging out for a few moments in the bathroom snorting great quantities of speed .
It was n't the sort of place you 'd want to hang out for too long , as Dee Dee quickly noticed that the bathroom was disgusting — sinks , toilets , everything was full of vomit , piss , and shit .
Sid Vicious — a key figure in the London punk scene but not yet a member of the Sex Pistols — wandered in and asked Dee Dee if he had anything to get high on , so Dee Dee generously gave Sid some of his crank .
Vicious pulled out a syringe , stuck it into a toilet filled with puke and piss , and then loaded it with speed and shot himself up .
The right - wing rocker Ted Nugent is known for being very antidrug and very prowar .
The Motor City Madman happily calls out any pussy - ass traitor not ready to grab a gun or a bomb or a nuke and show those towelheads that we mean business .
But back during the glory years of the Vietnam war , this most macho chickenhawk in the Republican firmament went to extremes to make sure his own pussy ass did n't end up in Vietnam , and he used drugs to do it .
In a 1970s High Times interview , Nugent related the story of how he avoided the draft .
For 30 days prior to his appearance before the draft board , the hairy and bearded Nugent stopped brushing his teeth , bathing , washing himself , or combing his hair .
He ate nothing but junk food and high - fat foods and drank nothing but Pepsi and beer .
Then , a week before his physical , Nugent pulled out all the stops .
He stopped going to the bathroom .
" I did it in my pants .
Shit , piss , the whole shot .
My pants got crusted up . "
Then three days before the exam , Nugent started staying up with the help of crystal meth .
When he finally went in for the army physical , Nugent was so sick that he passed out during his blood test .
During the urine test , he could n't pee .
And when it came time to give them some excrement , he pulled down his pants and it was all there and ready .
In fact , he got it all over his hands and arm .
Nugent bragged to High Times , " ... in the mail I got this big juicy 4 - F .
They 'd call dead people before they 'd call me ....
I just was n't into it .
I was too busy doin ' my own thing . "
Did n't Dick Cheney say something like that ?
( Nugent has recently claimed that he made this story up . )
In 1967 , rock guitarist and notorious smack addict Michael Bloomfield , who had played with Bob Dylan on his classic mid-sixties albums and as a member of Blues Project , had his own band of fellow musician - junkies .
They called themselves the Electric Flag .
They were hired by B - movie master Roger Corman to create the soundtrack to Corman 's LSD movie The Trip ( starring a young , acid - gobbling Jack Nicholson ) .
The band was invited to the film opening , where they took the front - row seats that had been set aside for them .
But the lads had arrived so loaded down on smack that they were nodding off and spacing out throughout the film .
In a High Times interview , Bloomfield added that the band was also encouraged to sleep by their positioning in the theater : " We 're sitting in the front row , and we 're like one inch from the screen — we have to sit at a 90 degree angle just to see the movie ...
" When the movie ended , everybody filed out except for Bloomfield and his coterie of stoned musicians , who were glued to their seats , some with eyes closed and the others glassy - eyed .
Confronted by members of Corman 's crew as to why they were not leaving the theatre , Bloomfield had enough presence of mind to come up with an excuse that would be socially acceptable at that time and within this particular milieu .
" We all had a lot of acid , " he told them .
In 1967 Hollywood , at the screening of The Trip , this had to be respected .
Not wanting to bum the fellows out during such a sensitive event , the crew members left the musicians alone in the theater .
It took them several hours to pry themselves from their chairs .
Japan has a reputation for searching rock stars for drugs .
Most famously , Paul McCartney spent some time in jail after going through Japanese customers ( see also the chapters : " The Beatles on Drugs " and " Big Busts and Big Deals " ) .
So when Guns n' Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin was warned by his manager to get rid of any drugs he might have before going through customers in Japan , Stradlin put them someplace he knew he would n't lose them — in his stomach .
He must have had quite a stash , because he wound up in a coma for 96 hours .
In Please Kill Me , Ronnie Cutrone , an artist and denizen of Andy Warhol 's 1960s Factory scene described a typical night out with the Doors ' lead vocalist : " Jim would go out , lean up against the bar , order eight screwdrivers , put down six Tuinals on the bar , drink two or three screwdrivers , take two Tuinals , then he'd have to pee , but he could n't leave the other five screwdrivers , so he'd take his dick out and pee , and some girl would come up and blow his dick , and then he'd finish the other five screwdrivers and then he'd finish the other four Tuinals , and then he'd pee in his pants , and then Eric Emerson and I would take him home .
"
In his mid-1970s heyday , Los Angeles declared " Elton John Week . "
To celebrate , the glam rock pasha invited his relatives out to L.A. to celebrate .
Allegedly , Elton took 60 Valiums , jumped into a hotel pool , and shouted , " I 'm going to die . "
His grandmother was heard to comment : " I suppose we 're going to have to go home now .
" In a 1999 High Times interview , Ozzy talked about the time he had the best coke he'd ever had .
He said , " I 'm lying by the pool one day and I met this guy and I ask him , ' You want to do some coke ? '
He goes , ' no no no . '
I 'm whacking this stuff up my nose , it 's a brilliant sunny day , and this guy 's sitting there with one of those reflectors under his chin getting a suntan .
I say , ' What do you do . '
He says , ' I work for the government . '
' Uh ... what do you do with the government ? '
' I work for the drug squad . '
I sez , ' You 're fucking joking . '
He shows me his badge .
I fuckin ' flipped ... flames were coming out of my fingers , man .
He says , ' Oh you 're all right .
I 'm the guy that got you the coke . ' "

Another new channel is about to begin broadcasting in Turkic language - speaking regions throughout Central Asia and the Caucasus , which shows the overwhelming cultural influence Turkish has compared to the languages in other Turkic - speaking countries , considering that :
- a lot of them have switched to the Latin alphabet fairly recently ( Azeri , Turkmen ) , want to and can't ( Tatar ) , or are considering it ( Kazakh and Kyrgyz )
- a lot of them are still much less influential than Russian even in their own countries ( Kazakh , Kyrgyz , Uzbek , etc . )
- a lot of them do n't even have their own countries ( Tatar , Gagauz , Uyghur , etc . )
Azeri / Azerbaijani would be the one exception to this , except for the fact that it is so similar to standard Turkish that many just consider them to be two standards of the same language anyway .
Now to the article :
TRT , Nevruz Günü olan 21 Mart'ta , Türk dünyası ' na hitap edecek yeni çok dilli TV kanalını yay ına alacak .
now
TRT , yeni kanalında Azerbaycan Türkçesi , Kazakça , Kırgızca , Özbekçe ve Türkmence programları ile 27 ülkede ve 13 özerk bölgede 250 milyon kişiye ulaşmayı planl ıyor .
Yeni kanal şu ülkelerde izlenebilecek :
Azerbaycan , Kazakistan , Türkmenistan , Özbekistan , Kırgızistan , Afganistan , Rusya Federasyonu , Ukrayna , Moldova , Gürcistan , Suriye , Irak , İran , Bulgaristan , Yunanistan , Balkan ülkeleri , Doğu Avrupa ülkeleri ve Çin Sincan Uygur Özerk Bölgesi
TRT yeni kanalında , Azerbaycan Türkçesi , Kazakça , Kırgızca , Özbekçe ve Türkmence programlara yer verecek ve Türkçe alt yazı kullanılacak ... Yeni kanalda ; kültür , sanat , belgesel ve müzik programlarının yanı sıra , Türkçe de öğretilecek .
On the 21st of March ( Nevruz or Nowruz , the Persian New Year .
Persian being an Indo- European language the word ( نو ) is cognate with the English new ) , TRT will begin broadcasting of a new multilingual tv channel to address the Turkish world .
TRT plans to reach 250 million people in 27 countries and 13 autonomous regions with programs in Azerbaijan Turkish ( Azeri ) , Kazakh , Kyrgyz , Uzbek and Turkmen .
The new channel can be seen in these countries : Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , Kyrgyzstan , Afghanistan , Russia , Ukraine , Moldova , Georgia , Syria , Iraq , Iran , Bulgaria , Greece , the Balkans , countries in Eastern Europe , and the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in China .
In other words , the new channel plans to broadcast in just about every area in Europe and Asia where there are Turkish - or Turkic - speaking people .
Plus : TRT 's new channel will have programs in Azerbaijan Turkish , Kazakh , Kyrgyz , Uzbek and Turmen , with subtitles in Turkish ... in the new channel will be programs on culture , health , documentaries and music , and teaching Turkish .
So once again we have standard Turkish being used as a kind of lingua franca for this channel .
TRT makes some pretty good material for learning Turkish like one podcast they used to have called Türkçe Öğreniyorum ( " I'm learning Turkish " ) that was created for those working on their Turkish , specifically for Turks or Turkic - speaking peoples abroad .
I 've transcribed a few of these , like this one for example : TRT also has an article and video on the new channel here

Advertisement The Metropolitan Police said video footage on YouTube which appears to show an officer hitting a woman during the G20 protests would be examined .
The footage shows the woman swearing at a police officer who then appears to hit her in the face on 1 April .
The officer also apparently strikes the woman on the leg with his baton .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission said it would look into the new footage of the London protests that has been referred to it by the Met .
The apparent actions of this officer raise immediate concerns
Metropolitan Police spokesman
The latest video comes after the IPCC began an independent inquiry into the death of 47 - year - old Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protests .
Mr Tomlinson died after suffering a heart attack .
Witness footage apparently showed Mr Tomlinson was pushed over by a police officer shortly before his death .
A statement from the Met on the new video said : " The apparent actions of this officer raise immediate concerns .
" Once we were notified of this footage by a media agency this afternoon we began to take steps to identify this officer and are currently in the process of referring the incident to the IPCC .
" Every officer is accountable under law , and fully aware of the scrutiny that their actions can be held open to .
" The decision to use force is made by the individual police officer , and they must account for that . "
It is very difficult to understand what justifies a gargantuan police officer assaulting a smaller woman for having the audacity to complain
Shami Chakrabarti , Liberty
The IPCC said : " The IPCC has been made aware that the Metropolitan Police Service will be referring an incident to us following footage which has come to light this afternoon .
" As soon as we get the referral we will look into it and decide the best way to progress an investigation into the actions of the officer involved . "
It also added that it received " a number of complaints from members of the public about the actions of police officers at the G20 protests " .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of human rights group Liberty , said : " It is very difficult to understand what justifies a gargantuan police officer assaulting a smaller woman for having the audacity to complain . "
She added : " It is no doubt a pressure cooker environment , however highly - trained professionals are supposed to be better at diffusing the situation . "
Ian Tomlinson lived and worked in the City of London Labour MP David Winnick called on Home Secretary Jacqui Smith to make a statement on the way " the G20 demonstration was policed " following the footage which he described as " outright police brutality " .
The Walsall North MP , who sits on the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee , said : " Not only the unfortunate death that occurred , but what I consider to be outright police brutality which in my view can in no way be justified . "
Footage taken by a New York fund manager which emerged last week showed Mr Tomlinson being apparently pushed to the ground by an officer .
Days later more video footage aired on Channel 4 appears to show the newspaper vendor being struck by an officer with a baton .
Soon after the police officer seen in the video came forward and was suspended by the Met .
The IPCC has also ordered a second post - mortem examination and officers are currently viewing all CCTV images from the City of London and private premises nearby , the watchdog said .

I suppose then , that it would be perfectly peachy with you if a person who was not interested in you " kicked " your " ass " after you made an unwanted advance towards them ??
Honestly darling , you should be flattered regardless of who it is that finds you interesting .
There is no need for violence .
It might be more useful to you and everyone if all people could just take a little peek deep inside and why it is that something as innocent as a " come - on " would cause one to be so angered that they felt the uncontrollable need to " kick ass " .
In all of my years of research I have found that , indeed , those who protest the most , want it the most .

The men deny charges of genocide and crimes against humanity Four men have won a High Court battle to halt extradition to Rwanda where they face mass murder charges .
Senior judges ruled that there was " a real risk " they would suffer " a flagrant denial of justice " .
All four are wanted in connection with the 1994 genocide in which 800,000 people were killed in 100 days .
The men deny involvement in the genocide and say they would not receive a fair trial if they were forced to return to Rwanda .
Anti-genocide campaigners condemned the court 's decision , saying that it sent a message to the Rwandan people that the suspected killers of their families could " walk free with impunity " .
The court ordered the four men , who have been held in custody since December 2006 , be released .
They are : Dr Vincent Bajinya , from north London ; Charles Munyaneza , from Bedford ; Celestin Ugirashebuja from Essex ; and Emmanuel Nteziryayo , of Manchester .
This decision demonstrates to the Rwandan people that the suspected killers of their families can walk free with impunity
Dr James Smith of the Aegis Trust
The men are accused of killing , or conspiring with or aiding and abetting others , to kill members of the Tutsi ethnic group " with the intent to destroy in whole , or in part , that group " .
Mr Munyaneza , Mr Ugirashebuja and Mr Nteziryayo were said to be mayors of local communes who allegedly organised killings in their areas while Dr Bajinya was allegedly a militia organiser in Kigali .
At an extradition hearing in 2007 , a court heard allegations that Dr Bajinya , who changed his name to Vincent Brown when he became a British citizen , had been part of the " inner circle " of then Rwandan president Juvenal Habyarimana .

After the president died in a plane crash in 1994 Dr Bajinya - a former member of the Rwandan governing MRND party - was claimed to have attended key " genocide meetings " where plans to murder hundreds of thousands of Tutsis were planned .
The court was told Dr Bajinya then went on to become a leader in the Interahamwe militia , which was to spearhead the slaughter .
Court papers alleged he ordered the militia to cut a suspected Tutsi " into pieces so that he would not recover " .
Dr Bajinya is also accused of personally interrogating a Tutsi woman about where her fellow " inyenzi " - or cockroaches - were before a militia man shot her dead .
Appeal refused Lord Justice Laws and Lord Justice Sullivan , sitting at London 's High Court , allowed the appeals by Dr Bajinya and his three co-defendants against the extradition ruling by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith because , the judges said , there was evidence that defence witnesses in Rwanda were afraid to give evidence in the men 's favour .
The judges added : " We conclude that if ( the four ) were extradited to face trial in the High Court of Rwanda , the appellants would suffer a real risk of a flagrant denial of justice by reason of their likely inability to adduce the evidence of supporting witnesses . "
The judges also ruled there was a real risk " of executive ( government ) interference with the judiciary " in Rwanda .
They refused the Rwandan government , represented by the Crown Prosecution Service , permission to appeal to the House of Lords against their ruling .
The judges ' decision is thought to be the first time an English court has ever blocked an extradition request from a foreign government on the grounds that it would violate Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights , which safeguards the right to a fair trial .
Lord Justice
Laws described it as " an important and anxious case " .
Lord Gifford QC , who had appeared for Mr Munyaneza , said the case had revealed " an emerging international consensus that there is no fair trial in Rwanda " .
' Legal loophole '
However there was criticism that a legal loophole had allowed four suspected mass murderers to walk free .
Dr James Smith of the Aegis Trust , which campaigns against genocide told the BBC that the UK government should change the law to allow British courts to prosecute crimes against humanity .
He said : " If the High Court is unable to allow extradition because the legal system in other countries does not meet its high standards , then the government should revise and amend legislation to allow proceedings in this country .
" As it stands this decision demonstrates to the Rwandan people that the suspected killers of their families can walk free with impunity in Europe . "
An estimated 800,000 Rwandans were murdered in about three months .
Frank Brazell , a solicitor representing Vincent Brown aka Dr Bajinya , welcomed the judges ' ruling , saying : " We are hugely pleased with the result .
" The central issue they have found is that there is clearly no prospect of these men having a fair trial in Rwanda .
" The primary reason is the likelihood of political interference affecting the approach taken by the judges of Rwanda to a case of this kind .
" Obviously this is linked to interference with witnesses and the inability to call defence witnesses because of government or judicial interference . "
He said Mr Brown , a British national and qualified doctor who had worked for a charity training nurses , would soon be released from custody .
He has been held since 28 December 2006 .
Asked if Mr Brown would now seek compensation , Mr Brazell said the issue would be discussed in due course .

US President Barack Obama has said the Senate 's delay in passing his $ 900bn ( £ 616 bn ) economic stimulus package is " inexcusable and irresponsible " .
He described the economic situation as " an urgent and growing crisis " , which could become " a catastrophe " if the Senate failed to act .
The bill includes measures to cut taxes and invest in job creation .
Some Senate Democrats are now reported to be ready to compromise and back a plan worth only $ 780 bn .
Dick Durbin of Illinois , the second most senior Democrat in the Senate , said they were " moving toward agreement " , Reuters news agency reported .
Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio came out of a meeting of Senate Democrats saying " we 've got a deal " .
The deal could pave the way for the plan to pass in a vote later on Friday , Democrat sources say .
President Obama is desperate to pass the package , the BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington says .
This is his first big legislative initiative since he took office , and it has hit some very rough water , our correspondent says .
' Echo chamber ' Mr Obama described as " devastating " the news that nearly 600,000 Americans lost their jobs in January .
" The situation could not be more serious .
These numbers demand action , " he said .
Mr Obama 's remarks came as he unveiled a new board of economic advisers , chaired by Paul Volcker , former chairman of the Federal Reserve .
" I created this board to enlist voices that come from beyond the echo chamber of Washington DC , " said Mr Obama , " and to ensure that no stone is unturned as we work to put people back to work and to get our economy moving . "
SENATE BILL : KEY POINTS
Tax cuts for working families : $ 247bn Job - creating investments in infrastructure and science : $ 165 bn Job - creating investments in health : $ 153 bn Job - creating investments in education and training : $ 138bn Job - creating investments for an energy independent America : $ 82 bn Job - creating investments tax cuts for small businesses : $ 21 bn Helping Americans hit hard by the economic crisis : $ 72bn Source : Senate Appropriations Committee
Q&A : Stimulus plan
The Senate is likely to vote on the stimulus bill later on Friday , according to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
Moderate senators from both parties have been holding talks behind closed doors in an effort to find common ground on the package .
Senate leaders are desperate to get the package passed , but it is not clear whether they have the 60 votes they need , our correspondent says .
About one - third of the bill is currently composed of tax relief , with the rest devoted to spending on infrastructure projects , like roads and bridges , new schools and alternative energy programmes .
Republicans and some centrist Democrats are keen to reduce the number of spending commitments in the bill , and without their support the bill may not have enough votes to pass in the Senate .
The House of Representatives approved its version of the package last week , worth $ 825bn , without any Republican support .
If the Senate gives its approval to the bill , the two different versions will then have to be reconciled in a joint House - Senate committee before facing a final vote .
President Obama has said he wants the passage of the bill to be completed by 16 February .

One of the major players in last decade 's arguments over anthropogenic climate change and its policy implications was the Global Climate Coalition , which received funding from both individual companies and industry groups .
Now , documents from that era have come to light thanks to the involvement of one of the GCC members , the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers , in a suit that has attempted to block California 's efforts to regulate automotive greenhouse gas emissions .
During discovery for the suit , a memo came to light in which the GCC 's scientific advisors suggested that certain aspects of climate science simply were n't controversial ; that memo was leaked to The New York Times , which has placed it online .
The documents include a few introductory memos , followed by a primer on climate science prepared by the GCC 's in - house scientific advisory committee .
The goal of the primer appears to be to bring everyone who would be speaking on the issue up to speed on the state of climate science ; it apparently dates from late 1995 , about the time when the IPCC published its second assessment of climate science .
It appears to have been prepared by members of the industries represented by the GCC ; the accompanying article in The Times indicates that the advisory committee was chaired by someone at Mobile , while two of the people listed as commenting on it appear to have worked for an oil company and an electric utility group .
Not surprisingly , the group was n't entirely sold on the concept of anthropogenic climate change .
At the time , given the state of scientific knowledge , the IPCC 's analysis was far more tenuous than it is currently , and the GCC 's advisors did n't even buy that .
The primer quotes the IPCC as concluding " the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate , " but the GCC advisors suggest that this statement , " goes beyond what can be justified by current scientific knowledge . "
The report reserves its most striking language for attempts to deny the eventual impact of continuing greenhouse gas emissions .
Part of the problem , in the view of the primer 's authors , is that computerized climate models were n't yet sophisticated enough to separate anthropogenic causes from natural variability .
At the time , they felt , scientists lacked sufficient raw data to build good models , and lacked the computing power to run them .
Nevertheless , the authors recognized that " improvements in both are likely , and in the next decade it may be possible to make fairly accurate statements . "
From there on out , however , things do n't exactly toe the GCC 's party line .
There are two striking things about the remainder of the primer : one is how little the arguments have changed in the past decade and a half , and the second is how badly off the GCC 's message is compared to that advocated by its own scientific advisors .
The primer dismisses a wide series of arguments that are still widely in use today .
" The scientific basis for the greenhouse effect and the potential impact of human emissions of greenhouse gasses such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied , " it concludes , noting elsewhere that the basics of this , " can be demonstrated in a laboratory . "
Although there are some uncertainties about individual temperature records , the authors conclude that global average temperatures have risen over the last century .
They also leave no room for doubt regarding the trajectory of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels or its cause : " human activities have raised the concentrations of CO 2 by more than 25 percent . "
Several pages of the primer are also spent on what it calls " contrarian " theories , such as solar variability and ideas promoted by Richard Lindzen .
Although these are considered interesting , the GCC 's advisors conclude that none of them are actually consistent with the available data , and " they do not offer convincing arguments against the conventional model of grenehouse gas emission - induced climate change . "
Apparently , this section was deleted from the final memo , although nobody that The Times could find was willing to identify who did so or why .
The report reserves its most striking language for attempts to deny the eventual impact of continuing greenhouse gas emissions .
" The potential for a human impact on climate is based on well - established scientific fact , " the primer reads , " and should not be denied . "
Elsewhere it states , " neither solar variability nor anomalies in the temperature record offer a mechanism for offsetting the much larger rise in temperature which might occur if the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse sases were to double or quadurple . "
The fact that the GCC was out of touch with the science became ever more obvious as time went on ; by 2000 , many of its most significant industry backers had abandoned ship ; shortly afterwards , the group shut down , leaving its site preserved in the web archive .
It 's tempting to make comparisons to the cigarette lobby — indeed , the comparisons are made in The Times , but the issue is probably more subtle than that .
The GCC 's advisors were pointing out that some areas of climate science were actually quite certain , while others remained open to scientifically valid skepticism ; the GCC ignored its science advisors only in that it treated everything as equally uncertain .

Have you ever wanted to know what you program was doing 5 minutes ago ?
Ever wondered exactly what files it was opening instead of the one you wanted it to ?
Well Visual Studio 2010 has got you covered .
During the Lang.NET keynote ( 10 minute mark ) , Microsoft demonstrated Visual Studio 2010 ’s diagnostic events and historical debugging features .
These features allow developers to not only see the application as it currently stands , but also the events that led up to that condition .
The diagnostic events window shows key events in an application ’s run .
These include exceptions , file access , and debugger events .
In some ways these could have been hand - rolled using Debug .
Write statements or macros on breakpoints .
But with an integrated list view , this allows you to filter on the type of event or the thread the event occurred on .
While a good feature on its own , this is dwarfed by the historical debugging capabilities .
When turned on , Visual Studio can capture stack frames and the variables associated with them .
This allows developers to back - step through the program to find out why something happened the way it did .
In order to save this information , the state of the application is stored on disk .
By default it only stores key types , but developers can set it to record literally every parameter , object , and global variable .
The only thing it will not store is local variables .
For more information , also see the video discussing historical debugging on Channel 9 .
This feature should be included in the upcoming beta 1 release .
Problems with faulty Nvidia graphics chips that caused large numbers of notebook computers to fail last year may not be over yet – at least for some .
Some HP users are complaining that their laptops , which were not included in the company 's official list of affected machines , are facing problems similar to what other users experienced last year .
" When I boot up my laptop , it says there 's no driver and I can't install one .
That means my machine locks up and shuts down , " says Dana Hight , a HP notebook user who runs a web development company .
" It is clearly related to what happened with Nvidia chips last year . "
Hight has bought his laptop about a year and half ago .
But he , along with other users in one of HP 's online support forums , say the company wo n't recognize his laptop model as one of the versions affected by the faulty Nvidia chips .
Hight has the DV9549US model .
HP did not respond to a request for comment about the complaints .
Last year many consumers saw notebooks and desktops PCs that refused to boot up , did not detect wireless networks or offer any video on the monitor .
HP acknowledged problems with about 38 desktops and 14 notebook models .
In October , 2008 , HP issued BIOS fixes and a limited extended warranty for these machines .
Nvidia has said a problem with the packaging material for some of its chipsets led to the high failure rates .
Dell and Apple also reported problems with Nvidia chips in 2008 .
But Hight and other users in HP 's forums complain that their notebook models from the dv95xx series are facing similar issues .
" About two months ago I started noticing flickering and the system locking up , shutting down and rebooting , " says Hight .
" It started getting worse but HP told me their technicians are not aware of anything with my chipset . "
Hight , who had bought extended warranty with the now bankrupt Circuit City says he has two options : to pay up to $ 400 to get a new motherboard , but with the same chipset from Nvidia ; or buy a new machine that will cost hundreds of dollars .
A quick look through a thread on one of HP 's online support forums reveals similar complaints .
HP technicians , say the users online , will not acknowledge their problems as being related to the bad Nvidia chips .
HP has not responded to Wired.com 's request for comment .
Hight says HP should step up and replace the faulty laptops instead of offering piecemeal fixes .
" I would expect HP to give us a solution , " says Hight .
" Why should users who paid $ 800 to get a HP laptop have to pay now because they got a bad machine ? "

I 'm glad that Twitter is working to resolve its scaling issues .
It 's a service that I love and use on a daily basis and from which I have benefitted immensely .
As far as I 'm concerned , Twitter is a case - study in how Ruby on Rails does scale , even in their hands .
Also , I know Alex Payne in person .
Not very well , but enough that if I was in San Francisco and sat down to share a beer and discuss the Ruby / Scala debate , I imagine that it would be a fairly civil conversation .
My interest in the question of Ruby vs. Scala at Twitter had mostly consisted of curiosity and amusement , at least until last night .
First I had an exchange of tweets with Alex which raised my warning levels , and second Alex wasted no time in creating for himself a virtual nintendo invincibility star for himself with this blog post : Mending The Bitter Absence of Reasoned Technical Discussion .
Who can disagree with the need for more reasoned technical discussion ?
Nobody , but frankly the timing of his essay made me throw up a little in my mouth .
The nausea only grew this morning when I checked on how much it 's being re-tweeted .
Even though Alex 's star is probably going to take a little while to wear off , here are some of the facts of this " debate " for your consideration and historical record :
First of all , my exchange with Alex last night , which I triggered by re-tweeting Jeremy McAnally :
RT @jm :
If you have to use kind_of ?
all over your code to mimick a " type system , " you 're doing it wrong .
( I had exactly the same thought !!!)
To which Alex responded :
@obie Indeed , using kind_of ?
in that way is " doing it wrong " in Ruby .
But as our codebase grew , it became a necessity to combat bugs .
Hmm ... A " necessity to combat bugs " .
What bugs , exactly ?
Bugs in Ruby or bugs in Twitter 's codebase ?
Non-deterministic bugs ?
At this point I was n't angry or anything , just curious and a little bit suspicious .
So I asked :
@al3 x Does n't make sense .
Do you mean non-deterministic bugs ?
An in - depth explanation of the bugs you 're talking about would be enlightening
To which Alex quickly replied :
@obie
Yes , I mean non-deterministic bugs in the giant , legacy , spaghetti parts of our system .
Unexpected objects flying around .
Ah , suspicions confirmed .
Alex is indeed scapegoating Ruby for Twitter 's shitty legacy codebase and the mistakes that they made during what is unarguably a very steep growth curve that would have challenged even the most brilliant team of developers .
But do n't take my word for it , here are some direct quotes from Alex himself in the recent Artima interview :
Twitter continues today to be primarily a Rails application , with a bunch of Ruby daemons doing asynchronous processing on the backend .
Over time we found that although Rails works great for doing front - end web development , for doing heavy weight back - end processing , Rails had some performance limitations at runtime .
And I think that — and this is more my personal opinion — the Ruby language lacks some things that contribute to reliable , high performance code , which is something we ’re very interested in as we ’re growing as a business .
We want the code we write to be correct and maintainable .
We want to keep our costs down — all the things most businesses want out of their stack .
So that ’s why we started looking at Scala .
Most damning :
I ’d definitely want to hammer home what Steve said about typing .
As our system has grown , a lot of the logic in our Ruby system sort of replicates a type system , either in our unit tests or as validations on models .
I think it may just be a property of large systems in dynamic languages , that eventually you end up rewriting your own type system , and you sort of do it badly .
You ’re checking for null values all over the place .
There ’s lots of calls to Ruby ’s kind_of ?
method , which asks , “ Is this a kind of User object ?
Because that ’s what we ’re expecting .
If we do n’t get that , this is going to explode . ”
It is a shame to have to write all that when there is a solution that has existed in the world of programming languages for decades now .
Adding fuel to the fire , Alex seems to have created quite a negative impression about Ruby and Rails with his recent Web 2.0 talk in which he advocated usage of Scala .
Tell me the impression you get from coverage of his talk in articles such as this one in MIT 's Technology Review , which makes the following incendiary assertions :
The company is leaving behind a programming language that has caused it much pain in the past , and instead embracing a new and somewhat obscure language called Scala .
[...]
Right now Twitter 's service is a hybrid of programming languages , Payne says .
The user interface runs on Ruby on Rails , which is " fine for people clicking around Web pages , " he says .
But by the end of the year , Twitter hopes to have a set of services in the back end that are written entirely in Scala .
And it 's the company 's plan to make sure that all the third - party services that connect to Twitter via the application programming interface ( API ) go through Scala code , bypassing Ruby on Rails completely .
" When you 're talking about a bunch of programs hitting the API rapidly , " Payne says , " We found we can better optimize things ... using Scala . "
Did you actually say " fine for people clicking around Web pages " , Alex ?
Maybe that Technology Review article is just sloppy journalism , a subject that Alex himself lamented not too long ago .
But I do n't think that 's the case .
I think that Alex is slyly pushing his Scala agenda forward , yet acting surprised when Ruby folks call him out for it .
What agenda ?
His agenda as an advocate of Scala and author O'Reilly 's Programming Scala book .
He said so himself in Recession Engineering :
I ’m first to admit that I have something of an agenda with this prediction .
I spend a fair bit of my time working with and writing about the Scala programming language , which provides the expressiveness and flexibility of dynamic and functional languages like Ruby , Python , and Lisp with the performance of C++ or Java .
- Alex Payne
Have I been guilty of this stuff in my own past as a Rails advocate with a strong agenda ?
Yeah , probably so .
Which is why I know it when I see it . :)
Until last week , the world had not heard from Bernard Madoff since before his arrest , on December 11th , or seen much of him .
The footage of the appearance he made the week after his arrest has been replayed on TV many times ; he ’s seen returning to his apartment , on East Sixty - fourth Street , after a trip to the federal courthouse , in lower Manhattan .
He has on a black baseball cap and is wearing an enigmatic smile — a damnable smile , as it seemed to have meaning , and therefore put us in the decadent position of trying to figure out what that might be , when ultimately whatever it meant was beside the point .
The facts of the case had more than enough meaning .
Last week , Madoff made another trip to the courthouse , where his fate would be decided — or , rather , formalized , as he had already decided his own fate , by stealing billions of dollars from his investment clients .
On Thursday , he pleaded guilty to the eleven felony counts against him , and Judge Denny Chin ruled that he be remanded .
In other words , jail , not bail .
The proceeding was scheduled for 10 A.M. , and anyone could attend .
It was in many ways a normal day , albeit with a little more electricity in the air and more guards in the lobby .
They were on high alert , but were also chatty ; when a woman set off the metal detector , a guard told her to take off her shoes .
“ Shoe violation , ” he said .
“ Shoe violation ? ” she said back .
The guard then sang the words “ shoe violation ” to the melody of “ She Works Hard for the Money . ”
The elevator going up to the twenty - fourth floor , where the hearing was held , was , as courthouse elevators usually are , redolent of breakfast pastries and the acrid smell of hot coffee meeting paper cup .
But the courtroom was already full , and the overflow crowd had been sent down to a capacious jury room on the ground floor .
The not very large screen that had been set up there and the blurry black - and - white picture on it were state - of - the - art for elementary schools in 1958 , but they were sufficient to give good views of Madoff and his lawyer , Ira Lee Sorkin , and their team , sitting in a row at a long table .
Judge Chin went through a series of questions designed to establish definitively that Madoff knew what he was doing in pleading guilty , and Madoff answered succinctly : Yes .
No .
Yes , I am .
Yes , I have .
Yes , Your Honor .
No , it has not .
I do .
The maximum penalties for the charges were read ; the two exquisitely unnecessary penalties were as satisfying to hear as the ones that involved fines and prison terms : each charge carried “ a maximum term of supervised release of three years ” and “ a mandatory special assessment of a hundred dollars . ”
Judge Chin , in a neutral tone , at last said , “ Mr. Madoff , would you tell me what you did , please . ”
Madoff , also speaking in a neutral tone , read aloud from a prepared statement , whose words were purportedly his own , detailing his crimes , and how he achieved them and concealed them for so long .
Yet in this very statement , designed to clear the air , was language that betrayed even more lies , deceit , and pathological self - righteousness .
You should have been there .
Madoff ’s opening lines were perhaps the richest , his second sentence alone speaking volumes : “ I am actually grateful for this opportunity to publicly speak about my crimes , for which I am so deeply sorry and ashamed . ”
Listeners did n’t need to know that he was grateful , and we certainly did n’t need him to underscore his gratitude with the word “ actually , ” a semantic fillip that asked us to care how he felt about how he felt .
As for his being “ so ” deeply sorry and ashamed , it ’s possible that we might have believed him a little bit if he had left out that sweet - talking , disingenuous “ so . ”
“ Deeply sorry and ashamed ” : he did n’t bother to separate “ sorry ” and “ ashamed ” into separate sentences and make them each stand alone and naked for a second , but delivered them as a singsong cliché .
Two sentences later , Madoff said , “ When I began the Ponzi scheme , I believed it would end shortly and I would be able to extricate myself and my clients from the scheme . ”
As he read this , he betrayed no sense of how absurd it was to use the passive voice in regard to his scheme , as if it were a spell of bad weather that had descended on him .
Still , he had faith — he “ believed ” !— that it would soon be over .
Yes , “ soon . ”
In most of the rest of the statement , one not only heard the aggrieved passive voice but felt the hand of a lawyer : “ To the best of my recollection , my fraud began in the early nineteen - nineties . ”
One might have expected that the most dramatic moments would be Madoff ’s pleading guilty , eleven times in a row , to the charges against him , or hearing his victims speak .
Only four victims spoke , and fairly briefly .
One of them had hoped for a trial so that “ we have more of a chance to comprehend the global scope of this horrendous crime . ”
One wanted more “ information as to where the money is and to find out who else may be involved in this crime . ”
Another — improperly — addressed Madoff himself , and wondered whether he ’d turned around to look at his victims in the courtroom .
But it was Sorkin who set the stage for the day ’s biggest moment , with a sometimes grotesque spiel , in which he referred to “ people who claim they lost money , ” and at one point , after having just referred to Ruth Madoff ’s “ properties in Montauk , in New York , and Palm Beach , ” started a sentence with the words “ At his wife ’s own expense . ”
No one knew how the sentence was going to go on from there , because Sorkin was halted by sounds from the courtroom — a burst of dark laughter in response to his special pleading , even though special pleading is his job .
As soon as Sorkin finished asking that Madoff ’s bail be continued , Chin said curtly , “ I do n’t need to hear from the government .
It is my intention to remand Mr. Madoff . ”
Immediate applause , quickly tamped down by the Judge .
Moments later , two court officers approached Madoff , who stood silently and still , and then he moved his arms a little so that his hands were behind his back .
And then there was a click . ♦

It ’s not often that I sing the praises of unsafe - at - any - speed Ralph Nader , but his recent legal victory is worthy of such praises .
“ LOS ANGELES , March 9 / PRNewswire / —
In a significant move for open - election laws , the U.S. Supreme Court today rejected an attempt to overturn a federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ’ decision that the state of Arizona could not require independent presidential candidates to register earlier than candidates affiliated with major political parties .
Arizona ’s petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court had been closely watched after 13 other states supported Arizona ’s bid to have the High Court hear the case .
The federal civil rights case , originally filed in Arizona federal district court , stems from Nader ’s 2004 presidency bid .
Ralph Nader had challenged the deadline , contending it violated his First Amendment rights to free speech and political association .
Lead Attorney Robert Barnes of the Bernhoft Law Firm represented Nader before the Ninth Circuit , which overturned the district court and unanimously declared the Arizona law unconstitutional .
Nader ’s Bernhoft Law legal team successfully argued that requiring independent candidates to register by June was unfair when the two major political parties did not hold their conventions until the fall .

David Swanson reported last night that the AG " made [ him ] a promise " :
As Attorney General Eric
Holder left an appropriations subcommittee hearing on Thursday I spoke loudly from the third row as he prepared to leave the room :
" We need a special prosecutor for torture , Mr. Attorney General .
Americans like the rule of law .
The rule of law for everybody . "
He replied as he approached and walked by , surrounded by bodyguards :
" And you will be proud of your country . "
I was joined by others in replying simultaneously :
" Yes , we want to be proud of our country .
We 're ready .
No need to wait . "
Holder knew exactly what it would take for me to be proud of my country , and he told me directly that I would be .
Will I ? Time will tell .

Moist , delicious , garlicky chicken .
Life is good , and just got a teeny bit better .
What a wonderful recipe packed with roasted garlic goodness .
This is a reader recipe sent in by Veronica .
Thank you so much , Veronica ----- this is a fantastic recipe .
She usually uses about 20 cloves of garlic , and I tried to go up to 40 cloves , but ended up only having 33 in the house to use .
I used two packages of drumsticks for the chicken , but you could easily throw a whole bird in or use 3 - 4 pounds of your favorite chicken parts .
The Ingredients .
serves 6
3 - 4 pounds chicken
1 large onion ( or 2 bitties , like I used ) , sliced
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons kosher salt
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon pepper
20 - 40 garlic cloves
, peeled , but intact
The Directions .
I used a 6 quart oval slow cooker .
Place onion slices on the bottom of the stoneware insert .
In a large mixing bowl , toss chicken parts with olive oil , salt , paprika , pepper , and all of the garlic cloves .
Pour into slow cooker , on top of the onion .
Do not add water .
Cover and cook on low for 6 - 8 hours , or on high for 4 - 6 .
The longer you cook chicken - on - the - bone , the more tender it will be .
If you use drumsticks , the ones on the side will brown and may stick to the sides of the crock , burning a bit .
If this bothers you , you can rearrange them with tongs an hour before serving .
I cooked our chicken on low for 7 hours , then kept it on warm for another 2 .
Veronica serves her chicken with a salad , mashed potatoes , corn , and green beans .
I served it with quinoa and asparagus .
The Verdict .
This is wonderful !
The onion and garlic had a mild , nutty garlic flavor that was a bit sweet .
Some of the larger cloves of garlic that were still intact were kind of strong --- they itched my nose .
The kids ate the chicken ( no onions or garlic for them ) dipped in bbq sauce .
Adam and I each ate 3 drumsticks that night , and I used the leftovers to make some
last night .
Thank you so much , Veronica !

Shrek fans will eat their heart out , knowing that someone has taken their dream , idea and the beautiful Fiona and decided to have a Wedding theme of the popular animated film .
While many may dream of amazing Wedding themes , only few actually go out and do it .
This couple though really hit it right , both reenacting the Shrek film and also looking really similar to the crude characters .
I am sure some producer would love to make a documentary of the film , a Shrek reality series , or even bringing Shrek away from animation .
Either or , I think this fairltale couple really delivers the goods .
I must say that I am green with envy and would wish I had the courage to carry on such a feat .
It seems more than just for looks but a whole lot of fun .
Check out the gallery for great images of the lovely Shrek and Fiona .

Easter eggs are specially decorated eggs given to celebrate the Easter holiday .
The egg was a symbol of the rebirth of the earth in Pagan celebrations of spring and was adopted by early Christians as a symbol of the rebirth .
In celebrating the Easter Holiday , I decided to compile some of the good looking design of Easter Eggs on the web for inspiration .
Have you already design your Easter Eggs ?
Make sure to check this out first to have more ideas on your design .
MSNBC ran a countdown clock in preparation for the big event last Tuesday night .
CNN ’s run-up thrummed with portent , while a skeptical Fox News joined in the fervent speculation .
So what had the cable news stations in overdrive ?
A fairly routine , some might say boring , presidential news conference that did not make news .
That did n’t stop squad after squad of panelists from weighing in on CNN  tearing apart President Obama ’s mien and message down to the last blink and nod .
A huge electronic display showed a “ word cloud ”  words in a size that indicated their frequency of use .
( Gee , I liked it better when John King used a digital maps to annotate and caress delegate totals . )
And before it even started taking apart the content , Fox pointed out that the president had used  gasp  a teleprompter .
There is no question that the stakes are high in this presidency , and it ’s hardly an epiphany that in order to feed the 24/7 beast , cable news has to turn every little thing into a big event .
But something else is at work here .
Gorged on ratings from a historic election and still riding on leftover adrenaline , the cable networks have steadfastly remained in campaign mode .
And the hyperbolic rhythms and requirements of a cable news world have never seemed less relevant to the story at hand .
Felonious Derivatives
Village Voice
Credit derivatives also figure heavily in the plot .
Apologists say that these became so complicated that even Wall Street could n't understand them and that they created " an unacceptable level of risk . "
Then these blowhards tell us that the bailout will pump hundreds of billions of dollars into the credit arteries and save the patient , which is the world 's financial system .
It will take time — maybe a year or so — but if everyone hangs in there , we 'll be all right .
No structural damage has been done , and all 's well that ends well .
Sorry , but that 's drivel .
In fact , what we are living through is the worst financial scandal in history .
It dwarfs 1929 , Ponzi 's scheme , Teapot Dome , the South Sea Bubble , tulip bulbs , you name it .
Bernie Madoff ?
He 's peanuts .
Credit derivatives — those securities that few have ever seen — are one reason why this crisis is so different from 1929 .

I once used chopsticks like Papua New Guinea tribesman spear fish .
Then I developed a vice - like power technique that often ended with wet seafood catapulting across the table .
Both experiences left me with a strong dislike for chopsticks — seriously , why on earth would someone not use a fork ?
Then I spent a year abroad in Japan during 1992 and 1993 .
It was a revelation .
The 90 - second video above provides all the basics you need to become a chopstick pro and never drop food again .
Several finer points …
1 ) Never stick your chopsticks straight down into your rice as a place holder .
This is considered bad luck or even a harbinger of death , as bowls of rice with chopsticks sticking out of the center are used in some rites of ancestral worship .
2 ) Never attempt to pass food from chopstick to chopstick .
Bad mojo similar to # 2 , as this is how unburnt bones are moved to the urn at a cremation .
3 ) During your practice phase , consider turning the hand and using the chopsticks like a forklift ( about 1 - 1.5 ″ apart ) for larger pieces or wet seafood .
Bring your rice bowl closer to the serving dish with your free hand to cut down on distance and potential for splatter disaster .
Practice in the beginning on smaller fried items with no liquid beneath them .
4 ) The technique I explain is common in East Asia ( Japan , China , Korea ) , and there are alternate techniques in South East Asia ( Vietnam , for example , where this video was taken ) .
The latter tend to use heavier and longer chopsticks , which are held closer together and even scissored .
5 ) For those who like fun OCD - like behaviors , getting good as using chopsticks will also improve your pen tricks ( demonstrated below ) .

There is a young man , different from other young men .
Ancient prophecies foretell his coming , and he performs miraculous feats .
Eventually , confronted by his enemies , he must sacrifice his own life — an act that saves mankind from calamity — but in a mystery as great as that of his origin , he is reborn , to preside in glory over a world redeemed .
Tell this story to one of the world ’s 2 billion Christians , and he ’ll recognize it instantly .
Tell it to a science - fiction and fantasy fan , and he ’ll ask why you ’re making minor alterations to the plot of The Matrix or Superman Returns .
For reasons that have as much to do with global politics as with our cultural moment , some of this generation ’s most successful sci-fi and fantasy movie franchises follow an essentially Christian plotline .
Hallelujah ! ” cries a minor character early in The Matrix , the 1999 cyberpunk flick , directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski , that took the nation by storm and , together with its two sequels , raked in about $ 600 million domestically .
“ You ’re my savior , man , my own personal Jesus Christ . ”
The character is addressing Thomas Anderson , a restless computer hacker , played by Keanu Reeves , who goes by the handle “ Neo ” and has sold him some precious illegal software .
It ’s just one of the movie ’s many references to its central inspiration .
Neo , we learn eventually , is in fact a nearly divine savior , the Jesus Christ of the bizarre world in which he lives .
Anderson does n’t realize it yet , however .
First , a mysterious man named Morpheus must contact him , conveying a shocking truth : the universe is n’t real but is actually a “ Matrix ” — a “ neural interactive simulation , ” a “ computer - generated dreamworld ” — and the year is n’t 1999 but something like 2199 .
Early in the twenty - first century , Morpheus explains , human beings and intelligent machines went to war against one another .
The machines , seeking a constant source of bioelectrical energy , started to breed people and use them as human generators , keeping them in little cells but convincing them , through illusion - conveying cables attached to their brains , that they still lived in an ordinary world .
“ You are a slave , Neo , ” Morpheus says .
“ Like everyone else , you were born into bondage . ”
Yet escape from bondage is possible .
“ When the Matrix was first built , there was a man born inside who had the ability to change whatever he wanted , to remake the Matrix as he saw fit , ” Morpheus tells Neo .
“ It was he who freed the first of us , taught us the truth .
. . .
After he died , the Oracle prophesied his return — that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix , end the war , bring freedom to our people . ”
Is Neo this reincarnated savior — the “ One ” whom Morpheus and his fellow rebels await ?
We do n’t know until near the movie ’s end , when a comrade - in - arms betrays Neo and Morpheus .
Neo chooses to save Morpheus ’s life by surrendering his own .
The machines kill him — but then he mysteriously returns to life and obliterates his enemies , to the grand accompaniment of trumpets and a choir .
He is indeed the One .
It takes no great perception to recognize how closely this plot tracks the basic Christian narrative , though it conflates the Passion with the End Days , adding the betrayal of a Judas to a messianic Second Coming .
Neo ’s very name is n’t just an anagram of “ One ” but also a prefix meaning “ new , ” a word with important Christian overtones : Jesus is a “ new man , ” we read in Ephesians 2:15 , who says that he brings a new testament .
Bryan Singer ’s underrated Superman Returns ( 2006 ) sought to answer an age - old question : Does humanity need gods ?
Lex Luthor , Superman ’s eternal nemesis , answers early on .
After Luthor compares himself to Prometheus , an accomplice retorts : “ Sounds great , Lex , but you ’re not a god . ”
“ Gods are selfish beings who fly around in little red capes and do n’t share their power with mankind , ” Luthor snarls .
He ’s in agreement with Lois Lane , who has won a Pulitzer for an op - ed titled “ Why the World Does n’t Need Superman . ”
Superman , you see , has just returned to Earth after a five - year absence spent searching for his lost homeworld , Krypton .
“ How could you leave us like that ? ” Lois demands .
“ I moved on ; so did the rest of us .
That ’s why I wrote it .
The world does n’t need a savior . ”
Is she right ?
In one scene , as Superman floats above the Earth , we hear his alien father in a voiceover .
Human beings “ can be a great people , ” Jor - El says .
“ They only lack the light to show the way .
For this reason above all — their capacity for good — I have sent them you , my only son . ”
The line , of course , echoes John 3:16 : “ For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son . ”
When Marlon Brando first spoke it in Superman ( 1978 ) , it was the earlier movie ’s only explicit Christian reference .
The recent installment not only resurrects the line ; it piles on further biblical allusions .
“ You wrote that the world does n’t need a savior , ” Superman himself tells Lois , “ but every day I hear people crying for one . ”
Isaiah 19:20 : “ When they cry to the Lord because of oppressors , he will send them a savior . ”
Later , as Superman tries to save the world from Luthor , the villain plunges a Kryptonite dagger into his side .
John 19:34 : “ One of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear . ”
And then , after saving the day by hurling Luthor ’s death machine — a rapidly expanding new continent that threatens to destroy the United States — into outer space , a poisoned and exhausted Superman plummets to earth , his arms outspread at right angles to his body and legs , a crucified figure lacking only a cross .
He remains in a coma until his son ( Lois Lane is the unwed mother in this updated Superman : do n’t ask ) restores him to life .
He leaves his hospital room empty until a nurse discovers it , just as Mary and Mary Magdalene find Jesus ’s empty tomb .
Superman ’s heroism thus answers the movie ’s fundamental question .
In one of the last scenes , we see Lois struggling to write a new essay : “ Why the World Needs Superman . ”
Perhaps the nation ’s recent superhero obsession , from the smash Spider - Man movies to The Dark Knight ( the biggest film of 2008 ) to the TV hit Heroes , owes more than we commonly recognize to religious impulses .
As Gabriel McKee writes in The Gospel According to Science Fiction , “ There are inherent messianic qualities in the . . . concept of the superhero — an individual with exceptional abilities who sacrifices part of his or her life for the greater good . ”
Both The Matrix and Superman Returns show the hero ’s discovery of his powers .
We see Neo learning martial arts almost instantaneously through the cable leading to his brain — a computer nerd ’s fantasy ; in a euphoric flashback , we watch the young Clark Kent finding out that he can fly .
No parallels to these episodes of joyful self - discovery exist in the New Testament .
But turn your attention from the canonical Bible to the Apocrypha — in particular , to the Gospel of Thomas , one of the so - called Infancy Gospels , stories of Jesus ’s childhood nearly 2,000 years old — and you ’ll find the child Jesus animating clay sparrows , restoring people to life , and even exacting revenge on his enemies .
“ He was again passing through the village , ” the text relates , “ and a boy ran up against Him , and struck His shoulder .
And Jesus was angry , and said to him :
You shall not go back the way you came .
And immediately he fell down dead . ”
If that last story sounds vaguely familiar , maybe you ’re one of the millions around the world who have read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer ’s Stone ( 1997 ) , the first installment in J. K.
Rowling ’s unprecedentedly successful seven - volume series of fantasy novels , the first five of which have been made into blockbuster movies .
Early on in The Sorcerer ’s Stone , before Harry discovers his magical powers , his loutish cousin Dudley punches him in the ribs during a visit to the zoo .
Unconsciously , an angry Harry makes the glass separating Dudley from a boa constrictor disappear .
We soon learn that Harry , like so many of today ’s fantasy heroes , is marked for greatness from infancy as the only person who can defeat a world - crushing evil .
The final book in the series , Harry Potter and the Interminable Sequels — no , wait , that ’s Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — has Harry ( you guessed it ) choosing to die to save the world and then returning to life , after a brief journey to an afterworld resembling ( note the place ) London ’s King ’s Cross railway station .
One reason that Disney finally made a movie out of C. S. Lewis ’s Christian allegory The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe in 2005 may be that popular fantasy has become increasingly religious at heart .
Peter Jackson ’s brilliant film adaptations of J. R. R. Tolkien ’s Lord of the Rings trilogy , on the other hand , probably do n’t fall into the category of messianic fantasy , despite a quick episode in which the wizard Gandalf experiences a sort of death and rebirth ; Tolkien ’s chief inspiration was political , not religious , and Jackson remains faithful to that intention .
The best illustration of the science - fiction and fantasy world ’s recent shift toward Christian themes , though , is the most successful sci - fi franchise in history .
George Lucas ’s Star Wars appeared in 1977 and instantly became a huge hit .
It told the story of Luke Skywalker , a gifted youth raised by his uncle and aunt on the planet Tatooine , who soon finds himself caught up in the struggle between a group of noble rebels and an “ evil Galactic Empire ” — in the words of the movie ’s famous opening scene , in which a few prefatory sentences of exposition crawl slowly into a distant field of stars .
An old man named Obi-Wan Kenobi , one of the last remaining members of the virtuous “ Jedi knights , ” takes Luke under his wing , but he must sacrifice himself to the Empire ’s dreaded Darth Vader to save the young man from capture .
In the end , Luke joins the rebels and helps win an important battle against the Empire .
To date , Star Wars has grossed nearly $ 461 million in the United States , making it the third - biggest film in American history .
It doubtless owes much of that success to mythologist Joseph Campbell , whose book The Hero with a Thousand Faces described certain features of the “ standard path of the mythological adventure of the hero . ”
The adventure ’s outline was simple : “ A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder : fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won : the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man . ”
Many myths shared even more than this , explained Campbell ; for example , “ the first encounter of the hero - journey is with a protective figure ( often a little old crone or an old man ) who provides the adventurer with amulets against the dragon forces he is about to pass . ”
Think of Arthur , Merlin , and Excalibur .
Such scholars as Otto Rank and Lord Raglan had earlier written comparative studies of hero - myths .
In 1936 , for instance , Raglan compiled a list of characteristics common to many mythological heroes : “ The hero ’s mother is a royal virgin ” ; “ the circumstances of his conception are unusual ” ; “ he is also reputed to be the son of a god ” ; and 19 others .
But it was Campbell ’s book that Lucas stumbled upon as he wrote his screenplay .
“ It ’s possible that if I had not run across him I would still be writing Star Wars today , ” Lucas acknowledged later .
Presumably , too , he would never have invented the “ protective figure ” Obi-Wan , who gives Luke a “ lightsaber ” not long after meeting him .
Scholars have noted the correspondence of parts of the Christian narrative to the hero - myths , and perhaps this affinity accounts for what little Christian imagery does show up in Star Wars .
“ If you strike me down , I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine , ” Obi-Wan warns Darth Vader .
But it ’s largely an empty boast : after his death , Obi-Wan does nothing more than appear as a sort of ghost from time to time .
The movie ’s main plot spends far more time on outer - space dogfights .
Two sequels swiftly followed : The Empire Strikes Back ( 1980 ) and The Return of the Jedi ( 1983 ) .
Both were entertaining , but neither drew on Christianity .
As the world knows to its sorrow , Lucas revived the franchise in 1999 with The Phantom Menace , the first movie in another Star Wars trilogy that chronicled events prior to those in the original three movies .
Episode I , as The Phantom Menace is also confusingly known , differed from the first Star Wars movie in many respects , among them a plot that no suspension of disbelief could render convincing and dialogue that sounded even more mechanical coming from the people than from the robots .
In one respect , however , The Phantom Menace consciously mirrored its predecessor , portraying a Jedi knight — Qui-Gon Jinn , played by Liam Neeson — who meets a talented Skywalker boy , this one named Anakin ( Jake Lloyd ) , on the Tatooine sands .
But where the original movie never deified Luke , The Phantom Menace describes Anakin — the future Darth Vader , Luke ’s father — in terms so messianic as to make Neo blush , repeatedly calling him “ the Chosen One . ”
The source of the term is in Luke — the Evangelist , that is — where Jewish leaders say of the soon - to - be- crucified Jesus : “ Let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God , his chosen one ! ”
The movie is fuzzy about who exactly has done the choosing , however — a failure doubtless rooted in Lucas ’s carelessness with plots .
The Phantom Menace proves equally vague when prophecy enters the story .
When Qui-Gon first intimates that Anakin may be the Chosen One , another Jedi knight says , “ You refer to the prophecy of the One who will bring balance to the Force , ” but we never learn who prophesied and when .
The prophecy echoes the Gospels ’ repeatedly stated thesis that certain passages in the Hebrew Bible foretell Jesus ’s coming .
“ The Force ” is one detail in which the new films are actually less spiritual than the old .
In the 1977 movie , Obi-Wan described this mysterious entity as “ what gives a Jedi his power .
It ’s an energy field created by all living things ; it surrounds us , penetrates us ; it binds the galaxy together . ”
In the 1980 sequel , Yoda — a character , created by Jim Henson , who looked suspiciously like Kermit the Frog and sounded suspiciously like Fozzie Bear — instructed Luke to “ feel the Force around you : here , between you , me , the tree , the rock , everywhere ! ”
Such language , smacking of the period ’s flirtation with natural mysticism , gave way in the new movies to an explanation more in keeping with our current fascination with molecular biology : the Force , we learned in The Phantom Menace , was actually the product of microorganisms in the blood .
It ’s as though Lucas , instinctively realizing the intellectual poverty of the New Age , gave it up , exchanged it for something resembling science , and then turned , elsewhere in the script , to a far older , more powerful story .
That story , though , he inverted .
Anakin will be not the world ’s savior but its destroyer , more Antichrist than Christ .
He will slaughter nearly all the Jedi knights and — after almost dying at Obi-Wan ’s hands and enduring a sort of rebirth as the masked Darth Vader — help remake a galactic republic into a dictatorship .
Still , in one respect he is explicitly a Christ figure .
A bit of early dialogue between Qui-Gon and Anakin ’s mother , one Shmi—names are n’t Lucas ’s strong suit , either — reveals that Anakin is the product of a virgin birth :
Qui-Gon :
You should be very proud of your son .
He gives without any thought of reward .
Shmi :
Well , he knows nothing of greed .
He has a —
Qui-Gon :
He has special powers .
Shmi : Yes .
Qui-Gon :
He can see things before they happen .
. . .
The Force is unusually strong with him , that much is clear .
Who was his father ?
Shmi :
There was no father .
I carried him , I gave birth , I raised him .
I ca n’t explain what happened .
What did happen ?
Not to Shmi , whose curious reproductive history the Star Wars movies also never bothered to explain , but to the Star Wars movies themselves — whose earlier trilogy mostly avoided biblical inspiration but whose more recent installments shifted so sharply toward Christianity ?
More generally , why has mainstream sci-fi and fantasy as a whole become so religious ?
One reason may be the religious revival that the United States and much of the world have been undergoing since the 1970s .
This “ revenge of God , ” in French scholar Gilles Kepel ’s phrase , has seemingly begun to be felt even in secular Hollywood .
But another reason surely lies in geopolitics .
During the sixties and seventies , popular American science fiction looked to the stars and saw a Cold War there .
Consider Star
Trek , the franchise that , as a TV show from 1966 to 1969 and later as a series of movies , chronicled the adventures of Captain Kirk , Mr. Spock , and the crew of the USS — “ United Starship ” — Enterprise , representatives of a democratic United Federation of Planets that held an uneasy truce with the warlike , autocratic Klingon Empire .
The real - world parallels were unmistakable .
“ Of course Star Trek was about the Cold War , ” critic Paul Cantor recently observed .
“ The United Federation of Planets was the United States and its free - world allies , the Klingons were the Soviet Union and the Communist bloc . ”
The original Star Wars films were similarly political at heart .
Like Star
Trek , they portrayed a universe caught between two great rivals , one free and democratic , the other hierarchical and autocratic .
Not for nothing did the first film use “ evil Galactic Empire ” to describe Darth Vader ’s dominion .
( One wonders whether Ronald Reagan drew his famous excoriation from Lucas ’s hit . )
When the Soviet Union began to thaw in the mid-eighties and collapsed entirely in 1991 , however , that neat good - versus - evil scheme resonated less , and mainstream science fiction started to cast about for alternative inspirations .
Often it failed .
Star Trek , for example , continued to imitate geopolitics as it launched a phenomenally boring new TV series , Star Trek : The Next Generation , in 1987 ( it would end its run in 1994 ) .
The Federation and the Klingons were now at peace , and the Enterprise resembled a spaceborne United Nations , a bustling enclave safe enough for the crew to bring children with them .
So yawn - inducing was the galaxy that the show frequently sought to introduce drama with a device called the “ holodeck , ” a virtual - reality entertainment area where the characters could cavort in more exciting locales — the Wild West , say , or 221B Baker Street .
Two more Trek series , Deep Space Nine and Voyager , tried to restore excitement — the first was set on a frontier space station , the second in a galaxy far from our own tedious one — but with little effect .
Too often , the Star Trek franchise called to mind the end of history on an intergalactic scale .
But while Star Trek floundered , other sci-fi , less committed to explicit Political Relevance , seized on a ready - to - hand story that exerted enormous power on American audiences — and not only because of its biblical source .
The story has roots deep in humanity ’s ancient past , as Campbell , Raglan , and Rank understood .
It is a story that , in one variant or another , our ancestors told one another so long ago that its sources are as mysterious as the story itself .
Messianic sci-fi movies and TV programs , despite their own interest in parthenogenesis , did not spring forth fully formed from the New Testament .
Science fiction of the written kind has long taken advantage of the cultural power of the Christ story .
In fact , two of the twentieth century ’s most popular sci- fi novels , Frank Herbert ’s Dune and Robert Heinlein ’s Stranger in a Strange Land , were overtly messianic , a fact noted by the sizable critical literature that exists on the books .
Christian themes are n’t an entirely new development in filmed science fiction , either .
In the Terminator franchise — which produced three fine films as far apart as 1984 , 1991 , and 2003 — robots from the future repeatedly attempt to kill the suggestively initialed John Connor , a man destined to lead humanity in a war against the robots .
Connor ’s birth is positively paradoxical , if not miraculous : a warrior sent back in time by Connor himself to fight the first movie ’s robot killer sleeps with Connor ’s mother . . . conceiving Connor .
Richard Matheson ’s 1954 novel I Am Legend , in which the world ’s last surviving human being battles vampire - like creatures , has inspired three Hollywood versions , but The Omega Man ( 1971 ) — in which Charlton Heston is first nearly crucified , then saves the world with his ( antibody - carrying ) blood , and winds up speared through the side and dead in , once more , a T shape — is more suggestively Christian than either The Last Man on Earth ( 1964 ) or last year ’s Will Smith vehicle I Am Legend .
Even in that most political of Cold War sci- fi movies , The Day the Earth Stood Still ( 1951 ) , we meet an alien who adopts the name “ Carpenter ” and , after being killed by the earthlings among whom he has landed , returns to life to offer them peace or a sword .
Steven Spielberg ’s E.T. ( 1982 ) similarly gave us a being who descended from heaven , cured disease miraculously , and then returned from death .
Yet despite the evocative power of the Christian narrative , it seems likely that geopolitics will return to mainstream science fiction , now that we realize how terribly exciting — I use the adverb carefully — our world still is .
In fact , it ’s already begun to happen .
A fifth Star Trek series , called Enterprise , began its four - season run on September 26 , 2001 — just 15 days after 9/11 and just before our subsequent war against the Taliban — with the good guys fighting a new race of aliens called , by a curious coincidence , the Suliban .
The action - packed series quickly became the best Trek since the original , and its references to 9/11 and the War on Terror only became more explicit as the show went on .
In Enterprise ’s penultimate season , aliens terroristically destroy a swath of Florida and the Enterprise goes on a mission to hunt them down and punish them .
Then there ’s Battlestar Galactica .
The corny 1978 original mercifully died after a single season .
Five years ago , however , the franchise was reborn — first as a three - hour miniseries , then as a weekly show — in a compelling new form .
As in the original , the show ’s heroes , the last remnants of a human civilization destroyed by mechanical beings called Cylons , are fleeing their persecutors and seeking Earth , the legendary planet of their origin .
But instead of the clunky robots of the 1978 series , the new Cylons are indistinguishable from human beings — a detail that helps turn the show into an ongoing examination of the War on Terror :
Is it ethical to torture Cylons , for example ?
Other questions also echo our current conflict :
How should the show ’s hero deal with members of a ( human ) fifth column that has tried to sabotage his ship ?
How much access to sensitive information should he grant to an apparently hostile reporter ?
The show declines to answer straightforwardly , instead presenting viewers with a world whose politics , like our own , are filled with moral ambiguities and difficult trade - offs .
Now that science fiction again has politics to draw on , will it abandon its religious impulses ?
Predicting the future is a task best left to sci - fi writers themselves , but I ’d bet not .
In a genre less committed than most to the this - worldly , there will always be messiahs to save the world from evil robots or invading aliens .
And at movie theaters and on TV screens nationwide , there will always be legions of worshipful fans .
WASHINGTON
Some big guns on the right have joined the left in calling for the temporary nationalization of Americas troubled banks .
Among them are former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan , Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham , consultant and professor Nouriel Roubini , and former Treasury Secretary James Baker .
They are wrong : Nationalization would compound the problems caused by the credit craze that led us to where we are , kick taxpayers in the stomach , and do in a convoluted way what the market would do swiftly .
The banking system is in a humongous mess .
Potential losses by U.S. banks on loans and securities amount to nearly $ 2 trillion .
The response by two consecutive administrations government - funded loans , capital injections and guarantees has not inspired confidence .
The markets know that the banks are concealing the value of their bad assets by not selling them at the low prices investors would offer .
The reason for not letting Citigroup , Bank of America , Wells Fargo and others go down is , we are told , that credit needs to keep flowing in order to avoid a depression .
But that reasoning is backward .
Credit is not the father but the child of economic prosperity .
Garet Garrett , the intellectual giant of the 1930s , put it like this in  A Bubble That Broke the World ,  his classic on the credit craze that led to the Great Depression :  From the beginning of economic thought it had been supposed that prosperity was from the increase and exchange of wealth , and credit was its product . 
It is common knowledge that for years , Americans have lived beyond their means by saving too little and borrowing too much .
If this is readily accepted , why is it so difficult to see that a government - induced expansion of credit at a time when American households are finally trying to pay back their debts and save for the future will only prolong the problem ?
In January alone , the annual rate of saving in the U.S. was the highest since monthly records began in 1959 .
That should be a reason to rejoice .
Of course , businesses need credit and customers .
But there are two ways to get them .
One is by bailing out and then nationalizing the banks and paying a catastrophic price .
The other is by letting the financial system purge itself of failed assets and giving consumers a bit of time to replenish their coffers .
Few things give a worse name to the free - enterprise system than offloading bank losses onto taxpayers .
The way to solve this crisis is to let zombie banks proceed to their beyond , allowing those banks that need restructuring to start doing just that while those in a position to fill the space left by failed institutions can jump in quickly .
After all , a majority of the almost 9,000 U.S. banks , including regional institutions , did not engage in credit hanky - panky and would love a chance to increase their market share .
I asked Michael Rozeff , a financial expert and professor emeritus at the State University of New York , if a market solution would interrupt credit .
 Federal and state authorities ,  he responded ,  should immediately encourage new banks to be chartered .
These new banks can mobilize the immense amounts of money now locked up in money market accounts and Treasury bills .
They can take over consumer loans , auto loans , and mortgage loans from older banks .
Credit need not be interrupted .
Failed banks could be restructured through the FDIC in order to preserve the insured deposits .
The creditors and various sound banks would absorb some of the existing branches and the good assets of the bankrupt institutions ; the bad assets would be sold at whatever price the markets decided .
Obviously , the shareholders would be wiped out and the bondholders would probably get a haircut because the priority would be to protect the depositors as would happen in the case of a federal takeover , but without the heavy cost .
Those who argue for temporary government ownership point to Sweden as an example of successful nationalization in the 1990s .
I asked Fredrik Erixon , a Swedish economist who directs the European Center for International Political Economy , if he agrees .
 Swedish policy ,  he responded , had little to do with nationalization :
No more than 15 percent of total credit ended up in banks owned by the government .
The government bailed out a bank it already owned ( Nordbanken ) and bought just one regional bank ( Gota Bank ) .
How can anyone seriously point to Sweden as a model for nationalizing Americas financial system ?
Based entirely upon a leak of abstract new marketing graphics from Microsoft , bloggers have announced a new generation of music players that will apparently do most of what the iPod touch did when it arrived in 2007 .
The product concept is so deep in vaporware territory that Microsoft has n't even publicly acknowledged any real plans to clone the iPod touch yet .
The marketing graphics below , initially published by Engadget , referred to as a " draft " artist 's conception , suggest the same minimalist , single home button as the iPod touch along with a wide screen that is smaller than the iPod touch but housed in a significantly thicker overall box .
This would make the rumored Zune HD device a fitting tribute to the original Zune , which targeted the popularity of the original iPod with a lower - density screen but thicker box a year after the video playing , fifth generation iPod shipped , only to be blindsided by Apple 's move to flash RAM - based video players with the iPod nano and shuffle .
The second generation Zunes caught up with a flash - based player just in time to be trampled by the stampede of interest in 2007 's video playing iPod nano and the web browsing iPod touch .
Microsoft had been able to clone the iPod classic and nano fairly easily , as both used largely off the shelf components and simple software ; reviewers reported that the Zune was nearly identical internally to the iPod nano .
Copying the iPod touch would take significantly more work , however .
Now two years behind
Last year , Microsoft caught up to Apple 's 2006 release of iPod games with its own new mobile XNA initiative in its third generation Zune firmware , although poor sales of Zune units have prevented major developers from showing much interest in the platform .
If Microsoft is able to release a touch - based Zune by the end of this year using either the same technology it showed off for Windows Mobile 6.5 or a simultaneously created alternative , it will remain no more than two years behind Apple .
A variant based partly on Windows Mobile would require shipping the functional new version of Internet Explorer Mobile the company announced was in the pipeline for new WiMo 6.5 smartphones .
Microsoft 's version of the iPod touch has also long been expected to eventually deliver a full - fledged WiFi music store , similar to the one Apple released in 2007 ; in 2008 , the company updated the Zune with a limited ability to find tracks on the Zune Marketplace .
If the Zune HD arrives on the one - year anniversary of last year 's Zune update , by September , it will deliver a version of most of Apple 's features within that two year copy window , with the notable exception of being able to run the same mobile software .
However , Microsoft already has its own software platform in Windows Mobile .
The problem is that all of these programs are oriented around stylus tapping or button pushing , not finger - driven touch .
As RIM discovered with the BlackBerry Storm , releasing a touch version of an existing brand is not easy nor without its own risks , as key interface choices at least temporarily diminished the Storm 's appeal .
Apple 's iPod touch shares a platform with the iPhone , with a user base of 30 million devices sold within the last two years .
Selling enough Zune HD and Windows Mobile 6.1 phones to give developers a reason to rewrite mobile apps around a touch interface could be a difficult undertaking , particularly given the already lucrative option of developing for the existing iTunes App Store market , paired with its existing library of apps for consumers .
Vaporware advertising ?
With such long odds , Microsoft may be smart to keep its plans secret and allow the blogosphere to build anticipation itself .
That 's what the company did in 2006 , which resulted in the Zune originally being touted as a juggernaut that would destroy the iPod by pundits who speculated that Microsoft would deeply discount the new player as cheaply as $ 99 and give it more features and flexibility than anything else on the market .
The downside was that Microsoft did n't attempt to meet those expectations .
It has consistently priced the Zune and its accessories near Apple 's pricing and has regularly had enough earlier inventory left over to clear out through significant discounts .
Further , most of its imagined features ended up being underwhelming in ability and scope , such as its wireless file sharing , or " squirting , " which was eventually supplemented by basic wireless sync and download features in its second and third years on the market .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cautioned Israel ’s right - wing government on Thursday that it risked losing Arab support for fighting any threats from Iran if it shuns Palestinian peace talks .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testifies before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington April 22 , 2009 .

Signaling U.S. impatience with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s reticence over peace talks , Clinton said Arab nations had made clear to her that Israel must be committed to the Palestinian peace process if it wants help countering Iran .
“ For Israel to get the kind of strong support it is looking for vis -a - vis Iran , it ca n’t stay on the sidelines with respect to the Palestinians and the peace efforts .
They go hand in hand , ” she told the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee .
Israel sees a nuclear - armed threat as a mortal threat .
“ They ( Arab countries ) believe that Israel ’s willingness to re-enter into discussions with the Palestinian Authority strengthens them in being able to deal with Iran , ” she added .
Since coming into power last month , Netanyahu and his right - leaning coalition have avoided recognizing the Palestinians ’ right to an independent state as his predecessor Ehud Olmert did .
The United States is committed to pushing for a two - state solution , with Israelis and Palestinians living side by side , and would like to revive stalled talks .
Netanyahu is set to visit Washington early next month .
Clinton said she was not going to prejudge the Israeli position until there had been face - to - face talks with him .
“ The prime minister will be coming to Washington in May , and we think that it is important not to prejudge what their view is and how that can best be approached , ” she said .
FUNDS TO HAMAS ?
Lawmakers put pressure on Clinton over a funding request for the Palestinians , saying there must be strong assurances that none of the money would go to the militant group Hamas if it were included in a future unity government under discussion .
Clinton said the State Department would carefully track assistance and additional steps being taken to ensure that no U.S. taxpayer money goes to Hamas .
“ No aid will flow to Hamas or any entity controlled by Hamas , ” she added .
But New York Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey , who has previously put holds on money earmarked for the Palestinians , questioned what she said was some “ flexibility ” in the Obama administration ’s approach .
Clinton reiterated that the Obama administration expected any new government that included Hamas to meet three conditions -- to recognize Israel , renounce violence and sign on to previous Palestinian peace accords .
But Clinton hinted that some flexibility might be needed , pointing to U.S. funding for Lebanon , whose government includes the militant group Hezbollah .
“ We are doing that because we think , on balance , it is in the interest of the United States , ” she said .
At a UN conference on race that took place on Wednesday , the message that the Vatican had to send was pretty clear – the Catholic Church feared that genetic alterations of babies could spawn a new type of racism worldwide .
Pope Benedict XVI argues that the ability to alter traits in unborn babies could lead to a new type of eugenics , with potentially devastating consequences for people .
The head of the Church also says that modifying babies in this manner is both unethical and immoral , and that the strives in this direction should be halted as soon as possible .
“ The Holy See is also alarmed by the still latent temptation of eugenics that can be fueled by techniques of artificial procreation and the use of ' superfluous embryos . '
The possibility of choosing the color of the eyes or other physical characteristic of a child could lead to the creation of a ' subcategory of human beings ' or the elimination of human beings that do not fulfill the characteristics predetermined by a given society , ” the Vatican 's observer , Archbishop Silvano Tomasi , said to the UN in Geneva .
The reaction seems justified to some extent , experts share , because selecting children 's traits is one of the main reasons why this line of research has been started in the first place .
Psychologists say that people want to resort to this type of procedure in order to feel in control of their lives , and also because they do n't want to leave anything to chance .
Indeed , it 's a lot simpler to take care of a baby that has been genetically screened for a number of diseases , rather than helping to raise up one suffering from the Down Syndrome , AIDS , or other such conditions , the experts add .
Ethically speaking , the Catholic Church has always advocated that people should have their babies the way God intended , and not according to their own whims .
And the point the Holy See brought into question at the UN meeting was actually a pretty interesting one , experts agree .
The stain that eugenics left behind , especially after World War II , is still very much present in the minds of many people , and disguising it in a “ more humane way to do it ” does not make arbitrary selection anymore acceptable , the Vatican believes .
HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) -- Japan 's trade surplus shriveled by 99 % in March from the year - earlier month as exports tumbled even more rapidly than the sharp decline in imports , official data showed Wednesday .
The trade surplus for the month was 10.96 billion yen ( $ 109.6 million ) , compared with 1.1 trillion yen in March 2008 , according to provisional figures .
Despite the small surplus in March , Japan 's trade balance for the year ended March 31 showed a deficit of 725.3 billion yen , the country 's first trade deficit in 28 years , according to Kyodo news service .
Japanese exports dropped 16.4 % to 71.1 trillion yen , while imports narrowed 4.1 % to 71.9 trillion yen .
Police ' fusion ' centers criticized for tracking Ron Paul , Barr , McKinney supporters Rachel Oswald
Published : Wednesday April 1 , 2009
Print This Email This Formed in the wake of 9/11 as a way to search out domestic terrorist threats , fusion centers today are being bombarded with criticism on all sides for things like improper surveillance of the supporters of third - party presidential candidates and an ambiguous mission directive that has lead to power overreaching .
Fusion centers are intelligence databases spread out across the country that collect data on ordinary citizens and synchronize national intelligence collection with local police .
There are currently more than 40 fusion centers in the country .
At a hearing Wednesday of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence , Information Sharing , and Terrorism Risk Assessment , rights groups , including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Council on Islamic - American Relations , spoke against the fusion centers .
 Fusion centers have experienced a mission creep in the last several years , becoming more of a threat than a security device , " said Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU 's Washington legislative office in a statement .
" With no overarching guidelines to restrict or direct them , these centers put Americans  privacy at huge risk .
We need our government to take a long , hard look at whats going into these centers and , frankly , what s coming out . 
The Department of Homeland Security also agrees that fusion centers pose a number of privacy risks to American citizens .
In a December 2008 report , DHS 's Privacy Office detailed seven risks posed by the centers .
They are :
1. Justification for fusion centers
2. Ambiguous Lines of Authority , Rules , and Oversight
3. Participation of the Military and the Private Sector
4. Data Mining
5. Excessive Secrecy
6. Inaccurate or Incomplete Information
7. Mission Creep
The ACLU has followed possible fusion center improper invasions of privacy , including the surveillance of third - party presidential candidate supporters , religious groups and of anti-war activists .
The group is asking the DHS office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to launch independent investigations into the following incidents :
* Inappropriate references " social , religious and political ideologies including support of third party presidential candidates such as Congressman Ron Paul and former Congressman Bob Barr " in a February 2009 report on the " modern militia movement " authored by the Missouri Information Anaysis Center .
Report available here .
* A May 2008 report entitled  Universal Adversary Dynamic Threat Assessment written by a private contractor that labeled environmental organizations such as the Sierra Club , the Humane Society and the Audubon Society as " organizations with known or possible links to eco-terrorism .
The report , which also criticized the Animal Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front , among others , is available here .
* The alleged improper monitoring and dissemination of communications of activists with the DC Anti-War Network .
* The labeling of national and state anti-war groups as " extremists in a report entitled a  Protective Intelligence Bulletin that was issued in March , 2006 by the DHS Intelligence Branch of the Threat Management Division of the Federal Protective Service .
The report is available here .
* A February 2009 report authored by the North Central Texas Fusion System called " Prevention Awareness Bulletin . "
The report described an alleged conspiracy of among the Muslim civil liberties group , CAIR , former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark and former Georgia Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney , among others to foster an " environment for terrorist groups to flourish . "
That report can be read here .
CAIR released the following statement regarding its naming in the Texas Fusion System report .
" CAIR is deeply troubled that the North Central Texas Fusion System bulletin labels monitoring the legal activities of American Muslims exercising their constitutional privileges as imperative ,  " their statement said .
The group " believes it is time for Congress to conduct a deeper evaluation of our nations new domestic surveillance infrastructure .
" Based on this and other recent incidents and initiatives targeting the Muslim community nationwide , we are concerned that the rights of American Muslims to participate fully in our countrys political process and practice their faith free of government intrusion is under assault ,  they added .

Of course , this was the exact opposite of what retail investors wanted .
After all the turmoil and volatility , why would anyone want it to continue ?
Well , for the reason we just mentioned – money .
Cramer , during Friday ’s show , exposed the bear raiders behind this type of trading and explained what makes them tick .
This negative attitude is largely held by hedge funds with huge short positions .
And if they have n’t yet covered those positions , they ’re most likely hoping Treasury Secretary Geithner delivers another limp and vague speech next week .
No doubt hedge funds bristled at President Obama ’s pro-business statements Thursday and those of Lawrence Summers , director of the National Economic Council , on Friday .
The more missteps in Washington , the better the returns for these funds .
Beyond the U.S. , hedge funds that make money on the downturn want the entire global economy to slowdown .
They ’re hoping China ’s stimulus does n’t work , copper prices dip , and oil heads lower .
Luckily for us , that ’s not happening .
Retail ’s better - than - expected numbers this week – if only by a slight margin – were also bad news for the hedge funds , as was General Motors taking a pass on $ 2 billion in federal aid .
Instead , that helped to boost the markets .
In the financials , Bank of America reported that it was profitable , which means the bank will escape Citigroup - style government ownership .
There ’s also talk of changes to the mark - to - market accounting that ’s turning asset - backed paper toxic and weighing down many banks ’ balance sheets .
And another landmark decision was announced this week : The Securities and Exchange Commission will reinstate the uptick rule .
This used to require a stock to tick up in price before it could be shorted , and without it bears have been able to hammer down companies with impunity .
The change is bad for the bears , in this case hedge funds , and good for us .
Bernie Madoff ’s guilty plea signaled that there might be justice in the world , which restores investors ’ faith .
Since hedge funds have made their money specifically due to a lack of faith , this turn of events tips the scales back in our favor .
Also , Warren Buffett spent a morning with CNBC this week instead of cowering in his modest Omaha home .
That inspires confidence , which again is not what hedge funds want right now .
General Electric withstood a credit downgrade .
In fact , the stock was up regardless .
The collapse of GE , needless to say , would have had severe consequences , but they might have been profitable for the shorts .
That possibility seems to have disappeared .
Analysts have n’t been downgrading stocks the way the bears would like .
They ’d want Wall Street pundits and experts on TV , radio and in print predicting another depression .
It ’s not happening , though .
Hedge funds also would have liked to see Friday ’s Dow gains much higher .
That way a sizable reversal of any kind next week would kill investors ’ spirits .
But it looks like buyers ’ remorse wo n’t be an issue , in the near term at least .
And lastly , healthy M&A activity , most recently in biotech , also hurts the hedge - fund cause .
Takeovers in the sector have totaled $ 193 billion just in the past month .
The new money entering the market will most likely end up in stocks , pushing them higher .
And the fact that the acquirers ’ share prices also rose might entice other firms to do some buying of their own .
Take it from Cramer , he used to run a hedge fund , and he knows how these guys think .
But the market ’s recent moves seem to indicate that the funds are n’t getting the negativity they need .
Should the big money shift gears and go long – which is likely if the good news keeps coming – then billions and billions of dollars will flood into stocks , possibly pushing the Dow up to 8,000 , Cramer said .
Hedge funds will have no choice .
They ’ll need to recoup any the losses incurred for being late to the turn .

There has been a lot of fear and hysteria surrounding the Food Safety Modernization Act ( HR 875 ) coming from small growers , organic gardeners , and organic consumers alike .
HR 875 was introduced by Congresswoman Rosa L. DeLauro , Connecticut , “ to separate food safety regulation from drug and device approvals and to restore the balance that has long been missing at Health and Human Service . ”
[ social_buttons ]
“ Under the proposal , FDA would be split into an agency responsible for food safety ( the Food Safety Administration ) and another responsible for regulation of drugs and devices .
This move creates an agency solely focused on protecting the public through better regulation of the food supply .
The Food Safety Modernization
Act would establish a farm - to - fork system for protecting foods that are currently regulated by FDA , which has jurisdiction over 80 percent of the food supply ” - DeLauro
Here ’s are 5 myths about HR 875 , debunked :
Myth : H.R. 875 “ makes it illegal to grow your own garden ” and would result in the “ criminalization of the backyard gardener . ”
Fact :
There is no language in the bill that would regulate , penalize , or shut down backyard gardens .
This bill is focused on ensuring the safety of foods sold in supermarkets .
Myth : H.R. 875 would mean a “ goodbye to farmers markets ” because the bill would “ require such a burdensome complexity of rules , inspections , licensing , fees , and penalties for each farmer who wishes to sell locally – a fruit stand , at a farmers market . ”
Fact :
There is no language in the bill that would result in farmers markets being regulated , penalized any fines , or shut down .
Farmers markets would be able to continue to flourish under the bill .
In fact , the bill would insist that imported foods meet strict safety standards to ensure that unsafe imported foods are not competing with locally - grown foods .
Myth : H.R. 875 would result in the “ death of organic farming . ”
Fact :
There is no language in the bill that would stop organic farming .
The National Organic Program ( NOP ) is under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) .
The Food Safety Modernization
Act only addresses food safety issues under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .
Myth :
The bill would implement a national animal ID system .
Fact :
There is no language in the bill that would implement a national animal ID system .
Animal identification issues are under the jurisdiction of the USDA .
The Food Safety Modernization
Act addresses issues under the jurisdiction of the FDA .
Myth :
The bill is supported by the large agribusiness industry .
Fact :
No large agribusiness companies have expressed support for this bill .
This bill is being supported by several Members of Congress who have strong progressive records on issues involving farmers markets , organic farming , and locally - grown foods .
Also , H.R. 875 is the only food safety legislation that has been supported by all the major consumer and food safety groups , including :

SOME TIME AGO , when I first put a scarlet A from the Out Campaign on my site , I also posted a brief explanation of what I meant by it , at the time .
Since then I 've had to reconsider — not so much to change my views as to sharpen them .
But I do see things a bit differently now .
Partly , this is a result of conversations with Christian friends .
Most of the Christians I know are relatively liberal , and very intelligent .
I 'd like to think the two go together , but , unfortunately , I know some intelligent conservatives as well .
The world does n't always satisfy our deepest cravings .
In these conversations , I get asked an interesting question .
It would be meaningless to anyone who had n't , at one point in their life , been a very , very , serious Christian .
But I was , and so I understand it .
After learning that I am no longer religious , or that I now self - identify as an atheist , they ask me about " my relationship with God " .
The question does n't bother me .
( Well , not in any cosmic sense .
It usually causes me a bit of discomfort in a social sense . )
What does bother me — in the sense that it has made me think about exactly what I mean by " Atheist " — is my answer .
Because , in the moment , I do know exactly what they mean , and I have no trouble reassuring them that my relationship with god is better than ever .
An odd thing for an atheist to say ?
An even odder thing for an atheist to believe ?
Yeah .
Regular readers blessed with sharp eyes may have already noticed a hint of the explanation .
The word " god " in my response is not capitalized .
That does n't mean I do n't consider it important — quite the opposite .
I 've made something of a point in these pages of distinguishing between Capital letter terms and small letter terms : between " Truth " and " truth " , " Patriotism " and " patriotism " , " Belief " and " belief " , " Morality " and " morality " .
The basic difference , in each case , is the difference between Orthodoxy and reality .
Not that Orthodoxy absolutely excludes reality .
It 's an impediment , not a complete barrier .
In fact , the experience of having a real ( small - " r " ) sense of welcome and open connection with myself , my world , and the — excuse the theological expression — ground of my being is what I experienced as my " relationship with God " when I was in my friends ' place .
I would n't have put it that way , then .
I had different models , a different vocabulary .
But that is how I would describe it now .
And that sense has only gotten deeper .
In fact , I wonder , sometimes , if it is possible to fully enjoy that experience without a little Orthodoxy .
Note to my atheist friends : if the last sentence bothered you because it sounded vaguely heretical from an atheist point of view , you qualify .
But let me rush on to reassure you .
I do n't mean that atheists do n't experience this connection .
I think the connection is inborn , and the normal state of affairs , in all of us .
What I do mean is that it may be harder to notice if you 've never had enough Orthodoxy around to disconnect you from it — to make you feel separated and out of touch with yourself , your world , the ground of your being .
( And I might add that not all Orthodoxy is religious . )
If you 've never experienced that disconnect you may be too much like a fish in water .
You may not notice the connection , even though you have it .
That brings me back to the sophomoric title of this series : " What Atheism Means to Me " .
To be continued ...
REAL AND UNREAL LANDMARKS OF FICTION : DickensWorld
When you grow weary of snatching wipes to pay the greengrocer who provides you with tonic and tobac ( fuel for the all - night writing sessions that result in long novels that no one will ever read ) , perhaps you should find the nearest gentleman of leisure ( or beadle ) , slit his throat in darkest night , steal his four - in - hand , and travel ( fast as the post ) to DickensWorld in Chatham , Kent for some much needed writerly recuperation .
From the website : " DickensWorld has an assortment of attractions to keep the whole family entertained ; jump on board the Great Expectations Boat Ride for splashing good fun , take a trip back in time to a Victorian School complete with nasty schoolmaster or get spooked in The Haunted House of 1859 .
Visitors will get the chance to come face to face with some of Dickens ' literary characters in their magnificent rendition of a Victorian town courtyard !
After all the excitement in the Dickensian courtyard , visitors can take a rest in the 4D cinema show at Peggotty 's Boathouse or at the animatronic show in the Britannia Theatre - sit back and enjoy the story of Dickens ' life and his literary works ... " DickensWorld !
Man , I want to go to DickensWorld right now !
I want to fuck some jolly whore in an alley while her older brother tries to steal my books to sell them for gin until I am forced to stave his skull in with a mouldy railroad tie , causing her to love me forever .
Unfortunately , by many accounts , soon DickensWorld ( which opened in 2007 ) will be bankrupt because it is a bad idea done badly and nobody in their right mind would ever want to visit DickensWorld for honest reasons , especially not children .
But for now , if you have the inclination and the scratch , you can still see this indoor mock - up of one of Victorian London 's ramshackle cess towns , where you can ride Europe 's longest log flume ride through the Newgate Prison in search of an escaped Magwitch , you can see an animatronic puppet show about Charles Dickens ' life and works , and you can play computer games in a Victorian schoolhouse .
Also , there are gift shops where you can buy Dickens books , horehound candy , and probably some shoe polish .
There are actors in period costume who try to involve you in their mental illness .
There is a playground called " Fagin 's Den " where toddlers can kick off their shoes and run around like lunatics for ten minutes while their parents whisper about germs and pedophiles .
Everything is dark all the time .
Everything is British .
Yet -- and here 's where they went wrong -- everything is also optimistic , dandy , sugarcoated , and juvenile .
I say , the creators of DickensWorld missed a golden goddamn opportunity .
I lived in this town called Waxahachie , Texas for a year growing up , which does n't offer much to anybody in the world except for a pretty good football team and a huge , two - month renaissance festival called " Scarborough Faire . "
Sometimes I miss Texas .
Here is Scarborough Faire 's " Weapons Policy " : " Weapons Policy :
The management discourages the use of weapons as costume adornments , as the safety of our patrons is our utmost concern .
Any weapon adornment must be " peace - tied " and otherwise protected so any sharp edges are covered , and so it can not be drawn or wielded while on the grounds .
Due to the wide variety of potential " weapons " each item is handled on a case - by - case basis when the patron enters the festival .
The Front Gate personnel determine what will and will not be allowed into the festival , as well as how it will be " peace - tied " and protected before the patron enters the festival .
To avoid your weapon being held at the entrance gate until you depart the Festival , we advise that you do not wear weapons as costume adornments .
Security personnel will monitor the wearing of weapons on the festival grounds .
On violation of our weapons policy , Security personnel may confiscate any weapon and expel the violator from the festival grounds .
Southwest Festivals , Inc. reserves the right to exclude a patron / participant from carrying or wearing a weapon .
" The dynamics of a renaissance festival are interesting : they take a group of charming sociopaths who would otherwise be homeless criminals , lash them together in one field , and nail up a sign that says " Historical Fun . "
The truth is that the only reason that a renaissance fair stays in business is because it is the best place to meet hysterical girls who like the wrong kind of men , to carry around a broadsword without anybody frog - marching you to a state home , to buy well - made fetish sex gear , to eat giant turkey legs , and to score meth .
I think the world is ready for a writer theme park , and I see no problem with organizing it around the preoccupations and style of big Chuck D .
But the trick is to find modern criminals and stick them in peacoats and sideburns .
The world is all cybercrime these days : the sneak - thiefs , pimps , and thugs of a bygone age need new jobs now .
A real DickensWorld ought to be half New Orleans brothel , half " Ripley 's Believe it Or Not ! " Museum .
Everyone there should be trying to destroy their minds and bodies with the blunt weapons of the Victorian working class .
There must be a huge selection of airless , smoke - filled rooms that you can rent by the hour complete with a stained mattress and one bucket full of lard , the other full of talc .
Things a real DickensWorld must have : 1 ) . Alcohol2 ) .
Lockpicking and pickpocketing lessons taught by aggressive professionals3 ) .
A rancid , rat - infested theater that shows bootleg " Masterpiece Theater " editions of Dickens movies where you can buy alcohol and boiled meat4 ) .
A writer 's commune funded by Oxford where writers get a cheap place to live ( a reproduction of the Marshalsea prison ) but where they must work as ticket takers and bartenders at the Dickens World amusements : a ) .
a deeply - disturbing animatronic freak show complete with terrifying reproductions of the Victorian era's most grotesque natural phenomena b ) .
a game where you toss baseballs at milk jugs c ) .
an indoor roller - coaster that also doubles as a real , working factory that makes cheap , good boots that you can also buy at Dickens World and which will last forever5 ) .
A really kick - ass library where you can drink and smoke6 ) .
A sex toy shop that specializes in copper , magnetism , and tophatsAnyway , if you live in England and your life is already a disappointment , I say take a trip over to DickensWorld and see this strange testament to the disappointment of a past age .
If you dedicate your whole life to literature , the poor , the beaten , and the despised , someday college kids will have to dress up as your " colorful " characters , choke down their dignity , and pretend to like children in order to pay for their psychology degrees .
If that 's not a reason to keep writing fiction , then I do n't know what to tell you .

jCaption is a jQuery plugin designed to make adding captions to a page dead simple .
It takes an image element and uses one of its attributes to build the markup for a caption .
It allows for both arbitrary styling and markup .
Dealing with image captions on the web can be a big pain .
The code structure for nearly any caption looks something like the following :
< div > < img src=" image.gif " alt= " " /> < p>Caption Text </ p> </div >
While writing such markup for every image is merely an inconvenience for web developers , it is an impossibility for most of thier clients .
Many clients use a web - based WYSIWYG editor to create and edit their pages through a CMS .
It would be nearly impossible to expect them to add this markup around their images .
This was a problem I faced when building a site for a client .
I found well - concepted solution in Captify , but I found it too restrive for my needs .
I proceeded by writing a version that met the following requirements :
Follow jQuery Conventions - Animations should n't be handled by passing in a string , instead arbitrary animations should be allowed .
Markup Should be Arbitrary -
Other than the tag that is required , other markup should be arbitrary .
Optionally Allow Placement From Text - Editors - Web - Editors like tinyMCE or FCKditor allow users to align images to the left or right of text .
Depending on the version , this is accomplished using the " align " attribute or " style " attribute .
This plugin accomodates both and makes sure that the caption is correctly placed as well .
Using the plugin
Using the plugin is dead simple .
Just use apply the .jcaption ( ) method to the images you want :
$ ( 'img ' ) .jcaption ( ) ;
By default this will take the following image :
< img src=" image.jpg " alt =" Some caption text " />
and produce the following markup :
< div class= " caption " > < img src=" image.jpg " alt =" Some caption text " /> < p> Some caption text </ p> </div >
The options will allow you to control the elements and classes that the plugin produces .
Additionally , to accomodate text editors , the plugin can copy the styling that was applied to the image to the caption instead , and take the images " align " attribute and append it to the caption class .
So for text editors that place images using align = " left " you can instead have the plugin add " left " as a class to the caption so that you can place the entire caption using your stylesheet .
Options
$ ( 'img ' ) . jcaption ( { // Element to wrap the image and caption in wrapperElement : ' div ' , //Class for wrapper element wrapperClass : ' caption ' , //Caption Element captionElement : 'p ' , //Attribute of image to use as caption source imageAttr : ' alt ' , // If true , it checks to make sure there is caption copy before running on each image requireText : true , // Should inline style be copied from img element to wrapper copyStyle : false , // Strip inline style from image removeStyle : true , // Strip align attribute from image removeAlign : true , // Assign the value of the image 's align attribute as a class to the wrapper copyAlignmentToClass : false , // Assign the value of the image 's float value as a class to the wrapper copyFloatToClass : true , // Assign a width to the wrapper that matches the image autoWidth : true , // Animate on hover over the image animate : false , // Show Animation show : {opacity : ' show'} , showDuration : 200 , // Hide Animation hide : {opacity : ' hide'} , hideDuration : 200 } ) ;
You 'll see that any arbitrary animations are possible by setting up the options in this manner .
Demo
View a Demo of this plugin with and without animations here .
The captions on the left are animated and the caption on the right is not .
Download the plugin
This plugin has been tested in IE 6 and 7 , Firefox 2 and 3 , Safari and Chrome .
Updated Sept. 2 , 2009 - Added CopyFloattoClass , improved some documentation and changed defaults to reflect the current state of text editors .
Updated Nov. 4 , 2009 - Added requireText , allowing the plugin to be run even if there is no caption text .

We are pleased to announce the Moksha Project and Fedora Community Project .
For a while now , Luke Macken , Máirín Duffy , myself and others have been working on consolidating the the Fedora Infrastructure bits under one unified user interface .
We have decided to split the efforts into two projects .
* Moksha - a generic platform for creating live collaborative web applications * Fedora Community - a website portal built on top of the Moksha platform What is Moksha ?
Moksha is a platform for creating real - time collaborative web applications .
It provides a set of Python and JavaScript API 's that make it simple to create rich applications that can acquire , manipulate , and visualize data from external services .
It is a unified framework build using the best available open source technologies such as TurboGears2 , jQuery , AMQP , and Orbited .
More information can be found on the Moksha Project Page at http://moksha.fedorahosted.org
What is Fedora Community ?
Fedora Community aims at being a portal interface for Fedora Project members to collaborate within and find information about the diverse Fedora universe .
It is created from applications built on top of the Moksha platform .
Fedora Community is assembled from a wide - ranging set of modules that integrates existing Fedora Infrastructure components such as koji , bodhi , FAS , and PkgDB .
More information and an example of the interface can be found at the Fedora Community project page http://johnp.fedorapeople.org/fedora-community/ .
Timeline Moksha 's base functionality is scheduled for completion by the beginning of February .
Our focus will then shift toward integration and polish to deliver the Fedora Community website in March .
Getting Involved Weekly Meetings -
We will be having public meetings every Monday morning at 10 am EST ( 1500 UTC ) where we go over the last week 's progress and the current week 's goals .
Anyone is welcome to join and take on action items .
The meetings will be broadcast over Fedora Talk .
If you are a Fedora Talk user with a soft / voip phone , you can join the conference via 2...@fedoraproject.org or infrastruct...@fedoraproject.org .
If you wish to dial in via a normal telephone , choose one of these local numbers : * 919-424-0063 - Raleigh , NC * 312-577-0052 - Chicago , IL * 978-303-8021 - Westford , MA * 650-930-9514 - Sunnyvale , CA * 442030518327 - UK
The conference call extension is 2001 .
irc - #moksha on irc.freenode.net mailing list - https://fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/moksha
Since at this point Moksha and Fedora Community development are pretty much intertwined , Fedora Community will be using the Moksha irc channel and mailing list .
At some point in the future we may wish to create a new irc channel and mailing list for Fedora Community efforts .

Somali Pirates Are Getting Rich : A Look At The Profit Margins
Errol Flynn never had it this good in “ Captain Blood ”
Being a Somali pirate looks like a profitable business from the outside and it is .
The margins are as attractive as those in the software industry .
Microsoft still makes 60 % or better margins on its core Windows , business , and server operations .
With the risks that the pirates take , they ought to do as well as that .
The New York Times did a piece last year in which it estimated that the pirates would bring in $ 50 million in 2008 .
That number will be higher this year , by as much as four times .
Most information on hijacked ships is that the ransom paid to get them back is about $ 2 million per vessel and crew .
In some cases , the pirates actually charge an additional fee for the ships which has been estimated as being as high as $ 5 million .
Based on 24/7 Wall St. ’s evaluation of news reports , the Somali pirates are seizing near one ship per day now .
This week , on a single day , they took over four vessels .
Even though several large national navies including the US are policing the shipping channels to cut down piracy , the rate at which the pirates can grab prey is picked up fairly fast .
The Somali pirates could take over between 80 and 120 vessels this year , and the figure is conservative .
That would put their gross revenue as high as $ 200 million .
The pirates almost certainly pay protection to the head of the Puntland , Mohamud Muse Hirsi .
Puntland is the region where most of the large “ mother ships ” that take the small pirate raiders out to sea , are located .
For protection from international intervention on land , senior Puntland officials are probably getting a third of the take , or about $ 65 million .
The next largest expense is buying and keeping “ mother ships ” in good working order .
The boats are usually trawlers which are , based on photos , about 100 feet long .
One or two of these have been sunk by foreign navies , but they do not have to be replaced often .
A large trawler built in the 1970s costs about $ 1 million .
A trawler that is ten years old costs closer to $ 3 million .
Some of the trawlers the pirates use were probably seized during their raids .
Most research indicates that one out of three attempts by the pirates to hijack a ship succeeds .
Covering enough ground to seize 120 vessels a year based on 400 attempts means that the pirates are probably running a dozen mother ships at any one time .
The costs to “ buy ” and maintain those ships is about $ 3 million each per year , because a trawler that is seized for use and not ransomed is $ 3 million in revenue not taken in .
Mother ship costs are at least $ 30 million , maybe $ 36 million .
These are not annual costs .
For each one sunk , the cost of replacement is $ 3 million .
On a pro forma basis for operations , the cost of mother ships is $ 6 million .
Each mother ship works with four or five attack vessels , which are not unlike WWII PT boats , but are made of light - weight metal or composite instead of wood .
Each of these has to run on two or more turbo diesels which put out 480 HP at 3,000 PRM .
These are not engines which are likely to be used on any of the hijacked ships so they are probably one of the largest direct costs the pirates have .
If the pirates operate 50 raiding boat it requires 100 engines .
These cost as much as $ 15,000 each , so the cost of these is about $ 1.5 million .
In most cases , they will not need to be replaced every year .
The boat themselves are probably less than $ 50,000 for the 50 shells the total $ 2.5 million .
Once again this is a one - time cost for those that are not sunk or abandoned .
Fuel for these diesels is probably very expensive but a lot of that can be taken from captured ships .
The pirates have to work with crews of mechanics , but their wages are probably modest .
Each mother ship and raider requires high - end GPS , radar and sonar .
The best radars available for small ships run about $ 4,000 .
High end GSP system cost about $ 1,500 , and sonar systems a little less than $ 1,000 .
All of the equipment runs about $ 400,000 for 12 trawlers and 50 raiders before installation costs .
Once again , this is not an annual cost because most of the hardware can be used for several years .
The cost of what are called “ extreme weather and marine ” satellite phones from one of the two premier global providers , Iridium and GlobalStar , is $ 1,200 per unit .
The cost of calls per minute is $ 5 .
Total cost for phones comes to $ 60,000 based on each team of pirates having two phones , and all of these probably get replaced each year due to damage .
Assuming 100 minutes a month per phone and the total cost of airtime is $ 600,000 .
Weapons are one of the largest single costs that Somali pirates have .
According to a book on AK - 47s from Amazon , the guns cost about $ 345 .
That is a total of $ 173,000 because each of 500 men is armed .
The price for 9 MM pistols on the black market runs about $ 200 , for a total of $ 100,000 .
Browning 50 caliber machine guns are $ 14,000 each , with at least one per raider and two per mother ship for a total cost of just over $ 1 million .
Rocket propelled grenades which are used in most raids run $ 3,000 and one is used in each of the 400 hijacking attempts for a total of $ 1.2 million .
Total ammunition costs at $ 1 per bullet are $ 250,000 .
Food and housing for 500 men and an average of 200 hostages has to be $ 10 a day , or $ 2.5 million a year .
Based on annual costs with pro forma calculations for things that have a life of more than a year , the expenses of operating the Somali pirate operation are $ 79 million .
That puts the profit of the operation at over $ 120 million .
It is worth contrasting that to the average income per capita in Somalia which is only about $ 600 .
The pirate business is not going away .
It is too profitable .
Douglas A. McIntyre
