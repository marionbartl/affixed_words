" Sometimes a beer is just a beer , " said John Dickerson in Slate .
But not when it 's mixed with politics .
President Obama is hoping to defuse a racially charged situation by talking over beers with black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. and James Crowley — the white police sergeant who arrested Gates .
Beer , you see , is the drink of the backyard and the ballgame , so it 's " the antithesis of the strutting and overreacting that gripped all three male actors in this drama . "
Please , said Julie Mason in the Washington Examiner .
Obama 's White House " beer - fest " is nothing more than a " pointless and contrived photo op . "
The president , who plunged into the affair by saying that the police had acted " stupidly " by arresting Gates when investigating a possible break - in at the professor 's home , is supposedly going to use the get - together as a " teachable moment " on race , but " at least half the point of the deal was for the three to be photographed together , smiling and holding beer . "
Precisely , said Lynn Sweet , the journalist who asked Obama about the Gates arrest at a news conference , in Politics Daily .
" The ' teachable ' moment may be that conversations do n't have to be stuck in the loop of a soundbite . "
Maybe by hoisting a beer with Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Sgt. James Crowley on Thursday evening the president wants to show " that sometimes people say things they regret . "
When the Jarawa tribe of hunter - gatherers began to emerge in ones and twos from the dense rainforests of the Andaman islands in 1997 , it seemed that these mysterious , handsome people only wanted to take a brief look at the modern world and would soon return to the trees .
But in the months that followed , shy Jarawa youths slowly gained in confidence and could be found hanging out on the side of a road recently built through their land .
Then they started to stop cars and buses going by , and to beg for food .
They even began to board ferries to travel between the islands .
No one knows why these people - one of the original tribes of the Andaman and Nicobar islands , a remote archipelago in the Indian Ocean - decided to leave the forest at that time .
Twelve years on they have become a tourist attraction .
Local companies take people to gawp at and photograph them as if they are animals in a zoo .
Some throw sweets and biscuits to them , or offer them lifts and money .
The majority of the Jarawa , thought to number about 250 people , remain deep in the forests , but some have learned bits of Hindi and regularly visit the port , the hospital or market place , says Sophie Grig , a researcher at human rights organisation Survival International who has visited the Andamans several times .
One or two Jarawa children have reportedly gone to a school and asked for education .
Integration has been partial and more or less at the Jarawa 's own pace and volition .
But now comes a threat that some anthropologists say could lead to the extinction of a tribe that has lived in isolation for millennia .
Barefoot India , a major Indian travel company , has just won a high court case that will allow it to build an eco-resort at Collipur , close to the designated Jarawa reserve .
Other hotels are expected to follow .
Barefoot , which already has an Andamans resort on Havelock Island , plans to bring in thousands of tourists a year from Europe to scuba dive and to explore the remote islands now becoming popular as one of Asia 's least visited beach destinations .
But Survival fears that the increased contact with tourists will inevitably expose the tribe fully to diseases and cultures that they will never be able to cope with .
" Evidence from around the world is that isolated tribal peoples have little or no immunity against diseases like flu and measles , and it is certain that the more contact there is between the tribe and tourists that diseases will devastate them , " says Grig .
" It 's not unusual for 50 % or more of a population to die soon after contact .
One epidemic can lead to severe depression , alcohol abuse , dependency and even suicide .
" It 's incredibly dangerous .
Why does Barefoot have to go there ?
There are plenty of other places . "
Grig continues : " The biggest concern is disease .
The Jarawa are incredibly vulnerable .
Then there 's alcohol .
People in this situation are vulnerable to addiction and dependency . "
A spokesman for Barefoot says : " Barefoot would not countenance any exploitation of Jarawa for tourism purposes from any of its guests , and most certainly will not attempt to do so itself .
The Jarawa have no access to the resort 's land , which is more than three kilometres away .
[ Far from threatening the tribe ]
Barefoot has had an extremely positive impact on the tribal interplay with the villagers in this area . "
There are perhaps 100 indigenous communities around the world that have chosen to live in complete isolation , but the frontiers of tourism are being pushed ever forward by cheap flights and an appetite for extreme ethno - tourism fuelled by the natural instinct of man to be curious about other people - and by shows such as Bruce Parry 's documentary series Tribe .
The Jarawa are peculiarly at risk because they live so close to a holiday resort , but dozens of other extremely remote groups are also in danger .
In the West Papua province of Indonesia , US expatriate Kelly Woolford of Papua Adventures offers - for $ 7,000 - $ 10,000 - to take tourists and camera crews deep into the forests of the Mamberamo and Baliem valleys , where he says they are quite likely to meet " stone age " tribes .
Papua Adventures does not guarantee " encounters " , but its " first contact " trek is advertised as a " full - on exploration " in areas where previously contact - free tribes are known to live .
Groups regularly stumble across tribespeople who appear to threaten them with bows and arrows , but who then disappear .
Anthropologists and others who have seen photographs have accused Woolford of setting up these encounters , but he insists that the meetings are all by chance .
" Tourism can be a useful source of income , but most people would say it 's pretty bad news for the local people , " says anthropologist David Turton .
Turton has spent 40 years among the semi-nomadic Mursi in the Omo valley in southern Ethiopia , where some women have had their lower lip pierced and stretched so that a clay plate can be inserted .
With the prospect of a giant dam flooding much of their lands , the tribe has enough problems , but it has been exploited by tourism now for 20 years .
Tour companies have presented the Mursi as the most primitive and wild people and the Mursi are fully aware they are being singled out as savages .
The tourists arrive in four - wheel drive vehicles and the Mursi gather around them , asking for money in return for being photographed .
Turton has asked the Mursi what they think of these people , who only seem to want their photographs .
He recorded this conversation in 1991 :
Bio - iton - giga : " Why do they do it ?
Do they want us to become their children , or what ?
What do they want the photographs for ? "
Turton : " They come because they see you as different and strange people .
They go back home and tell their friends that they 've been on a long trip , to Mursiland .
They say , ' Look , here are the people we saw . '
They do it for entertainment . "
Komor - a- kora : " We said to each other , ' Are we here just for their amusement ? ' "
" They conclude that white people are thieves .
The relationship is similar to prostitution , " says Turton .
" The Mursi know they are looked down on .
But to them the encounter is a commercial transaction .
They are short of everything and cash is important . "
Tourism has always been culturally destructive and exploitative .
Hundreds of people once lived in hardship but security on St Kilda , 60 miles off the west coast of mainland Scotland , but the community collapsed after first missionaries and then tourist boats arrived in the 1920s .
Within a few years of the first tourists , the community had disintegrated and those remaining on the island had to be evacuated .
Equally , the Himba in Namibia survived everything that a hostile arid environment could throw at them for centuries until they became a tourist attraction in the 1970s .
Their communities were overrun and many Himba are now beggars and alcoholics .
These days , tribes are regularly diminished in the name of economic advancement .
The refugee Burmese Kayan women in Thailand , who wear brass coils round their necks , each year attract thousands of tourists , who pay to visit them in their camps .
Their communities are disintegrating as alcoholic dependency grows .
Governments also act inhumanely to encourage tourism .
The Botswana government is putting out to tender for safari companies to build lodges with bore holes in the central Kalahari game reserve at the same time that the Bushmen - who have lived there for millennia - are forbidden to even use the existing ones .
One safari lodge will have a water hole less than a mile from the Bushmen , who will be made to walk hundreds of miles to collect water .
The worst destruction of indigenous groups is often invisible , done by governments and the tourism industry exploiting tribal groups for their land .
" Indigenous peoples are often removed from their ancestral lands to make way for tourist developments or to create national parks where animals take precedence over people , " says Tricia Barnett , director of Tourism Concern .
The watchdog group is to publish a major report on the human rights abuses of tourism in September .
" Tourism is violating left , right and centre all manner of the articles contained in the UN human rights declaration - land rights , dignity , respect , the right to privacy , cultural exploitation , " says Barnett .
But above all , land everywhere is being claimed at the expense of indigenous people for the construction of hotels and golf courses , and for the creation of national parks and reserves .
" The onward march of tourism involves the arbitrary removal of people from their lands , " says Barnett .
" Tourists are becoming often unwitting collaborators in the exploitation of others .
It is a competitive , resource - hungry industry , by its nature exploitative .
International hotel chains and operators jostle to expand and out - price each other , and impoverished governments compete to attract business by offering cheap land and tax free investment .
Indigenous groups are often the most vulnerable . "
" Tourism is land hungry .
It depends on unspoilt landscapes .
Time and again the indigenous peoples have their land grabbed .
They just do n't come into the equation , " says Rachel Noble of Tourism Concern .
But it is possible to get ethno - tourism right in an ethically sensitive way .
Jonny Bealby , who runs Wild Frontiers , which has been taking small groups of people to stay days at a time in remote places such as the Hindu Kush in Pakistan , says many eco-tourism businesses are starting up .
" These are joint ventures with indigenous communities , like the Achuar [ on the Peru / Ecuador border ] .
In the western Amazon , there are several eco-lodges where usually an agency sets up a partnership with a tribe .
The company and the tribe each have a 50 % stake .
On the whole , they seem to be perfectly respectful of each other .
The communities do it on their own terms .
The ventures are on a manageable scale .
It 's fundamentally a meeting of equals .
It comes down to scale and who is in control , " says Bealby .
" If [ ethno - tourism ] is done right it can benefit everyone . "
Successful ventures , such as with the Akha hill tribe in Thailand , Aboriginal cultural tours in Australia , the Garifuna tourism group in Honduras and the Il Ngwesi Lodge in Kenya , which is 100 % owned by local Maasai , are invariably grassroots - led and community - based .
" Tribal groups often feel that some tourists exploit them .
It happens when they are being observed as if in a goldfish bowl .
They do not like it when tourists stay in a swanky hotel and drive in and do not talk to them , then get in their Jeeps and go back , " says Bealby
" That kind of thing happens a lot .
But when it 's small groups and the money goes direct to local people , then the benefits flow both ways . "

It should be rather obvious that without any sustained job growth there will be no economic recovery .
In the same breath , you will have someone tell you that this is no common recession yet when it comes to talking about the stock market they will tell you that in normal times , stocks recover before jobs .
That is true if this were your run of the mill recession .
It is not .
When you have five states like Oregon , Rhode Island , Michigan , South Carolina , and California all having unemployment and underemployment over 20 percent then you know the unemployment situation cuts deep and wide .
With massive market volatility that has sent the S&P 500 rallying 40 percent in only 4 months .
That is not normal .
Most Americans intuitively know that without a broad based job recovery , there is little reason to believe this recession is close to being over .
Let us look at how widespread unemployment is across the country :
* Source : Zero Hedge
The current nationwide unemployment rate is 9.5 percent .
Yet if we look at the broader U - 6 number , we will see that unemployment is closer to 17 percent .
What does the full employment situation look like ?
Well let us break down the numbers to give you a better sense of what this is :
All said , we have about 26,000,000 Americans fully out of work or underemployed .
Things actually get tougher when you realize that many people are unemployed for much longer times as well .
Those who are long - term unemployed ( meaning they have been jobless for 27 weeks or more ) has surged to 4,400,000 .
Mass layoffs are also still in record territory .
Mass layoffs occur when a single employer will be laying off 50 or more individuals .
This is an important measure because it shows deep contractions in the overall industry instead of targeted niche layoffs .
In June , we had 2,763 notices of mass layoff action :
You ’ll notice that manufacturing layoffs are pushing the overall trend up .
I know that the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are concerned with Wall Street and banks but little is being done to improve the employment situation for the average American .
This is disconcerting .
Most Americans depend on employment and to the vast majority , their job is the economy .
Yet what targeted effort is being taken to compensate for the 6,000,000 + jobs that have been lost since the recession started in December of 2007 ?
Do n’t you think that a concentrated effort on jobs is more important than dumping trillions into the banking casino ?
I think most Americans that are laid off already understand what it means to be in economic chaos ; the chaos many were told would unfold if we did n’t give banks untold billions .
Yet here we are with 26,000,000 unemployed and underemployed Americans .
The job losses have been broad and are hitting each category :
You ’ll notice that the two biggest sectors hit were manufacturing and professional / business service .
These are higher paying sectors in relation to leisure and hospitality for example .
The only sector that saw some growth was education and health services but even in these areas , with government cutbacks we know job losses will be occurring here .
And this is telling .
Normally education and healthcare are the last bastions of hope in a deep recession but that is not the case anymore .
Even secure jobs like nursing are coming under fire :
“ ( Market Place ) A lot of people go into nursing for security .
That was part of the draw for 32 - year - old Narayan .
The former filmmaker was told Hopkins nursing grads often got hired , sight unseen .
The reason : hospitals desperately need nurses .
Now Narayan doubts there ever was a nursing shortage .
Narayan : I ’m like “ What shortage ?
I ca n’t get a job . ”
That ’s really the case .
I ’d cry but I can ’t .
I just want to laugh about it .
There are still job openings for nurses .
But vacancy rates nationwide are lower than they have been for years , says Peter Buerhaus .
The Vanderbilt University professor is lead author on a recent study of the nursing labor market .
He says in the last two years a record number of nurses have returned to full - time hospital work . ”
And this is occurring because men have taken on a large part of the layoffs and many women are having to go back to work to recoup lost hours for their family balance sheet .
That is the case in the nursing profession .
Many experienced nurses who might have worked a few shifts are now taking on more shifts to make up for lost hours by their spouses :
“ That ’s the story with Cynthia Yates .
She ’s been a nurse for 23 years .
She ’s trying to rebuild her family ’s savings , in part because of her fiancee ’s career .
Cynthia Yates :
He ’s in real estate .
So one of us had to have a steady position .
Yates used to be a freelance nurse for the Greater Baltimore Medical Center .
Better pay , more flexible hours than being on the hospital ’s payroll .
But last summer , her hours started to get cut , as staff nurses gobbled up the time .
Yates says by fall , the situation got grim . ”
It ’s all about the jobs .
Without a stabilizing employment picture there is little hope for a sustained recovery .

More than 50 studies were included in the review Organic food is no healthier than ordinary food , a large independent review has concluded .
There is little difference in nutritional value and no evidence of any extra health benefits from eating organic produce , UK researchers found .
The Food Standards Agency , which commissioned the report , said the findings would help people make an " informed choice " .
But the Soil Association criticised the study and called for better research .
Researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine looked at all the evidence on nutrition and health benefits from the past 50 years .
Without large - scale , longitudinal research it is difficult to come to far - reaching clear conclusions on this , which was acknowledged by the authors of the FSA review
Peter Melchett , Soil Association
Among the 55 of 162 studies that were included in the final analysis , there were a small number of differences in nutrition between organic and conventionally produced food but not large enough to be of any public health relevance , said study leader Dr Alan Dangour .
Overall the report , which is published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , found no differences in most nutrients in organically or conventionally grown crops , including in vitamin C , calcium , and iron .
The same was true for studies looking at meat , dairy and eggs .
Differences that were detected , for example in levels of nitrogen and phosphorus , were most likely to be due to differences in fertilizer use and ripeness at harvest and are unlikely to provide any health benefit , the report concluded .
The review did not look at pesticides or the environmental impact of different farming practices .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Gill Fine , FSA director of consumer choice and dietary health , said : " Ensuring people have accurate information is absolutely essential in allowing us all to make informed choices about the food we eat .
" This study does not mean that people should not eat organic food .
" What it shows is that there is little , if any , nutritional difference between organic and conventionally produced food and that there is no evidence of additional health benefits from eating organic food . "
She added that the FSA was neither pro- nor anti-organic food and recognised there were many reasons why people choose to eat organic , including animal welfare or environmental concerns .
Organic food is just another scam to grab more money from us
Ishkandar , London
Read your comments here Dr Dangour , said : " Our review indicates that there is currently no evidence to support the selection of organically over conventionally produced foods on the basis of nutritional superiority . "
He added that better quality studies were needed .
Peter Melchett , policy director at the Soil Association said they were disappointed with the conclusions .
" The review rejected almost all of the existing studies of comparisons between organic and non-organic nutritional differences .
" Although the researchers say that the differences between organic and non-organic food are not ' important ' , due to the relatively few studies , they report in their analysis that there are higher levels of beneficial nutrients in organic compared to non-organic foods .
" Without large - scale , longitudinal research it is difficult to come to far - reaching clear conclusions on this , which was acknowledged by the authors of the FSA review .
" Also , there is not sufficient research on the long - term effects of pesticides on human health , " he added .

Since announcing her resignation , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has been pummeled by critics who have called her incoherent , a quitter , a joke and a “ political train wreck . ”
And those were fellow Republicans talking .
Palin has been a polarizing figure from the moment she stepped off the tundra into the bright lights last summer as John McCain ’s surprise vice presidential running mate .
Some of that hostility could be expected , given the hyper - partisanship of today ’s politics .
What is remarkable is the contempt Palin has engendered within her own party and the fact that so many of her GOP detractors are willing , even eager , to express it publicly -- even with Palin an early front - runner for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination .

Some admit their preference that she stay in Alaska and forget about any national ambitions .
“ I am of the strong opinion that , at present day , she is not ready to be the leading voice of the GOP , ” said Todd Harris , a party strategist who likened Palin to the hopelessly dated “ Miami Vice ” -- something once cool that people regard years later with puzzlement and laughter .
“ It ’s not even that she has n’t paid her dues .
I personally do n’t think she ’s ready to be commander in chief . ”
Others suggest a delayed response to last year ’s shaky campaign performance , now that the race is over and Republicans feel free to speak their minds .
“ I ca n’t tell you one thing she brought to the ticket , ” said Stuart K. Spencer , who has been advising GOP candidates for more than 40 years .
“ McCain wanted to shock and surprise people , and he did -- in a bad way . ”

It is more than cruel sport , this picking apart of Alaska ’s departing chief executive .
The sniping reflects a serious split within the Republican Party between its professional ranks and some of its most ardent followers , which threatens not only to undermine Palin ’s White House ambitions -- if , indeed , she harbors them -- but to complicate the party ’s search for a way back to power in Washington .
Consider a USA Today / Gallup poll released last week .
About 7 in 10 Republicans said they would be likely to vote for Palin if she ran for president .
Other surveys place Palin in a statistical dead heat with Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee , the former governors of Massachusetts and Arkansas , respectively , who sought the White House in 2008 and give every indication that they will try again in 2012 .
Although any presidential poll taken this far out has to be taken with a sea ’s worth of salt , that is not the reason so many Republican strategists and party insiders dismiss Palin .
“ People at the grass roots see a charismatic personality who is popular with other people at the grass roots .
But their horizon only goes so far as people who think like them , ” said Mike Murphy .
The veteran GOP ad man eviscerated Palin -- a “ political train wreck , ” “ an awful choice ” for vice president , her resignation an “ astonishing self - immolation ” -- in a column published Thursday in the New York Daily News .

“ Professional operatives keep their eye on a broader horizon and understand , without independents and swing voters , she ca n’t win , ” Murphy said .
“ She ’s a stone - cold loser in a general election . ”
That , of course , is debatable and subject to any number of developments over the next few years .
A Palin spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment .
In an interview Sunday in the Washington Times , Palin said she planned to write a book and campaign for candidates nationwide , regardless of party affiliation , who shared her views on limited government , national defense and energy independence .
But the reaction to her resignation from Republican candidates around the country has been telling .
Asked if they planned to invite Palin to visit and campaign on their behalf , several of those facing tough races -- the ones who need to do more than turn out the party faithful or collect their contributions -- were not rushing out the welcome mat .

“ I do n’t generally need people from outside my district to do a fundraiser , ” Rep. Frank R. Wolf , a Republican from the Democratic - leaning suburbs of northern Virginia , told the Hill newspaper .
“ There ’s others that I would have come in and campaign , and most of them would be my colleagues in the House , ” Rep. Lee Terry ( R - Neb . ) said in the same piece .
Whatever one thinks of Palin , there is no question she has been subjected to a level of internal sniping -- friendly fire seems like a misnomer -- that is extraordinary .
The Republican criticism of Palin , 45 , began during McCain ’s presidential run , privately at first , then breaking into the open during the last troubled days of the Arizona senator ’s campaign .
Finger - pointing and back - stabbing are hardly unusual in politics , especially on the losing side .
But like so many things Palin- related -- the crowds , the adoration , the antipathy -- the verbal strafing seems of a whole other magnitude .
( How many other losing vice presidential candidates would merit a 10,000 - word exegesis in Vanity Fair , which depicted Alaska ’s governor as a narcissistic , one - woman demolition derby ? )
Advertisement
Some blame sexism , though again there is sharp disagreement between Palin ’s supporters and detractors .
Some think the former beauty queen has always been hurt by her looks , whereas others think her appearance has helped her considerably .
“ If Sarah Palin looked like Golda Meir , would we even be talking about her today ? ”
Murphy asked .
Others see a knee - jerk reaction from the political establishment , which will always frown on any populist outsider ( think Ross Perot , Pat Buchanan , Howard Dean ) , much less a governor who quits midterm and shows up on TV in hip waders .
“ The fact that she is a woman who ’s extremely attractive and dynamic and charismatic throws them for a loop , ” said Bay Buchanan , who strategized for her brother ’s two insurgent presidential campaigns .
“ Once they sense the first little sign of weakness , that ’s when they go in for the kill . ”
No one knows where the future will take Palin , not even the governor herself .
Her reemergence on the national scene and the scathing response from so many of her party peers underscore one thing , however : Republicans may hold dear their memories of the late Ronald Reagan .
But his famous 11th commandment -- “ Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican ” -- was laid to rest a long time ago .

A small terrier died in a hot car while its owner ’s girlfriend waited in a long line to audition for “ American Idol ” at Invesco Field at Mile High Stadium .
Quincy Vanderbilt , 24 , was served Tuesday with a misdemeanor summons for animal cruelty , said Lynn Kimbrough , spokeswoman for the Denver district attorney ’s office .
Vanderbilt drove his girlfriend from North Dakota to Denver so she could audition for “ American Idol , ” Kimbrough said .
He left the dog in the car with the windows rolled up early in the morning , Kimbrough said .
The recorded high in Denver was 91 degrees Tuesday .
Vanderbilt was supposed to check on the dog periodically .
By the time he did at 2 p.m. , the dog was dead , Kimbrough said .
Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson said temperatures soar in a car with its windows rolled up in the summer .
“ It ’s extremely dangerous . ”
Denver Animal Care and Control officials said that it takes only minutes for a pet left in a vehicle on a warm day to succumb to heatstroke and suffocation .
On a 78 - degree day , for example , temperatures in a car parked in the shade can exceed 90 degrees — and hit a scorching 160 degrees if parked in the sun .
“ We ’ve had a fairly mild summer so far , ” Kimbrough said .
“ But temperatures are heating up .
Clearly , it ’s a danger to people as well , especially young children . ”

Finding no errors which materially prejudiced appellant 's substantial rights , we affirm .
Art. 59 ( a ) , UCMJ , 10 USC § 859 (a ) .
Issue I
The first granted issue pertains to the correctness of portions of the military judge 's instructions .
Appellant contends that the judge erred in multiple respects .
As no trial objections were lodged regarding instructions , appellant concedes that these alleged errors or omissions must have been of a fundamental nature , such as where the judge had a sua sponte duty to instruct , or where they constituted " plain error . "
E . g . , United States v. Olano , 507 U.S. 725 ( 1993 ) ; United States v. Taylor , 26 MJ 127 , 129 ( CMA 1988 ) ; United States v. Fisher , 21 MJ 327 ( CMA 1986 ) .
In particular , appellant first contends that the judge improperly placed a burden of proof upon him .
The sole charge in this case was premeditated murder .
Premeditated murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with the " premeditated design to kill . "
Art. 118(1 ) .
Unpremeditated murder is the unlawful killing of a human being without premeditation , but with the intent " to kill or inflict great bodily harm . "
Art. 118(2 ) .
At trial , the defense made no attempt to deny appellant 's conduct , which indeed was witnessed both at the scene of the crime and at the hospital .
He also did not deny the intentionality of his conduct or offer a lack - of - mental - responsibility defense .
Para . 43 b , Part IV , Manual for Courts - Martial , United States ( 1994 ed. ) ; Art. 50a , UCMJ , 10 USC § 850a .
Instead , the theory of his defense throughout was that he had only committed voluntary manslaughter .
Voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being , with the intent to kill or to inflict great bodily harm , while " in the heat of sudden passion caused by adequate provocation . "
Art. 119(a ) , UCMJ , 10 USC § 919 ( a ) .
Thus , a significant focus of the trial was an inquiry into the nature and history of appellant 's relationship with his wife , his discovery of her infidelity , the extent and duration of his efforts to learn the identity of her paramour , his preparation for the killing and his pursuit of the paramour , and his demeanor before , during , and after the killing .
Unpremeditated murder is a lesser - included offense of premeditated murder , and voluntary manslaughter is a lesser - included offense of both premeditated and unpremeditated murder .
The only difference between premeditated and unpremeditated murder is that in premeditated murder the Government must prove that , " at the time of the killing , the accused had a premeditated design to kill , " while in unpremeditated murder the Government need only prove that , " at the time of the killing , the accused had the intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm . "
Para . 43 b , Part IV , Manual , supra .
The elements the Government must prove for voluntary manslaughter are , somewhat paradoxically , identical to those of unpremeditated murder .
Compare para . 44 b( 1 ) with para .
43 b( 2 ) , Part IV , Manual .
The difference between the two offenses is that if , notwithstanding the accused 's intentional state of mind , he kills while " in the heat of sudden passion caused by adequate provocation , " what would otherwise be unpremeditated murder is mitigated to voluntary manslaughter .
This latter mental state , though part of the statutory definition of the offense , is neither an element that the Government must prove nor an affirmative defense that the defense must prove .
Once raised , however , the Government must disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt .
Mullaney v. Wilbur , 421 U.S. 684 , 704 ( 1975 ) ( " [ T ]he Due Process Clause requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of the heat of passion on sudden provocation when the issue is properly presented in a homicide case . " ) .
In the instant case , the military judge instructed the members on reasonable doubt as follows :
You may find the accused guilty of an offense only if you re convinced as to guilt by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt as to each and every element of that offense .
( Emphasis added . )
The judge next listed the elements of premeditated murder , particularly defining the phrase : " premeditated design to kill . "
Immediately thereafter , the judge began instructing the members about the lesser - included offense of voluntary manslaughter .
He stated :
You 're advised that an issue has been raised by the evidence as to whether the accused acted in the heat of sudden passion .
" Passion " means a degree of rage , pain , or fear which prevents cool reflection .
If sufficient cooling off time passes between the provocation and the time of the killing which would allow a reasonable person to regain self - control and refrain from killing , then the provocation will not reduce murder to the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter .
However , you may consider evidence of the accused 's passion in determining whether he possess [ sic ] sufficient mental capacity to have the premeditated design to kill .
An accused cannot be found guilty of premeditated murder if , at the time of the killing , his mind was so confused by anger , rage , or sudden resentment that he could not or did not premeditate .
On the other hand , the fact that the accused 's passion may have continued at the time of the killing does not necessarily demonstrate that he was deprived of the ability to premeditate , that he did not -- and that he did not premeditate .
Thus , if you 're convinced beyond reasonable doubt that sufficient cooling off time had passed between the provocation and the time of the killing which would allow a reasonable person to regain his self - control and refrain from killing , you must decide whether he in fact had the premeditated design to kill .
( Emphasis added . )
Next , the military judge instructed the members on the offense of unpremeditated murder .
Again , immediately thereafter , he continued the instructions on voluntary manslaughter :
You 're advised that the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter in [ sic ] included within the crime of unpremeditated murder .
Voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being with an intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm , done in the heat of sudden passion caused by adequate provocation .
Acts of the accused which might otherwise amount to murder constitute only the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter , if those acts were done in the heat of sudden passion caused by adequate provocation .
Passion means a degree of anger , rage , pain , or fear which prevents cool reflection .
The law recognizes that a person may be provoked to such an extent that in the heat of sudden passion , caused by adequate provocation , he strikes a fatal blow before he has had time to control himself .
A person who kills because of passion caused by adequate provocation is not guilty of murder .
Provocation is adequate if it would cause uncontrollable passion in the mind of a reasonable person .
The provocation must not be sought or induced as a [ sic ] excuse for killing or doing harm .
If you 're not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of murder , but you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the killing , although done in the heat of sudden passion caused by adequate provocation , was done with the intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm , you may still find the accused guilty of voluntary manslaughter .
( Emphasis added . )
The military judge then gave an instruction distinguishing premeditated murder from unpremeditated murder .
Thereafter , he listed the elements of voluntary manslaughter and explained applicable terms .
Then the judge gave an instruction distinguishing voluntary manslaughter from unpremeditated murder .
Later the judge returned to presumptions and burdens , instructing :
You 're further advised , first , that the accused is presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt .
Second , if there 's reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused , that doubt must be resolved in favor of the accused , and he must be acquitted .
Third , if there 's reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt , that doubt must be resolved in favor of the lowest degree of guilt as to which there is no reasonable doubt .
And , lastly , the burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt is on the Government .
The burden never shifts to the accused to establish innocence , or to disprove the facts necessary to establish each element of the offense .
( Emphasis added . )
Thus , the instructions unfolded in this manner : First , the judge explained the elements of the two relevant types of murder and their relationship with voluntary manslaughter .
That is , he explained that , notwithstanding the Government 's proof of the elements of murder , if adequate provocation and passion were present , appellant could not be convicted of murder .
Then the judge explained the elements and content of voluntary manslaughter itself .
Finally , he explained that , if there was reasonable doubt " as to the degree of guilt , " appellant could only be convicted of " the lowest degree of guilt as to which there is no reasonable doubt . "
( Emphasis added . )
In other words , since " heat of sudden passion caused by adequate provocation " bars a conviction of murder , a reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt due to the presence of heat of passion precludes murder .
Though more elaborate than the penultimate sentence quoted from Mullaney v. Wilbur , supra , these instructions amounted to the same thing .
Different language might , of course , be suggested .
But the question before us is not whether the instructions can be improved upon , but whether they were so flawed as to now justify reversal , even though no objection was made at the point that improvement could readily have been implemented .
United States v. Fisher , supra .
We hold that the instructions were not so flawed .
Nothing in them gives us pause for concern that the court members believed appellant had any burden whatever .
Instead , we are satisfied that it was quite clear to the members that , for the Government to prevail on the murder charge , it had to disprove , beyond reasonable doubt , " heat of sudden passion caused by adequate provocation . "
The next aspect of appellant 's challenge to the instructions involves a phrase - -" mental condition " -- uttered several times by the military judge during instructions , again without contemporaneous objection .
Appellant seems to imply that , by using this phrase , the military judge wrongfully injected into the proceedings the possibility that appellant was suffering from some sort of medically or psychologically cognizable category of disease or abnormality .
To compound the matter , in appellant 's view , the judge never defined this term for the court members .
We consider these assertions meritless in this context .
In isolation , the particular instruction appellant now objects to was as follows :
Now , the evidence in this case has raised an issue whether the accused had a mental condition and required state of mind with the [ sic ] respect to the offense of premeditated murder and its lesser included offenses .
In determining this issue , you must consider all relevant facts and circumstances .
( Emphasis added . )
Of course the instruction was not given in isolation .
It was included within a major segment of instruction about the distinctions in state of mind between premeditated murder and its lesser - included offenses , including " voluntary manslaughter , if it was done in the heat of sudden passion caused by adequate provocation without time for cool reflection . . . . "
With obvious reference to our opinions such as Ellis v. Jacob , 26 MJ 90 ( CMA 1988 ) , and United States v. Berri , 33 MJ 337 ( CMA 1991 ) ( evidence of accuseds impaired mental state is relevant to attack mens rea elements ) , the military judge went on to instruct :
Now , you 're advised an accused because of some underlying mental condition may be mentally incapable of entertaining the premeditated design to kill , or the specific intent to kill , or the specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm .
You should therefore consider , in connection with all the relevant facts and circumstances , evidence tending to show the accused may have been suffering from a mental condition of such consequence and degree as to deprive him of the ability to entertain the premeditated design to kill , or the specific intent to kill , or the specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm .
( Emphasis added . )
This latter instruction , of course , was the very embodiment of the theory upon which the entire defense case was predicated -- that because of appellant 's agitated state of mind as a result of his discovery of his wife 's infidelity , he was so reasonably provoked and in such sudden heat of passion that he could not have premeditated murder or that , even if his acts were intentional , they were partially excusable due to his state of mind .
3 / As previously indicated , ascertaining appellant 's state of mind on the night of the homicide was essentially the only contested matter on the merits .
In that regard , numerous witnesses , both expert and lay , were called by both sides on the very point .
Nothing was more germane to this trial than appellant 's " mental condition " at the time of the offense .
His posttrial effort to infuse the ordinary phrase " mental condition , " in the context used by the military judge , with some exclusive technical connotation of psychosis or other formal diagnostic category , see , e . g . , American Psychiatric Association , Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( 4th ed. 1994 ) , must fail .
In the context in which the instructions were given , nothing could have been clearer to the court members than that the judge was referring to the veritable mountain of evidence adduced regarding appellant 's state of mind , his mens rea , and his claimed sudden heat of passion .
The absence of defense counsel 's objection or request for clarification corroborates the lack of confusion .
We reject this aspect of appellant 's challenge to the instructions .
Similarly , we reject appellant 's attack on the judge 's explanation of the difference between the affirmative defense of lack of mental responsibility -- which the defense did not raise -- and an attack on a mens rea element of the prosecution 's affirmative case -- which most assuredly was raised .
See Ellis v. Jacob and United States v. Berri , both supra ; see generally 1 W. LaFave and A. Scott , Substantive Criminal Law § 1.8 ( c ) ( 1986 ) .
Arguing that the military judge threw out the heart of the defense case , appellant lifts from a lengthy passage the following language :
Lack of mental responsibility -- that is , heat of passion defense -- is not an issue in this case .
The fuller instruction , although partially repetitive of passages already quoted , was as follows :
Now , the evidence in this case has raised an issue whether the accused had a mental condition and required state of mind with the [ sic ] respect to the offense of premeditated murder and its lesser included offenses .
In determining this issue , you must consider all relevant facts and circumstances .
Now , one of the elements of this offense -- of these offenses is a requirement of premeditation and a specific intent to kill as to the charged offense , and the intent to kill or inflict great bodily [ sic ] as to the lesser included offenses , on which you 've already been instructed .
Now , you 're advised an accused because of some underlying mental condition may be mentally incapable of entertaining the premeditated design to kill , or the specific intent to kill , or the specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm .
You should therefore consider , in connection with all the relevant facts and circumstances , evidence tending to show the accused may have been suffering from a mental condition of such consequence and degree as to deprive him of the ability to entertain the premeditated design to kill , or the specific intent to kill , or the specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm .
The guilt of the accused [ sic ] is on the Government to establish the guilt of the accused by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt ; unless in light of all the evidence , you 're satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused , at the time of the alleged offense , was mentally capable of entertaining the premeditated design to kill , or the specific intent to kill , or the specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm , you must find the accused not guilty of those offenses .
Now , this evidence was not offered to demonstrate or refute whether the accused is mentally responsible for his conduct .
Lack of mental responsibility -- that is , heat of passion defense -- is not an issue in this case .
What is an issue in this case is whether the Government has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the ability to entertain the premeditated design to kill , or the specific intent to kill , or the specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm .
In considering this issue , you may consider the evidence of the accused 's mental condition before and after the alleged offense , as well as the evidence as to the accused 's mental condition on the date of the alleged offense .
The evidence as to the accused 's mental condition before and after that date is admitted for the purpose of assisting you to determine the accused 's condition on the date of the alleged offense .
( Emphasis added . )
We acknowledge that the suggestion that the " heat of passion defense " was " not an issue , " taken out of context , would be erroneous .
In context , though , it is quite obvious that the military judge was making the distinction between evidence offered as the affirmative defense of lack of mental responsibility and evidence offered to attack elements of the Government 's affirmative case .
See LaFave and Scott , supra .
Given the extensive instructions elsewhere on heat of passion and voluntary manslaughter , we are certain that the members did not mistake the judge 's meaning .
We also find meritless appellant 's remaining criticisms of the military judge 's instructions .
For example , appellant complains that , at one point in the judge 's extensive instructions to the members regarding the various types of evidence before them , he mistakenly indicated that a witness identified appellant as the speaker of a statement heard by the witness , when in fact , the witness did not identify the speaker .
Civilian defense counsel promptly corrected the military judge , who immediately acknowledged and corrected his mistake to the members .
This illustrates the reason why parties must object in a timely fashion at trial or face the burden of overcoming plain error on appeal .
The matter was corrected , and the trial moved on .
As it happens , the judge was giving the foregoing instruction to explain to the members that , before considering the content of a statement allegedly heard by the witness -- which had indeed been offered for the inference that appellant was the speaker -- the members had first to determine whether appellant was in fact the speaker .
The judge went on to explain that , unless the members were first satisfied " beyond reasonable doubt " that appellant had made the statement , they were to " disregard " it completely and " give it no consideration , whatsoever . "
Ironically , appellant now seeks to leverage this instruction on evidentiary mechanics into an accusation that the judge was " highlighting " negative evidence about him and not summarizing the evidence in an evenhanded manner .
This particular instruction fell toward the end of a lengthy portion of the instructions in which the judge was explaining different categories of evidence , such as expert and lay witnesses and their opinions , circumstantial and direct evidence , depositions , stipulations , appellant 's good - military - character evidence , as well as the statement potentially made by appellant .
Nothing in these instructions appears to be less than evenhanded or to highlight negative evidence against appellant .
On the whole , we find the military judge 's instructions to be legally correct , fair , evenly balanced , and well - tailored to the evidence presented .
We find no instructional errors that rise to the level of plain error .
Issue II
In the second granted issue , appellant challenges the military judge 's rulings with respect to one of appellant 's expert witnesses .
4 / This witness , a forensic psychiatrist , as a member of the " sanity board " convened to evaluate appellant 's " mental condition . "
RCM 706 , Manual , supra .
Among many types of information considered by the board members , they personally interviewed appellant for a total of some 15 hours .
5 /
The issue before us concerns the use the defense wished to make of those 15 hours of interview .
Specifically , the defense wanted the expert to repeat or publish to the court members much of what appellant told them regarding his state of mind and emotions at the time of the offense .
Defense counsel argued that these statements were admissible under Mil. R. Evid. 703 and 705 ( basis of opinion ) .
6 / Moreover , counsel argued that the statements were independently admissible as statements made under the medical - hearsay exception , Mil. R. Evid. 803 ( 4 ) , as exceptions to the rule against hearsay .
7 /
Trial counsel disputed that the statements to the sanity board were " made for medical diagnosis or treatment , " arguing that " [t ] hey were made pursuant to a sanity board that was directed by the court , clearly for litigation purposes . "
Trial counsel also objected to allowing the witness to relay appellant 's statements , because it would amount to the defense " smuggl[ing ] the accused 's version of events in without having him take the witness stand . "
[ Appellant did not testify on the merits . ]
Based on argument of counsel alone , the military judge agreed that the medical - hearsay rule did not apply .
He reasoned that a person seeking ordinary medical assistance was " quite different from an individual facing charges of this nature , going before a government compelled sanity board , with a very strong motive to tell the board something other than what may be the truth [ . ] "
Regarding the claim that Mil. R. Evid .
703 and 705 permitted experts to relate an accused 's hearsay , the judge asked defense counsel , " [ I ] f that analysis were so , why would n't an accused in every case go tell a doctor everything about the case , and then just call the doctor in .
In that way , he could avoid telling his own story from the witness stand ? "
Ultimately , citing Mil. R. Evid .
403 ( " Although relevant , evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice . . . . " ) , the judge ruled that , even if the statements satisfied the medical - hearsay exception , he would " exclude any testimony concerning specific statements made by the accused during the course of the interview with the doctor , as I find that its unfair prejudice substantially outweighs its probative value . "
In so holding , the military judge was consistent with our opinion in United States v. Stark , 24 MJ 381 , 384-85 ( CMA 1987 ) ( military judge did not abuse discretion in excluding psychiatrist 's videotaped interviews of accused , which " would have clearly given appellant an opportunity to smuggle eight hours of testimony before the court members without subjecting himself to the crucible of cross-examination " ) , cert .
denied , 484 U.S. 1026 ( 1988 ) ; cf . United States v. Neeley , 25 MJ 105 ( CMA 1987 ) , cert .
denied , 484 U.S. 1011 ( 1988 ) .
It is important to note the boundaries of the matter here in issue .
We are not talking about limiting a party 's ability to probe the basis of an opinion offered by a party opponent .
See RCM 705 ; Giannelli , Expert Testimony and the Confrontation Clause , 22 Cap. U. L. Rev. 45 ( 1993 ) .
Nor are we talking about a party 's ability generally to develop and support its own experts ' opinions .
See United States v. Combs , 39 MJ 288 , 291-92 ( CMA 1994 ) .
Instead , we are focusing on what has variously been termed " conduit problems , " the " backdoor  hearsay exception , " or simply hearsay smuggling .
3 C. Mueller & L. Kirkpatrick , Federal Evidence 685 ( 2d ed. 1994 ) ; 2 S. Salzburg , M. Martin & D. Capra , Federal Rules of Evidence Manual 1368 ( 7th ed. 1998 ) .
Mil. R. Evid .
403 is a judge 's tool for preventing a party from unfairly smuggling hearsay , either as " basis " for an expert 's opinion or under the various hearsay exceptions .
Of course not all " smuggled " hearsay must be excluded at all times ; and certainly instructions can often be crafted to guide factfinders when appropriate .
Ultimately , the military judge retains considerable discretion in deciding when the prejudice is too great to permit admission of the proffered evidence .
See United States v. Sullivan , 42 MJ 360 , 363 ( 1995 ) .
Here , appellant 's expert was permitted great leeway in explaining not only his conclusions about appellant 's mental state , but also about the information he utilized in arriving at those conclusions .
Appellant , of course , was free , if he chose , to testify and present his version of the events and his state of mind to the factfinders .
Had he done so , the unfairness equation regarding the proffered hearsay evidence would undoubtedly have changed .
Under the circumstance , we are satisfied that the military judge did not abuse his discretion .
This issue is without merit .
III
In the final issue before us , appellant challenges the military judge 's decision to receive in evidence various books or pamphlets found in appellant 's quarters .
Portions of each item contained information or pictures about knives or knife fighting .
One was an Army Field Manual , another a coffee - table picture book about general Army life , still another a mail - order catalog .
One booklet and a pamphlet were specifically knife - oriented , denominated respectively : " Everybody 's Knife Bible " and " Your Silent Partner . "
The significance of the materials apparently relates to statements made by appellant at the hospital .
One of the German doctors who rushed to the room described appellant 's " logical , " " orientated , " " clear " statements as follows :
And the context of what he talked to us was that he felt humiliated and betrayed by his wife .
I remember that he told us that he found a list in her car with several names .
And he repeated some times , all of this .
And then he told us that he had learned how to disconnect a head from a human body , but we did n't understand very clearly where he had learned that .
We understood that he told us , " I 've learned that , " and the fact that the head was position [ sic ] on his neck and did not move at all showed us that that was done , in anatomical terms , in a very adequate way .
Consistent with this description , appellant 's wife remembered appellant saying , upon presenting the head to her :
[ D ] o n't underestimate me , I 'm very skilled at what I do .
I studied this , I planned this , I calculated this .
Apparently in response to such statements , the authorities looked for evidence corroborating this training or skill of appellant .
What they found was the books .
The defense moved in limine to suppress the materials .
The military judge found them to be relevant under Mil. R. Evid .
401 and 402 and not unfairly prejudicial under Mil. R. Evid .
403 .
Trial counsel did not mention the evidence in his closing argument , and the military judge did not mention it during instructions .
Thus , the materials were presented to the factfinders simply as relevant evidence ; there was no suggestion that mere possession of the materials amounted to misconduct in any respect .
Appellant now complains that the materials " were totally irrelevant " to his " state of mind , " since they were " purchased long before " the offense .
He contends prejudice was obvious ,
[ g ] iven the limited scope of the issues before the members , and the fact that the sole issue before them was whether or not appellant planned and premeditated this homicide . . . .
But appellant underestimates the logical significance of the evidence at trial , which bore no such restriction .
It must be remembered that appellant pleaded not guilty to the Charge and specification , thereby putting all elements in issue .
Among those elements was proof that appellant killed the deceased .
However obvious it may have appeared in retrospect that it was he who burst into the hospital room with the severed head , it was far from established ab initio that it was he also who perpetrated the fatal assault .
To be sure , as appellant himself observes on brief , his trial " defense counsel openly conceded in his opening remarks to the [ trial ] Court " that " appellant was the perpetrator of this offense . "
But opening statements are not evidence , much less conclusive evidence .
And since it is apparently not easy to cut off a head with a knife , evidence corroborating appellant 's expertise in this area seems highly probative of identity at least .
Moreover , just as appellant 's gruesome statements at the hospital were undeniably relevant to prove premeditation and intent , so evidence tending to confirm a knowledge of knife weaponry seems equally relevant .
Cf .
United States v. Orsburn , 31 MJ 182 ( CMA 1990 ) , cert .
denied , 498 U.S. 1120 ( 1991 ) ; United States v. Mann , 26 MJ 1 ( CMA ) , cert .
denied , 488 U.S. 824 ( 1988 ) .
Indeed , some of the books are roughly analogous to bomb - making manuals found in the residence of a suspected terrorist .
Other portions of the materials , to be sure , were only marginally probative at best .
Into this latter group fell the coffee - table book and the mail - order catalog .
But by the same token , these materials had no prejudicial potential .
Art. 59 ( a ) .
On the whole , we conclude that the military judge did not abuse his discretion in receiving the evidence .
The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed .
Judges SULLIVAN , CRAWFORD , GIERKE , and EFFRON concur .
FOOTNOTES :
1 / His approved sentence extends to a dishonorable discharge , confinement for 45 years , total forfeitures , and reduction to the grade of Private E - 1 .
The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed these results .
44 MJ 512 ( 1996 ) .
2 / We granted these issues for review :
I. WHETHER INSTRUCTIONAL ERRORS DEPRIVED APPELLANT OF DUE PROCESS AND A FUNDAMENTALLY FAIR TRIAL AND CONSTITUTED , AT THE LEAST , PLAIN ERROR .
II .
WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ABUSED HIS DISCRETION IN REFUSING TO ALLOW THE DEFENSE PSYCHIATRIST TO TESTIFY AS TO THE BASIS FOR HIS OPINION .
III .
WHETHER THE ARMY COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS ERRED IN FINDING THE ADMISSION OF BOOKS RELATING TO KNIVES OFFERED AS EVIDENCE OF " PLANNING ACTIVITY " HARMLESS WHERE THE SOLE ISSUE WAS WHETHER APPELLANT PREMEDITATED THIS HOMICIDE OR RATHER ACTED IN THE HEAT OF SUDDEN PASSION .
This case was argued at the University of Texas School of Law , Austin , Texas , without objection from the parties involved .
See 38 MJ 136 , 137 n.1 ( CMA 1993 ) .
3 / As appellant himself argues on brief before this Court :
There was substantial evidence that , at the time of the offense , appellant 's mind was so clouded by confusion , anger and rage that he was incapable of premeditating , and that he lacked a sufficient cooling off period following the discovery of his wife 's paramour that he was guilty of no offense greater than a manslaughter .
Final Brief at 27 - 28 .
4 / Though plainly not within the purview of the granted issue , n.2 , supra , appellant also attacks the judge 's ruling regarding a second defense psychiatrist .
Though unnecessary to respond , we reject this assertion outright .
That witness , a forensic psychiatrist , had been led far afield by both counsel - - especially by government counsel ( without defense objection ) - - into a variety of legal definitions and conclusions .
Finally when , on redirect examination by defense counsel , the witness ventured again into a legal definition of premeditation , the military judge intervened , in this manner :
----
I 'm sorry , counsel , I 'm going to terminate this inquiry .
This has gone far afield .
We 're now having a witness discuss legal principles and I 'm very uncomfortable with it .
Members of the court , I will instruct you on what the law is ; what premeditation means ; and you 'll follow my instructions .
Captain Mulligan , I 'm holding the Government responsible , because I think you drew this witness way beyond the purpose of his testimony . . .
Trial defense counsel was permitted to continue the examination of his witness regarding the mental nature of premeditation .
Appellant 's assertion on brief that ,
in effect , the military judge prevented competent expert testimony on a subject which would have been helpful to the trier of fact , to wit :
The appellant 's inability to premeditate the crime because of the fact that he was in a rage [ , ]
is unsupported by the record .
5 / Under Mil. R. Evid .
302 , the evidence considered by the board is privileged and cannot be revealed to the prosecution unless the accused " first introduces into evidence such statements or derivative evidence . "
Here appellant did introduce such evidence , inter alia , by calling the psychiatrists to testify on his behalf in support of the defense attack on the mens rea elements of murder and on " heat of sudden passion caused by adequate provocation . "
6 / Mil. R. Evid. 703 provides :
The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing .
If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject , the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence .
Mil. R. Evid. 705 provides :
The expert may testify in terms of opinion or inference and give the expert 's reasons therefor without prior disclosure of the underlying facts or data , unless the military judge requires otherwise .
The expert may in any event be required to disclose the underlying facts or data on cross-examination .
7 / Mil. R. Evid. 803 ( 4 ) provides :
The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule , even though the declarant is available as a witness :

Tips for saving more energy
The Verdict
You 've pulled some leftover mac n' cheese out from the refrigerator , glance over at your counter , and see a microwave and a toaster oven .
Which do you toss your plate of pasta into , if you 're looking to be the most sustainable ?
The biggest sustainability concern in this case is energy usage , and the microwave wins out handily over the toaster oven .
The best news is that you can easily verify this in your own home .
Most microwaves and toaster ovens have the wattage they use printed directly on them .
That number is pretty close to the actual power each device pulls .
So , if you have an 1200 W toaster oven and a 600W microwave , your microwave is generally using about half of the power of your toaster oven .
On average in the US , microwaves use 925 Watts , while toaster ovens average 1225W .
So , on the surface , microwaves use about 20 % less power than toaster ovens .
However , microwaves also typically require less cooking time , leading to more significant savings .
According to a 2006 study by the UK's Market Transformation Programme , microwaves used about half the power of toaster oven for similar tasks .
We 've run some numbers for a few common meals , assuming you have an average microwave and toaster oven .
Our cook times are based on either the packaging , or the exclusive expertise of Steven 's mom .
Other folks have found similar numbers .
But , as always , there 's more to the story than that .
That 's why we have the fine print !
It seems like cheating , but it 's true .
The biggest difference is the types of radiation that each uses to cook food .
Toaster ovens use infrared radiation , or heat coming off those glowing heating elements .
While this does a good job of heating the food , it also heats the air in the oven , the toaster oven itself , and the room around it .
Anyone who has touched the top of a just - used toaster oven can attest to that fact !
In contrast , microwaves work by using microwave " title= " Microwave " > microwave - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave ">microwave " target = " _blank " > Microwave " > microwave radiation to heat " title= " Dielectric heating " > heat - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_heating " > heat " target = " _blank " > Dielectric heating " > heat the molecules of just the food and container placed inside .
This saves a tremendous amount of energy from being wasted heating the appliance , and surrounding room .
It 's also important to note that microwave and infrared radiation have nothing to do with nuclear radiation , which can be dangerous .
When your microwave and toaster ovens are off , they produce no radiation at all .
Microwaves produce their electromagnetic radiation in much the same way as a fan turns electricity into the movement of its blades - there is nothing inherently dangerous happening !
From what we could find , both microwaves and toaster ovens are 100 % recyclable when disposed of properly .
Both appliances break down into various metals , plastics and glass that can be fairly easily reused .
Check out Earth 911's great recycling guides for where you can recycle yours .
In terms of creation , microwaves look to be a bit more intensive to make , but that difference is more than offset by savings in usage .
Surely not .
If you want a crisp crust of any kind , you 'll need to expose your food to infrared radiation , like that from a toaster or pan .
But for everything else , your microwave 's likely an option , and could save you some energy !
Microwaves are often thought of simply for reheating , but can also be used to prepare food , including everything from rice to hard - boiled eggs , and a whole lot more
There are a few other ways to save a significant amount of energy when using either or both appliances .
Place both your microwave and your toaster oven on a power strip , preferably one that you 'll notice is on !
Since many more advanced versions of each include electronic clocks , timers , and circuits , they pull power all the time , even when you 're asleep and there 's nothing to cook .
Putting all your devices on power strips is a great way to stop that waste of electricity , and on average , saves about 10 % of the power you microwave or toaster oven uses over its life .
This one 's not immediately obvious , but makes a lot of sense .
For larger frozen items , defrosting first can save as much as half the cook time - adding up to a whole lot of energy saved !
The chart below shows the energy usage for baking a large frozen lasagna , frozen and defrosted .
This is a particularly effective way to cook , and get the best of both worlds .
You can heat your meal mostly in the microwave , then transfer it to a toaster oven for the last minute or so , to get the crisp crust , potato skin , or tortilla that your taste buds request .
If you 've got both appliances , it does n't have to be one or the other .
Be creative , and try out new ideas !
For tasks that can be done in either the microwave or the toaster oven , the microwave wins out , hands down , in energy usage .
That 's this week 's showdown !
Toss us your comments below , and if you have ideas for a future showdown , let us know
LK lunar module for the L3 project During the 1960s , the Lunar Spacecraft , in Russian " Lunnyi Korabl " or LK , was conceived as a part of the L3 lunar expeditionary complex to be carried aloft by the N1 rocket .
From the outset , Soviet designers understood that despite being the largest launch vehicle developed by the USSR , it could only carry two - person crew on a lunar mission and only one to the surface of the Moon .
Previous chapter : LOK spacecraft without thermal insulation ) .
( requires Flash plugin to view )
Known specifications of the LK spacecraft : Height 5.2 meters Maximum landing gear span 5.4 meters
Total mass of LK spacecraft before descent onto the lunar surface 5,560 kilograms including Block E propulsion system ( fueled ) , including ... 2,950 kilograms Block E dry mass 525 kilograms Oxidizer mass 1,580 kilograms
Fuel mass 810 kilograms LK liftoff mass on the surface of the Moon 3,800 kilograms Payloads to the lunar surface Less than 50 kilograms Soil sample mass delivered to lunar orbit Less than 50 kilograms Crew 1 Habitable volume 5 cubic meters Lunar surface access Near Side , Equatorial regions Duration on the Moon with crew 1 day Duration on the Moon without crew Less than 1 day Similar to the American Apollo missions , LK was designed to separate from a lunar orbital spacecraft ( LOK ) , in orbit around the Moon .
After a descent to the lunar surface and , hopefully , a successful " moonwalk , " the cosmonaut would blast off from the Moon onboard LK and link up with LOK .
Following the moonwalker 's transfer back from LK to LOK , both cosmonauts would jettison the LK and depart toward Earth onboard the LOK .
However , unlike in Apollo , no internal tunnel between LOK and LK existed , therefore back - and - forth movement of a crew member between two ships would have to be done in spacesuit , via the same hatch in LK , which would be used to walk on the lunar surface .
Also unlike in Apollo , the same propulsion unit of the Block E would be used for the final phase of the descent on the lunar surface and for a takeoff .
The initial descent to the Moon would be propelled by the Block D stage attached to LK .
Block D would jettison and crash onto the lunar surface , after which Block E's engine would take over .
LK lander design A full - scale prototype of the LK lander used for training shows a possible early configuration of the spacecraft .
As a system , the LK spacecraft consisted of the lunar module itself and the Block E propulsion system .
However , structurally , the spacecraft would be subdivided into the Lunar Landing Aggregate , ( Lunnyi Posadochnyi Agregat , LPA ) and the Lunar Ascent Vehicle , ( Lunnyi Vzletnyi Apparat , LVA ) .
In turn , LPA consisted of a lattice - structured main body with a diameter of 2.27 meters and a four - legged lunar landing device , ( Lunnoe Posadochnoe Ustroistvo , LPU ) .
In its launch configuration , the stowed landing gear would have a span of 2.26 meters .
( 231 )
It would be likely deployed immediately after the jettisoning of the protective shroud in preparation for landing in the lunar orbit .
In 1965 , the development of the landing mechanism was subcontracted to KB Arsenal .
The lunar module consisted off following major elements : Pressurized cosmonaut compartment ;
Flight control avionics ;
Life - support system ;
Attitude control systems ;
Lunar landing device , or LPU , with four landing legs ;
Power supply system , consisting of chemical batteries attached to LPU .
Block E was permanently attached to the bottom of the cosmonaut compartment , while the LPA / LPU landing device was connected to Block E with a set of pyrotechnic devices , which would be severed at the takeoff from the Moon .
LPU also carried small solid - propellant motors designed to press the vehicle into the lunar surface upon touchdown .
They were developed at NPO Altai ( a.k.a NII - 9 , ANIIKhT ) in the city of Biysk .
In addition , a special retractable umbilical mast linked various systems in the LPA / LPU landing device to the cosmonaut compartment .
The mast would be retracted prior to the ascent vehicle 's blastoff from the Moon .
On all its sides , LPA was heavily loaded with various sub-systems and scientific gear including : a Planeta landing radar ;
a pressurized avionics container ;
two deployable communications antennas ;
three batteries ;
four containers with water for a vaporization unit .
The 105 - kilogram scientific package would reportedly include a 59 - kilogram robotic arm and a drill with an operational life span of 60 minutes .
( 231 ) The LVA ascent vehicle consisted of the cosmonaut compartment , another avionics compartment , the attitude control section and a Block E propulsion unit .
Like in Apollo 's lunar module , the 2.3 by 3.0 meter 's cabin had a complex geometrical shape dictated by its dual function as a landing and docking command center .
However where Apollo featured an angular multiplying shape , the LK crew module sported a complex combination of semi-spherical structures .
In its architecture , it clearly borrowed from the original design of the Soyuz spacecraft .
An interior view of the LK lander .
A circular cutaway in the front of the cabin contained a window which would afford a good view of the surface below the ship during landing .
The pilot could steer the spacecraft to a touchdown while standing at the controls , in case of problems with the nominal automated descent mode .
To save space and room , the cabin famously had no seat .
However , like all Russian spacecraft and unlike Apollo , LK 's cabin featured a normal nitrogen - oxygen atmosphere , instead of the oxygen - only life - support system in early NASA spacecraft .
The flight control system featured an onboard computer and enabled the cosmonaut to select the final landing site and conduct the approach and touchdown manually .
( 202 ) During its development , the LK lander went through several reincarnations , which becomes apparent when one compares different versions of the spacecraft preserved at various locations in Russia .
Block E propulsion system for the LK lander The Block E propulsion system , developed at OKB - 586 in Dnepropetrovsk , was one of the most critical systems onboard the N1 - L3 complex .
Unlike any other phase of the lunar expedition , a failure of Block E during takeoff from the surface of the Moon would inevitably result in the loss of a cosmonaut .
To improve the reliability of Block E , the one - chamber 11D411 engine had a backup 11D412 engine with two combustion chambers .
Combined , the two engines would create a propulsion system designated 11D410 .
Both were burning a mix of unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide .
Details inside Attitude control propulsion
To maintain its orientation in space , the LOK and LK spacecraft were equipped with a 11D73 and 11D76 ( DOK - DKP ) thrusters developed at the design bureau of Aviation Plant No. 500 , which was renamed Soyuz Tushino Machine Building Design Bureau , or TMKB Soyuz .
Thermal control system
In addition to an extra-reliable propulsion , the lunar lander needed a very effective system to remove heat while it was constantly baking in sunlight on the surface of the Moon .
Korolev 's design bureau ( known as TsKBEM at the time ) subcontracted the development of a thermal control system for the LK spacecraft to NPO Nauka .
This organization had extensive experience in development of life - support systems for Soviet aviation and space industry .
Within NPO Nauka , Department No. 59 took the responsibility for the development of the first Soviet vaporization device for use in space .
A special vaporizer was developed to remove extra heat from the spacecraft using boiling alcohol as a coolant .
The coolant was contained in a special tank divided by a flexible membrane onto a coolant storage and an air - pressurization chamber .
The unit had the capability to maintain the temperature of the coolant at a predetermined level .
The vaporizer consisted of four elements : the unit itself ; four coolant tanks ; valves controlling the coolant supply ; dosage controllers ; pressure sensors , to monitor minimum pressure in the coolant supply , which would indicate either depressurization of the supply system or out - of - coolant state .
On the vapor half of the system , it had a valve for the boiling pressure of the coolant , dosage device for the supply of the coolant into the vaporizer , a temperature regulator on the exit from the vaporizing chamber , including a control unit and temperature sensors .
( 346 ) Landing legs
In 1965 , a delegation of the 3rd Directorate of the Ministry , which oversaw the KB Arsenal navy weapons center in Leningrad , suddenly paid a visit to the enterprise accompanied by engineers from OKB - 1 .
The group requested the chief of Arsenal 's production I.A. Medvedev and N.N. Kazakov to develop a landing gear for the lunar vehicle designated 11F694 under a very short deadline .
Despite initial skepticism of the company 's leadership , three months later Arsenal 's engineers reportedly showed acceptable technical solutions to the design to their colleagues at OKB - 1 .
A special test stand , which was designed for trials of the landing gear and its amortization system was constructed outside of the department No. 837 at Arsenal 's campus .
( 559 ) One of the challenges of the project was the work with components of the gear made of titan , with which the company had little previous experience .
Due to tight schedule , two and sometimes three - shift work was required at KB Arsenal 's production plant .
( 560 ) By 1967 , several sets of landing gear for LK were delivered for integrated tests in Zagorsk .
KB Arsenal then worked on the development of landing gear for unmanned lunar probes , five of which operated on the surface .
( 559 ) Flight testing
The flight testing of the LK spacecraft started with a specially equipped helicopter , simulating the ship ' landing profile .
During a sortie on April 17 , 1970 , the flight control system of the LK spacecraft was tested during a helicopter test .
Three prototypes of the LK module , designated T2 K , were also launched into the Earth orbit on Soyuz ( 11A511 ) rockets .
During the flights , the ship 's Block E propulsion systems conducted multiple firings , simulating maneuvers during the lunar expeditions .
However due to the continuous failures of the N1 rocket and the subsequent cancellation of the N - 1 - L3 project , the LK module never had a chance to carry a Soviet cosmonaut to the lunar surface .

BACK to How to live well on very , very little
In the early days we almost never threw anything away in my family .
We 'd put everything away somewhere , ' just in case ' we found a use for it later .
Scrap lumber , metal , and paper , old clothes , broken radios and TVs , car parts , you name it , we kept it .
We often accepted the cast offs of neighbors and friends too , and simply added it all to the pile .
This drove my mom crazy , but it sure did come in handy .
Over the years we ended up actually re-using quite a bit of this stuff , often in ways we 'd never guessed when first putting it aside .
This often saved us from having to buy new items , or waste the time driving around shopping / looking for same .
So it saved us both money and time .
All us kids ( well , at least the boys ) thus became trained to always check the ' junk ' in the basement or garage first when we needed or wanted something .
We 'd scan the assortment of items , brainstorming on ways to improvise upon this item or that , to achieve our goal of the moment .
And so , we were being steadily trained in the art of ' aggressive exploratory recycling ' .
Of course , to be a master of this technique like my dad , you must educate yourself by all available means .
Schooling helps a lot -- but mainly serves just to get you started on your real education , in this field .
You have to be willing to learn as you go , on - the - fly , allowing what opportunities come your way to shape your studies and experimentation .
For instance , decades ago dad noticed some electrical motors being thrown away at his workplace , and realized such things could really come in handy in his own personal workshop .
So he'd gather up the discarded items and take them home and test and disassemble them to find and correct the problem , where possible .
Often it turned out to be simple fixes which were considered impractical for a large company to fool with , but well worth the time of an individual looking to cheaply motorize a home or small workshop .
He 'd replace worn out brushes or bearings , and end up with valuable industrial grade motors which in many cases would last the lifetime of a single household like ours ( which could n't stress motors as severely as a factory ) .
Indeed , I 'd wager dad still has some such motors ready to work at the flip of a switch today , that he first salvaged and repaired 40 years ago or more .
Of course , motors usually require the housing of frameworks or larger devices to really do anything .
So dad designed and built himself things like combination saw and grinder tables for such purposes .
He also built custom window fans to cool our non-air conditioned home in the summers .
Dad did things like obtain ' junked ' lawn mowers and electric drills from places like yard sales or the discards of neighbors , revamp their motors or other items needing repair , and add the once - again functional devices to the household armory .
Some 10 - 15 years back he built an electric lawn mower out of an old dead and motorless mower chassis , discarded car battery , and electric motor .
He 's used it regularly ever since .
Another motorless lawn mower chassis he did something quite different with .
During a spate of neighborhood vandalism , dad 's front yard and driveway became frequently strewn with very hard to see nails , which were a hazard to both his and visitors ' car tires and to anyone walking the area .
Dad checked his junk collection and found he had a motorless law mower chassis , and a large two - foot long magnet which had been discarded by a food plant maybe 25 years before ( it was originally used to extract metal objects from produce to be canned ) .
So dad put larger wheels on the chassis to raise its rolling height to accommodate the magnet , and viola !
he now had a ' nail sweeper ' .
This gave dad a tool by which he could comprehensively sweep the affected area of all nails early each morning .
I saw for myself its effectiveness .
It literally gathered up hundreds of nails , filling up bucket after bucket , over a several week period .
So besides removing a real danger from his yard and driveway , dad actually profited from the vandalism by adding to his carpentry nail supply .
To help keep us kids entertained and out of trouble decades ago , dad built an amusement park ride out of a single tall metal pole , four or five long lengths of chain , and maybe ten short metal rods or pipes .
This gave several kids at once a contraption they could each slip one leg into and hold onto with one or both hands , and fly at great speeds around at wildly fluctuating heights -- with the speed and height determined solely by their own physical exertions .
It was much better than a conventional swing set .
So much so that all the neighborhood kids preferred coming to swing on our special ride , than use their own store - bought swing sets .
As a teen I got into cars big - time -- especially race cars .
Unfortunately , I could n't afford to get the shiny new Firebird Trans
Am I drooled over in the magazines , and some of my richer high school associates managed to receive as gifts .
Fortunately though , me and dad were able to work together to pretty much satisfy my automotive yearnings in another way .
One which as a byproduct provided me with a substantial education in automotive systems , principles , design , troubleshooting , and repair ( That training would serve me and those around me well in the decades to follow ) .
Dad and I did a heavy customization of a 1969 Ford Mustang Mach One , with the goal being to incorporate many cutting edge features of the most famous race cars of the time ( this was ages ago : the nineteen - seventies ) .
One of these refinements was a large air dam for the front of the car .
The bottom needed to be flexible so it would n't break when it occasionally encountered a curb or the road itself .
So we shaped the upper portion from sheet metal and the bottom six to eight inches from an old thick rubber conveyor belt , thrown away by a factory .
It worked like a charm .
Heavier duty suspension parts ( like anti-sway bars and springs ) and sleeker , more functional body parts ( like air scoops ) from originally better equipped or newer versions of our Mustang were sought out and retreived from auto salvage yards .
Discarded steam pipes formed the interior roll cage .
Discarded aluminum conduit was used in building a custom dashboard .
We cut louvers out of a metal box which originally contained an air conditioning unit gone bad , and welded them into the hood for both cool looks and extra engine cooling .
Built our own custom grill with window screen and sheet metal .
I guess you get the idea here .
We were able to do some pretty neat race car customization of an existing vehicle using largely junk materials available for free or very low cost .
I 'd end up having quite a few interesting times with that car , before everything was said and done .
Another time I was embarking on one of my earliest stints of self - employment , and needed a heavy duty but still portable air compressor .
To buy a ready - made new unit like I wanted would maybe have cost a $ 1000 , and still would n't have been as lightweight and portable as I wanted .
So my dad and I figured out another solution .
I bought a tiny new light duty compressor for a fraction what the heavy duty tanked model would cost .
Dad happened to have a good - sized steel water tank among his ' junk ' stores , which we decided to make a part of the system .
This tank was several times larger in capacity than most of the new tank - compressors available on the market , and so would create less strain on the light duty compressor ( the compressor would n't have to run as often ) .
Plus , we figured we'd keep the portability and lightweight elements by keeping the system in two parts : the small compressor and the tank itself .
I could carry them separately to my set up sites , and instantly assemble or disassemble the whole set up using the quick connects / disconnects we installed in the plumbing work .
Dad also had a water pressure gauge we added to the system , only to use for air pressure here .
We installed handy valves while we were at it .
All the main valves , gauges , quick connects and the pressure regulator for telling the small compressor when to start and stop we built onto the top of the water tank , in a piping framework .
This mass also gave me a useful handle by which to lug the tank around .
We tied a rope harness around the tank to give me a few other handles too for moving it around with .
This set up worked superbly for many years , and is still functional today , if I need it .
Even the light duty compressor itself still works ( despite getting a tremendous workout for many years ) , apparently because dad and I designed the overall system so well the light duty compressor never became strained by its tasks .
In 2002 , my mom wanted a movable desk type of device that would hover over her bed to hold her flat panel desktop computer display , keyboard , mouse , and possibly other items so she could use them from the bed itself .
Within a day or two dad had put together an impressive , sturdy , and stable bed desk which spanned the entire width of the bed , offering more than enough desktop space for all mom 's needs .
The bed - desk was custom built to mom's bed specifications ( so someone else 's would necessarily be different ) , with a desktop 17 inches deep and 64 inches long , with a half - inch raised lip around every side but the one facing the user , so that small items could not roll off out of reach onto the bed .
A wooden panel on each end stands 29.25 inches high to hold the desk off the floor .
Reinforcements of various means were applied to where the desktop and side panels meet , among them a couple of boards 17 inches long ( cut to fit ) , 3.5 inches high and 0.75 inches thick , which conveniently double as exterior handles for moving the desk .
The desk can be easily pushed towards the foot of the bed for mom to disembark , and put completely away by removing the computer gear to a nearby standard desk , pushing the bed - desk all the way to the foot of the bed , and then tilting the bed desk over to lay on the floor and act as a foot stand to the bed , neatly tucked out of the way and almost unnoticeable in the room , despite its significant size .
The main three sections of the bed - desk consist of ( one ) the top of an old piano we disassembled to get rid of from the house many years ago , and ( two ) two panels from some old cabinets we removed from the house long ago too , during a renovation .
I have more tales where these came from , but you get the idea .
Aggressive exploratory recycling can save you tons of money and time , and expand your horizons in countless ways .
Of course , it helps if you have a spacious place to store all that junk until you find a use for it .
It might be that getting together with close family , friends , or neighbors of like - mind on such matters , and all storing their junk in the same fortuitous place , agreeing to share the spoils first - come - first - served could work out well .
However , everyone might also have to agree NOT to sell anything from the common store in yard sales / garage sales / flea markets once it had been placed in storage , unless all participants agreed .
One last point here :
You do n't have to restrain your ' junkstorming ' salvage efforts to physical resources alone .
You can also aggressively seek out pure ideas too .
For example , my dad loves building bird houses and feeders .
He 's been known to see an interesting but expensive bird house design in a store , or pictured in a mail order catalog , and build his own much more economical version later in his workshop .
Plus , by building his own , he can customize the design to his liking , scaling it up or down in size , or adding features he believes the store - bought version was lacking .
Similar re-use of ideas can be done with all sorts of devices you might see in stores , advertisements , or elsewhere .
Often you can get even more information about a particular design ( if needed ) by searching out references on the internet , or browsing through related how - to books in your local library or bookstore .
Sometimes the business promoting the original item will even provide free brochures , photos , and other info on request .
Of course , if you go beyond making such items for yourself and begin selling them to others , you might get into intellectual property issues where legal permissions and a licensing fee would be necessary , if your own design too closely mimicked that of another .
Things like patents and trademarks are considered serious matters in most developed nations these days .
That 's a whole other subject though , which is beyond the scope of this page .
If you have suggestions for improvements or additions to this page , please send them .
You never know : it might be your idea that saves the world .
Do n’t Marry A Soldier
Do n’t Marry A Soldier
The main reason there are so many sexual psychopaths and serial killers ( aka soldiers ) in the world is that women find them sexually exciting .
~ Roedy ( age : 70 )
Single soldiers are usually young , handsome and athletic .
No wonder they so easily turn a girl ’s head .
However , here are 49 reasons I think you should not marry a military man or woman .
You will never make a bigger mistake in your life .
I use the term soldier with the same metonomy Buffy St. Marie used in her song The Universal Soldier to stand for all military people .
This applies not just to the US military , though most of my examples are taken from the USA .
Think of it as like a prose folk song , something a father might sing to his daughter .
You must use your head as well as your heart .
Military personnel have a divorce rate twice that of civilians .
43 % of all military marriages end in divorce within 10 years .
source .
Why would military marriages be so fragile ?
Keep reading .
In , 6000 vets committed suicide .
Why ?
Because they were so ashamed of themselves that they felt compelled to execute themselves .
Think how many more vets are crippled with guilt who want to commit suicide but ca n’t quite bring themselves to do it .
Do you want to risk marrying someone who deserts you by killing himself ?
Do you want to be married to a man who has committed deeds so terrible he feels suicide is the only way to atone for them ?
Do you want to be tied to someone who is so suicidally depressed that no treatment or medication helps ?
Do you want a man in your bed , or near your kids , who has committed deeds so unspeakably awful he is too ashamed to tell anyone what they were .
This psycho signed a contract when he enlisted agreeing to kill any child for no reason other than he was ordered to .
It would be like asking Michael Vick to take care of your puppy while you were on vacation .
Psychopaths are incredibly charming .
They appear to be kinder and more considerate than normal folk .
They have to keep up this act because they do n’t actually have normal feelings .
When they are exposed , everyone is astounded that such a nice fellow could commit such crimes .
Look at the evidence .
If you partner has any history of killing or torturing others , he could well eventually come for you or your family under the right stressors .
Even Hitler was kind to his dogs .
Watching him interact with them , you would never guess what he was capable of .
Now 18 vets a day commit suicide — considerably more than are killed in combat .
If that many actually kill themselves , that means there are hundreds of times that number utterly miserable , just dragging through life wishing they could kill themselves .
Consider the effect of his protracted depression , then suicide on you and your children .
Even if he does not go all the way to suicide , you will be the breadwinner for the entire family , plus all the duties of wife and mother .
He will just drag you down into the pit of despair with him if you do n’t divorce him .
In the past decade , the US Army lost more soldiers to suicide than to enemy fire in Afghanistan .
~ Rachel Maddow ( age : 61 ) Drift : The Unmooring of American Military Power Since the soldiers know better than anyone exactly what is going on in Afghanistan and Iraq and they are killing themselves in record numbers , presumably what the soldiers are doing is quite a bit more shameful than the administration lets on .
When soldiers return from Afghanistan they often either attempt suicide or complete it .
Everyone knows that combat often leads to PTSD ( Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder ) , brain damage and suicide .
Suicide is more common than death in combat .
So the most important question is , why did these people enlist to go to Afghanistan in the first place ?
They were not conscripted .
Of all possible things to do with their lives they voluntarily signed on as soldiers , agreeing to kill whomever they were ordered to .
It was not to protect Canada .
Canada attacked Afghanistan , not the reverse .
Afghanistan was so impoverished , that an attack on Canada would have been impossible .
It was not for the money .
Military families often have to seek welfare .
It was not to help the people of Afghanistan .
Canadians refuse to donate even pennies to help people in the third world .
It was not for the travel to exotic places .
Afghanistan are hell holes .
What does that leave ?
They enjoy soldiering , namely bullying , killing , torturing and sometimes raping and pillaging .
When they get back they become terminally guilty and kill themselves .
It a natural consequence .
They deserve the same mourning as other multiple killers .
Your loved one will be off for months and years at a time .
He may be back only days before being shipped out again .
This can be a pretty lonely life .
If you have children , you will be largely raising them by yourself .
Without a full time father , they are more likely to have behavioural problems .
Your husband will probably be away when your children are born , leaving you to endure labour alone and missing those crucial first hours of bonding .
Ask any child of a military man .
They make distant , aloof fathers .
They do n’t bond properly .
The military whips recruits into good physical shape .
It is hard not to be swept away by that trim athletic body .
That is about the only plus and even that wo n’t last forever .
If you do decide to marry a soldier , that is probably the real reason .
Hormones are taking over your brain .
You are picking a good mate as if you lived in a cave and needed a muscular brute to protect you from wild animals .
Think of the misery you know others have found marrying a handsome bastard .
If your husband participates is an aggressive war ( illegal first strike war ) such as Afghanistan or Iraq , he is guilty of a capital war crime , even if he just peeled potatoes .
The USA currently does not recognise the authority of the world court and acts to protect its vets from prosecution .
However , the USA will not always be the world ’s only superpower and wo n’t be able to thumb its nose at the world court forever .
In the meantime , other countries are treaty bound to prosecute your husband if he steps on their soil .
Most do n’t do it because they fear the American reprisal , but that will not necessarily always be true .
There is no statute of limitations on war crimes .
Prosecuted or not , you are still married to a war criminal , guilty of the same crime as the Nazis hanged at the end of WWII ( W orld W ar II ) .
Unless he reaches high rank , he will never be able to provide for you and your family properly .
Many soldiers ’ wives live worse than those on welfare .
You will be transferred over and over .
You have to pull up roots on a moments notice and move off somewhere else .
You have no say in the matter .
If you have children , they will become army brats , children who never learn to socialise with other children since they are never in one place long enough to make lasting friends , children who do poorly in school because of the repeated disruptions .
You ca n’t have a career of your own because you are forced over and over to quit without notice .
All this moving means you ca n’t put down roots anywhere or make lasting friends .
You are nothing more than the wife of your husband , a decorative adjunct without value in your own right .
You wo n’t even have the support of your family since they may be continent ’s away .
If you have children , your mother and father will hardly ever get to hang out with their grandchildren ; that is quite selfish .
You may be forced to transfer your young family to some third world country , ripe with parasites , tropical diseases , poisonous insects and snakes .
Even if you do n’t transfer , your husband will bring back these parasites , tropical diseases and funguses back to infect you and your children .
You will constantly dread that phone call or knock on the door to let you know your husband has been seriously injured or killed .
There will be a knock on the door .
There will be a man in crew cut standing there who says , I am sorry for your loss in a rather wooden , bored way .
You will have to start your life all over from scratch .
Or it could be your husband himself in a wheelchair , looking many pounds overweight , speaking in a halting , brain - damaged , distracted voice , like someone with Alzheimer ’s , with an ostomy bag strapped to his stomach .
Loss of genitals is a common injury .
For the rest of his life , you are obligated to be his nurse rather than his wife .
All he will be capable of doing is eating , drinking beer and watching TV .
Your husband can be killed at any time .
It is a sword of Damocles over your head for his entire career .
He will leave you to care for your family as a single parent .
About 80 % of soldiers returning from combat suffer from PTSD .
He may panic at any loud sound .
He may wake up in the night screaming .
He may attack you imagining you are an enemy soldier .
He may become paranoid .
Make sure you learn what PTSD is before you presume love will automatically give you the resources to deal with it .
If you are unlucky , you will spend the rest of your life tending a mentally ill person who will be no company at all .
There are so many men out there unlikely ever to get PTSD .
Why waste your time on a cripple ?
Women have anonymously complained that the military trains their men to hide emotions .
They become emotional clams unwilling to face any emotional or relationship problem .
This drives women crazy .
Men in general have this tendency to some extent anyway .
If you discovered your fiancé had murdered his previous two wives , you might have second thoughts , ditto if you had discovered he had murdered a dozen strangers of random ages and genders just because he was paid to .
You are considering marrying a man who is under unbreakable contract to the government to kill strangers and who may have already done it .
If he later gets a crisis of conscience and refuses to kill one of his assigned targets , he can he shot on the spot .
What kind of person signs such a contract ?
Not even Mafioso enslave themselves to that extent .
Force always attracts men of low morality .
~ Albert Einstein ( age : 76 ) Soldiers often do some disreputable things under peer pressure that they avoid talking about .
This is includes drinking to excess , whoring , drug - taking , raping , bullying and terrorising , hazing , killing and raping children and torturing .
The fundamentalist Taliban had eliminated drug trafficking .
Under US military control , Afghanistan has risen to # 1 heroin producer in the world , selling over a trillion dollars worth a year .
This could not happen if US soldiers were not complicit in the drug trade .
Recall that a significant number of US soldiers returned from Viet Nam addicted to heroin .
The remote control nature of much of modern warfare ensures the primary targets will be children and civilians .
A soldier often does not even see his victims .
When he kills blindly like this e.g. with napalm , cluster bombs , land mines or white phosphorus , in a third world country like Iraq where most of the people are under 15 , inevitably he kills more children than adults and civilians than soldiers .
In addition when American soldiers attack they have a massive advantage in power , armaments and technology .
This power corrupts them to toy with the civilian populations , to torment them for amusements like a child tormenting insects .
The military likes remote control warfare because it keeps their soldiers safe and it protects the soldiers from emotionally feeling the impact of their butchery .
These soldiers look just like anyone else .
You would never guess from the soldiers ’ clean - cut faces what mischief they have been up to .
Recall the pudgy boyish face of Lt. Calley of the Mai Lai massacre in Viet Nam .
The domestic charms of house and home do n’t quite do it for them anymore .
These sadistic desires were always in the background .
The thrill of violence was part of the appeal for them enlisting — to commit cruel acts without any possibility of legal repercussions .
When you marry a soldier , you are marrying someone more prone to abusing you and your children too .
His standards of what constitutes acceptable behaviour are warped by war experience .
A Canadian soldier returned from the relatively gentle Afghanistan war with PTSD .
He repeatedly abused his infant triplet sons , breaking 19 of their bones .
He blamed the attacks on his condition .
Do you really want someone with PTSD anywhere near your kids or near you ?
The New England Journal of Medicine reported that American soldiers returning from Iraq are being sent home to their families without treatment .
According to MSNBC one in eight soldiers returning from Iraq are suffering from PTSD .
Less than half seek treatment .
Some soldiers are able to separate their family life from their life as killers .
They may appear completely normal and loving , though obviously it is great stress to do so .
double amputee double amputee
Your husband can suffer a brain injury or be made a paraplegic .
This is 2 to 8 times as likely as death depending whom you ask .
Professor Stiglitz of Columbia University said that as of , there were more than servicemen with brain , spinal , amputation and other serious injuries and about 20 % of those injured have suffered major head or spinal injury .
This turns him into a giant infant who has to be feed , bathed and diapers changed .
You are morally stuck with caring for him 24/7 for the rest of your life whether you continue to love him or not .
When you rip off the pretty bunting , what the military is about is killing , torturing , maiming and terrorising people .
In modern warfare , most of the victims are civilians and most of those are children .
On some level , your husband was drawn to this killing .
There is a cloak of respectability , even nobility that the government casts over it , but when you get down to it , soldiers do the exact same thing as Mafia hit men — kill just because they were ordered too .
Though they give lip service to personal responsibility , they are brainwashed to the point disobeying an order becomes unthinkable .
They consider deciding who has the right to live a superior ’s total responsibility .
At Nuremberg , humanity proclaimed that claiming I was just following orders .
is not sufficient excuse for murder .
Your potential husband , agrees with the Nazis .
He thinks he is morally off the hook so long as someone else gave him permission to murder .
How else could he make up excuses for killing civilians and children ?
Do you really want this man passing those sorts of dark genes to your offspring ?
Instead of spawning more little soldiers , you could just as well spawn more little criminals .
What sort of woman are you to choose such genes for your children .
It is as sick as marrying a criminal on death row .
Every soldier swears up and down he never killed any civilians and never saw it happen .
Oddly though , if you look at the statistics , on average , one civilian gets killed for every US soldier serving in Iraq , so it has to be common .
Perhaps they do n’t count deaths by incendiary chemicals , squashing with armoured vehicles , bombs burying alive in rubble or land mines , only shooting .
You also might wonder about a man that selected an occupation that would keep him away from his wife most of the time , especially when he spends that time in the company of young fit men excluding the company of women .
If he is a closeted homosexual or bisexual , getting married primarily to satisfy the demands of his parents and church , you are in for a life of misery .
He will never be able to truly love you .
He will never be true to you .
Gay men used to sign on as sailors in the days of sailing ships , but would have a wife , in name only .
Even straight men in prisons and in the military without access to women often resort to homosexual encounters .
Soldiers are often exposed to teratogens like DU ( D epleted U ranium ) , herbicides ( like Viet Nam ’s Agent Orange laced with dioxin ) , chemicals , chemical warfare , biological warfare , not to mention exotic parasites and tropical diseases .
This may cause cancer later , or even more likely will cause your children and their children to be genetically deformed .
Would you ever forgive yourself if your child was born hideously deformed , or even mildly damaged because of the damage these agents did to your husband ’s sperm ?
Over half the soldiers who served in the Gulf War , died of Gulf War Syndrome or were treated for it .
They were in Iraq for only weeks .
Your husband will be there years .
Not only the returning soldiers suffered from Gulf War syndrome , but also their children and wives .
Soldiers brought back loathsome diseases , parasites , toxins and radioactivity .
The military , in most cases , refused medical aid .
If you love and cherish your husband , you are encouraging and enabling him to do his job of soldiering .
Soldiering is a sickening , revolting job , and it takes the memory of a loving wife for many to continue .
You then became complicit is his war crimes .
You are morally tarred with his misdeeds .
Today , Canada and the USA only fight in illegal aggressive wars .
They are not defending their countries as did soldiers in past .
You are sacrificing yourself for goals as evil as any Nazi wife did , mostly killing civilians and children and teenagers who posed no threat to Canada , the USA or Britain .
Have a look at photos of some of the children hideously tortured and killed by the likes of people just like your husband .
The people who committed these atrocities appear just as sweet as your guy .
They do n’t have green saliva .
That is his dirty secret .
He gets off on killing and admit it , so do you or your heart would not be attracted to such a man .
If your soldier lover woos you and holds out the promise of marriage , but never seems to pop the question , consider he may already have a wife back home and he is just using you for sex .
Nazi soldiers were popular to start , but as their deeds became more and more widely known , all decent society shunned them .
Soldiers who serve in illegal aggressive wars to plunder a small nation ’s natural resources , such as the Afghan war or Iraq war , will over time become more and more pariahs , eventually subject to death threats and anonymous attacks , just as Nazis and Nazi collaborators were hounded .
They could even face kidnapping and prosecution as international war criminals .
The penalty for engaging in aggressive war at Nuremberg was death .
Today it would be life imprisonment , an even crueller punishment .
Consider how people who participated in the Viet Nam war have over the years become more and more pariahs .
The shame of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars will be even greater because of the use of banned weapons and torture and the craven motive for the war .
On a young woman told me she had gone to a bar and met a pleasant young man , who turned out be joining the military .
The young woman recoiled and asked How will you feel when you are ordered to drop a bomb ?
You will be killing innocent people , perhaps a child .
How will you feel about killing a child ?
He responded ,
It would n’t matter so long as it was a foreign child .
This is every soldier ’s true answer .
He could not kill children , a required side effect of modern warfare , if he were not that callous .
You can read Collateral Damage : America ’s War Against Iraqi Civilians or you can check with returning vets .
If a soldier is driving in a convoy , he will be ordered to run over any Iraqi child who gets in the way and not stop under any circumstances .
Your boyfriend knows this and is eager for the experience .
You do n’t want that sort of man anywhere near your children , born or yet to be born .
What sort of mother are you that you would leave your kids alone with a man who put no value on the lives of children ?
Military men can become addicted to combat .
They crave the danger , the killing and the intense emotional involvement with other men , the adrenalin rush .
Peaceful civilian life just bores them and they abandon their families over and over to get their adrenalin fix with their buddies .
Sebastian Junger describes the phenomenon in his New York Times best seller War .
Impersonal killers are like drug addicts .
The first time gives them the ultimate high and after that , no high is as good .
Unfortunately , the addict does n’t know that .
He will chase that high to the gates of insanity and death .
By now , killing is all our unsub [ unknown subject killer ] thinks about .
He ’s set up the exact same situation again and again , hoping to get the same result .
He begins to think he ’s doing it wrong .
He becomes obsessed with improving his skills , honing his m.o .
And tailoring his weapon to his deadly purpose .
He figures if he gets them all just right , if he can get his technique and his tools perfected , he ’ll feel that first high again .
He ’s becoming a more lethal addict .
and he ’ll never accept that the high is gone and it wo n’t come back .
He ’ll never stop .
Never .
~ Aaron Hotch Hotchner Criminal Minds played by Thomas Gibson ( age : 55 ) This addiction to killing is what really draws soldiers to enlist for pitiful pay , long hours and disgusting , dangerous working conditions .
Military life is all about giving and executing orders .
Mentally healthy people do n’t enjoy bullying or being bullied .
By marrying a soldier you are on some level getting involved in a relationship game of dominance / submission , even S&M ( S adism & M asochism ) .
If you are not into it yourself , you are setting yourself up for hell .
The fantasy may be titillating , but the reality is for most people either terminally boring or terrifying .
The military is all about hierarchy , status and blind obedience the very opposite of the teamwork equality needed for a good marriage .
What do you think of the wife of a serial killer , someone who murders dozens of innocent women and children ?
Someone like Karla Homolka .
You feel revulsion .
You wonder what sort of perverse motivation attracted her to such a killer .
You wonder how she could bear to lie in bed next to such a creep .
That is how many people will feel about you if you a marry a soldier , aka a hit man , a serial killer paid by the military to butcher and torture innocent people with illegal horror weapons such as napalm , cluster bombs , white phosphorus and land mines .
To create shock & awe , they use weapons that kill as more painfully than any civilian serial killer would devise .
Even after you come to your senses and divorce the creep , the shame will stick to you for the rest of your life .
How do you feel about Eva von Braun , Mrs. Adolph Hitler ?
She did not kill anyone , but she supported her husband in some rather unsavory acts .
Were she still alive , people would spit on her and try to run her down with their cars .
Your potential husband will be a war criminal , like Hitler , just not on such a grand scale , but if his deeds were known , ( especially torture , white phosphorous and crimes against children ) , it would bring equal disapprobation on you .
Some people will despise you even more than they despise the Nazi wives for your rôle is supporting and encouraging your serial killer husband .
The Nazi wives had the excuse of being swept away by masterful propaganda .
You do n’t .
You took on your support rôle with eyes wide open .
You can expect the hatred toward you to grow , just as it did the Nazi wives , as the deeds of their husbands became more widely known .
Many soldiers become addicted to dangerous drugs .
They are easy to get and cheap in third world countries .
They many not even realise they are taking heavy drugs .
For example in the Viet Nam era , Viet Cong would secretly salt American soldiers ’ beer with opium .
Further , soldiers lied to themselves that opium in this form was harmless .
They may take drugs to deal with the pressure of combat .
Drugs are known under local names and soldiers kid themselves they must be harmless .
Timothy McVeigh became addicted to methamphetamines while on duty in Desert Storm in Iraq .
This made him psychotic .
Life in a combat zone has few pleasures and many sorrows so soldiers commonly turn to drugs for relief just to cope .
On top of that the government gives soldiers upper to keep them alert on long missions .
Eventually the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq will be over and people from those countries will come as tourists or immigrants to the USA .
It is not rocket science to find out who “ served “ in Afghanistan and Iraq and even the atrocities they were involved in .
Your husband ’s victims may decide the only way they can have closure is to kill him , you and your entire family .
This is trivially easy to accomplish in peacetime thanks to the NRA ( N ational R ifle A ssociation ) .
Pray they do it in a way less painful and lingering your husband used .
The invasion and occupation of Iraq is illegal .
~ Kofi Annan ( age : 80 ) Secretary General and Boutros Boutros - Ghali ( age : 93 ) former Secretary General of the U.N.
I think in this case international law stood in the way of doing the right thing .
~ Richard Perle ( age : 76 ) , , Pentagon hawk , cat - stroking , Ernst Stavro Blofeld , James Bond villain pasty lookalike , admitting the Iraq war is illegal .
Since Kofi Annan and Boutros Boutros - Ghali of the U.N. have declared the Iraq invasion and occupation illegal , your husband will technically be an international war criminal .
This means he may at any time be arrested if you leave the country to travel in a country that subscribes to the International Court in The Hague .
The USA may not forever be powerful enough to protect him from prosecution , even on home soil .
It is a hanging offence , though more likely it will e commuted to life imprisonment .
Recall that some Nazis faced prosecution even into their 90s .
That possibility will hang over you the rest of your life .
Many returning from Iraq become mental basket cases unable to deal with the horrors of war and the guilt at what they have done .
They beat up their children and wives and are emotionally distant .
Friends and family reject them .
They ca n’t hold down a job .
They become homeless .
The become drug addicts and alcoholics .
Look at the way American treats the homeless vets of the Viet Nam and Iraq wars begging on the streets .
Watch some documentaries about the shell shocked vets .
One grabbed a clerk by the throat when she did not hand over the change with sufficient respect .
Others wake up screaming in the night decades later reliving trauma .
Most have marital breakdown .
The sound of packing bubbles popping sends a vet to the floor in cover .
Another found he could not handle his job clearing up road kill since he could not shake his fear there were bombs hidden underneath the carcasses .
You will become , at least to some extent , a nutcase .
28 % of Canadian soldiers returning from Afghanistan are classified as having serious mental problems such as suicidal tendencies , post - traumatic stress disorder or depression .
The Veteran ’s Association estimates 37 % of American soldiers returning from Iraq are classified as having serious mental problems .
Even the Bush administration admits 15 % of soldiers returning from Iraq suffer from PTSD .
On CBC ( C anadian B roadcasting C orporation ) Newsworld Sunday Night aired a documentary called PTSD : The War at Home about Iraq vets suffering from PTSD who snap and kill their families and neighbours .
According to the documentary , to get treatment for PTSD , there in a terrible catch 22 , men must sign up for another potential tour of duty in Iraq .
They ca n’t face that so they go untreated .
According to CBC Newsworld documentary , aired 16 % of Canadian soldiers returning from Afghanistan have a dangerous drinking problem , e.g. drunk driving .
I feel so ashamed of myself .
It is even worse than when I was in Afghanistan .
I have nightmares all the time .
I feel so empty because I do n’t know why I did what I did in Afghanistan .
~ Travis , Canadian soldier returning from Afghanistan .

He was a serial killer who killed a number of American teenagers .
The mothers of the victims screamed and hurled obscenities at him .
The families of your husband ’s victims will feel this way about him and you also for egging him on , though they may never get the opportunity to confront you both .
Strangers unrelated to the victims will also hate you and hold you in contempt for what you have done .
There is no way you will ever convince any of these people to forgive you .
You will be cursed in the strongest imaginable ways .
People will pray daily for generations for you to be tortured in hell .
Murdering , especially kids , is simply not acceptable .
You are a monster if you try to claim otherwise .
It is very common for such women to be in deep denial .
They claim their partners do n’t kill people , do n’t kill civilians or do n’t kill children .
When confronted with the statistics , they either deny the statistics or say only other soldiers kill , not their man .
They are also in complete denial about their rôle in supporting their husband in his career killing people .
They refuse to notice they buy their groceries with money earned killing people .
They are living off the avails of murder .
They are totally convinced their husband is a hero , and are baffled why anyone would have anything remotely negative to say about them .
They just ca n’t hear it when you explain why the husband is a war criminal , a murderer or a paid thug .
It is not that they disagree , they just ca n’t hear .
They keep asking over and over
Why are you so angry with me ?
That is the strength of their denial conditioning .
There are many additional reasons not to marry a soldier , which are reasons why your husband should not enlist .
Many of those penalties , you will feel too .
Perhaps your soldier boy has snowed you that he is a brave fighter for freedom , nobly protecting his country from the bad guys .
This was true in WWII , but it certainly is not true today .
First , neither Iraq nor Afghanistan attacked the USA , Britain or Canada .
The Afghans and Iraqis have not killed a single civilian ( unless you count mercenaries in Iraq ) in a war that has waged longer than WWII .
Bush claims that Saudis , not Iraqis or Afghans were behind 2001 - 09 - 11 .
The USA attacked unprovoked .
Even the WMDs ( W eapon of M ass D estructions ) turned out to be a lie .
Aggressive war is illegal under international law .
Under the Nuremberg principles , to aid or abet such a war is a capital offence .
The war in Iraq was not about Saddam .
Saddam was captured on .
The war did not pause for even a second .
It could not have been primarily about Saddam .
Further , Saddam offered to surrender peacefully just before the invasion .
Bush did not want Saddam .
He wanted Iraq ’s oil .
Bush promised liberation , but instead bombed the residential sections of Baghdad in a Nazi - like show of Shock & Awe brutality on the opening day of the war .
Decadent American cheered the spectacle live on CNN ( Cable News Network ) from their couches , much like Romans of old viewing a cruelty extravaganza in the Coliseum .
Bush has no interest in even worse dictators that Saddam such as Robert Mugabe and the generals who run Sudan .
Those dictators do n’t have the # 2 oil reserves on the planet .
Further , the USA installed a puppet dictator , an ex-Unocal man , Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan whose Ministry of Vice enforces the same repressive Shari’a Islamic religious law as the Taliban .
Clearly the Afghanistan war is not about freedom either .
The notion the USA would spend $ 2 trillion for the freedom of Muslims is absurd , especially when Americans have a strong racist hatred of Muslims .
On a per capita basis , USA is the stingiest of all the developed nations when it comes to foreign aid .
Americans are not spending these stupendous sums on the wars out of the goodness of their hearts .
It would be completely out of character .
They are spending them to get control of trillions of dollars worth of oil .
Your soldier boy is well aware of this , but he still likes to pretend he is seeking revenge for 2001 - 09 - 11 , or protecting the fatherland .
He is just looking for an excuse to rape , maim , torture and kill .
He is a sadistic serial killer .
That is what truly motivates him .
Listen in when he is drunk talking to his buddies about the real reasons he likes being a soldier .
No matter how smooth - talking , handsome , fit and charming he is , you do n’t want to get involved with a psychopath .
A soldier goes through strenuous training to teach him to obey orders without question and also to order others about brusquely .
This instant obedience is considered necessary for combat conditions .
However , that sort of behaviour is less than optimal in a loving relationship .
The movie The Great Santini explores what happens when military reflexes leak back into family life .
Some soldiers are really really stupid .
They are Nazis at heart , who just go along with killing without making any effort at all to see if it is justified .
They honestly think that Iraq and Afghanistan attacked the USA on 9/11 ( even Bush claimed it was executed by Saudis and funded by Pakistan , setting aside all evidence for inside collusion ) and they are killing peasants and children who have no weapons in order to protect their loved ones back home in the USA .
These are the sort of people who appear on Jay Leno ’s Jay Walking segment who are so out of touch with world events they do n’t even know the name of their president .
They do n’t make any effort to see if the murders they are about to commit are justified because they fantasise they will enjoy killing .
They do n’t want the facts to interfere with their fun .
Someone that stupid , that cruel and that selfish will never make an adequate bread winner .
The problem with marrying a soldier is that his is already married to the military .
You will always play second fiddle .
He will always do what they want , not what you want .
The military will decide what country you live in , whom you socialise with , when your husband will leave you and for how long .
They will decide whom your husband will kill next and what risks he will take .
They will even decide what sort of haircut he has and how he wears his facial hair .
They will decide where your kids go to school .
They will decide your income .
You are marrying a Momma ’s boy who likes being told what to do and by someone who is not you .
However , if you are foreign born and just want to get a meal ticket to the US - economy gravy train , marrying a soldier might make sense .
He will be away most of the time , so you wo n’t have to have much sex with him .
There is a good chance he will get his head blown off by an IED ( I mprovised E xplosive D evice ) or turned into a mental vegetable .
You can then marry someone else , without all his drawbacks , while you are still young .
Since time immemorial , man have escaped their duty to look after their children by running away to war .
Some of these points you will see clearly apply to the guy you are thinking of marrying .
Some of these points clearly do not apply .
Some disadvantages you may be unwilling to accept , but could well prove to apply later .
All I ask is that you think deeply before leaping into a marriage that could ruin your life .
Ask other women who have married men similar to the one you are planning to marry about the advantages and disadvantages .
The military has a culture demeaning to women .
Women soldiers universally complain of sexual harassment and rape .
Male soldiers refer even to their girlfriends as pussy .
Getting drunk and screwing whores is the traditional military bonding ritual .
The military culture teaches soldiers to treat women as objects , useful only for raw physical sexual gratification .
This makes them easier to kill without hesitation or guilt .
The military drills its soldiers to believe that violence is legitimate and to act on orders without thinking , without any hesitation .
It also teaches them bullying and torture are a legitimate way to get what they want .
Do you seriously want a man in your home with that sort of conditioning ?
who will react violently without thinking ?
It would be a bit like choosing a pit bull rescued from a dog fighting ring as a family pet .
Women who are sexually attracted to men who kill children should not be permitted near children either , not even their own .
A soldier makes huge sacrifices , abandoning his loved ones and family , risking health and life , eating revolting food and living in crowded , stinking barracks .
He risks brain damage and psychological trauma .
Why ?
In WWII it was to defend the homeland .
That does not apply today .
Neither Afghanistan nor Iraq is the remotest threat to the homeland .
It is for the opportunity to hunt people , kill people , hurt people , torture people , bully people and in some cases rape and torture children .
When he comes home , those dark desires wo n’t miraculously disappear .
Sooner or later he will take out his violence urges on you and your children .
Belgian UN ( U nited N ations ) troops forced a young Somali to eat pork ( extreme Islamic taboo ) , drink salt water , and then eat his own vomit .
Others roasted a Somali boy over a flaming fire and urinated on a murdered Somali .
These are Belgians , not Nazis , Russians or Americans .
Belgians are the people who perfected chocolate and pommes frite .
Why did these Belgian soldiers do this ?
Look at the glee on the face of the soldier on the left in the photo .
These men are sadists .
They enlisted for opportunities to humiliate and hurt people .
There no possible motive of self - defence .
Belgium is not under attack and if it were , the entire EU would race to its defence .
This same sadism is the reason young Americans enlisted for the Afghan and Iraq wars .
It is the same reason no sane young woman ( or man ) should consider marrying a soldier of any nationality .
~ Roedy ( age : 70 ) If you marry a soldier , you may have children with him .
50 % of their genes will be his .
Your children may well inherit his propensity for violence and homicide .
It may express itself it socially unacceptable ways .
They too may grow up to be hired killers .
Children usually adore their fathers and mimic him in every detail .
They take their values from him .
You see it all the time , generations of military families where sons grow up to be killers to please their fathers .
Soldiers are trained to kill for no reason and without hesitation .
Sometimes soldiers crack from battle stress and startle at any loud noise or footsteps in the dark and react instinctively as if they were back in battle .
Your husband could well beat or kill you and your children without even thinking .
Rent the DVD The Great Santini .
Some military men bring their notions of discipline home and drive their families nuts .
They are more likely to order their wives about and treat children as objects because that is what they are trained to do .
If you train a soldier to shoot a five year old without batting an eye , on the grounds the child might be concealing a grenade , you have to expect him to be somewhat callous when he returns to family life .
He will think nothing of dashing his infant son against a wall or threatening his wife with a handgun if she fails to do the dishes .
Think long and hard about why he enlisted .
Do n’t just blindly accept the first trite lie you are given .
Recruiting posters always talk of defending the homeland even when your country clearly attacked first and the other country is a small fraction the size of yours .
There are two kinds of wars : A war where your country is attacked .
A war where your country attacked someone else .
Usually in the first type there is a draft and in the second there is not , though there was a draft for the Viet Nam war .
There is a pressing need for young men to defend their country in the first sort of war .
In the second , there is not .
The first sort of war is legal ; the second is not .
Why then do people enlist for the second type of war ?
They are obviously well aware they will be asked to bully , torture and kill children , women and men , so they could not have that big an objection to doing it .
They like killing .
They are natural serial killers who seek a socially acceptable outlet .
They are sadists .
They seek socially acceptable outlet for their cruelty .
They want to get away from their wives and families .
They prefer male camaraderie .
They enjoy the adrenalin thrill of combat .
They love playing with high tech war toys .
They are rapists or child molesters seeking unlimited outlets where they will not face legal repercussions .
They have committed some crime and are looking for a way to quickly disappear until the heat is over .
There is a family tradition of enlisting in the military .
The enlistee has no mind of his own and does whatever his parents demand no matter how morally repugnant .
The enlistee is a high school dropout with no marketable skills .
It is a choice between becoming a drug dealer , going on welfare or enlisting and killing innocent people .
He chose to become the lowest - pay grade hit man .
They have master / slave fantasies .
The idea of big bellowing sadistic sergeant with his foot up their butt turns them on something fierce .
They are seeking a socially acceptable means of suicide .
These are just some of the good reasons to stay well away from such psychotic people as friends , lovers or spouses .
Notes
Women often write me protesting that they love their soldier husbands .
I do n’t doubt that .
Soldiers tend to be fit , sexy and fun companions .
I am just warning you of the dangers of selection one for a husband .
Hollywood usually portrays soldiers as adult boy scouts .
So powerful is that Hollywood image that Americans conveniently forget that their soldiers have killed well over a million Iraqi children .
That nobility might have described most of the soldiers in .
Do n’t and II , but not the soldiers who volunteered for killing when their own nation was not attacked e.g. in Viet Nam , Afghanistan or Iraq .
A more typical soldier today is a gang member who discovers the army is the only employer that will accept a loser like him , or a psychopath who wants free reign to loot , rape , torture and kill with almost no possibility of prosecution , at least from American courts .
Americans have no trouble believing soldiers from other countries are thugs , but insist their own are saintly .
There is no reason at all that should be so .
What drives this delusion is the same sort of idiotic pride that besotted the Nazis with their master race nonsense .
American soldiers have the same failings as any other soldiers .
Today ’s American soldiers are not draftees .
Of all possible vocations , they chose killing , mostly civilians and of them mostly children .
They are seriously sick individuals .
If anything , America behaves worse than any other militaries , ignoring the Geneva conventions as quaint , using routine torture and banned weapons .
It foolish national pride that leads Americans to claim their soldiers behave infinitely better than any other soldiers .
There are women who fully understand they are marrying serial killers / soldiers , but do it anyway .
They see me as hateful either for disproving of their husbands murderous activity , or for accusing their husbands of murder .
Some may be so naïve they do n’t believe the primary function of soldier is killing people , but most are completely aware of what their husbands do and they get a sexual charge from it .
They are repressed serial killers themselves .
They get their jollies vicariously .
They strongly do n’t like it that I have no respect for people who murder or egg on murders .
It is perfectly normal to despise child killers , or grandma killers .
These twisted women want us to make an exception for their husbands .
I lump them with the nutcases who marry incarcerated serial killers , trying to convince everyone else that under the murderous exterior of their partner lurks a lovable teddy bear .
They know perfectly well what sort of partner they have chosen .
They are living out their own sick fantasies through him .
The ones who marry soldiers are even sicker that the ones who marry the incarcerated because their partners are free to keep on murdering and thus provide endless titillation .
Oddly because of indoctrination with military propaganda , most Americas will buy the BS these women sling to defend themselves and their husbands .
I flatly refuse to believe such crap .
It drives them nuts .
They know what they are doing is wrong .
Having even one person call them on their lies stings their consciences .
Serial killers on death row may often attract a dozen or so female groupies .
Why are the women doing that ?
I think it goes back to our pre-civilisation days .
There was no law to protect you , just a big , mean , nasty mate willing and able to dispatch anyone who threatened you .
I think some women are acting on this primitive drive .
Even normal women prefer large , well - muscled men .
Then there are the large numbers of women pathologically attracted to men in the military who kill for a living .
The idea of killing excites them , but they do n’t want the direct involvement that they would get if they enlisted themselves .
One of the most bizarre excuses for the Iraq war that Americans give me is that they are defending their freedom from attack by Iraq .
What attack ?
2001-09-11 ?
Even president Bush on , said that Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with 2001 - 09 - 11 .
Bush said bin Laden , a Saudi and a small band of Saudi Al - Qaeda was responsible .
Everyone saw the USA bomb the residential sections of Baghdad live on CNN on , the opening day of the war , not the reverse .
There was no WMD ( W eapon of M ass D estruction ) attack .
There were not even any WMDs .
Perhaps Americans are offended that Iraqis attacked them when the US military illegally invaded their country and started plundering it .
That is defence , not attack .
What American freedom did Iraqis interfere with — the American divine right to steal ?
The war was not even about liberating Iraqis from Saddam since Saddam offered to surrender before the war and was deposed the instant the war started .
If regime change were truly what the war were about , the war should have ended as soon as Saddam was captured on ( 14 years and 4 months ago ) .
It raged on even more fiercely , without even a hiccup , indicating there was something else fueling it .
Hint what does Iraq have billions of barrels of that the USA thinks it desperately needs , needs badly enough to kill and torture children for ?
War is about stealing other people ’s resources .
The rest is patriotic bullshit to sell them to gullible people .
~ Roedy ( age : 70 )
Why ?
You might wonder why I wrote this essay .
The deaths of innocent people haunt me .
I think about them as I lie trying to sleep .
I try to think what I could do to stop ignorant Americans from committing these crimes , particularly killing and torturing children in Afghanistan and Iraq .
I feel personally responsible since it seems I am one of the few people who gives a damn .
I have found soldiers the most ignorant people on the planet and the most stubbornly proud of that ignorance .
They have been brainwashed into thinking killing and torture are good .
I do n’t have much hope of directly convincing them to give up their life of crime , though I try .
However , the women who support these men are perhaps a bit more amenable to reason .
If I could convince women to avoid soldiers as sexual partners , it would make life as a soldier more difficult .
If I could convince women to avoid soldiers as sexual partners , I could save those women from a life of misery .
If I could convince women to avoid soldiers as sexual partners , I could prevent those soldiers from passing on their defective genes .
If I could destroy the reputation of soldiers as life partners , then soldiers might avoid the profession just to get laid .
From the furious response , I am hitting a nerve .
I find it astounding that anyone will publicly champion child rapists , child killers and child torturers , but that is what the majority of responders do .
They are as sick as the soldiers .
If you have any doubts about your fiancé , those doubts are most likely to grow over time .
You need to be very sure about a choice of life partner .
A serial killer who will rarely be home is hardly the best father material .
You are choosing both for yourself and your potential children .
Save yourself heartache and choose a man you can solidly trust to be kind and loving instead .
You deserve that .
P.S. I am using the term soldier in the generic sense of anyone in the military , which would include navy , air force and marines .
They all chose to kill people for a living .
Most of them committed a capital crime by aiding and abetting either of the two illegal aggressive wars : Afghanistan and Iraq .
Debate
This essay tends to generate a lot of feedback of the form “ I want to / am going to kill you .
You are wrong .
Change it to be pro-US military .
How dare you not worship the ground US soldiers walk on .
You would not be alive if it were not for them killing children on your behalf .
The USA is # 1 , rah , rah , rah .
Everybody else is a stinky raghead .
You are not worthy to lick our asses . ”
It would be rather irresponsible of me to ignore all my sources and arguments and rewrite my essay to suit some anonymous boor on the Internet who offered no reasons or sources for his / her opinions .
If you disagree with some fact I have asserted , please point to a definitive source , rather than just saying everything you said is untrue However , I doubt there is anying you could say that would convince me to have even the tiniest bit of respect for someone who makes his living killing children .
I wrote this and related essays about circa .
Unfortunately , since then many of the supporting links have gone stale and I had to remove them .
Unfortunately , the most important ones were to documents on the Bush White House website , now all withdrawn .
That is not under my control .
I asked the White House to put them back , or archive them and predictably , they ignored me .
I consider people who approve of butchering children in Afghanistan and Iraq mentally ill , in the legal sense of not understanding the difference between right and wrong .
They are going to have to work very hard to convince me I am wrong , just as I would not take at face value something someone living in an insane asylum told me .
They will need to marshal facts and logical argument .
They ca n’t just bluster or bully me .
If they actually joined the military , when they enlisted , they signed a contract agreeing to butcher children for no reason other than being ordered to .
That makes them a repulsive and dangerous psychopath , in my book .
How can I possibly trust anything they say ?
By the way , those kids have every right to blow the damn heads off US military .
America invaded their country unprovoked and illegally .
You might ask , but did not the conscripts and enlistees of WWII do the same thing ?
Yes and they committed atrocities too , however , they had the excuse they had to defend their country .
Modern soldiers have no such excuse .
Neither Afghanistan nor Iraq attacked or threatened the USA .
I do n’t claim that each of these points in itself is sufficient reason to reject a soldier spouse or that every point applies to every soldier .
I am saying that you would be wise to consider each factor and to decide for yourself how well it fits your particular case .
I am saying that overall , soldiers are quite attractive in the short run because of their fit bodies , but usually will make your life miserable in the long run .
Go in with your eyes wide open .
Make sure you talk to a number of military wives first .
And do n’t say I did n’t warn you .
If you go ahead anyway , you fully deserve whatever happens to you .
I have written many essays critical of war and soldiers .
However , this is the one that drives the sadists who favour killing children apoplectic .
Why is that ?
Perhaps they feel confident I will never stop the Pentagon from providing them opportunities to kill and torture children , but women might read my essay and be convinced to cut off their supply of penis lubricant .
They already know they are poor relationship material .
This essay just rubs their noses in it .
That is why they squirm when they read it .
Exception
When there are no wars , soldiers do exercises to prepare for rescue from earthquake , flood and other natural disasters .
This is a challenging work and completely admirable .
The objections I stated above would not apply .
In the comments on the Keynes and Hayek thread , Nikolaj says of me :
My response was to deny that I know better than individuals how much money they " should " hold , and then argued that the point was that whatever quantity they wished to hold at the current price level , it should be supplied .
In thinking about this some more , it strikes me that I could have gone a step farther .
One could make the case that it is those who deny that MV should be stabilized who are really the ones who think they know better how much money people should want to hold .
The difference is that they believe that they know what the optimal nominal money supply is rather than the demand .
Both the defenders of 100 % reserves and a Friedman rule are , at least implicitly , insisting that the public 's demand for real balances accommodate itself to the nominal supply of money .
In the case of 100 % reserves , the money supply is essentially fixed and if the demand for money changes , the adjustments should take place through the price level .
( This is what Rothbard means by saying any supply of money is optimal - he 's assuming costless price level adjustments . )
Is this not simply saying to money holders : " I know you 'd like to hold higher real money balances , but we know this nominal money supply is the right amount , given our gold supplies , so tough cookies for you - you 'll have to wait out painful price adjustments to have your higher demand for real balances accommodated . "
In the case of a Friedman rule , the hubristic claim is that the selected growth rule is optimal no matter the short - run changes in demand .
Here too , the changes in money demand are dismissed and not seen as a reason to change the supply .
Both groups implicitly think they know better how much money the public should want to hold .
From a monetary equilibrium - free banking perspective , this is all very misguided .
Like any other good , markets should supply the quantity of real money balances the public wishes to hold and should avoid painful price level adjustments ( both up and down ) by doing so through changes in the nominal money supply .
The point is that ME - FBers have no idea what the optimal money supply is other than to say it 's whatever the public wishes to hold at the current price level .
We are not pretending to know how much money the public " should " hold , nor are we pretending to know how much we should supply .
What market institutions such as free banking do is to discover how much money people wish to hold and then supply them that amount , I would argue , in a way that minimizes the damages done from the inevitable imperfections of the process .
It is those who would tie the money supply to anything but the demand to hold it who are suffering from the pretense of knowledge or the fatal conceit .
Emma Watson and Rupert Grint may have momentarily distracted the world by flashing their underwear and contracting swine flu ( respectively ) , but at Thursday ’s New York premiere for Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince , Daniel Radcliffe was on an impressive charm offensive that made it clear which of the three is still going to be making bank when he ’s fifty .
We watched as he moved down the carpet , joking about his height , laughing at the sexual tension and drug-use allusions in the film , and gamely imagining who would win a battle between wizards and vampires ( “ Wizards !
Vampires have to get near a wizard to kill him and we ’d be able to keep our distance ” ) .
And he certainly got on our good side by telling us he wants to be back on Broadway in two or three years and is even taking tap lessons to get ready ( “ So far it ’s just a bit of shuffling …
If I do a musical I want to be proper !
Tap dance is so cool ! ” ) .
But it was his completely adorable interaction with a terrified 11 - year - old reporter from Scholastic News that won us over for good .
Imagine half a dozen pushy TV reporters shoving their mikes in Radcliffe ’s face as he zeroes in on a little girl holding her microphone with both hands , voice shaking so much she can hardly form sentences .
Radcliffe ( to other reporters ) : “ One moment , one moment .
I will come back to you .
[ Locks eyes with Scholastic News girl ] Hello ! ”
Girl : “ Hey. I ’m Danielle from Scholastic News . ”
Radcliffe : “ Hello , Danielle !
Pleasure to meet you . ”
Danielle : “ This is an HONOR to interview you . ”
Radcliffe : “ Oh , thank you .
You ’re very sweet .
Thank you . ”
Danielle : “ I ’ve seen the first and second movies and read the first and second book and they are SO good .
Especially the movies .
I loved them , the movies ! ”
Radcliffe : “ Thank you very much .
You ’re very , very kind .
They get even better than that , though , so when you get time or when your parents think you ’re old enough , you must watch the rest .
They ’re very cool . ”
Danielle : “ Um , and I have two questions .
How are you most like Harry ? ”
Radcliffe : “ I think in the way that we value our friends .
Friendship is very important in both of our lives .
I think I have Harry ’s natural curiosity as well .
He ’s interested in a lot of things in this world , as am I . ”
Other reporter : “ Daniel , how … ”
Radcliffe : “ One moment , one moment . ”
Other reporter : “ They told us to group together . ”
Radcliffe : “ It will happen .
One second , sorry . ” [ re - focuses on Danielle ]
Danielle : “ How did Harry change from the first movie to the second ?
I mean , the sixth ? ”
Radcliffe : “ To the sixth ?
Well , he grew marginally taller .
The films have gotten a lot darker since that first film , so I think he has had to get a lot tougher since then .
Thank you very much . ”
Danielle [ holding breath , then nearly dropping mike ] : “ Oh. My. God. Oh. My. God .
That was soooo cool ! ”
Update : Read Danielle ’s article !
While Whole Foods CEO
John
Mackey recently publicly inflamed the health care debate , behind the scenes Whole Foods has been quietly dismantling a key piece of legislation that would make it easier for workers who want to form a union to do so .
Whole Foods and Starbucks are backing a “ compromise ” to strip the Employee Free Choice Act ( EFCA ) of a key provision .
The so - called “ card - check ” provision would require employers to recognize its employees ’ union once a majority has signed union authorization cards .
Currently , employers often refuse to recognize new unions even if all their employees have signed up .
New contracts often take years to negotiate , meanwhile workers are frequently subject to harassment and sometimes fired .
The card - check provision is so central to this legislation , it has been called “ the card - check bill . ”
Food industry giants from WalMart , to meatpacking titans Smithfield , and Hormel , to McDonalds have sent out an army of lobbyists to fight the pro-union bill .
WalMart has spent $ 10.5 million in federal PAC spending since 2000 , plus contributions to other corporate front groups lobbying against the bill .
However , unlike out - and - out opponents of the legislation , Starbucks and Whole Foods have built labor friendly images by supporting fair - trade and offering better wages than some other chains , despite being aggressively anti-union .
Now it appears the retailers are cashing in on that image to modify the EFCA and remain , as Mackey says , “ 100 % union - free . ”
The hypocrisy is not lost on Whole Foods ’ employees - one states , people need “ to know just how false their [ Whole Foods ’ ] ' socially responsible ' image is , especially with regards to their own workers . ”
This summer Whole Foods employees are voting on their new health benefits package – the “ choices ” amount to a significant cut from the previous years ’ packages .
Reflecting employee discontent , a recent press release comments
“ It takes a truly unique culture to persuade people that submission is empowerment . ”
They go on to allude to the need for unions to confront these cuts , saying that without “ a method for organized , collective action workers can expect this promise from their employer , ' Whole Food Market reserves the right to change , revise or eliminate any of the policies and / or benefits at any time . ' ”
Several workers at a San Francisco Whole Foods store were fired this spring for incidents employees claim were related to their organizing efforts .
An un-compromised Employee Free Choice
Act would prevent that kind of retaliatory activity and provide the “ method ” to preserve health benefits that employees seek – but not if Whole Foods and other food giants strip the bill of it's teeth .
Though reporters have discussed the EFCA compromise as if it is a done - deal , AFL - CIO union leader Candace Lund reminds us , “ reports of the death of card - check have been prematurely exaggerated . . .
We do n’t have a compromise , just an article [ referencing one NY Times story ] . ”
Lund ’s support of the “ card - check ” provision is just one way unions are seeking better conditions for workers .
Within the food system , organized labor has played a significant role in job quality .
Research by the Institute for Women ’s Policy Research indicates that unionized workers in the retail food industry make 31 percent more than their non-union counterparts .
The premium is even higher for part - timers ( 33 percent ) , non-supervisory workers ( 45 percent ) , and cashiers ( 52 percent ) .
Union members are also more than twice as likely get part or all of their health insurance premiums paid through their job .
Yet , unionization rates have fallen from their post World War II peak of 35 % , to 26 % in 1975 and today only 12 % of all workers and 8 % of private sector workers are unionized .
This drop in union representation has come with a significant drop in wages .
For example , supermarket workers ’ real average earnings fell by 31 % between 1978 and 1996 .
Similarly , wages in the meatpacking sector have declined in real terms by 45 % since the 1980's .
The fact that food industry giants have come out in force against the bill is indicative of something larger .
Falling wages and health care coverage are trends that are recurring throughout the food system and public policy underwrites the decline - through selective enforcement of labor and anti-trust laws , but also through state welfare programs .
As the food industry has become increasingly concentrated over the past two decades– cost - cutting measures have disproportionately shifted to workers whose poverty line wages are often supplemented by Medicaid , food stamps , child nutrition programs , direct government payments , and other government services .
The total estimated cost of state and federal payouts for Burger King employees alone is over $ 273 million a year .
Multiply $ 273 million over all major fast food and low - wage retail food outlets , and the government is shelling out billions of dollars a year to subsidize the industry ’s bottom line .
According to research done by the AFL - CIO , in the company ’s home state of Arkansas , Wal - Mart employees are the largest group of Medicaid recipients from any one company , accounting for 40 % of the total state Medicaid budget .
One way to reverse this trend would be to make food sector jobs good jobs - by making it easier for workers who want to form a union to do so .
This is why an intact Employee Free Choice Act ( with majority sign - up ) is crucial .
Whole Food 's John Mackey is no fool – while he may have galvanized supporters of health care reform by speaking up , on the issue that will eat into his company 's profit margin , he remains silently , yet powerfully active .
Everyone has seen their share of once - domestic cats who have left the litter - box behind in favor of an outdoor life .
Feral cats have made the transition easily .
They are natural predators and able to fend for themselves .
Other domesticated species seem , at first , to be less able to make it in the big , bad world .
But pet birds , farm animals , and even aquarium fish have been able to thrive in the wild in certain situations .
Here are some examples of domestic species that have unexpectedly made a life for themselves outside the cage .
Australia ’s Feral Camels
( images via anra.com.au and jjron )
Camels were imported to Australia to help with the exploration and settlement of the Outback .
Their use declined with the advent of railways and automobiles , but the camels continued to thrive in the harsh environment .
Some estimates claim that there are nearly 0ne million humped creatures on the continent .
Because of their rapidly increasing numbers , hunting and eating camels is encouraged .
Feral Parakeets
The hardy monk parakeets , also called Quaker parrots or Quaker parakeets , have become famous residents of urban areas like Chicago ’s Hyde Park .
These wild parakeets are descended from pets and have somehow managed to adapt to the conditions and thrive in the city .
They are larger and louder than common budgies .
Feral Honey Bees
( image via Brisbane Insects )
Most bees were born in the wild .
However , some , like the one in Southeastern Australia in the picture , were actually descended from domesticated honey bees .
In the wind , they continue their hive lifestyle , creating honey that will never find its way into a jar .
Thailand ’s Soi Dogs
( images via Thai Dogs )
A Bangkok alleyway ( soi ) is bound to have a few rather mangy residents .
Feral soi dogs are sometimes fed by compassionate residents and sometimes able to scrounge food from trash or roadkill .
They are as much a part of the city ’s personality as its markets and temples .
Aquarium Fish in the Wild
Most of the tropical fish species that you ’d find in a pet store are bred specifically for the tank environment .
Hardy fish like koi and common goldfish are able to survive is most freshwater environments even if they were born in a tank .
For other fish , like the Pearl Cichlids that wreak havoc in Northern Australian streams , a more specific settings is needed to survive .
Wild Parrots
Perhaps the most famous animals on this list are wild parrots .
The red - masked parrots who starred in the documentary The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill are the poster children of the wild parrot population in the US .
In fact , there are communities of parrots all along the West Coast that are equally welcomed by residents .
Feral Farm Animals
It would seem that most farm animals are ill - equipped to survive in the wild .
What would a pig used to feeding at the trough do outside of its pen ?
But feral pigs and sheep are commonplace in rural areas around the world , especially in agricultural areas in the US .
Some are hunted like wild animals and others are considered a nuisance , eating crops and forever altering eco-systems .
Feral Cows of Hong Kong
( image via HKoutdoors )
It is a common sight worldwide : cows sitting lazily in fields , chomping on grass .
It is the same on Lantau , a sparsely inhabited island in the territory of Hong Kong .
The difference is that these cattle do not belong to a dairy or beef farm .
They are feral , but that does n’t seem to have changed their lifestyle much .
Hawaii ’s Feral Mouflon
( image via rarehawaii )
Hawaii ’s countryside is being eaten by the rapidly expanding populations of feral sheep and European mouflon .
Mouflon are thought to be the forefather ’s of domestic sheep .
Their appetites mean that they can mow through vegetation quickly .
With no natural predators besides humans , populations are difficult to control .
Bali’s Tame / Wild Monkeys
Though they are not , and were never , domesticated , it would be easy to mistake the Crab- eating Macaques at Ubud Monkey Park on Bali for trained pets .
They pester visitors for hand - outs and some are able to turn on the charm the way a clever dog who wants a treat might .
According to Balinese lore , the monkeys are protectors of the area ’s Hindu temples .
Feral Guinea Pigs
Last year , people began seeing a strange rodent on the Hawaiian Island of Oahu .
It ’s not that guinea pigs are a rare animal ; it ’s just that they are usually found in cages with wheels and water - bottles ( or as the main course of an Andean meal ) .
The large litters that these rodents can have makes them a danger to any natural environment into which they are introduced .
Some speculate that the original 40 sightings of feral guinea pigs last year where the result of one pregnant female being released .
An idiot allegedly racing his Lotus Elise against a Porsche around Salt Lake City crashed into an oncoming car last night .
Making this worse : his son was in the passenger seat , and he 's the one in critical condition .
The Lotus driver apparently lost control around a corner , over - corrected and slammed straight into a BMW X5 .
The passengers of the BMW suffered only minor injuries , but the passengers in the Lotus were trapped for 30 minutes and had to be cut out of the roof .
The 14 - year - old boy was life - flighted to the hospital while the father was well enough to be taken by ambulance .

And the driver of the Porsche , of course , fled the scene until he was later stopped by deputies .
The D.A. is still trying to determine what charges will be filed .

A U.S. ad featuring an Ontario woman who spoke out against the Canadian health - care system may be exaggerating the severity of her condition , say medical experts .
Canadian experts say that had Shona Holmes 's case been deemed an emergency , she would have received care in Canada within days .
( ( CBC ) )
Shona Holmes has appeared in U.S. ads saying she had to go to the Mayo Clinic in Arizona to be treated for a rare type of cyst at the base of her brain — a Rathke 's cleft cyst .
She mortgaged her home and paid $ 100,000 to be treated there because getting care in Canada involved a six - month wait , she said .
She is currently suing OHIP to recoup those costs .
Holmes , from Waterdown , Ont. , said she would have died had she relied on the Canadian health - care system and waited to see a specialist .
But the director of the brain tumour research centre at the Montreal Neurological Institute says he thinks that claim is " an exaggeration . "
Dr. Rolando Del Maestro says the lesion Holmes was diagnosed with is benign , and usually slow - growing .
It typically does not require urgent attention , he said .
" If it 's a real emergency in the sense that the patient 's visual function is getting substantially worse , the patients would be brought in immediately and would be operated on the next day , " he said .
In 2005 , Holmes , complaining of headaches and vision loss , went to see a Canadian doctor and was put on a six - month waiting list to see specialist .
After trying unsuccessfully to expedite the process , she was diagnosed and treated at the Mayo Clinic .
Holmes said U.S. doctors considered the cyst a tumour , and that it would cause death if not removed immediately .
But neurosurgeon Michael Schwartz of Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital says he 's never seen or heard of a death from a Rathke 's cyst .
He told CBC News symptoms can be alleviated if the cyst is drained or part of it removed to take pressure off the optic nerve .
" Then the person 's vision almost always improves .
" If somebody called me about a patient that was losing her vision or had a structural abnormality of the brain I would see them within days . "
Opposition to Obama
The contentious advertisement is being run by a conservative lobby group , the Americans for Prosperity Foundation , opposed to U.S. President Barack Obama 's plan to involve the government playing a role in reforming U.S. health care .
It warns that Washington wants to bring in Canadian - style health care that would cause " deadly " delays for people waiting for important medical procedures .
Holmes denies taking any money from Americans for Prosperity for her message .
Her publicist , paid for by the lobby group , says she 's now declining interviews .
But Holmes told CBC
News in an earlier interview she believes Canadians are not speaking up about the problems in the health - care system .
She said that every time she thinks about stopping her criticism of the system , she gets " another really sad phone call or desperate phone call of somebody who is tragically trying to get treatment in Canada and can't . "
Americans for Prosperity says it has spent nearly $ 1.8 million US running the ad in Washington , D.C. , and 11 states with key senators who are either writing health - care bills or wavering on the issue .
It is one of a handful of commercials that are expected to grow in number and criticism this summer as detailed health bills emerge from the U.S. Congress and dozens of interest groups , companies and labour unions tussle to influence legislators .
Through June 27 , $ 31 million has been spent for roughly 47,000 TV ads on health care this year , says Evan Tracey , president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group , a firm that tracks issue advertising .
So far , Tracey said about $ 15 million has been spent on ads favouring the Democrats ' push to revamp the health - care system and $ 4 million to oppose it .
Another $ 12 million has gone to ads generally favouring better health care , nearly all of it from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America , representing drug makers , which hopes its market will expand if more people have insurance .
Tracey estimated that $ 250 million will ultimately be spent on the campaign this year .

A bill that makes it tougher to hire foreign exotic dancers will also make it harder for live - in caregivers and other temporary workers to come to Canada .
Lawyer Richard Kurland , a Vancouver immigration - policy analyst , says it does n’t make sense why the Conservatives reintroduced the proposed legislation after a previous version did n’t pass in the last session of Parliament .
“ Logic means you ’ve seen evidence there ’s a problem , [ and ] you need a policy solution , ” Kurland told the Georgia Straight .
“ Logic is not a high priority on this bill . ”
Under Bill C - 45 , tabled by Minister of Citizenship , Immigration and Multiculturalism Jason Kenney on June 17 , a visa officer “ shall refuse to authorize the foreign national to work in Canada if , in the officer ’s opinion , public policy considerations that are specified in the instructions given by the Minister justify such a refusal ” .
The instructions , according to the bill , “ shall prescribe public policy considerations that aim to protect foreign nationals who are at risk of being subjected to humiliating or degrading treatment , including sexual exploitation ” .
Kenney ’s ministry issued a media release stating that the proposed amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act will “ protect vulnerable foreign workers such as exotic dancers and live - in caregivers who could be victims of exploitation ” .
However , Kurland said that bill is a “ blank cheque to refuse people ” .
“ The path that I see is . ” ¦” ˜Let ’s attack exotic dancers because we want to but we ’re not allowed to , ’ ” he said , adding that exotic dancing in strip clubs is a legal activity .
“ They ca n’t use the criminal law so they ’re going to use the immigration law on a morality issue . ”
Alice Wong , Conservative MP for Richmond and parliamentary secretary for multiculturalism , explained that the bill is intended more for exotic dancers , agricultural labourers , and those who may end up in “ sweat shops ” than it is for live - in caregivers .
According to Wong , one measure to evaluate the vulnerability of a person is insufficiency of funds .
“ If we allow them in , we are actually putting them in great risk , ” Wong told the Straight .
Wong confirmed that the bill is driven by Conservatives ’ aversion to foreign strippers in Canada .
“ That is one of the major concerns because , legally , according to admissible criteria , these workers can come in but experience has told us that once they come in , they will be exploited , ” she said .
Erika Del Carmen Fuchs of the Justicia for Migrant Workers B.C. does n’t agree with the Conservative approach .
Fuchs told the Straight : “ If there ’s a problem with human trafficking , they should go after traffickers , not the people being trafficked . ”
In May , two Filipino caregivers alleged mistreatment by Liberal MP Ruby Dhalla ’s family .
The caregivers claimed that they worked 12 to 16 hours a day and that their passports were confiscated .
If the bill becomes law and is applied to cases similar to the Dhalla affair , Kurland said that the only remedy available for caregivers would be to get kicked out of Canada .
“ The only way I see them helping people is to say , ” ˜We ’re going to help you by not letting you come here , ’ ” Kurland said .
Strip club owners already find it almost impossible to bring women to Canada .
In a letter to Parliament ’s citizenship and immigration committee in 2008 , Tim Lambrinos , executive director of the Adult Entertainment Association of Canada , pointed out that from about 1,000 visas for strippers issued in an unspecified previous year , the government issued only 17 in 2007 and half of 2006 combined .
In a phone interview from Toronto , Lambrinos said that in 2008 , only about 10 visas for foreign strippers were granted .
“ I want to know the name of one Canadian employer , of an exotic club owner who has been charged or convicted of any crime of any form of exploitation against foreign women working as an exotic dancer in Canada in the last five years , ” Lambrinos told the Straight .
“ There ’s not one . ”
In 2008 , 192,519 temporary foreign workers were admitted to Canada .
On the day the Conservatives tabled Bill C - 45 , Liberal MP Joyce Murray sought unanimous consent on her motion for a plan to address human trafficking and sexual exploitation of vulnerable persons .
According to Murray , all parties supported the motion except the Conservatives .
“ This is a poor excuse for addressing human trafficking , ” Murray told the Straight , in reference to the bill .
The Multicultural Helping House Society will host a conference for caregivers at the St. Mary ’s Ukrainian Catholic Centre at 3150 Ash Street in Vancouver on July 18 .
According to the group ’s programs director , Maria Javier , Bill C - 45 will give too much discretionary powers to visa officers in Canadian embassies .
In one of the whiniest tirades I ’ve read written by anyone over 3 feet tall , the European Publishers Council released the the so - called “ Hamburg Declaration on Intellecutal Property Rights ” in June .
The temper tantrum Declaration was signed by around 160 publishers and was meant to prompt the European Commission into action , calling on it to improve the “ protection of intellectual property on the [ i] nternet . ”
Some gems from the document :
Numerous providers are using the work of authors , publishers and broadcasters without paying for it .
Over the long term , this threatens the production of high - quality content and the existence of independent journalism .
I wo n’t even get into how this is totally not true .
Oh by the way , signatories included folks from the Wall Street Journal , the Financial Times Group , Ringier and Axel Springer ….all bastions of independent journalism .
There should be no parts of the Internet where laws do not apply .
Oh really ?
Legislators and governments at the national and international level should protect more effectively the intellectual creation of value by authors , publishers and broadcasters .
Unauthorized use of intellectual property must remain prohibited whatever the means of distribution .
Yikes .
I did n’t ask permission to cut and paste .
Sorry y’all .
In any case , Google was one of the first to respond to the EPC ’s call with a helpful hint : Exclude yourself from Google .
“ There has grown in the minds of certain groups in this country the idea that just because a man or corporation has made a profit out of the public for a number of years , the government and the courts are charged with guaranteeing such a profit in the future , even in the face of changing circumstances and contrary to public interest .
This strange doctrine is supported by neither statute or common law .
Neither corporations or individuals have the right to come into court and ask that the clock of history be stopped , or turned back . ”

He who receives an idea from me , receives instruction himself without lessening mine ; as he who lights his taper at mine , receives light without darkening me .
Super high - resolution spy satellites have been imaging sea ice at the poles for the last decade on behalf of earth scientists .
But the images has been kept from the public and nearly all scientists , too .
Over the last 10 years , a tiny group of scientists with security clearance was able to see some of the images , but could n't use them publicly .
Now , mere hours after a National Academy of Sciences committee recommended that the intelligence community " should release and disseminate all Arctic sea ice " imagery that can be created from the classified satellite data , the United States Geological Service has published the set of high - res images .
The new data provides what NAS committee member Thorsten Markus called " a dramatic improvement " in what we can see .
The previously off - limits sea ice data has a resolution of one meter .
The previous scientific standard sea ice images from the Landsat program have a resolution of 15 meters .
Markus saw some of the sea ice images last December when the committee reviewed the scientific value of the spy satellite data .
" It 's a very nice data set , " Markus said .
" I think people will jump on it , quite frankly . "
With the new info in hand , scientists should be able to build better models of smaller sea-ice features like melt ponds and ridges .
Both are believed to have important roles in sea ice dynamics , but how important they are remains unclear .
It 's not just the high resolution of the satellite data that 's got scientists excited .
The intelligence community has also been snapping photos of more locations and for longer than anyone else .
" [ The data ] is better in quality , it 's longer in duration and it's broader in coverage , " said Peter Gleick , president of the Pacific Institute , who did not contribute to the new report , but is looking at similar issues for the National Academy of Sciences .
Gleick noted that the information release could be part of a larger trend in which the scientific and intelligence communities realize that they share a concern for environmental problems .
" The intelligence community is increasingly aware that some of these global environmental issues are also security issues .
And in that sense , working with the scientific community in an open way helps both communities , " Gleick said .
" If we can reduce environmental threats and reduce security risks at the same time by releasing more data , then we 're all better off .
That 's the key .
And that 's why there is more cooperation in this area . "
In this case , the data release went incredibly smoothly .
Less than a day after the NAS panel briefed Congress Tuesday , and within hours of the report 's official publication , the website with the images went live .
" I was shocked , in a positive way , " said Markus .
" Normally , you do a recommendation and then nothing happens for months .
This is quite unusual . "

France 's history of republicanism and anti-clericalism goes back to the revolution of 1789 .
The secular republic fiercely protects the rigid separation of the state from organised religion , established in 1905 .
In 2004 , after a heated national debate , a law reasserted France 's cherished religious neutrality in public schools , banning the wearing of conspicuous religious symbols in state schools – including Muslim headscarves , Jewish caps and Sikh turbans .
French civil servants and public sector staff cannot wear religious symbols while working in state offices .
But there is no law preventing headscarves or religious symbols being worn by members of the public in public spaces .
The current debate over whether to ban full Islamic veils from being worn in public places intensified after Barack Obama 's recent Middle East speech hit a raw nerve in France .
He said it was " important for western countries to avoid impeding Muslim citizens from practising religion as they see fit – for instance , by dictating what clothes a Muslim woman should wear " .
This was seen by some politicians as a jibe at France .

Tux Racer 0.61a Released for Windows
Wednesday , February 21 , 2001 Tux Racer 0.61a has been released for Windows .
This is a small patch on the 0.61 package for Windows ; the only difference is that a more recent version of SDL.dll ( 1.1.8 instead of 1.1.7 ) is used .
This fixes problems that many people experienced with version 0.61 on Windows 98SE .
If you already have Tux Racer 0.61 for Windows and are experiencing crashes when the game starts up , you can download SDL 1.1.8 yourself ; simply replace the SDL.dll file from Tux Racer 0.61 with the one in that package .
If you are n't experiencing any problems with Tux Racer 0.61 , then there is no need to download 0.61a .
Tux Racer 0.61 Released
Wednesday , January 31 , 2001 Tux Racer Version 0.61 has been released and is available from the Downloads section .
This release mainly patches problems with version 0.60.3 , but also adds a few new features .
New in this release : SDL can be used instead of GLUT for handling OpenGL contexts and mouse / keyboard events ( the Windows build no longer uses GLUT ) .
Using SDL gives better fullscreen rendering support under both Linux and Windows .
Added a fish pickup sound .
Added a " diagnostic log " feature to help diagnose system problems and pinpoint bugs .
To create the log , set " write_diagnostic_log " to true in the options file ; the log ( diagnostic_log.txt ) will be created next time Tux Racer is run .
Please include ( selected parts ) of the log when submitting bug reports .
Cygwin is no longer used in the Windows build .
Fog can now be disabled ( for buggy Rage 128 drivers ) -- set " disable_fog " to true in the options file .
Added a loading screen ( this fixes Debian Bug # 75235 ) .
X libraries now included in LIBS in configure script ; this should fix some GLUT detection problems .
Arbitrary joystick axes can be mapped to Tux controls ( thanks to Julie Brandon for suggestion and patch ) .
Fixed some 32 - bit - isms to allow compiling on 64 - bit machines ( like Alphas ) ; thanks to Jay Estabrook for the patch .
Enjoy !
For those that are wondering , new Tux Racer development has been progressing on a separate branch from this release .
We want to get the features that will go into Version 1.0 into a better state before releasing them to the public .
We 're getting there ; please be patient !

Tux Racer Preview at Joystick101.org
Friday , October 27 , 2000 Joystick101.org has posted an article about Tux Racer .
[ Old news items ]
Schmidt , who has returned to his California - based political and public affairs consulting business , said that he “ worked incredibly hard during the campaign to defend Sarah Palin and her family against a lot of attacks that I thought then and think today were very unfair . ”
And he got in a dig at Kristol , who frequently offered unvarnished assessments of McCain ’s campaign from his perch at the Standard , on Fox News , where he is a contributor , and in his then - New York Times column .
“ Bill Kristol , going back to the time of the campaign , has taken a lot of cheap shots at the campaign without ever offering a plausible path to victory , ” Schmidt said .
“ He ’s in the business of ad hominem insults and criticism . ”
Responding to Schmidt ’s counterattack , Kristol directly fingered Schmidt : “ It ’s simply a fact that when the going got tough , Steve Schmidt trashed Sarah Palin , both within the campaign and ( on background ) to journalists .
This was after Steve took credit for the Palin pick when , at first , he thought it made him look good .
John McCain deserved better . ”
At this , Schmidt unloaded in a lengthy telephone interview , suggesting that Kristol was carrying out a personal vendetta based out of anger over the attempt to fire Scheunemann in the final days of the campaign .
In doing so , Schmidt revealed what has been whispered about for months following the campaign : that he and another top aide had ordered a leak hunt in the campaign ’s internal e-mail system .
“ What this is about is a personal issue that happened late in the campaign relating to a close , personal friend of Bill Kristol and people at The Weekly Standard , ” Schmidt said , refusing to use Scheunemann ’s name .
“ At the end of the campaign there were a series of leaks that were so damaging that it was consuming the 24 - hour cable news cycle .
Leaks to reporters where Sarah Palin was called all manner of names .
[ McCain senior adviser ]
Rick Davis and I jointly felt that was outrageous .
So we made an attempt for the first time in the campaign to try to ID who was leaking information that was so damaging and demoralizing to a campaign that was in very difficult circumstances , ” Schmidt said , noting that an IT professional executed a system - wide search by keyword .
“ What was discovered was an e-mail from a very senior staff member to Bill Kristol that then entered into the news current and continued the negative in - fighting stories for an additional news cycles .
I recommended tough medicine for that individual that was carried out , ” Schmidt said , again referring to Scheunemann .
“ Bill Kristol might not have liked that decision , and he might be mad about what happened to his friend , but going all the way back he has been a part of this story and I ’ve preserved his confidentiality in that until now .
But his use of his public forums to take a personal fight and make character attacks is just simply dishonest and wrong . ”
Scheunemann , confirming that his e-mail had been searched , accused Schmidt of “ acting in a manner of Iranian secret police ” in going to his account .
The foreign policy hand said what was discovered was a message from Kristol inquiring who was the source in the campaign of the “ diva ” leak , the now - famous complaint from a senior McCain campaign official to CNN ’s Dana Bash that Palin was acting like a spoiled and selfish celebrity .
Schmidt suggested that Scheunemann had fingered Nicolle Wallace , a senior McCain adviser who helped work with Palin , to Kristol in the message .
“ It led to a whole another round of speculation , including Fred Barnes the next night attacking Nicolle Wallace on the air , ” Schmidt said , suggesting without saying directly that was why an effort was made to terminate Scheunemann .
Barnes , another Weekly Standard editor and Fox News contributor , accused Wallace on Fox News in late October of being “ a coward ” for running up tens of thousands of dollars in high - end clothes for Palin and then letting the governor take the blame for the purchases .
After Wallace denied she had purchased the clothes , Barnes apologized on the air the following night .
But Scheunemann said the clothes controversy was an entirely separate issue and one which he made no mention of in his e-mail to Kristol .

Age & disability correspondent , BBC News website
An erotic audio site is marketing itself to blind and visually - impaired people .
But have disabled people been excluded from the world of " adult " entertainment ?
Lud Romano - who runs an internet communications business - was on holiday in South Africa with his partner when they discovered erotic audiobooks on iTunes .
They found the idea of a single voice reading aloud to be a little " empty " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" If you 're going to get an erotic charge from that , you have to do a lot of work yourself , " he says .
He decided there and then to commission a series of short radio dramas which would be made available from a website .
The original target audience for Clickforeplay was sexually confident , upwardly - mobile young women - the sort of people who felt comfortable about buying erotic fiction from a High Street bookshop or browsing the more female - friendly " adult " shops .
The 12 - minute chunks of audio sold , but not in vast numbers .
" They [ the plays ] were n't costing anything , neither were they earning anything , " said Mr Romano .
After a failed attempt at the " soft porn " market - " people wanted it a lot harder than we could ever achieve in the audio domain " - he looked at what was available for blind and partially - sighted people .
Erotic audiobooks
He was surprised to discover how under - served the market was in terms of adult material .
This is not to suggest that there is nothing " out there " for people who do not have access to standard print or video
For instance , the Royal National Institute for Blind People ( RNIB ) has erotic fiction in its audiobook library , as any mainstream library might have .
Many people view mainstream pornography as exploitative
And general audiobook companies have sections dedicated to erotica which can run to 200 or so titles .
But one of the few dedicated erotic offerings for blind people that Mr Romano could find was a website containing an archive of audio recordings of American volunteers describing what they could see while watching hardcore pornography clips .
A brief listen to a couple of the audio files at the site is probably enough to convince most people to entertain themselves with something a little more improving .
Deadpan , monotone descriptions of mainstream porn might even seem to the casual surfer like some sort of prank .
" It 's just so bad , it 's ridiculous , " Mr Romano says .
His approach has been to get beyond what he describes as the " bored housewife meets young pool cleaner " type plot and to aim for something that will appeal to more sophisticated tastes .
He has a group of three writers who are simply told to " write naughty stories " .
The plays are then recorded in a suite of rooms in north London " as live " .
There are erotic audio sites but few are marketed at blind people " It 's not actors gathered around a microphone - they really act this , dynamically . "
For those who worry about the exploitative nature of pornography , it might be reassuring to know that Mr Romano 's actors do , of course , keep their clothes on .
Each drama has a setting that is " ripe for erotic development " , according to Mr Romano .
One concerns the interaction between an artist , his female assistant and a nude female model .
Another is set in a laboratory in which two male scientists accidently discover a powerful aphrodisiac which their female boss insists upon trying .
Unfortunately , she uses all of it before they can analyse it and produce another batch .
Each drama costs around £ 2,500 to produce .
Mr Romano 's firm has signed a deal with a company which gives text - to - speech output from webpages and magnifies the text as well .
Society 's reluctance
And while some people may disapprove of the enterprise as just another example of the internet being used to disseminate sexual content , it will be welcomed by those disability rights activists who believe the exclusion of disabled people from the sexual arena mirrors their marginalisation in other areas of life .
Writer and performer , Mat Fraser , says that making adult material available to disabled people is an intrinsic part of inclusion .
" It is the erotic that helps us to feel alive , real , included , and disabled people have so much to offer the world of the erotic and the adult , " he said .
Society 's reluctance to accept disabled people 's sexuality is perhaps based on a deep - rooted but unspoken belief that they should not reproduce .
Many disabled people feel excluded from the world of ' adult ' entertainment
This is a prejudice that is being challenged by activists , artists and writers , like Penny Pepper - a writer of erotic fiction that includes disabled characters .
" We are tired of being nannied and denied the rights to sexual expression that non-disabled people take for granted - so on that level , at least , we should fight for equal access to view and enjoy such material , " she says .
Certainly , the RNIB makes sure that a wide range of tastes is catered for when choosing material for its Talking Book library .
The library 's manager , Pat Beach , says the main problem is access to printed material per se - less than 5 % of books published in the UK ever appear in large print , audio or Braille .
" We do not act as a censor - erotic fiction can be found on our shelves just as it is in a public library or a bookshop , " he says .
Others believe that - because disabled people can experience difficulty in forming intimate relationships - accessing erotica and adult entertainment can provide an alternative outlet .
" As part of the wider campaign for barrier removal , it is really important also to remove barriers to erotica and sexual expression for disabled people , " says disabled academic , Tom Shakespeare .
Mr Romano has already begun discussions with the RNIB , hoping to find an avenue to make more blind people aware of his product .
Below is a selection of your comments .
This throws up an interesting dilemma - do we support feminism against porn , or disability rights ?
What do feminists who may be disabled think ?
Andrew Turner , Stoke On Trent More power and success to Mr Romano .
We able bodied people tend to forget that people with disabilities still have the same feelings as everyone else .
George , Woking Fascinating article , although for any disabled singletons reading in despair , it is entirely possible for a disabled person to have a functioning , sexual relationship .
I have had a boyfriend for about five - and - a - half years , and am perfectly consenting .
I was born with Asperger 's Syndrome .
Steve ( my boyfriend ) says that it's a fantastic idea that no one should be excluded from any activity that able - bodied people can do , there is far to much disablism .
Amy , Dudley , England Hooray , about time , although a straight , able bodied woman I truly believe that all forms of erotica should be equally available to all who wish to access it , no discrimination should mean exactly that - any volunteers required
Rosie , Lancaster
So why are n't the actors actually ' doing it ' , without their clothes on ?
This sounds very patronising to me .
If real hardcore sex is ok to be watched , why can't it be heard too ?
I 'm sure the squelching sounds would be nice for someone trying to get themselves in the mood .
rebecca , Norwich
As a purveyor of pornography through the traditional medium of an adult shop , it is refreshing to see attitudes to this material relaxing a little .
As a responsible retailer , I would welcome any person over the age of 18 into our premises , regardless of age , gender , sexual orientation or disability .
Indeed , we have regular customers with varying disabilities , both single and in couples who appear to enjoy a healthy sex life .
I for one will be actively seeking out material such as this and stocking it gives access to all .
Sexual freedom is a right for all and if people with disabilities require assistance to allow them access to this freedom , who has the right to prevent it ?
If we were discussing access to the theatre instead of pornography , I fear the attitudes may be a little different !
Stuart Gilbert , Evesham , Worcs I think this sounds like a great idea , and I 'd be surprised if it was just blind people who were interested in it .
I wonder if the comments made about young women being comfortable buying erotic literature is related to the imagination aspect , something missing from video porn .
I have quite a few female friends who read erotic novels , but who I laugh with about how over the top porn films are .
For those who find imagining scenarios more attractive and powerful than viewing them , I 'd imagine that erotic podcasts would be an attractive alternative .
Gemma , Edinburgh
The key here is to differentiate between erotic content - which has a place , and pornography which is another word for wrecked lives , the degradation of women and putting money into the pockets of pimps , spivs and lumpen small businessmen .
Why would any sane person want access to the latter ?

The current standard / specifications followed by most of the major UNIX desktop enviromnents , such as Gnome , KDE , XFCE , LXDE , and ROX , is called freedesktop.org .
See http://www.freedesktop.org/ for detail .
Freedesktop.org is formed by a group of developers .
Developers duscusses on the so called ‘ xdg ’ mailing list to come up with some specs which will be followed by major desktop environments .
The specs developed by Freedesktop.org are not formal standards , but they are widely used in Gnome , KDE , and XFCE .
Freedesktop.org standards defines the way window managers work , they way how file types are recognized , how icons are named , the way to define the main application menu , to exchange data between applications and different desktop environments , and more .
The process to form those specs , however , is quite inefficient and problematic .
All discussions are held on their xdg mailing list .
If someone has a proposal , he / she then writes a draft of the spec for it , and then post it to the mailing list .
Then , if you ’re lucky enough , or you ’re a big guy ( famous Gnome or KDE developers ) , you ’ll get attentions and some feedbacks .
After lenghthy discussions , if there are no obvious objections , the draft will be added to freedesktop.org repository , and was posted on their wiki .
This is roughly how the specs are formed .
Nevertheless , if there is no one implement your spec , your spec soon became useless .
That means , either Gnome or KDE should support your proposal , otherwise no one will use it .
How can something be called ‘ standard ’ when nobody is following it ?
Later , if someone has some good ideas regarding to improving the spec , he / she can post his / her proposal in the mailing list with a patch , and if there is no objection , the patch * might * be applied to the spec .
However , once the original author / maintainer of that spec does n’t like your idea , your proposal will never be accepted .
Or even worse , your messages got omitted by the original author / maintainer of existing specs , then there is no way to improve anything in existing specs .
This is a real problem in freedesktop.org .
Besides , another big issue here is , most of the specs / standards are advocated by Gnome or KDE developers , and they do n’t even consider the needs of other desktop environments .
The so - called cross -desktop standards are actually well - implemented in Gnome and KDE only .
XFCE tried hard to follow all those standards , but never get everything work flawlessly .
LXDE tried to follow those specs , too , but found that many of the specs are very complicated and inefficient , which can slow down our desktops and add bloatness .
Nowadays they are trying to add more things , and get modern desktops more and more complicated .
It ’s nearly impossible to keep lightweight if you want to follow ‘ all ’ the standards developed by Gnome and KDE .
So that ’s why we only supports the parts we need .
Recent changes in freedesktop.org , like PolicyKit and ConsoleKit , are mainly developed and implemented by Gnome - related developers .
Then the KDE guys are forced to follow them .
They even drop their well - designed and high performance IPC mechanism , DCOP , and adopt dbus , which is mainly advocated by Gnome developers .
Some people even suggested that KDE should replace their own VFS with GIO / GVFS developed by Gnome .
Some new technologies are developed by Gnome first , and then they wrote freedesktop.org specs for them .
Later , those things are copied to KDE and they soon have their KDE equivalence .
Unfortunately , all other desktop environments are forced to follow those standards whether they really need it or not , to keep the compatability with those two major desktop environments .
Why should we always be forced to follow all those things we do n’t like or do n’t even need ?
If we do n’t follow them , we lost compatibility with many existing Gnome / GTK + and KDE programs .
In addition , they modify the specs frequently , and always break backward compatibility .
So our precious time are wasted on re-implement everything in their new specs and try to fix all broken compatibility left by them .
It ’s enough !
Sometimes things developed by the two major DEs are quite awesome and useful .
However sometimes those specs just do n’t suitable for other DEs and they did n’t consider the needs of users of DEs other than Gnome and KDE .
So , every enthusiastic developers / users of lightweight desktop environments , please join their xdg mailinst list and join their discussions and let them listen to your voice .
If you do n’t want to be forced to use things developed by Gnome and KDE , please let them hear your voice in the mailing list .
Since they are now moving gnome libs into GTK + , like it or not , all gtk + applications will be affected .
Desktop environments other than Gnome and KDE might have some special needs and goals and those Gnome standards might not suitable for us sometimes .
So we need to let them hear our voice and we should be part of the decision making .
So , please , join the xdg mailing list and get involved if you can .

( For full cover of the attacks , click [ ID : nSP391776 ] )
JAKARTA , July 18 ( Reuters ) - Indonesian police said on Sunday they were reconstructing the face of one of the suspected suicide bombers from a severed head in a bid to push forward a probe into deadly attacks on two luxury Jakarta hotels .
Nine people died and 53 were wounded in Friday 's attacks on the JW Marriott and Ritz - Carlton , according to police .
The two hotels were popular with business executives and diplomats and considered to be among the most secure buildings in the capital .
The blasts , which are suspected of being carried out by Islamic militants , left some bodies so badly mutilated they were difficult to identify and two decapitated corpses were believed by police to belong to the suicide bombers .
" We are trying to reconstruct the face of one of the heads we found to see if it matches the guest from 1808 .
We will ask witnesses and receptionists , is it him ? , " police spokesman Nanan Soekarna told a news conference .
Police said the bombers had checked in to the Marriott as paying guests on Wednesday and had assembled the bombs in their room .
A third bomb was found and defused in a laptop computer bag in room 1808 .
Soekarna said the attacks bore the hallmarks of Jemaah Islamiah ( JI ) , the radical militant Islamist group responsible for a string of deadly attacks in Jakarta and on the resort island of Bali that seemed to end in 2005 .
" The method , the equipment used is the same as both bombs in Bali and the one found in Cilacap , " he said referring to the Bali attacks in 2002 and 2005 , and bomb equipment police recently found during raids in Cilacap , Central Java .
Ansyaad Mbai , head of the anti-terrorism desk at Indonesia 's security ministry , said the attacks may be linked to a fugitive Malaysian - born militant Noordin Top , who is believed to have broken away from JI to form a more radical wing .
Mbai was quoted as saying by state news agency Antara that the government was stepping up efforts to find Noordin Top , who has been linked to a string of attacks , as as priority .
Sidney Jones , a Jakarta - based expert on Islamic terrorism at the International Crisis Group , also said that the attacks had the hallmarks of Noordin Top .
" The most important hallmark is the suicide bombing as a method of attack and also the targeting of iconic Western symbols , both of those are associated more with Noordin than with mainstream Jemaah Islamiah , " Jones told Reuters in an interview .
Malaysia 's New Sunday
Times newspaper cited an unnamed senior police source as saying that although the attacks bore Noordin Top 's hallmark , intelligence reports indicated that he was not involved .
Security was increased at shopping malls and hotels across Jakarta at the weekend .
The Four Seasons Hotel in Jakarta was briefly evacuated on Sunday morning after a bomb scare , although guests were later allowed to return after a search , a receptionist said .
Elshinta radio reported that the hotel had received a telephone call warning of a device planted on the 18th floor .
The casualties of Friday 's attacks included citizens of Indonesia , the United States , Australia , South Korea , the Netherlands , Italy , Britain , Canada , Norway , Japan and India .
The blasts are a severe blow for President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , who was re-elected earlier this month in a landslide victory on the back of strong growth in Southeast Asia 's biggest economy .

And on the other end , when the other team is close to making the shot , he 's the last line of defense , the one who swats away the shot , vetoes their attempt to score .
A good point guard is a legislator , perhaps a majority leader or whip , someone who is a facilitator , not a scorer .
This is n't difficult stuff , it 's a pretty simple and simplistic analogy .
So what does it say about Sarah Palin that she would get it so wrong ?
Some may say it shows a basic misunderstanding of what the job is all about .
Certainly much of her actions as Governor have shown either lack of fully grasping the role or a severe disinterest in it .
Some may say this is a reflection of her narcissism - I was a point guard therefore the Governor is a point guard .
But I think the reality is a lot more shallow than that .
We all know people like her .
She 's stuck in High School .
She still lives in her home town and even as Governor could n't bring herself to make the move to Capital .
She married her high school sweetheart .
And she still exhibits the pettiness and petulance of a high school girl who thinks she 's the be all and end all .
We all know people like her .
They do n't make it in College , often drifting from school to school until returning to their home town to stay for good , sheltered in their past success , unable to move on .
For Sarah , the Governor is a point guard because she 's incapable of the personal growth required to become something different , something bigger , something better .
I know it 's absurd to bring up Barack Obama in a diary about Sarah Palin , but just as a point of comparison , when Barack mentioned basketball during the campaign it usually was " I may be skinny , but I 've got sharp elbows " .
Translated that means I 'm not afraid to go down low and mix it up with the big boys .
It was him saying I can play the post , I can fill the role .
Far different than the image of the point guard dribbling the ball through a full court press and then passing once she gets it over mid-court .
Which brings me to the last point of her analogy in strict basketball terms : the full - court press .
That is a very effective defense ... in High School .
You occasionally see it in College .
In the pros , it 's a sucker move .
In this year 's championship , a key moment was when Phil Jackson decided to take the ball out at the far end of the court .
Van Gundy fell for it , put a press on which just spread out the defense and allowed Derek Fisher to get off the open three to tie the game .
It was the turning point of the series and the play that really showed the weakness in the Magic 's game - the coaching .
Van Gundy , like Sarah Palin , showed he was n't ready for the big time ( though I would put him far above Palin in terms of preparedness ) .
Sarah 's hoop game is still High School , just as Sarah herself is still stuck there , telling the increasingly fewer people of her past glories , big fish , small state .
Did you know she was Miss Wasilla ?
She was .
She still is .
The Washington Post has abandoned an offer to sell lobbyists and business interests access to Obama administration officials and policymakers for $ 25,000 a time , including dinner , after uproar in the paper 's newsroom over a promise that its journalists would also be part of the package .
The offer came to light in a flier aimed at players in healthcare at a time when the White House is planning major reform of the industry .
It promised " a collegial evening , with Obama administration officials , Congress members , business leaders , advocacy leaders and other select minds " at dinners hosted by the Washington Post publisher , Katharine Weymouth , at her home .
The flier , given to a healthcare lobbyist , also offered access to " healthcare reporting and editorial staff " at the off the record dinners .
" An evening with the right people can alter the debate , " the flier said .
" Bring your organisation 's CEO or executive director literally to the table .
Interact with key Obama administration and congressional leaders … "
" Spirited ?
Yes .
Confrontational ?
No .
The relaxed setting in the home of Katharine Weymouth assures it " .
Similar dinners were planned in the future to discuss other major White House policy initiativies .
Each was to cost $ 25,000 per organisation or " sponsor " with one thrown in free for bulk purchases at 11 dinners for $ 250,000 .
But after the flier was exposed on the Politico website , Weymouth cancelled the plans .
" Absolutely , I 'm disappointed , " she told her own newspaper .
" This should never have happened .
The fliers got out and were n't vetted .
They did n't represent at all what we were attempting to do .
We 're not going to do any dinners that would impugn the integrity of the newsroom . "
Earlier in the day , the executive editor , Marcus Brauchli , sent an email to staff after a backlash in the newsroom .
" We will not participate in events where promises are made that in exchange for money The Post will offer access to newsroom personnel or will refrain from confrontational questioning , " he wrote .
" It suggests that access to Washington Post journalists was available for purchase . "
But one former
Post staffer said the scheme has been under consideration since last year because of the paper 's difficult financial situation , losing £ 12 m in the first quarter of this year , and that reporters had been consulted about organising the meetings .
The newspaper said that the fliers " appear to be the product of overzealous marketing executives " .
A Washington Post spokesperson , Kris Coratti , said the newsroom was not consulted .
" The flier came out of a business division for conferences and events , and the newsroom was unaware of such communication .
It went out before it was properly vetted , and this draft does not represent what the company 's vision for these dinners are , which is meant to be an independent , policy - oriented event for newsmakers .
As written , the newsroom could not participate in an event like this , " she said .
Because I ’ve moved into the more elegant waters of Ruby and Mono , I sometimes forget just how power Perl can be .
Sometimes 8 lines of perl is all you need to solve a problem .
The Problem
So , I ’ve gotten back in to Blood Bowl with my friend Pyg , but that ’s mostly for another blog post .
As we ’ve been relearning the rules , Pyg found a much better consolidated rule set on the web as a PDF , in A4 , as it was created by Brits .
A4 , is the far more logical way to make paper that ’s normal page size ish .
However , it is slightly longer and slightly narrower than our Letter paper standard .
The real challenge here was that I wanted to create something that was bindable at our local Office Max .
“ Printing ” the A4 PDF to a Letter PDF in evince gave me something with about 3 / 4 inch of white margin on the right side of every page .
If I could get that to alternate between the right and left sides of the page , then I ’d be golden .
As you can see , left as is , bindng double sided would both look silly , and actually bunch through some of the text on the right side pages .
The Solution – Hack the PDF
PDF is just a document standard .
That means a lot of it is in plain text , for a gracious definition of that word .
I openned the file up in emacs and started searching for words that might represent this .
Eventually I found the following snippet in the PDF :
<< / Type / Page
/ Parent 1 0 R
/ MediaBox [ 0 0 611.999983 791.999983 ]
/ Contents 196 0 R
/ Group <<
/ Type / Group
/ S / Transparency
/ CS / DeviceRGB
>>
/ Resources 195 0 R
>>
This is part of the Page definition , and what ’s important is that MediaBox tag .
The 4 numbers there are X , Y , Width , Height of the content .
After some experimentation I determined that the values I needed for “ right side pages ” were : - 52 0 559.999983 791.999983 .
I need to set every other ( of 84 pages ) to that .
There are MediaBox definitions that have nothing to do with Page , so I ca n’t just look for them .
It has to be a MediaBox in that Page definition .
Changing your line break
Perl has a lot of operations that are line oriented , so you get 1 line at a time .
But one of the greatest powers of perl is it ’s really easy to change what it considers a line break .
This is done with the line ending special variable $ /. A common trick is to $/ = undef ; which means the first read of a file will read the entire thing into a string .
For this problem I decided that if I made << my seperator , I ’d get the Page definition and MediaBox on the same line , making life much easier .
But enough of the details , here is the code :
#!/usr /bin/perl use strict ; local $ / = ‘<<‘; my $ count = 0 ; while ( <> ) {
if ( $_ =~ m{ / Type / Page} ) {
if ( ( $ count % 2 ) == 0 ) {
$ _ =~ s{MediaBox [.*?]
}{ MediaBox [ - 52 0 559.999983 791.999983 ]}gs ;
} else {
$ _ =~ s{MediaBox [.*?]
}{ MediaBox [ 0 0 611.999983 791.999983 ]}gs ;
}
$ count ++ ;
}
print $ _ ;
}
This reads in the first pdf from standard in , the second to standard out .
Because I could change the line seperator I do n’t have to keep track of state of if I ’ve seen a Page seperator , and if I ’m still in that block ( i.e. proper formal parsing ) .
That lets me do it in 2 matches .
The results , as just as you would like , and made for some nice printouts for binding :
Sometimes you just need to roll up your sleeves and bang out some perl code . 🙂
Bing ’s Traffic now surpasses Digg , Twitter and CNN
Ever since
Bing ’s successful first week launch based on its search engine capabilities it has given Google a scare with positive reactions from the online community .
A lot us us thought that the traffic was high in the first few weeks because of the initial product launch .
Lets see where Bing stands after a month , according to Compete , Bing is now the 13th most visited site on the web with 49.57 million unique visitors in its first month as Microsoft ’s official search engine .
Bing ’s traffic was higher than that of Digg ( 38.96 million ) Twitter ( 23 million ) , and CNN ( 28.54 million ) .
This number are only US visitors , since Compete only track US online data .
Interestingly Bing has now surpassed Live.com , its predecessor , which actually garnered 79.4 million visits in June .
This can mostly be attributed to the fact that a lot of Microsoft services , most notably Hotmail , are on the Live domain .
Bing is showing some solid numbers and growth for its first month in existence and Microsoft ’s spend in seach engine marketing for the year will help in consolidating its growth and postion .
Still , it ’s got a long way to go before it can begin to challenge Google ’s top position in search engine marketing race .
Lance Armstrong refused to speak to the media in the second half of the Giro d’Italia but seems to going on a charm offensive at the Tour de France .
On Sunday , while waiting for the plane transfer to Limoges , he spoke live on French television sports show ‘ Stade 2 ’ in the company of former Tour de France winner Laurent Fignon , who is currently fighting intestinal cancer .
Armstrong confirmed that all the money raised by selling the yellow Livestrong bracelets during this year ’s Tour de France will go to fighting cancer in France and encouraged Fignon .
He also answered a series of question about his rivalry with Alberto Contador and revealed that he will ‘ probably ’ ride another Tour de France in 2010 , perhaps with a new Livestrong team .
When it was put to him that there was not yet a war with Contador but that there clearly was n’t peace , he said .
“ The honest truth ?
There ’s a little tension at the dinner table .
Alberto is very strong , very ambitious and I understand that , I ’ve won this race seven times and I understand he wants to want it a second time . ”
“ If he wins , he wins .
I ’ll be second , third or fifth .
If he ’s the best rider in the race , there ’s nothing I can do . ”
Armstrong admitted that the victory in this year ’s Tour was probably a battle between him and Contador after Astana ’s dominant performance in the first week .
But he claimed he was not waging a psychological war against his younger Spanish rival .
However , he refused to sign for a guaranteed third place in Paris .
“ I try to stay relax and try and keep the atmosphere as calm as I can .
Not only with Alberto but with the other guys and the staff .
We ’ll see .
The Tour is only 25 % done , maybe halfway done , but only 25 % in terms of the selection . ”
“ I would probably not sign for third .
No .
I would n’t sign for third place . ”
ARMSTRONG STILL IN CHARGE ?
Armstrong refuted the idea that he was still the patron of the Tour de France peloton and claimed he had lost count of the number of doping controls he has done after being tested three times between Friday and Saturday .
“ I ’ve lost count ( of how many dope controls ) .
I ca n’t complain , it ’s the nature of the sport we ’re in and the nature of sport in general .
We need these tests to restore the confidence of people , ” he said .
The Astana team is expected to go into meltdown after the Tour de France with Alexandre Vinokourov returning to the Kazakhstan after his two - year ban for blood doping .
Vino believes he will take over the team , perhaps with Contador as leader , while Armstrong and team manager Johan Bruyneel create a new team aimed at promoting Armstrong ’s Livestrong cancer foundation .
To help the team get off the ground , Armstrong hinted that he may ride the 2010 Tour de France .

“ It ’s a idea were working on .
Nike is the king of the sports world and so would be a good sponsor .
But I ’m not sure Nike and Livestrong would be the ideal teaming .
We ’re looking more into sponsors who are investing in the foundation but it ’s harder than the Tour . ”

China has taken yet another step to transform the yuan into the dominant global currency , a long - term initiative that could ultimately dethrone the dollar as the world 's top unit of exchange .
In the last four months alone , China has signed currency swapagreements worth more than $ 95 billion ( 650 billion yuan ) with an array of nations – including : Argentina , South Korea , Indonesia , Malaysia , Belarus and Hong Kong – that are only too glad to move away from the increasingly shaky U.S. dollar .
For Westerners who are struggling to come to terms with the notion of a disarrayed dollar , the thought of oil , gold or other commodities being priced in yuan instead of dollars has to seem about as likely as having another country put a man on the moon .
But the Chinese yuan is already well on its way to becoming that globally accepted standard unit of exchange and the proverbial genie , as they say , is out of the bottle .
In fact , I 'd even go so far as to say the dollar 's days of dominance are numbered and with each new round of bailout chicanery , the clock is winding down ever faster .
Asia 's Long - Term View
In such Asian markets as Japan , Hong Kong and Mainland China , the long - term planning that 's an anathema to Corporate America is actually standard fare .
During the height of Japan 's dominance in the 1980s , the Western business press – with a touch of derision – wrote about how some Japanese companies routinely formulated business plans with durations of 100 years or more ( while working in Asia early in my career , I actually even contributed to several such plans … but that 's another story for another time ) .
That 's neither here nor there to most people who note smugly that Japan is getting its comeuppance .
But what they do n't understand is that Japan is not alone .
In fact , many people I talk with are shocked to learn that at a time when the West is still busy handing out Band - Aids in an attempt to deal with the greatest financial crisis on record , China has been quietly and shrewdly reinventing itself with the same kind of long - term vision .
Take commodities , for example .
While companies in the United States , Great Britain and Europe are being forced to shed promising assets in order to compensate for massive losses or to pay down debt , cash - rich China has been able to operate as a buyer in a buyer 's market .
While the rest of the world has interpreted this as a sign that China 's interested in buying the things it needs to grow , what they have not understood is that China 's also interested in using physical assets as a source of " currency " that offsets an increasingly eviscerated U.S. dollar .
This is actually a double - whammy of sorts , for while the rest of the world has been grappling with the global slowdown , China has been locking up supplies of commodities that are only going to become more scarce ( and more valuable ) as global demand escalates .
In fact , as I 've suggested for months , now , China is n't just going to consume those assets ; it 's going to use them as part of the same long - term vision it 's been staking out with regard to its own currency , the yuan , which it fully intends to boost in status to the point where it becomes an internationally accepted currency .
The Once - Dominant Dollar
That 's quite a turn of events .
Even now , despite the travails of the U.S. economy , the dollar remains the world 's most widely held reserve currency and , as such , is the standard unit of exchange in most international transactions .
In fact , many non-U.S. firms ( such as Airbus SAS ) actually price their manufactured products in dollars .
And the dollar is the de facto unit of pricing for such commodities as oil ( hence the term " petrodollar " ) .
Several countries even use it as their " official " currency .
But the global financial crisis is threatening that dominance .
The United States has already " injected " into the world economy trillions of dollars that are collectively worth more than 60 % of this country 's entire gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
And the prospect of still more injections for California , GMAC LLC and other " national " interests is extremely worrisome – and not just to millions of Americans , either .
If Washington stays on this path , the result will be a currency crisis the likes of which few are capable of imagining and a near - complete devaluation of the once - almighty U.S. dollar .
Ironically , both events will only further embolden China , speeding up its efforts to boost the yuan 's international acceptance .
The " New " Yuan
While some experts may question Beijing 's motives , it 's hard to question China 's long - term strategic vision , since the country is actually being forced to take these steps that ensure its own survival .
Unfortunately , our leaders in Washington do n't seem to understand this , so they 're only making matters worse – when they instead could be actively working with China and the world community on this instead of summarily ignoring the fact that the yuan may well be the world 's next reserve currency .
At the very least , China 's currency is likely to be granted a global status on par with the current major currency trading pairs for purposes of settling international transactions , whether the West wants that to happen or not .
I 've outlined this scenario many times in recent years and , quite frankly , too often received blank stares in return .
Most folks here in the West just are n't prepared to deal with the idea that the U.S. dollar could be finished and that another currency could replace it after more than 60 years of global dominance .
But they better get used to the idea – and in a hurry .
China is acutely aware that not having international currency convertibility hampers both its development and – thanks to the ongoing financial crisis – its potential survival .
Not only has China been forced to accept huge reserves built upon previous trade growth ( its $ 2 trillion in reserves is an all - time record ) , but its own policies have contributed to its relative inability to flex its capital - market muscles .
That 's especially true in transactions involving U.S. dollar / yuan exchange rates .
What for us sounds quite theoretical in nature represents a very real problem for businessmen such as Dong Xianbin , the chairman of the Guangxi Sanhuan Enterprise Group Holding Co. Ltd .
He estimates that he 's lost more than 150 million yuan ( about $ 22 million at current exchange rates ) on international trade in the past three years alone because of exchange rate changes between the dollar and the yuan .
So he 's keen to see yuan - based transactions that will reduce exchange - rate risks , or eliminate them entirely .
And he 's not alone .
Thousands of Chinese companies are chomping at the bit for the same reasons .
As a nation , not having a universally accepted currency is a huge issue .
China 's record reserves are now at risk thanks to the U.S. government 's bailout boondoggle , because each new greenback printed debases the value of every other dollar out there , including the ones China holds .
Historically , Beijing sought to mitigate that risk by diversifying its holdings into other currencies most notably the European euro and the Swiss franc , for instance .
But now China 's facing the kinds of problems that massive mutual funds closer to home must deal with when they hold a disproportionately large amount of money : China 's reserve fund is so massive that there 's literally no other single currency that can absorb all that liquidity .
So even if China wanted to diversify more aggressively , it 's going to be hard pressed to do so .
Incidentally , this is precisely why China 's so - called " nuclear option " will never become more than a theory bandied about by conspiracy buffs .
Under such a scenario , China will either " dump " its dollars , and / or stop buying them , causing the value of the greenback to plummet .
China might start selling , but there literally is not another currency on the planet that could absorb a wholesale liquidation .
Therefore , the reality is that China needs to have the U.S. boost the value of the dollar – even as the United States needs to have China do all it can to maintain the dollar 's value .
Shopping for Commodities
At this point in time , China essentially has two alternatives :
It can seek out other stores of value , such as natural resources , which are highly liquid and reasonably " deep " in global markets , but which can also be very volatile from a pricing standpoint .
Or it can elevate the credibility of its own currency in the international financial markets and effectively remove the exchange rate risks associated with its own partially blocked yuan .
Never one to leave anything to chance , China is pursuing both strategies .
For instance , China 's been buying gold like there 's no tomorrow – and is looking to add to its holdings .
Since 2003 , China has boosted its holdings of gold by 73 % to an estimated 1,054 metric tons , with an approximate value of $ 31.3 billion .
This makes China the fifth - largest holder of gold on the planet , followed by the United States , Greater Europe , and Switzerland .
China 's also gone global in its hunt for oil – which , of course , is the only other global " currency " truly in international demand .
While there 's a real benefit to having locked up supplies of commodities , they are n't an ideal store of value .
And that suggests that what China really needs to do is elevate the global prominence of its own currency at the same time , whether U.S. leaders aid the process or not .
History shows that strong economies tend to have strong currencies .
And the actions that I 've reported on recently from China – the cross-Straits agreements reached between China and Taiwan , the Hong Kong yuan - trade agreements and the " yuan carry trade , " to name a few – only reinforce the effort China is putting forth to achieve this goal .
Speaking of goals … there are obviously plenty of Doubting Thomases on this issue – but they were around years ago before China announced that it wants to put a man on the moon by 2020 .

Timothy Baldwin
Tenth Amendment Center
August 24 , 2009 Tenth Amendment CenterAugust 24 , 2009
From Chuck Baldwin : Note :
My son , Tim , writes today ’s column .
He is an attorney who received his Juris Doctor degree from Cumberland School of Law in Birmingham , Alabama .
He is a former prosecutor for the Florida State Attorney ’s Office and now owns his own private law practice .
He is author of a new book , published soon by Agrapha Publishing , entitled FREEDOM FOR A CHANGE .
We must not fear Sotamayor ; rather , we should insist that she fear the states — and obey the Constitution .
Yes , yes , we have all heard the remarks from those who would call themselves conservative , libertarian or the like concerning the nomination and now swearing - in of Sonia Sotomayor to the United States Supreme Court , which took place on August 8 , 2009 .
Yes , yes , books have been written by those conservative and libertarian editorialists and authors who have explained to us that the United States Supreme Court ( US S CT ) is “ out of control ” and how we must elect “ conservative ” Presidents to appoint “ conservative ” judges .
Ironically , this infatuation with the federal government , and specifically with the judicial branch of the federal government , has actually ( at least in part ) created the growing enslavement of the people of these States United .
Certainly we should care about who sits on the US S CT bench .
However , the time has come in our Confederate Republic ( the USA ) to acknowledge and understand that the power to govern ourselves justly and constitutionally is in the hands of the people of the several states of America–NOT in the hands of the branches of federal government .
What most people in America have been duped to believe is that the US S CT is the final arbiter in all matters concerning government actions related to the US Constitution .
When it comes to US S CT rulings that contradict the US Constitution and that reject the historical facts and principles of our Republic , people feel hopeless and think that regaining freedom somehow means replacing the “ liberal ” judges with “ conservative ” judges .
Such an approach to preserving freedom is not only un-American ; it is fruitless and ineffectual .
History now proves this .
Additionally , this approach proves that the vast majority of Americans have been indoctrinated into the centralist - ideology imposed on us by not - so - innocent advocates of such a political belief system .
Let me state this clearly : the US Constitution does not grant to the US S CT the power to interpret the Constitution in contradiction to the terms of the Constitution , and it does not strip the powers of the States to actively arrest and resist tyrannical federal actions .
The US S CT can no more violate the Constitution than the Legislative and Executive branches can .
What sense does it make that the US S CT is bound by an oath to support and defend the Constitution and then has the power to interpret it however the heck they want to ?
Do you think our founders were so near - sighted and unlearned that they would have given to the US S CT this unchecked and unlimited power in the very document that states its purpose is “ to secure the blessings of liberty ” ?
The framework of our Confederate Republic was clearly understood by those who advocated its ratification , namely , Alexander Hamilton , James Madison and John Jay : the writers of the Federalist Papers .
These are the men who some today would argue advocated for a centralist government , reducing and eliminating the power of the states to resist and arrest federal usurpation of power .
Obviously , these advocates of centralism would not have you aware of what these founders said on the subject , nor would they like to admit that the US Constitution formed a league of states , which was acceded to by each independent and sovereign act of the states , and which secured the right and duty of the states to actively guard against the encroachments of the federal government they created for the security of the blessings of liberty .
It must first be admitted that the US Constitution never gave to the US S CT the power to substitute their will for the intentions of the Founders of the Constitution .
This is easy to prove .
Alexander Hamilton admits this in Federalist Paper 78 :
“ It can be of no weight to say that the courts , on the pretense of a repugnancy , may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature . . .
The courts must declare the sense of the law ; and if they should be disposed to exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT , the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body . ”
[ efoods ]
Here , Hamilton points out the fact that , in our Confederate Republic , the US S CT MUST apply the Constitution to all federal laws as intended by the Founders .
They are NOT to place their will above the will of those who framed and acceded to the US Constitution .
To suggest that the US S CT has the power to alter , change or amend the Constitution at will is to place the US S CT above the Constitution : they can no more do this than the legislative branch can pass an unconstitutional law and the executive branch can carry out an unconstitutional law .
Or as Hamilton puts it , putting their will above the Constitution will “ equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body . ”
Neither is acceptable and neither is constitutional .
One cannot credibly and correctly argue that whatever the US S CT says goes .
I should not even have to restate this maxim , but in America , it has been held true that any unconstitutional act is null and void .
This applies to the US S CT as well .
Thus , the question becomes , what can and what must the states do when all three branches of the federal government ignore the Constitution and trample over the intents of its foundational principles ?
The authors of the Federalist Papers give us some guidance on the subject .
In Federalist Paper 16 , Hamilton explains in detail the states ’ right to actively resist federal tyranny and usurpation of power .
Listen to Hamilton :
“ The plausibility of this objection [ that the states will at any time obstruct the execution of federal laws ] will vanish the moment we advert to the essential difference between a mere NON - COMPLIANCE and a DIRECT and ACTIVE RESISTANCE .
If the interposition of the State legislatures be necessary to give effect to a measure of the Union , they have only NOT TO ACT , or to ACT EVASIVELY , and the measure is defeated .
This neglect of duty may be disguised under affected but unsubstantial provisions , so as not to appear , and of course not to excite any alarm in the people for the safety of the Constitution .
The State leaders may even make a merit of their surreptitious invasions of it on the ground of some temporary convenience , exemption , or advantage .
“ But if the execution of the laws of the national government should not require the intervention of the State legislatures , if they were to pass into immediate operation upon the citizens themselves , the particular governments could not interrupt their progress without an open and violent exertion of an unconstitutional power .
No omissions nor evasions would answer the end .
They would be obliged to act , and in such a manner as would leave no doubt that they had encroached on the national rights . . .
Attempts of this kind would not often be made with levity or rashness , because they could seldom be made without danger to the authors , UNLESS IN CASES OF A TYRANNICAL EXERCISE OF THE FEDERAL AUTHORITY . ” ( Emphasis added . )
Here , Hamilton clearly recognizes the states ’ ability to actively intervene against the federal government “ in cases of a tyrannical exercise of the federal authority . ”
Hamilton also expounds upon the natural protection that the new system of the US Constitution provides , in that states will not so easily and readily interfere with federal action when such interference must be made actively and openly against the federal government .
Certainly , where at least three - fourths ( the percentage needed to amend the Constitution ) of the states disagree with the State actively resisting the federal government , that State will consider the risks and costs to be too great to carry out and thus would not resist actively ; instead , that State would use its VOICE and not its ARM to communicate its discontent .
However , as told by Hamilton , “ IN CASES OF A TYRANNICAL EXERCISE OF THE FEDERAL AUTHORITY , ” the states most certainly would use their ARM to arrest such tyrannical actions .
Hamilton describes the use of this ARM of the States in Federalist Paper 26 :
“ [ T ]he State legislatures , WHO WILL ALWAYS BE NOT ONLY VIGILANT BUT SUSPICIOUS AND JEALOUS GUARDIANS OF THE RIGHTS OF THE CITIZENS AGAINST ENCROACHMENTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT , will constantly have their attention awake to the conduct of the national rulers , and will be ready enough , if any thing improper appears , to sound the alarm to the people , and not only to be the VOICE , but , if necessary , the ARM of their discontent . . .
[ T ]he people should resolve to recall all the powers they have heretofore parted with out of their own hands , and to divide themselves into as many States as there are counties , in order that they may be able to manage their own concerns in person . ”
( Emphasis added . )
Hamilton goes so far as to say , if the federal government has usurped its powers and the people of the states feel it necessary , the states should secede from the union , dividing “ themselves into as many states as there are counties , in order that they may be able to manage their own concerns in person . ”
This is not I stating this : this is one of the most well - known Founding Fathers in American history .
Hamilton further expounds upon this states ’ right and duty to check federal usurpation of power in Federalist Paper 28 .
He says ,
“ Power being almost always the rival of power , the general government will at all times stand ready to check the usurpations of the state governments , and THESE [ THE STATES ] WILL HAVE THE SAME DISPOSITION TOWARDS THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT .
The people , by throwing themselves into either scale , will infallibly make it preponderate .
IF THEIR RIGHTS ARE INVADED BY EITHER , THEY CAN MAKE USE OF THE OTHER AS THE INSTRUMENT OF REDRESS .
How wise will it be in them by cherishing the union to preserve to themselves an advantage which can never be too highly prized ! ” ( Emphasis added . )
Very clearly , Hamilton sees the brilliance of our Confederate Republic system of government , whereby the states can check the federal government and that where “ rights are invaded ” by the federal government , the people “ can make use of the [ states ] as the instrument of redress . ”
Hamilton continues in this discussion , saying :
“ It may safely be received as an axiom in our political system , that THE STATE GOVERNMENTS WILL , IN ALL POSSIBLE CONTINGENCIES , AFFORD COMPLETE SECURITY AGAINST INVASIONS OF THE PUBLIC LIBERTY BY THE NATIONAL AUTHORITY .
Projects of usurpation cannot be masked under pretenses so likely to escape the penetration of select bodies of men , as of the people at large .
The legislatures will have better means of information .
They can discover the danger at a distance ; and possessing all the organs of civil power , and the confidence of the people , THEY CAN AT ONCE ADOPT A REGULAR PLAN OF OPPOSITION , in which they can combine all the resources of the community .
They can readily communicate with each other in the different States , and UNITE THEIR COMMON FORCES FOR THE PROTECTION OF THEIR COMMON LIBERTY . ” ( Emphasis added . )
Even as expressed by the centralists ’ hero , Alexander Hamilton , the states were not left impotent regarding federal tyranny and were not stuck with the fruitless redress only through the US S CT .
Hamilton clearly suggests that the states have the sovereign and active power to arrest the exercise of federal tyranny .
Again , the question here is not , does the federal government have the power to act within its delegated powers , for we all would concede that the federal government has the power to do what we the people in the several states delegated to the federal government .
We acknowledge , as Hamilton expresses in Federalist Paper 27 , “ the laws of the Confederacy , as to the ENUMERATED and LEGITIMATE objects of its jurisdiction , will become the SUPREME LAW of the land . ”
Rather , the question is , what are the states going to do in response to the usurpation of powers that have been tyrannically taken by all three branches of the federal government ?
The question is , what are the states going to do when the federal government has passed , upheld and executed laws that are not “ enumerated and legitimate objects of its jurisdiction ” ?
After all , such laws are by definition NOT the supreme laws of the land and consequently , the people of the states and the states themselves are not bound to them .
( Of course , this necessarily implies that we the people understand the Constitution , the principles of our government and the true character and nature of our government . )
Are the people of the states to sit back and let the federal government trample over the rights , principles and structure of our Confederate Republic ?
Is every State to shirk its responsibilities and duties to actively protect , preserve and defend the freedoms of its sovereign ( the people of the State ) against federal tyranny ?
Are the people of the states to live and be governed in tyranny with the only hope that we will hopefully elect a President who will hopefully appoint a US S CT justice to the bench so that the Court can hopefully hear a case on the direct issue so that the Court will hopefully rule the correct way ?
Nonsense !
The time has come that the people of the several states of America wake up to the truth of their history : they are citizens of independent and sovereign states ; the US S CT is NOT the final arbiter in matters of freedom ; the federal government is not the source of our freedom ; the states have the duty to resist the encroachments of federal usurpation ; and freedom can be restored when the Confederate Republic is restored .
To that end , we must not fear Sotamayor ; rather , we should insist that she fear the states–and obey the Constitution !

* Investigators pressured researcher to pull talk on virus
* Talk was on origins and motives of Conficker Gang
LAS VEGAS , July 29 ( Reuters ) - Investigators searching for the criminals who infected millions of computers with the notorious Conficker virus are trying to limit access to information about its creators .
The investigators pressured one of the world ’s leading experts in cybercrime to pull a talk on Conficker ’s origins and motives of the gang behind the attack .
He was due to discuss the topic on Thursday at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas , one of the world ’s top forums for exchanging information on Internet threats
“ I was asked not to go into that because of an ongoing investigation , ” Mikko Hypponen , chief research officer for Internet security firm F - Secure , said in an interview on Wednesday .
He declined to say which agency requested him to pull the talk or explain why they asked him to do so .
Criminal investigators sometimes discourage people from disclosing sensitive information about crimes out of fear it might tip off suspects .
Hypponen would not say if that was the reason .
Hypponen said he will still speak about Conficker at the conference , but " there will be no news " on the virus that attacks machines running Microsoft Corp 's MSFT .
O Windows operating system .
Conficker started spreading late last year and infected an estimated 10 million computers at its peak in March .
It was designed to let its creators turn compromised machines into “ slaves ” that respond to commands sent from a remote server that effectively controls an army of computers known as a botnet .
Security experts succeeding in cleaning up most infected PCs after an unprecedented public awareness campaign to clean it up .
Hypponen said it now infects about 1 million PCs .
The Conficker botnet is one of many such networks controlled by syndicates that authorities believe are based in eastern Europe , Southeast Asia , China and Latin America .

In 1993 , Canada 's ruling party went from government to having just two MPs , after scoring just 16 % in the general election .
After Labour 's electoral drubbing in June , could it face a similar fate ?
Canada 's first female PM warned Labour against changing leader Kim Campbell , the first - and so far only - woman to become prime minister of Canada served for just four months in 1993 , before leading the Progressive Conservative Party into a rout from which it never recovered .
Miss Campbell was chosen after Brian Mulroney , who had been prime minister since 1984 , decided not to fight a general election which had to be held by the end of 1993 .
She has some words of advice for those who tout David Miliband and Alan Johnson as potential Labour leadership challengers .
" I think the young whippersnappers who have the potential to lead the party successfully should bide their time , " she told me .
" Do n't take on a party when you do n't have time to show who you are and why you 're different .
Because you 're then just Gordon Brown , thinner and younger . "
Initial popularity ?
The Progressive Conservatives had seen their popularity nosedive - partly a result of a severe downturn in the economy similar to that seen in Britain today .
Before he left office , Mr Mulroney received the worst poll ratings of any previous Canadian prime minister , much as Gordon Brown has experienced in Britain .
The Progressive Conservatives , like Labour in the UK , had been the second party of government for most of the previous century .
They tended to be in office for shorter periods than the more dominant Liberals , and the government which had been in office since 1984 was their longest serving .
It 's better for the unpopular leader to take the hit to enable a new leader to start fresh
Former Canadian P.M. Kim Campbell
Before her election as leader , Kim Campbell was defence minister .
She had not been an MP for long , and was more of a " policy wonk " than a practitioner - a CV not too dissimilar from that of the Foreign Secretary David Miliband .
Despite her initial popularity , Miss Campbell says she did not have long enough before the general election to overcome the unpopularity of Mr Mulroney and the party .
She thinks a leadership change this close to a general election in Britain would be a mistake .
" A party can have a devastating defeat that then enables them to rebuild and to choose new leadership credibly , as opposed to a kind of desperate pass at the end of the game .
" You 've already changed leaders once because you thought Tony Blair was n't going to get you elected and Gordon Brown came in , " she added .
" And now you 're at the end of the game , maybe you could find a Kim Campbell but it's not really fair because you 're really not giving him or her the chance to demonstrate change .
" And that 's the problem - better for the unpopular leader to take the hit to enable a new leader to start afresh . "
Downward spiral The Progressive Conservatives went into the election with 169 MPs .
They ended up with just two - and Kim Campbell was not one of them .
The number rose to 20 at the next general election , but the party was on a downward spiral , and eventually it was wound - up .
Brian Mulroney - Canada 's Gordon Brown ?
Could Labour be facing an equally disastrous outcome here ?
In the European Parliament elections in June , the party won 15.7 % of the vote , a fraction lower than the Progressive Conservatives managed in Canada in 1993 .
It was Labour 's worst performance in a nationwide election in 99 years .
The differences , however , are important .
The Progressive Conservatives were facing three major rivals , each of whom ate into their support .
Most Labour
MPs think that would not happen in a general election , because the majority of voters tend to choose a party which they think can form a government .
Others , though , think Labour 's poll ratings would not need to fall much further than they are now for the pressure on Gordon Brown to become overwhelming .
One former cabinet minister told me this week that if they fall to 23 % , then MPs will move against him .
Advice to Brown However , the Canadian experience might make those agitating for Gordon Brown 's departure think twice .
Rob Marris , Labour MP for Wolverhampton South West and a Canadian citizen , says such a move would amount to " window dressing " , and would be treated by British voters in the same way Mulroney 's replacement was in Canada .
Even Labour politicians who think defeat is all but inevitable can find some consolation in the Canadian experience .
Although the Progressive Conservatives were put firmly on the route to oblivion by the electorate , conservatism as an electoral force did not die .
The remnants of the old party and Reform eventually combined - which is why Canada has a Conservative government today , led by the former Reform Party activist , Stephen Harper .
Mind you , it took 13 years .
As for Kim Campbell , she has enjoyed a successful life after politics , first as a diplomat and an academic , now as a campaigner for good governance .
She thinks Labour should avoid creating its own version of her .
Instead , Gordon Brown should do what Brian Mulroney did not - face the electorate and take the consequences .
" If Gordon Brown believes in his policies and if he thinks he 's done the right things , then losing an election will not be the end of his political credibility , " she told me .
" It will give his party the chance to re-think things and choose a new leader who can go out with a fresh view .
That 's the right thing to do . "

posted March 30 , 2009 .
tagged cookies , rails , and tests .
While moving some applications to Rails 2.3 recently , I stumbled across some problems with testing cookies .
E.g. this blog uses cookies to remember your name , email address and web url if you leave a comment .
This way , you do n't need to re-enter these information the next time you leave a comment .
These cookies are set by the controller action that creates new comments ( in CommentsController #create ) :
cookies [ ' blog_visitor_name ' ] = { : value => @comment .
name , : expires => 1 . year .
from_now }
This is the extended form of setting a cookie ( a hash is used to not only set the cookies value but also the expiration time ) .
There are several more hash options available which are described in the ActionController #cookies documentation .
The basic form ( which only sets a simple session cookie that is valid until the visitor closes the browser ) uses a simple string :
cookies [ ' cookie_name ' ] = ' cookie_value '
This form of setting and getting cookies in a controller has been there for quite some time and actually has n't changed in Rails 2.3 .
But what has changed , is the availability of cookies in functional tests .
Before Rails 2.3 , you needed to create a CGI :: Cookie object for each cookie of a request .
After the request , you could then check the cookies accessor and assert correct attributes of a cookie :
def test_comment_creation_overwrites_visitor_cookies @request .
cookies [ ' blog_visitor_name ' ] = CGI :: Cookie . new ( ' blog_visitor_name ' , ' Fred F. ' ) post : create , { . . . } assert_equal ' Fred ' , cookies [ ' blog_visitor_name ' ]. value assert_equal '/' , cookies [ ' blog_visitor_name ' ]. path assert cookies [ ' blog_visitor_name ' ].
expires > 364 . days .
from_now end
As you can see , this test first sets a cookie by creating a CGI : Cookie object and requests the create action .
This simulates a user who previously used " Fred F. " as his name and now posts a new comment using the name " Fred " .
After processing the request , the test checks if the user 's cookie is update to the new name he gave .
Furthermore it tests that the newly created cookie attributes ( path and expire time ) are properly set .
With Rails 2.3 , usage of cookies in tests were modified to match usage in the controller itself .
The above test now looks like this :
def test_comment_creation_overwrites_visitor_cookies @request .
cookies [ ' blog_visitor_name ' ] = ' Fred F. ' post : create , { . . . } assert_equal ' Fred ' , cookies [ ' blog_visitor_name ' ] # assert_equal '/' , cookies ['blog_visitor_name ' ] ...???
# assert cookies ['blog_visitor_name ' ] ...???
> 364.days.from_now end
Since the cookies accessor now returns the cookie value only ( like in controllers ) , it is easier to test wether a cookie was correctly set to the expected value .
However , extended information like the cookie path and the expiration time are not available anymore and therefore we cannot test anymore if these attributes were correctly set by the controller .
PHILADELPHIA ( AP ) 
A federal appeals court has overturned a rule that said a cable TV company could not serve more than 30 percent of the nation ’s subscribers .
The decision , released Friday , was a victory for the largest cable company , the Comcast Corporation , which has a 25 percent share and sued to block the rule .
It was an embarrassing decision for the Federal Communications Commission , which had reimposed the cap after it was rejected twice before .
Friday ’s ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit called the limit “ arbitrary and capricious , ” and threw it out .
Fearing a cable monopoly , Congress directed the F.C.C. in 1992 to set limits on how many customers cable TV operators could reach nationwide .
The agency set the limit at 30 percent , but that was thrown out twice by the courts .
Two years ago , under chairman Kevin J. Martin , the same cap was reinstated , prompting the new challenge from Comcast .
In the ruling , the appeals court noted that the F.C.C. sought to justify the previously rejected cap by recalculating its formula .
But the outcome remained the same at 30 percent .

Non profit websites share many of the same best practices as any website .
They need to be user friendly , easily navigable , and use appropriate fonts , colors , and other design elements .
But often a non profit website needs to offer more than your typical corporate site .
A non profit ’s website needs to make it easy to find out more about their cause , to donate money , and to become more involved .
It needs to make it easy for media contacts to find the information they need and the contact information of key personnel .
And it needs to do all this in a way that ’s inviting to the organization ’s targeted donors and / or volunteers .
Below are a list of best practices for designing non profit websites followed by some examples of non profit websites that are getting things right .

Below are a list of best practices for designing non profit websites followed by some examples of non profit websites that are getting things right .
1. Make Your Site Donor - Friendly
Donations are a necessary thing for every non profit organization out there .
Your website can be a great place to solicit donations , especially from new donors .
It can also make it easier for recurring donors to make additional donations .
In either case , you want it to be a simple and straight - forward process for people to give you money .
There are a few things to keep in mind when creating a donor - friendly site .
First , make sure your donation page is prominently linked from your home page .
Whether you do this with a special banner or button or simply make it prominent in your regular navigation , donors have to see where to donate before they can do so .
Second , make the actual donation process as painless as possible .
Do n’t require visitors to set up an account to donate .
The donation process should n’t be any more complicated than any other online transaction .
Other than information required to process their credit card or e-check , do n’t require any other information .
And use a single - page donation form if possible , with just one confirmation page .
There ’s less chance that there will be browser or connectivity issues if there ’s only a single page to deal with .
2. Make Your Site Media - Friendly
Getting media attention can have a huge impact on a non profit organization .
Whether the media attention brings in more donations directly or simply raises the profile of the organization , getting attention from journalists , bloggers , and anyone else with an audience is important .
Make it easy for journalists to find information about your organization .
Include profiles of your board of directors , founder (s ) , and other key personnel .
Make sure you include contact information ( email and phone ) for each of these key people .
Have a downloadable media kit that includes everything your print media kit does .
Offer downloadable images from your site so journalists and bloggers do n’t have to contact your and wait for a response .
And include press-ready quotes , both from members and directors as well as outsiders .
Make it clear that journalists and other organizations may use these items in news coverage without contacting the organization for prior permission .
3. Make Your Site Volunteer - Friendly
Make it easy for visitors to your site to find information on how they can get involved .
There are plenty of people out there who might not have the money to make a donation but are still passionate about what your organization is doing .
Whether you provide detailed information about volunteering directly , steps people can take on their own , or just contact information for your volunteer organizer , make sure you do n’t overlook this crucial bit of information .
Providing multiple means of contact makes it easier for volunteers to get in touch , so include an email address , phone number , and a web contact form if you can .
4. Make Sure Your Organization ’s Purpose is Immediately Apparent
How many times have you gone to a website and not had a clue what the site was about ?
This happens all too often .
Designers and clients often take for granted what visitors to their site will already know about their organization .
But considering how much information is pushed in bite - size pieces on sites like Twitter and Facebook , there ’s no telling how much or how little visitors will know .
With some organizations it ’s easy enough to figure out what the organization is about just by its name , but for others it ’s not so easy .
Putting an abbreviated mission statement right on the home page is one way to solve this .
Another way is to put a prominent link somewhere on the home page that takes visitors to an about page that offers concise , plain - language ( not “ marketing - ese ” ) information about what the organization does .
5. Make Sure Your Content Takes Center Stage
Design on any site should be transparent , and especially so on non profit sites .
That ’s not to say your site can’t have an interesting design , just that the design should revolve around your content and your mission , not the other way around .
Take into account the types of information you ’ll be providing on the site and the formats that will be used .
Consider up front how much multi-media elements will be used , and whether they ’ll be used on every page or just in special gallery sections .
If you plan to post videos and photos on multiple pages , you ’ll need to make sure your column widths other elements are complimentary to the kinds of media you want to use .
Make sure your columns are wide enough to accommodate YouTube videos , for example .
If they ’re not , any time you embed a video ( or similar element ) , your site design will look haphazard ( and some of your site content might end up covered up ) .
6. Make Sure Your Website is Consistent with Your Other Promotional Materials
Your logo should use the same logo and colors as your other promotional materials .
Maintaining a consistent brand throughout your organization greatly increases your chances of being recognized in passing .
Your website does n’t have to ( and probably should n’t ) match your print promotional materials exactly , but echoing the look and feel of those materials increases brand identity .
Make sure the content is consistent , too .
Proofread and copyedit your website content just as you do your print materials .
While it ’s easier to change content on a website , it still gives a negative impression if your site is riddled with errors and inaccuracies .
7. Know Your Site ’s Purpose Up Front
The leaders of your organization ( or whoever is in charge of the organization ’s website ) should make a list of what the goals for the site are before starting the design process .
Is the site primarily to allow existing members to stay updated ?
Is it to solicit donations ?
Is it to get new volunteers or members ?
Is it to raise awareness in general ?
Whatever your purpose is , knowing it and communicating it to your designer going into the design process will save headaches and delays down the road .
Make sure everyone is on board with the same vision , too , so you do n’t have to make unnecessary changes down the road , which saves both time and money .
8. Include a News Section or Blog
Including a blog or news section has a couple of big advantages for non profit sites .
First , it gives people a reason to come back to your site .
If you offer news about your organization and your cause , people who are interested in either will come back on a regular basis ( or subscribe via RSS ) .
This keeps your site visible and makes it more likely they ’ll become more involved in the future ( or stay involved if they are already ) .
Second , blogs and news sites are often quoted by other blogs and news sites .
This increases the exposure for your site and will likely bring you more traffic .
Third , constantly - updated content increases your search engine visibility .
This makes it easier for people actively looking for information related to your organization to find your site .

Unemployment in California and Los Angeles County will increase well into 2010 , continuing to exceed the highest levels since at least the end of World War II , according to a local economist whose projections for the Southland economy are among the most negative to date .
Continued sluggishness in key industries such as construction , retail , international trade and hospitality will keep the state from a full recovery until 2011 , said the report , released by the Kyser Center for Economic Research at the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp .
Personal income will drop 2 % in the state this year , the report said , the first annual decline since 1938 .
“ Most people have n’t experienced anything like this in their lifetimes , ” said Jack Kyser , founding economist of the Kyser Center .

California ’s jobless rate , which was 11.6 % in June , will average 12.6 % next year , according to Kyser , who also projected that Los Angeles County ’s unemployment rate will be even higher , averaging 12.8 % in 2010 .
The county ’s jobless rate was 11.3 % last month .
Home construction will continue to fall , and the commercial real estate market will go through more distress as vacancies climb , the report predicts .
As a result , it says , Los Angeles County will lose 168,000 jobs this year , led by the manufacturing sector , which is projected to shed 38,800 positions .
Some areas outside Los Angeles County are expected to fare even worse .
In San Bernardino and Riverside counties , where unemployment already tops 13 % , the jobless rate will climb next year to an average of 14.7 % , the forecast said .

“ The Inland Empire will experience a longer and deeper recession than the rest of Southern California , ” the report said .
Escalating foreclosures and falling home values have created the region ’s “ worst - ever economic crisis . ”
The Inland Empire has lost 80,000 jobs in the last year alone , battered by the slowdown in international trade .
The region is a major distribution hub for companies that move goods from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to the rest of the country .
Even quiet Ventura County is in for a rough ride , pulled down by layoffs at corporate giants Countrywide Financial and Amgen .
The county will shed 5.1 % of its jobs in 2009 , pushing average unemployment for 2010 to 10.3 % , the forecast said .
Ventura posted a jobless rate of 10.2 % last month , up from 5.9 % in June 2008 .
“ Whatever the problem seems to be these days , Ventura County has more of it , ” the report said .

The Kyser Center report may be a little too glum , said Esmael Adibi , an economist at Chapman University in Orange .
“ To me , it looks very pessimistic , ” Adibi said .
Kyser predicts the state will lose 694,000 jobs this year , but Adibi ’s figure is 37 % lower , at 437,000 jobs lost .
Monday ’s resolution of the state ’s budget crisis is more reason to be optimistic about the future , Adibi said , especially because the governor did n’t raise taxes .
The psychological effect of the agreement should n’t be underestimated , he said .
What ’s more , federal stimulus money will buffer some of the cuts in education and transportation .
“ A big puzzle today got solved , and that ’s good news , ” he said .

Kyser did not agree that the budget fix would help matters .
Losses in revenue will continue to dog municipalities throughout the state , he said , potentially even pushing some into bankruptcy .
Budget cuts will make it even more difficult to create jobs .
“ The news from Sacramento is going to create more problems next year , ” he said .
“ It could even get worse . ”
The Kyser Center forecast also measures the health of key economic drivers in Southern California , including aerospace , trade and motion picture production .
Some of the key drivers are in danger of shrinking permanently , Kyser said .
Aerospace could shrivel if the Defense Department cuts funding for Boeing ’s C - 17 cargo aircraft program and commercial air travel continues to lag .
As international trade stays slow , ports in Canada and Texas and on the East Coast will try to lure business from Los Angeles .
Production in the motion picture industry is increasingly taking place out of state , and cutbacks in advertising are hurting the broadcast TV industry .

Perhaps hardest hit is apparel and textile manufacturing , once a key regional driver .
In Los Angeles County the industry will shrink 14 % between 2008 and 2010 , shedding 13,300 jobs , the report said .

No sooner had Apple senior vice president of worldwide product marketing Phil Schiller taken the keynote stage at Apple ’s Worldwide Developer Conference ( WWDC ) before he announced that Apple has tripled its active user base in the past two years .
The secret , of course , is the success of the iPhone .
Schiller produced a chart showing the number of actual active OS X users from 2002 - 2007 .
By the end of 2007 Apple counted about 25 million active OS X users .
In the past two years , there ’s been a “ huge spike ” of new OS X users , according to Schiller , and Apple has seen the user base grow from 25 million to near 75 million users today , in 2009 .
That 's thanks to extraordinary success of the iPhone and iPod touch , which both run a version of OS X .
“ No wonder everybody ’s trying to race behind us and follow in our footsteps , ” quipped Schiller .
Editor 's note :
Due to a reporting error , it was originally indicated the number of Mac OS X users had increased from 25 to 75 million .
That has been corrected .

These are the notes a comrade of mine , Liz Ross from Socialist Alternative , ( www.sa.org.au), did for a talk in November last year .
So it needs a little updating but the general points are timeless .
And of course it was written before the current economic crisis which is seeing business urging Government not to introduce an emissions trading scheme .
The pressure from the bosses to protect profits , not the environment , will be immense .
Liz is the author of Capitalism :
How it ’s costing us the earth , available from Socialist Alternative .
WHY CAPITALISM IS NOT THE ANSWER
If I were to sum up this talk , a quote from the American environmental scientist Robert Newman perhaps fits the bill : “ You can either have capitalism or a habitable planet .
One or the other , not both . ”
But just taken on its own it leaves us in limbo .
We have to then ask – and answer – the question : how do we get to have a habitable planet ?
All kinds of proposals have been put forward by different groups – everything from “ Live simply , so that others may simply live ” , some sort of return to an imagined pre-capitalist heaven on earth , through radical reform of capitalism itself , which , despite what Newman says , many believe is enough to save the environment .
Then to the solution we in Socialist Alternative propose – a revolutionary overthrow of the current system and its replacement by socialism , a society run by the working class in the interests of the majority .
A society that by its very nature can put in place the processes that begin to address restoring the earth to sustainability .
Despite the handful of vocal dissenters – and I see just today Andrew Bolt in the Herald Sun promoting one such person – that we face an environmental crisis is beyond question .
Whether it ’s global warming , pollution , plundering the forests and oceans , just to mention a few issues , the earth is in a dire state .
And things are only getting worse .
As the damning IPCC report out this week suggests it ’s coming sooner – much sooner – than previously predicted .
And our rulers – to paraphrase a famous saying , “ fiddle while the planet burns ” .
Australia ’s environmental performance , despite all the hype that Turnbull and Howard mouth , is now ranked as third worst on environmental issues of the world ’s twenty - one richest nations .
Rather than closing the gap on greenhouse gas emissions , Australia ( along with the rest of the world – the developed countries in particular ) is racing in the opposite direction , pumping out more and more every year as yesterday ’s news noted .
But surely this is n’t the whole story .
What about all those companies which are “ going green ” or those new firms producing renewable energy equipment , water tanks , or environment - friendly household products ?
Billionaires such as media giant Rupert Murdoch proclaims he ’s convinced of the risk of climate change and has embraced a ‘ carbon neutral ’ stance for his company .
Environmental groups are teaming up with those in the retail and hospitality industries for a greener world .
Wal - Mart is working closely with Conservation International on its efforts to cut energy usage and switch to renewable sources of power and McDonald ’s has teamed up with Greenpeace to discourage deforestation caused by the growth of soybean farming in Brazil .
And the other day I heard that Friends of the Earth has teamed up with one of the retailers here .
Even the oil companies are jumping on the bandwagon , with British Petroleum ( BP ) rebadging itself as Beyond Petroleum with a gleaming gold and green sun logo and promises of developing renewable energy sources , weaning them – and us – off oil .
And there ’s no shortage of money for ‘ green ’ businesses .
As the New York Times pointed out earlier this year , “ venture capitalists have begun pouring billions into energy - related start - ups , ” with “ lawyers , accountants , recruiters and publicists all developing energy - oriented practices to cater to the causes of transforming the trillion dollar US domestic energy market while [ so they say ] saving the planet . ”
Does n’t all this mean that capitalism is capable of fundamentally reforming itself ?
After all it ’s not hard to see that this society is one of history ’s most innovative and productive systems ever .
Just as a small example , look at the booming computer industry and how it has transformed the way we live – at least in the wealthy West .
As well , as British socialist Chris Harman recently pointed out , governments and businesses do have a genuine interest in stopping climate change .
Not in our interests certainly but , as he adds “ just as their predecessors a century and a half ago had a genuine interest in dealing with typhoid and cholera in slum working class districts in order to stop the diseases affecting upper class districts as well . ”
He continues “ What is at stake for them – the people running governments and business – now is greater .
Not just their lives are threatened , but the stability of global capitalism . ”
And while concern for their own survival is no doubt important to today ’s ruling class , it ’s the continuation of their system – global capitalism that is the critical factor for them .
So , for example , climate change was certainly on the collective minds of the world ’s richest and most powerful individuals , companies and countries at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year .
But the debate was not pitched at saving the planet – rather as the backdrop signs spelt out , it was – “ Make Green Pay ” .
Henry Ford ’s great - grandson Bill , a “ passionate environmentalist ” apparently , sees his mission in life as getting rid of the internal combustion engine , that powers today ’s cars .
But again it ’s the survival of business that matters as he explains : “ There is a rising tide of environmental awareness .
Smart companies will get ahead of the wave .
Those that do n’t will be wiped out . ”
But is n’t that just the way the system works ?
For some companies there are profits , while others will go to the wall , but overall the system survives and we ’ve seen a massive improvement in the quality of life for so many people – healthier and longer lives coupled with higher standard of living .
The cleaning up of environmental problems such as the London smogs which peaked in the notorious December 1952 Great Smog that killed around 4000 people , acid rain , CFCs and the insecticide DDT to name just the most well known .
And if Bill Ford does get rid of the internal combustion engine , wo n’t that be great ?
We can even point to the fact that capitalism has overseen the greatest productive bonanza the world has ever seen , making it possible for the first time in human history to feed , clothe , house and provide education , leisure time and the like for every single person on the planet .
[ Though of course that there is still homelessness , starvation , illiteracy does raise questions about the system . ]
But to go on with the benefits .
It ’s also made it possible to devise the technology to clean up the planet , stop the global warming threat , use renewable energy – and so on .
Also , as many point out , have n’t earlier systems been just as destructive as capitalism is today ?
It ’s claimed the collapse of the Maya in Central America was due to over - farming , Roman and Greek societies certainly took their toll on the environment , probably contributing to their downfall .
It ’s also argued that humanity played a huge role in the extinction of many of the large animals of earlier times , including the big flightless birds of New Zealand .
So why do we argue that capitalism – more than any other human social system – not only cannot solve the environmental problems of today , but also , in and of itself , is the cause of the world ’s ecological nightmares .
Nightmares that we can only awake from by replacing capitalism itself .
We have to go back to the basics of how the system works .
Capitalism divides society into two main classes , the ruling class ( eg , factory owner , banker – the employer ) and the working class .
Under the rule of the employers and the state forces that back them up , capital combines its two sources of wealth – the mass “ socialised ” labour power of workers in the factories , farms , offices and the like , associated with the necessary machinery ( the computers , trucks , etc ) with the second source – the world ’s natural resources , to produce goods at a level never seen before .
These goods that are produced , however , do not belong to the workers who have made them – either for their own use or even to trade for other useful items .
Nor do they have a say in what is produced .
Instead they are the property of the employer , who then proceeds to sell these items for more than it cost to produce them – in other words , at a profit .
A money profit that is pocketed by the employer rather than shared equally with all .
And because the system runs on making profit – without it the company will collapse – this sets up a highly competitive world system as companies battle it out for market share and more profits .
So the result is that what drives this system forward , is not how these goods satisfy human needs for a living – though of course it must do that to a certain extent otherwise there will be no workers – but the driver is the money profit a capitalist can make from the sale of products .
So if there ’s a choice between human need and profit , profit will win out .
This is when you see the obscenity of food being dumped rather than sent to feed the malnourished or starving peoples of the world , who are too poor to buy them at the price that would deliver a profit .
Or the case of James Hardie which continued to make asbestos products because it was profitable , despite the fact that they knew asbestos could – and would – kill many of those who came into contact with it .
Money profit has another property – apart from enriching the ruling class – that is crucial in its destructive potential .
Unlike natural resources which can completely run out and cannot be accumulated , the goal of money profit is quantitatively unlimited , and it can continue to accumulate for so long as there is anything left standing .
Hence the quote from Paul Burkett in our pamphlet : “ We may not like it , but the fact is that capitalism can survive any ecological catastrophe short of the extinction of human life . ”
And the capitalists will continue to try to “ improve ” their productive processes to gain ever more profit .
As Karl Marx put it , “ The division of labor [ a highly efficient way of organising work ] is necessarily followed by greater division of labor , the application of machinery by still greater application of machinery , works on a large scale by works on a still larger scale .
That is the law [ driven by competition ] which again and again throws bourgeois production out of its old course and which compels capital to intensify the productive forces of labor , [ and ] because it has intensified them . . . [ this ] law gives capital no rest continually whispering in its ear ‘ Go on !
Go on ! ’ ”
Polish revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg explains in more detail how this drive for profit leads to environmental crises as the world is plundered .
She writes “ Capital , impelled to appropriate productive forces for the purposes of exploitation , ransacks the whole world ; it procures its means of production from all corners of the earth , seizing them , if necessary by force , from all levels of civilisation and from all forms of society . ”
Today we just have to look at the US in Iraq and Afghanistan – the murder of millions and the environmental trashing that comes from non -stop warfare to secure the oil and other resources to maintain US world domination – ie the domination of American capital .
Then there ’s the competition for the riches of Africa , where the companies grow fat and the people starve and the local land is devastated ; the wide - scale destruction of forests to grow corn for biofuel ; or as global warming melts the ice around the Arctic , resource companies rush to lay claim to Greenland ’s previously inaccessible oil , diamonds and gold .
Or in Australia where we see the latest invasion of Aboriginal land to gouge out the uranium and other mineral resources for private profit .
Or Capital creates commodities that can be sold out of resources that once were free .
As one commentator noted , carbon credits – part of the carbon trading process – “ are a triumph of capitalism , creating a commodity from nothing – clean pockets of air – that gain value through being certified .
They have created a market now worth between $ 10 and $ 30 billion . ”
This set The Economist – the British magazine for the bosses – to rubbing its hands with glee over such wealth creation adding its hope that , “ perhaps soon , the best things in life will not be free . ”
But crazy as this system may seem , a system that can never stand still , is forever expanding , what underpins the capitalist dilemma is that because of the constant innovation and improvement , as more and more workers are replaced by machinery , the system ’s rate of profit actually declines .
This leads the world ’s capitalists to ever greater frenzies of production – especially arms production as occurred in the aftermath of World War II – as they try to counteract the system ’s downward spiral .
So we get the economic crises that capitalism cannot escape .
A drive for money profit that forces ever greater production until there are market gluts and then the falling prices , plummeting profits and financial collapse of the system .
While every other human society faced crises of scarcity , capitalism is the only one that has crises of over - production .
And as well , crises that can only be resolved by mass destruction of productive forces ( the factories , farms , etc ) and emiseration of millions of people either through wars or economic Depressions .
With immediate profit as the driver of the system , not the real needs of humanity or a sustainable planet , capitalism is , in fact , indifferent to the fate of humanity and the world we live in .
Marx wrote that Capital is “ moved as much and as little by the sight of the coming degradation and final depopulation of the human race , as by the probable fall of the earth into the sun . ”
So for example , former US Secretary of State Madeline Albright , when asked whether the death of an estimated half million children in Iraq as result of the sanctions imposed in the 1990s , was a price worth paying , she replied “ … the price – we think the price is worth it . ”
So to sum up what we ’ve gone through so far .
Capitalism – a system whose driver is profit rather than human needs – must plunder and degrade the planet to feed its continuous expansion as it tries to counteract its inbuilt faultline – the tendency of the rate of profit to fall .
Consequently , we argue , capitalism is directly responsible for the scale of destruction and if left to continue , will drive us ever closer to annihilation .
WHY THE WORKING CLASS ?
Now I ’ve detailed the ills of the system and why it is the way it is , what ’s the solution ?
For many the most obvious answer still would be to reform capitalism itself .
Make the governments act , force the companies to go green with legislation that has real teeth or use financial incentives to encourage sustainable production .
Just yesterday a group of Australian businesses and environmentalists , frustrated by the glacial progress so far on environmental issues , announced they were setting up a lobby group to put pressure on governments to do just this .
Now it is possible to imagine a capitalism that lived off the profits based on the production and sale of renewable energy .
You ca n’t go anywhere these days without seeing new environmental businesses setting up , especially water tanks and solar panels .
The car company Saab flashes its green credentials with ads boasting about “ Going Grrreeen ” because it uses biofuels .
There are companies growing rich on renewable energy , organic farming or environmentally sound building practices .
After all there ’s no law that says for capitalism to survive it has to rely on fossil fuel sources , that it has to have plastic or die .
So also , it can seem to be common sense to take steps individually , to clean up your own backyard .
Certainly this is the message we can take from the Howard government ’s recent Environmental Guidelines handout .
Though I suspect most people would consider it a complete waste of the paper they used in the guidelines , when the advice included such things as telling people to keep the lid on the saucepan when they ’re cooking .
As well many environmental groups can point to gains that have been won .
In Melbourne , for example , when the Victorian government proposed placing a toxic waste dump in the middle of working class western suburbs – and home to Melbourne ’s market gardens – a coalition of workers , unions , local residents and market gardeners ran a successful state - wide campaign and forced the government to ban future land - filling of hazardous waste .
In addition there was a complete overhaul of hazardous waste management , including recycling and waste reduction .
Union initiated Green Bans and the anti-nuclear movement certainly won gains earlier , both drawing in unions , resident actions and mass rallies .
It ’s even conceivable that in the face of an immense global crisis brought on by climate change , where the social upheaval and instability threatened the survival of key sections of global capitalism , that some dramatic world - wide shift to sustainable production could happen .
So it may be possible that capitalism can spend its way out of a planetary meltdown , but the crucial question is : what will be the final cost to humanity of its survival ?
Restructuring the world economy to provide some level of sustainability is not going to be just a case of simply switching from one profitable enterprise to another or paying a bit more for energy and water .
Because “ we are where we are ” , we have a world system based on massive extraction of non-renewable energy sources and other resources generating enormous profits for existing companies , alongside a world arms race leaning more and more to nuclear weaponry and ratcheting up the pressure to mine uranium .
None of these firms will give up their profitable businesses without a fight , nor will governments simply drop the push to nuclear warfare .
In fact we could – and will if capitalism continues along its present trajectory – see wars fought where the new renewable energy firms challenge their rivals oil and coal for market dominance , or countries fight over access to food and water resources .
In other words the market forces of capitalism running rampant .
So if the ruling class cannot provide the answers – and there ’s a lot more in this pamphlet and in issues of our magazine that spell this out – who can ?
Earlier I referred to capitalism as being basically a two class society – workers and bosses .
Rather than being any particular attribute of the bosses or what they do , it is actually the combination of workers ’ labour ( or labour power as Marx called it ) and the world ’s natural resources that creates society ’s wealth .
And more specifically it ’s workers ’ labour power that is the source of profit that the system so relies on .
It does n’t take much then to see that if workers are the source of the system ’s wealth , then as Marx famously puts it , they can also be the system ’s “ gravediggers ” .
In other words , when workers stop , nothing moves and this points to the power the working class has to challenge capital – a power held by no other group in society .
And we ’ve just seen what happens when sections of the working class right now – the teachers and nurses in Australia or the workers and students in France and German railway workers – take action .
So precisely because the global threat to the environment comes from the operation of capitalism itself , we ’re going to have to take on the might of the corporations and the state that is hand in glove with them .
Obviously this is n’t just something that can happen overnight .
Right now this means our first step must be a collective fight for reforms , harnessing the strength of the organised working class , to shut down the polluting companies and force governments to act , rather than looking to concerned citizens individually rationing their water and electricity use , paying more for “ green ” alternatives or buying organic .
In other words – how we struggle and what we demand matters .
If we look at how the battle against uranium mining was waged , it ’s clear it was through collective action , the combined mobilisations of the anti-uranium movement , indigenous groups and the unions , that we won what we did .
Mobilising around working class demands such as “ Black Ban Uranium ” or “ land rights , not uranium ” , kept the movement focused on the need to tackle the bosses and the government , not just do deals with them or even see some of them as our allies .
Again I want to refer you to our pamphlet which has more examples of the different struggles in Australia ’s history .
However this is just the beginning .
Mass mobilisations and union pressure can start to shift the corporations , but to challenge capital at its very core – and lay the basis for a different world – we need to go further .
Out of the struggle must come both the revolutionary organisations of workers to overthrow capitalism , and a class ready to build the world anew – to build a socialist society .
And to get to there , we need to start in the here and now – as Mick ’s book “ From Little Things … ” outlines .
We need to be having the political arguments convincing people that capitalism is the cause of the world ’s environment problems , why it ’s the organised working class that has the power to stop capitalism in its tracks – and as a consequence , why it is so crucial to build the mass mobilisations – like this month ’s Global Warming rally and the union struggles that can strengthen workers ’ ability to fight .
But also , why we need to build political groups such as Socialist Alternative , to bring together the admittedly small numbers of active socialists around today to start to make the arguments about the need to take the struggle past reforming capitalism on to the path of a revolutionary transformation of society .
To begin to build a socialist society that can lay the basis for a sustainable world for the whole planet .

Nature , not mankind , is responsible for recent climate change , according to new peer - reviewed research likely to send ripples around the world .
The two - year study by three Australasian scientists was published yesterday in the American Geophysical Union 's Journal of Geophysical Research and casts doubts on the widely accepted assumption that human activities are responsible for global warming .
Auckland University climate scientist Chris de Freitas , Bob Carter , an academic at James Cook University , Townsville , and Melbourne scientist John McLean have concluded that little or none of the late 20th century warming trend can be attributed to humans .
Instead , they say that in the past 50 years the average global temperature has fallen and risen in close agreement with the development of El Nino or La Nina conditions .
In 2007 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said global surface temperatures had increased about by 0.74 degrees Celsius between 1906 and 2005 .
The panel concluded that rising levels of greenhouse gases from human activity , including deforestation and burning of fossil fuels , were responsible for much of that increase .
De Freitas , who has worked as an adviser to the Climate Science Coalition , which is sceptical about global warming , said his paper had been fully peer - reviewed over six months and accepted by a top academic journal .
" This will have an effect .
This is scientific research , not an opinion ...
There will be people who will be forced to correct me , no doubt , but that is what science is all about robust debate . "

Campbell Bridges , 71 , was attacked by 20 men in the grounds of his 600 - acre property near the southern town of Voi .
He fought off the mob with his son Bruce and four Kenyan staff but died of his injuries on arrival at hospital .
Police are investigating the attack which is reportedly connected to a three - year dispute over access and control of Mr Bridges ' gemstone mines .
Police said he was driving his pick - up truck in the grounds of his home within a national park when he was ambushed by about 20 men brandishing crude home - made weapons .
Witnesses said his injuries were caused by stab wounds from a knife .
No - one else was injured in the attack on Tuesday .
Mr Bridges ' body has since been flown to the capital Nairobi .
He would stand up to anyone .
He would have gone in with his fists flying if someone attacked him
The Rev John Ellison
Victim 's friend
Murdered gems expert 's son speaks A close friend , the Rev John Ellison , 72 , from Alton , Hampshire , told the BBC Scotland news website that the internationally - renowned gemmologist would have put up a strong fight .
" He was very fit , strong and confrontational but a lovely man nevertheless , " he said .
" He would stand up to anyone .
He would have gone in with his fists flying if someone attacked him . "
He added that his " wonderful " friend had " a quick fuse if anyone was dishonest " .
Mr Bridges was born in the UK but had lived in the African country most of his life .
He is credited with discovering the green Tsavorite gem , a rare stone unique to the region , and also worked as a special consultant to the New York jewellers , Tiffany and Co. Mr Ellison revealed that Mr Bridges had previously been threatened as he owned mining rights and therefore knew where the deposits were .
" He was very well known in Africa and the gemstone industry , which gave him a lifetime achievement award , " he said .
" He had a fund of stories and I was privileged to have been the first person outside his family to know of his discovery in 1971 .
This is terrible news . "
A UK Foreign Office spokesman said : " We can confirm the death of Campbell Bridges on 11 August following injuries sustained in an attack near Voi in Kenya .
" British consular officials are liaising with the local authorities who have confirmed that an investigation is under way . "
Mr Bridges leaves a wife , Judy , and two grown - up children , Laura and Bruce .

By Maggie Shiels
Technology reporter , BBC News , Silicon Valley
The average user has 120 friends on the site Facebook has turned up the heat on Google by purchasing content - sharing service FriendFeed , say industry watchers .
Many expected Google or even
Twitter to buy the company , which has been praised for its " real - time " search engine .
This type of search is valuable because it lets you know what is happening right now on any given subject .
" Google look out , Facebook knows the real money is in real - time search , " said respected blogger Robert Scoble .
" Google is the king of regular search .
FriendFeed is the king of real - time search .
This makes the coming battle over this issue much more interesting , " Mr Scoble told the BBC .
Back in May , Google founder Larry Page admitted that the search giant had fallen behind other services like that of Twitter .
" People really want to do stuff real time and I think they ( Twitter ) have done a great job .
" We 've done a relatively poor job of doing things that work on a per second basis , " Mr Page said at the time .
' Warning shot '
Many in Silicon Valley agree that this deal has changed the game .
" Facebook was unable to acquire Twitter so this is the next best option , " said Ben Parr , associate editor of Mashable , a news blog covering social media .
" FriendFeed is well known for having some powerful and intelligent technology that allows users to aggregate everything they do online and do it all in real time .
WHAT DOES FRIENDFEED DO
Friendfeed lets users bring together many of the accounts they have on social media and networking sites such as Facebook and Flickr Updates posted on those sites by a user and their friends are echoed on FriendFeed .
A built in chat system lets FriendFeed users instantly comment or start a conversation about an update .
These feeds of what friends are up to can be embedded in webpages or fed out to services such as Twitter .
FriendFeed works with almost 60 sites including Delicious , Reddit , LinkedIn and NetVibes .
" With this acquisition , Facebook is gunning directly not only at Twitter , but at Google .
This is a warning shot to those two companies , " Mr Parr told BBC News .
Mr Scoble noted that FriendFeed 's real - time search could stretch back 18 months compared to a few days for Twitter .
Silicon Valley commentators have long regarded FriendFeed as an inspiration for many of Facebook 's features .
These include the ability for users to import activities from third parties services like YouTube and Flickr to letting users comment or say they " like " something in another user 's feed .
" FriendFeed has in effect been the R&D ( research & development ) department for Facebook for some time now , " said Mr Scoble , who is one of the service 's most popular users with nearly 46,000 subscribers .
" They have the best community technology out there and Facebook should continue to use them to try out new features and test them out before transferring them over to Facebook . "
The deal
The purchase caught many in Silicon Valley by surprise , even though the two companies had been talking on and off for the past two years .
" This is an 11th hour deal , " admitted FriendFeed co-founder Bret Taylor .
Twitter sees itself as a new form of real - time communication Industry commentators had expected Google to make a bid for the company , especially given the fact that its founders all used to work there .
" FriendFeed accepts Facebook friend request " is how Mr Taylor described the buyout , in a tongue - in - cheek reference to how Facebook users ask one another to become part of their friend network .
He continued in a similar vein in his blog post .
" As my mom explained to me , when two companies love each other very much , they form a structured investment vehicle .
" Our companies share a common vision .
Now we have the opportunity to bring many of the innovations we 've developed at FriendFeed to Facebook 's 250 million users around the world . "
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was equally complimentary .
" Since I first tried FriendFeed , I 've admired their team for creating such a simple and elegant service for people to share information .
" As this shows , our culture continues to make Facebook a place where the best engineers come to build things quickly that lots of people will use . "
As part of the agreement , all FriendFeed employees will join Facebook and the company 's four founders will be given senior roles on the social networking site 's engineering and product teams .
FriendFeed will continue as it is for the moment independently .
" Eventually , one way or another , it 's hard to see FriendFeed as it stands now , continuing on , " said MG Siegler of Silicon Valley news site Tech Crunch .
" Facebook will begin to take up too much of the FriendFeeders ' time , and it will languish .
It 's sad , but that 's the web .
Not every service can flourish .
There simply are n't enough users with enough time to use all of them . "

" Where 's the beef ? "
That 's the idiom that jumps to mind as I work my way through Galen Gruman 's " The 7 best features in Mac OS X Snow Leopard . "
I knew the features list would be lean -- Apple has deliberately undersold Snow Leopard by pitching it as a relatively minor release -- but please !
Gruman 's article reads like a laundry list of borrowed features and derivative works .
It 's as if someone at Apple grabbed a copy of the Windows 7 beta and simply Xeroxed the release notes .
For example :
64 - bitness : Yippee !
Apple finally goes 64 - bit -- BFD !
As a Windows user , I 've been livin ' la vida 64 - bit for more than three years .
Vista was the first mainstream desktop OS to deliver a viable 64 - bit experience , and Windows 7 has taken this migration further by making it the preferred flavor for business users .
[ See how Windows 7 RTM stacks up against Vista and XP in InfoWorld 's tests .
|
Get ready for Windows 7 : Download InfoWorld 's 21 - page PDF Windows 7 Deep Dive report . ]
Meanwhile , Apple can't even deliver a fully 64 - bit implementation .
Snow Leopard boots into a 32 - bit kernel by default -- something about a lack of 64 - bit device drivers , which is ironic when you consider how small a hardware ecosystem Apple must govern when compared to Microsoft and its burden of having to run on just about anything with an Intel - compatible CPU .
Exposé Dock Integration :
This one 's a joke , right ?
Am I to understand that Apple is just getting around to adding this ?
Microsoft has been offering this type of functionality ( aka thumbnail preview ) for years , and Windows 7 has taken the concept further with Aero Peek , Shake , and Snap .
It sounds like Apple 's Xerox machine suffered a paper jam with this one -- or perhaps it 's just stuck in one of those famous Mac OS X infinite loops .
Expanded PDF
Preview :
If this constitutes a " feature , " then Apple must really be grasping !
I mean , Windows has supported PDF file preview -- via an installable ifilter module -- ever since Desktop Search debuted pre-Vista .
In fact , the ability to seamlessly preview third - party content has been a staple of the Windows experience for years .
So while I 'm glad to see Apple finally getting on the ball with its PDF handling ( I hear the updated viewer lets you basically do away with the piggish Adobe Reader for most common tasks ) , I 'm still utterly stunned by the fact that this is even an issue .
Provide a free ( i.e. not trialware ) XPS document viewer with Mac OS X and then maybe I 'll get excited .
QuickTime Pro : Can you believe the Apple folks used to charge for this thing ?
I guess they saw the writing on the wall , what with Microsoft releasing yet another excellent iteration of its free Movie Maker application .
Way to play that reactionary card , Apple !
I could go on , but I think I 've made my point .
Mac OS X Snow Leopard is truly an underwhelming release , one that borrows most of its " new " ideas from Windows Vista .
Meanwhile , Microsoft continues to drive OS evolution forward , introducing a raft of truly innovative features with Windows 7 .
( Check out J. Peter Bruzzese 's video of the top 20 Windows 7 features for examples . )
The new Taskbar puts Apple 's clumsy Mac OS X Dock to shame , while its enhanced support for multicore CPUs ( see my earlier research on this topic ) means that even non-optimized code gets a boost -- no Grand Central Dispatch tweaking required .
[ Get all the details on the new Mac OS X features in InfoWorld 's " What 's new in Mac OS X Snow Leopard " slideshow trio : new features for all users , new features for office users , and new features for power users .
| Follow InfoWorld 's ongoing coverage of Mac OS X Snow Leopard . ]
I 've often referred to Windows 7 as " Vista R2 , " an incremental follow - up release that was mostly about righting the wrongs of its predecessor .
Viewed in these terms , Mac OS X Snow Leopard is more like a service pack : a collection of bug fixes and minor functional enhancements that , quite frankly , should have been in the original release .
As such , Snow Leopard is nothing to get all excited about ; it 's not worth even the modest " upgrade " price Apple is asking .
A drugged - up New Plymouth youth who tried to paint the town yellow with a paintball gun yesterday is now facing multiple firearm , drug and driving charges .
The 19 - year - old 's hour - long rampage began in New Plymouth 's Strandon area just before 10 am when he started taking pot shots at members of the public from his moving car .
At least one person was injured when hit by a paintball , while numerous cars and houses were splattered with paint .
An hour later , police arrested the Tariki teenager after he crashed into another car .
Sergeant Grant Sawtell said the teenager had fired randomly at cars , pedestrians and property .
A man who was hit by a paintball near the Devon Hotel received a sizeable welt on his arm , but did not require medical attention .
" It just goes to show the potential for injury from paintball guns , especially if it hit you in the eye , " Mr Sawtell said .
" It is fortunate that no other person was injured . "
A loaded paintball gun was found in the car , along with a cannabis pipe .
Mr Sawtell said the teenager , who was a disqualified driver and was not supposed to have the car , admitted smoking cannabis before his shooting spree .
Police were appalled by his actions .
" Neither has he got proper control of the vehicle , but he 's been firing out of the passenger 's window .
" He was driving , shooting and trying to avoid police .
It was a recipe for disaster , " Mr Sawtell said .
The teenager is facing charges including disqualified driving , reckless driving , failing to stop , assault , recklessly discharging a firearm , unlawful possession of a firearm , possession of a pipe to smoke cannabis and driving under the influence of drugs .
He appeared in the New Plymouth District Court yesterday and was remanded on bail to reappear on August 20 .
Bail conditions include a 24 - hour curfew .

DAWSON CREEK , British Columbia , July 4 ( UPI ) --
A natural gas pipeline in western Canada was bombed Saturday for the second time in four days and the sixth time in nine months , officials said .
The bombing of the EnCana pipeline near Pouce Coupe in northern British Columbia was being investigated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , The Province reported .
Advertisement
Someone living near the pipeline called police between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m.
Saturday to report hearing a loud bang , investigators said .
The company said employees were already nearby repairing damage from Wednesday 's bombing , which was about half a mile away .
EnCana said the explosion Saturday caused a leak .
" These attacks are n't just against EnCana , they are against the entire community , " Rhona DelFrari , a spokeswoman for EnCana , said .
" We are becoming increasingly frustrated by this because it 's becoming a risk to the public . "
Cpl . Dan Moskaluk , an RCMP spokesman , said two additional officers have been added to the force in Dawson Creek because of the explosions .
But he said the most recent blasts mean police are getting more tips from the public .
" We are dealing with domestic terrorism , " Moskaluk said .
" This is an attack on a critical infrastructure . "
WASHINGTON  Civil libertarians recently accused President Obama of acting like former President George W. Bush , citing reports about Mr. Obama ’s plans to detain terrorism suspects without trials on domestic soil after he closes the Guantánamo prison .
It was only the latest instance in which critics have argued that Mr. Obama has failed to live up to his campaign pledge “ to restore our Constitution and the rule of law ” and raised a pointed question :
Has he , on issues related to fighting terrorism , turned out to be little different from his predecessor ?
The answer depends on what it means to act like Mr. Bush .
As they move toward completing a review of their options for dealing with the detainees , Obama administration officials insist that there is a fundamental difference between Mr. Bush ’s approach and theirs .
While Mr. Bush claimed to wield sweeping powers as commander in chief that allowed him to bypass legal constraints when fighting terrorism , they say , Mr. Obama respects checks and balances by relying on  and obeying  Congressional statutes .
“ While the administration is considering a series of options , a range of options , none relies on legal theories that we have the inherent authority to detain people , ” Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary , said this week in response to questions about the preventive detention report .
“ And this will not be pursued in that manner . ”
Apple had officially removed the ' Hottest Girls '
App from its store and seems punished the developer of the pornographic app .
The developer or the app that allows users to download explicit photographs to their iPhones said that Apple had removed their program from its iTunes store without notice .
Apple has now removed all of our apps from the iTunes store without prior warning .
We have yet to hear back from them on this issue , ” the developer said .
Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr explained yesterday that they had removed the pornographic App because of the developer 's violation on the agreement .
The spokesman said that the developer adds inappropriate content directly from their server after the application had been approved and distributed .
Apple has no further comments about the disappearance of all Apps from the pornographic app developer .
The other day Su - Shee asked on IRC if I could tell her which components of Rakudo are written in which programming language .
So here it is :
The source code is entered at the top of the machine named Rakudo , and is transformed in various stages .
The first two , parser and action methods , are actually part of Rakudo , and are hosted in the Rakudo repository .
They are written in two different subsets of Perl 6 , the regexes ( parser ) , and " Not Quite Perl 6 " , short NQP ( action methods ) .
The next two stages ( PAST and POST compiler ) are part of the so - called " Parrot Compiler Toolkit " , short PCT .
Both PAST and POST are structural representations of the program , with PAST being more high - level than POST .
Both compilers are written in PIR , the parrot assembly language , and are distributed along with parrot .
They are also used by many other parrot based languages .
The POST compiler emits PIR , which IMCC transforms into byte code .
IMCC is parrot 's PIR compiler , written in C and statically linked into parrot .
The byte code ( PBC ) can then be stored to disk , or executed in memory by a so - called run core or run loop , which is in some sense the heart of parrot - or one of the hearts , because there are several different ones available ( one for just - in - time compilation ( JIT ) , one for debugging etc. ) .
There are also some supporting custom types and operations in Rakudo called dynamic PMCs and dynamic ops which are written in C , and helper functions written in other languages ( namely NQP and PIR ) .
Those do not show up in the flow chart .
The part of Rakudo described so far is the stage one compiler .
In the build process it is compiled first , and then it compiles the setting library down to PBC .
" Setting library " is a fancy term describing the built - in functions which are written in Perl 6 .
The result of this compilation ( together with a low level runtime library in PIR ) is linked together with the stage one compiler and parrot , the result is the perl6 executable .

HARRY POTTER star Daniel Radcliffe further pissed off the Religious Right when he said in an interview with Moviefone that he thought it was “ awesome ” that some people thought he was gay .
His remarks follow his recent revelation that he was an atheist .
I grew up around gay people my entire life , basically , that ’s possibly why I ’m quite camp , and some people think I ’m gay when I meet them , which I think is awesome .
It ’s always good to keep them guessing [ laughs ] .
I do n’t go on any blogs or chats or anything , but my friends are demons for them , and apparently someone said â€ ˜Daniel Radcliffe is gay .
He ’s got a gay face ! ’
[ Laughs ]
I really do n’t know what a gay face is .

Hal Turner is a white nationalist who promotes ( among other things ) the rounding up and killing of Jews .
He also worked for Pat Buchanan ’s presidential campaign , served as campaign manager for libertarian party candidate Murray Sabrin , and was even a friend of Sean Hannity ( even though Sean later tried to deny it ) .
He also runs a website and does a weekly webcast espousing his views .
But he ’s now sitting in jail without bail .
In a June 2 posting to his website , he wrote that three US appellate judges “ deserve to be killed ” because they upheld a Chicago ban on handguns .
But the next day , he crossed over into crazy land by providing the names , work addresses , phone numbers , and photos of the three judges on his website .
At that point , the FBI swung into action and arrested Turner .
And here ’s when it goes beyond crazy .
While Turner was in custody , he called in a posting to his website that threatened and named the three FBI agents who interviewed him .
And they said Skip Gates was nuts for yelling at a policeman .
One of the more standard vim tweaks is to have parens , braces , brackets , and quotes auto - close — that is , you type ( , and the ) is inserted automatically .
This can be a big help in keeping track of nested groups .
This is easy to do poorly ; to do it well takes a little more thought .
I took a look at TextMate 's rules and mimicked them ( mostly ) .
Put all this stuff in your .vimrc ( _vimrc on Windows ) .
Note : A couple of these tweaks are modified or copied outright from the Vim Scripts repository .
Auto - close pairs
)
Map the auto - close for non-quotes .
This is trivial :
inoremap ( ( ) < Left > inoremap [ [ ] < Left > inoremap { { } < Left > autocmd Syntax html , vim inoremap < < lt >>< Left >
No big deal ; when the opening character is typed , insert the closing character and hit < Left > so the cursor is between them .
Function to check next character .
function ! ClosePair ( char ) if getline ( '.') [ col ( ' . ') - 1 ] == a : char return " \< Right > " else return a : char endif endf Map closing characters .
Now , all you need to do is link the closing characters to the function :
inoremap ) < c-r> =ClosePair ( ' ) ' ) < CR > inoremap ] < c-r> =ClosePair ( ' ] ' ) < CR > inoremap } < c -r> =ClosePair ( '} ' ) < CR >
Map the auto - close for quotes .
This is only slightly more difficult than ( ) [ ] {} , because of the case where you might add an escaped quotation mark to a string .
It requires a separate function : since the opening and closing characters are the same , we can't map the closing to ClosePair .
So we put it all in one function :
function ! QuoteDelim ( char ) let line = getline ( '.') let col = col ( '.') if line [ col - 2 ] == " \ \ "
" Inserting a quoted quotation mark into the string return a : char elseif line [col - 1 ] == a : char " Escaping out of the string return " \< Right > " else " Starting a string return a : char.a: char . " \< Left > " endif endf
Then just need to map that :
inoremap " < c - r > =QuoteDelim ( ' " ' ) < CR > inoremap ' < c - r> =QuoteDelim ( " ' " ) < CR >
.vimrc

WASHAKIE COUNTY , Wyoming ( CNN ) -- Federal agents have apprehended accused child molester Edward Eugene Harper , who was on the FBI 's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list , an FBI official said Thursday .
Edward Eugene Harper is believed to have lived a nomadic lifestyle since fleeing Mississippi .
Harper , 63 , is accused of molesting two girls , ages 3 and 8 , in his neighborhood in Hernando , Mississippi , more than a decade ago , the FBI said .
The FBI said it received a telephone tip in June at the Denver office regarding Harper , and brought a SWAT team and a hostage negotiation team to apprehend him in rural Wyoming on Thursday .
He surrendered without incident , the FBI said , and later admitted his identity to agents .
Harper was living in a 1979 truck with a camper top in the southern portion of Washakie County 's Big Horn Mountains , the FBI said .
He is believed to have lived a nomadic lifestyle , moving from place to place and earning a living by doing odd jobs and herding sheep , the FBI said in a statement .
He was indicted in April 1994 with conspiracy to commit sexual battery , fondling a child and sexual battery .
He failed to appear for a scheduled court hearing and a state warrant was issued for his arrest in October 1994 .
He was later charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution , a federal offense .
The FBI added him to its 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list last year .
Before living in Mississippi , Harper had been a ranch hand , working with cattle and sheep in Montana and Wyoming , the FBI said in its release on Harper last year .
He has also worked as a truck driver , the agency said .
According to the FBI , Harper subscribed to " sovereign citizen " ideology and claimed to be a member of the Montana Freemen , a group that rejected the authority of the U.S. government .
The group became famous for an 81 - day standoff with federal agents in Montana in 1996 .
But after the arrest and conviction of many of its members , the group essentially disintegrated , according to Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center .
" As far as I know , " they do n't exist , he said .
" Most of them went to prison and there was nothing left . "

Sometimes a trip the museum can be fulfilling , depending on which type of one you go to .
Some offer world - renowned art , while others offer fossils and remnants of the past .
However , here are the twenty strangest museums that are out there , either because someone does n’t have a life or we want get disturbed by the past .
Do n’t worry , you wo n’t find anything done by Picasso .

16 . New Orleans Historic Voodoo Museum ; New Orleans , Louisiana
If it ’s not creepy enough to have a museum on voodoo , New Orleans had to have one on the history of voodoo .
This way you can see how different rituals derived from folklore .
I wonder if there is a section dedicated to Weekend at Bernie ’s 2 .
15 . The Trash Museum ; Hartford , Connecticut
Most guys could probably agree that all you see at a museum is a bunch of garbage .
So why not actually have one on all things trash ?
They say it ’s quite interesting , but how much fun can trash actually be ?
14 . Shin Yokohama Ramen Museum ; Yokohama , Japan
Here ’s a place dedicated to one of the least expensive , and popular , bachelor meals on the market – ramen noodle soup .
If it ’s not enough to have a museum on ramen noodles , they even made this into an entire amusement park .
13 . Icelandic Phallological Museum ; Húsavík , Iceland
I never thought I ’d see the day when an entire museum would be dedicated to penises … but here we are .
Luckily , there are no human specimens , but there are over 200 penises of various species here .

Now it ’s only purpose is to serve our curiosity .
9. Burlingame Museum of Pez Memorabilia ; Burlingame , California
Remember all those Pez dispensers you once threw away ?
Turns out that some of them are worth quite a bit .
If you ’d like to take a trip down memory lane , or have nothing better to do , it could be worth the visit .
8. Vibrator Museum and Masturbation Hall of Fame ; San Francisco , California
Thought you ’ve seen it all by now , right ?

Here you can find a collection of pathological matter that helped with medical research .
Now people just go to get grossed out .
2. Sulabh Museum of Toilets ; New Dehli , India
I appreciate indoor plumbing as much as the next guy , but do we need a museum dedicated completely to toilets and the history of them ?
1. Museum of Bad Art ; Boston , Massachusetts
Yes , this museum is actually dedicated to the preservation , appreciation , and celebration of bad art .
It ’s hard to believe that people could spend so much time and effort on things that hideous .
Why do health care prices keep going up ?
Why is it that , over time , the cost of health care has exceeded the ability of almost everybody to pay for it out - of - pocket ?
Ask this question of 10 different people , and you 'll likely get 10 different answers , with blame dropped on HMOs , burgeoning technology , greedy doctors , malpractice insurance , socialized medicine , and a whole list of other bad guys .
It seems that practically no one from Obama to Limbaugh can remember what causes prices to go up , and up , and up .
Let 's review basic economic theory .
The law of supply and demand tells us that when demand for a product or service increases while supply remains unchanged , the price will go up .
When supply increases and demand remains the same , the price will go down .
When supply decreases and demand remains the same , the price will go up .
When demand decreases and supply remains the same , the price will go down .
Given enough time for market influences to play themselves out , these patterns will always produce these results .
Okay , now I think we can all agree that health care prices have gone up , and up , and up .
They 've been doing so for more than 50 years .
So the question is : why ?
What 's changing in the supply / demand equation ?
Well , certainly part of it is that there are more people alive today than there were 50 years ago .
On the other hand , there are more doctors , nurses , and hospitals than there were 50 years ago .
There is also more new technology than there was 50 years ago .
But there 's also another factor that has changed , one which gets very little attention .
Before I tell you what it is , consider this question : why has the cost of health care so dramatically outpaced the rate of inflation over the past 50 years ?
Give up ?
The other factor is the supply of money .
If you increase the amount of money available for the product or service in question , the price will always go up .
No exceptions .
This is the price of monetary inflation .
But it 's not the only way that the supply of money affects prices .
Prices will also go up if you force money to be spent on that product or service .
Every time , without exception .
It does n't matter where the money comes from .
It does n't matter whether the money is a tax dollar or an insurance dollar or a personal dollar .
The mere act of forcing someone ( or even inducing someone ) to spend it on health care must always contribute to the rising cost of health care .
Period .
This is the major cause of the rise in prices of anything where government chooses to involve itself .
Even if there were no change in the number of buyers and no change in the number of sellers , and no change in the products or services , if you shovel more money to the buyers or force them to spend more of their own money for a particular product or service , the price of that product or service will go up , every time over time , without exception .
This is exactly what happens every time government tries to solve a problem like health care .
If they allocate tax dollars to spend on some aspect of health care , the price of health care will always go up over time .
If they pass a regulation which forces people ( or insurance companies ) to spend money on some aspect of health care , the cost of health care will go up .
If they give a tax deduction to taxpayers for spending money on some aspect of health care , the cost of health care will go up .
This includes employer tax deductions for health insurance , Medicare , Medicaid , federal and state regulations of health care and health insurance , HMO formation , HMO reform , malpractice insurance , new drug testing , etc. , etc .
It happens every time , without exception .
Since Barrack Obama is the new President , he gets the current blame .
But he 's not the only one .
Every President in modern history over the past 50 + years is guilty of the same conduct…using government to increase the cost of health care .
Nor is Obama the first to claim that his particular plan will not drive the cost of health care up .
The same claims apply to Presidents named Bush , Clinton , Reagan , Carter , Ford , Nixon , Johnson , Kennedy … .
The list goes on and on .
Nor does it apply to just Presidents .
Congresses have done the same thing over and over .
Republicans and Democrats throughout the years have claimed repeatedly that their plan would keep costs down , that it was the other guy 's play that would increase the cost of health care .
Every one of them , every President , every Senator , every Congressman who made such a claim , was lying .
We know that they were lying because every government requirement in health care , every tax dollar spent , every regulation , every control , every … everything the government does drives the cost up .
Period .
No exceptions .
If you 've ever wondered what makes zombies rise up and chase down fresh brains after they 're dead , you 're not alone .
Harvard psychiatry professor and avowed sci-fi geek Dr. Steven C. Schlozman wondered too , and after a great deal of late - night movie watching and necro-diagnostic research , has fashioned himself into probably the world 's foremost expert on zombie neurobiology .
Mark Strauss of io9 took an in - depth look at some of the good doctor 's theories , a few of which I 've harvested ( word choice ! ) here for your flossy amusement .
( They originally appeared in Schlozman 's article " Zombies on my Mind . " )
Read on ... if you dare !
The Frontal Lobe
This part of the brain is involved with " executive functioning " - enabling us to think carefully and solve problems in an abstract way .
Clearly , there 's not much going on there if you have the misfortune of being afflicted with living deadness .
But we do know that zombies can see us and sense us .
Schlozman concludes that zombies possess just enough frontal lobe activity to " listen " to the thalamus , through which sensory input is processed .
But the frontal lobe function most relevant to understanding zombie behavior is the control of " impulsivity " - the general term for when you do something and , if you had two more seconds , you might not have done it .
For instance , if in a fit of rage you have the sudden urge to punch your boss in the face , the frontal lobe intervenes and allows you to consider why that might be a bad idea .
The Ventromedial Hypothalamus
In the movies , zombies are always hungry , no matter how many supporting actors they consume .
The most likely explanation is that zombies do n't have a properly functioning ventromedial hypothalamus : the region of the brain that lets you know whether you 've eaten enough .
The result is hyperphagia .
Zombies will eat and eat and eat , but never feel satiated .
That raises a slightly awkward question :
If zombies are constantly eating , then how come they never poop ?
Schlozman does n't know for sure , but he has at least one promising theory : Maybe the living dead are constipated .
Now we know why zombies are always moaning .
The Cerebellum and the Basal Ganglia
Science may once and for all settle the heated debate over whether " the infected " in 28 Days Later could be classified as zombies .
Schlozman says " no , " observing that " the infected " possess " some sort of higher cortical function going on that allows them to hunt humans . "
Moreover , the fake zombies in 28 Days Later exhibit fluidity of motion .
They can run , jump , climb and quickly change direction - activities that the true Romero zombies are incapable of performing .
Clearly , zombies suffer from cerebellar and basal ganglia dysfunction ( duh ! ) .
Those are the parts of the brain that make fluidity of motion possible .
The basal ganglia helps us with coordinated movement .
The cerebellum helps us with balance .
In fact , if you visit the website of the National Institutes of Health and read about cerebellar degeneration ( such as ataxia ) , the symptoms match the familiar gait of the living dead : " a wide - legged , unsteady , lurching walk , usually accompanied by a back and forth tremor in the trunk of the body " ¦ "

Try to be mindful , and let things take their natural course .
Then your mind will become still in any surroundings , like a clear forest pool .
All kinds of wonderful , rare animals will come to drink at the pool , and you will clearly see the nature of all things .
You will see many strange and wonderful things come and go , but you will be still .
This is the happiness of the Buddha .

Since it was first introduced several months ago , the dreaded Conficker worm has been synonymous with wreaking havoc on computers worldwide .
Almost no one would ever consider its creation a " good " thing , but that may be changing , if only in one isolated incident .
Ironically the virus , warned to be harmful to millions of people around the globe , has actually made a few hundred fans in England .
The warm reception came following a planned attack on Manchester City Council ( MCC ) .
According to the Manchester Evening News , a total of 1,609 traffic tickets could not be issued within the 28 - day legal limit , rendering them void and altogether useless .
Worst of all , the attacks ended up costing the MCC more than 43,000 GBP ( Great Britain Pound ) in lost bus lane fines .
( Source : itpro.co.uk )
Financial Losses Don't End There
A series of new reports filed by the Manchester City Council reveal that the Conficker virus ended up totaling 1.5 million GBP in lost earnings .
This included a hefty 1.2 million GBP via the IT department bill , 600,000 GBP for consultancy support and expertise and another 600,000 GBP to bring forward the purchase of Wyse Terminals as replacements for the compromised PCs .
There was also 178,000 GBP in staffing costs , with most spent in covering the processing backlog for benefits .
Why did Conficker Target the Manchester City Council ?
While the Conficker virus has zeroed in on a number of IT businesses this year , many still question why the Manchester City Council was chosen to be the target this time .
In the aftermath of the attacks , the answer is now known : MCC had no IT disaster recovery plan established in case of emergency .
The shortcomings have since been addressed to prevent future attacks .
Steve Park , head of IT at the Manchester City Council , attempted to reassure the public after claiming that the MCC has now " built on and improved a disaster recovery strategy , which covers all main networks . "
( Source : itpro.co.uk )
However , more than a few people are claiming that any strides made now are " too little , too late " in terms of preparing for a future Conficker attack .
While online deviants would not likely reappear for a second time , many feel that the damage to the MCC has already been done during the first wave of attacks .
Another week , another update on Edge Rails .
And man , you are n’t making this easy on me , are ya ?
This weekend , in case you had n’t already heard , was the first Rails and RailsBridge BugMash .
If my count is correct , there were roughly 300 commits to the Rails master over the past six days , with most of them pushing in over the weekend .
Talk about a trial by fire !
There ’s a lot of really good stuff in here , so let ’s get started :
All I ever wanted was a little Validation
ActiveRecord ( or probably more accurately , ActiveModel ) received a lot of validation love this weekend .
Thanks to James
Hill you can now have your validations read from a custom method .
This will allow you to more easily validate non-column - instance variable - data , for example .
Adam Keys added support for exclusive ranges in validates_length_of .
So , validates_length_of : name , : within => ( 5...10 ) will actually restrict the valid length to between 5 and 9 .
.
So , will actually restrict the valid length to between 5 and 9 .
Thanks to Zac Williams , validates_length_of : name , : maximum => 10 will now allow nil values to validate , by default .
will now allow values to validate , by default .
What good is validates_format_of if you can’t validates_format_of : without => /.../ ?
Well , not much , let me tell you …
Elliot Winkler provided a patch do to just that .
if you ca n’t ?
Well , not much , let me tell you …
Elliot Winkler provided a patch do to just that .
And last , but certainly not least Jeff Dean committed a great patch , which now brings to us : validates_with .
This little beauty now allows you place validation code into an external class .
And that , my friends , means better encapsulation of responsibility , I ’ll bet on better readability , and even shared validation logic across your application or possibly even gems .
Nice job , Jeff .
We ’re so much more Resourceful
There were quite a number of updates to ActiveResource over the weekend .
And , I ’m sure many of you are going to be quite thankful for some of these :
ActiveResource now supports HTTP proxies thanks to Marshall Huss .
This should be highly useful in large corporate and other firewalled or isolated environments .
ActiveResource gets SSL options from Roy Nicholson .
This allows you to use X509 certificates , SSL timeouts , peer verification , and more .
ActiveResource.exists ?
got some polish from Jatinder Singh .
And , by polish , I really mean that now it works .
Instead of raising Net:: HTTP errors .

And , by polish , I really mean that now it works .

Fabien Jakimowicz added JSON error reporting support .
So , now regardless of whether you ’re using either XML or JSON , errors will be correctly reported back to you .
There ’s strength in numbers
Thanks to Dan Cheail , we finally get a grouped_collection_select helper .
I mean come on , there ’s no way you can tell me that you ca n’t love this :
class Continent < ActiveRecord :: Base class Country < ActiveRecord :: Base class City < ActiveRecord :: Base <% = grouped_collection_select(:city , : country_id , @continents , : countries , :name , :id , : name ) %> < select name= " city [ country_id ] " > < optgroup label = " Africa " > < option value= " 1 " > South Africa < / option > < option value= " 3 " > Somalia</ option > </optgroup > < optgroup label= " Europe " > < option value= " 7 " selected =" selected " > Denmark < / option > < option value = " 2 " > Ireland </ option > </optgroup > </ select >
I have massive Routes
This weekend brought a small , but incredibly useful patch to rake routes by Mike Breen .
Now you can filter the listed results by passing in CONTROLLER =foo .
That ’s. just .
awesome .
Personally , it ’s gotten to the point that my fingers just assume that they are to append the “ | grep foo ” portion whenever I type rake routes .. apparently I have nerd muscle memory .
* sigh *
Short and sweet
I ’ll end the BugMash portion here with just a few more commits worth mentioning .
Certainly this was n’t the extent of the BugMash and I could probably fill up another post just as long with even more mashed bugs and features , but it ’s gotta end somewhere , right ?
Rizwan Reza added support for you to define custom RedCloth options via the textilize helper .
So , now , textilize ( " Testing < b> HTML </b> " , : filter_html ) will actually filter the HTML !
helper .
So , now , will actually filter the HTML !
You can now redirect_to( User ) - note that User is a class not an instance here - as a synonym for redirect_to( users_url ) .
Thanks to Niklas Holmgren for that .
- note that is a class not an instance here - as a synonym for .
Thanks to Niklas Holmgren for that .
Delivered mail items now have the ability to save to disk because of Eric Davis .
When using the new : file delivery method , you can even define your own custom : location for directory storage .
delivery method , you can even define your own custom for directory storage .
And finally , it ’s not necessarily BugMash - related , but José Valim - among dozens of other commits - added model .
destroyed ? .
This nifty method will return true only if the instance you ’re currently looking at has been successfully destroyed .
Now that we ’re clear of those , here are a couple of non-BugMash - related topics which were addressed :
A visit to the Oracle
There ’s a difference between knowing the path and walking the path .
And this week saw some updates to Rails , mostly around testing , adding improved Oracle database support .
A large amount of this effort appears to be coming from one man , Raimonds Simanovskis .
I know when we talk about databases with Rails , it ’s always the big four - SQLite , MySQL , PostgreSQL , and that other one which shall not be named - so it ’s nice to get a little more focus the 800 lb.
gorilla in the room .
This update fixed failing test cases due to offset and limits , empty strings storing as null , numeric results from ActiveRecord.sum , Oracle not utilizing an ‘ AS ’ keyword on joins , and many more .
AbstractController :: Responder
José Valim and Yehuda Katz ( and many others , I ’m sure ) have put in some excellent work in refactoring the Rails renderer .
In fact , the majority of the rendering code has come to find a home in a common object , the AbstractController : : Responder .
Certainly , this may not be its final resting place , but it ’s interesting to note that once a lot of the render logic was brought together the core team was able to quickly identify and refactor the logic to see some dramatic speed increases .
At one point , Yehuda even mentioned a tested benchmark showing , “ 10 % faster partial rendering , ” than Rails 2.3 .
I know that in the RailsEnvy podcast I jabbed a few ribs about the amount of time it ’s taken to see a Rails 3.0 release , but it ’s important to note that these guys are doing some seriously awesome work .
I ’m seeing extensive testing and benchmarking and very intelligent refactorings .
We ’ve really got some great things yet to come .
I ’m sure I ’ve left out several important and / or interesting commits this week .
So , I apologize if one of those was yours .
I , and the rest of the community , certainly appreciate the effort you all put in this weekend and Rails is certainly better for it .
So , thank you , thank you , thank you to all of you BugMashers out there .
And , if you missed out on getting your commit in this round , we ’re certainly ready to welcome you into the next .

I ran into a representative of The New York Times the other day at lunch .
“ Holy guacamole . ” he said to me from the next table .
As he did he put down an archaic looking cellphone signaling to the rest of the cafe that it was okay to start talking again .
He immediately began explaining to me that he was in town on business , “ We ’re seeing if we ca n’t move papers here ( Hyde Park , Chicago ) .
Try to get a few professors to use them in their classes .
Have you ever read The Times ? ”
“ Of course , but online . ” I said .
“ I understand that you guys are in trouble these days . ”
“ Right now our readership is actually going up ” he responded “ As the smaller papers go out of business their readers become ours .
We ’re picking up 120,000 subscriptions at a time .
But yeah we ’re in trouble , this must have been how Edward J. Smith felt . ”
( I had to look it up too , he was the captain of the Titanic . )
“ I do n’t understand why we ’re in trouble , people like to read , you like to read , can you honestly say you do all your reading online ? ”
Yes I can say that ( and I did ) .
Amongst our generation there ’s no question of competition between print and screen .
I do everything on my computer and the ease of opening a new tab is something that print will never match .
But a sheaf of print was never The Times real product–print simply used to be the cheapest medium for delivering content .
These days
The Internet is that medium and I think The Times has embraced this ( although apparently our guy has n’t ) .
In fact , their site is a savvy piece of work .
But I felt the need to press him further : “ What do you guys think about reddit ? ”
He ’d never heard of reddit , and I was appalled , it was like a Coca - Cola employee not having heard of Pepsi .
I obligingly explained , trying to conceal my pride at my generations elegant solution .
The Time ’s content could never beat reddit’s , because reddit ’s content included The Time ’s , it was a simple subset argument .
Finally we got to the question : “ So what ’s reddit got that we do n’t ? ”
Aha , I knew this one cold , reddit ’s got its community , its chaotic masses that somehow always float the most interesting bits of The Internet to the top of the home page and have collectively consumed every scrap of sci fi in existence .
The New York Times might create brilliant content , but reddit facilitates its consumption and the former , by itself is n’t a business model anymore .
Not on the scale The Times needs it to be .
This is reddit ’s edge .
But it is n’t .
The New York Times is pulling in 15 million unique visitors a month ( according to compete.com ) and reddit ’s community wo n’t beat The Time’s .
Anyone who ’s anyone reads it .
Winston Churchill read it .
Try to imagine what his karma would have looked like .
The problem is , right now they ’re doing nothing to leverage this community , and this is the final nail for print .
They do n’t need to convince us to read their paper ’s or use it in our classes , we already do that , they need to convince us to pay for it .
The Times is planning to finally cut off free access and try to sell subscriptions to its online content .
If this happens it will be the end of my readership .
But if they offer me the option of interacting with their other readers ( their staff would be cool as well ) , who share my interests and have worthwhile opinions , then I ’m in .
I ’m in for double what they ’re thinking about asking right now .

Norway 's biggest headache right now is not the financial crisis .
Rather , the predominantly Christian nation is plagued by a religious dilemma over the right of a Muslim woman to wear a hijab as part of her police uniform .
As the controversy has escalated , the country has seen the physical collapse of the justice minister , the public burning of a hijab , and a substantial rise in the popularity of Norway 's anti-immigrant opposition party just six months before general elections .
This is odd for a country known for religious tolerance , generous international development aid , and peace efforts worldwide .
But the controversy highlights the latent fears of a nonpluralistic society , where 91 percent belong to the Evangelical - Lutheran Church of Norway .
The dilemma began last fall when a Norwegian Muslim woman petitioned for permission to wear her hijab , the traditional head covering for Muslim women , as part of her police uniform .
Norway 's justice ministry originally decided in February to allow it , but revoked the permission a few weeks later after loud criticism from the police union , which argued it breached the neutrality of the uniform .
" A change of uniform regulations , with an allowance for covering hair , has never been a goal in itself .
It has always been thought of as a possible means to increase the recruitment of police from minority groups in society , " said Justice Minister Knut Storberget , in defense of his decision to revoke the initial permission .
Amid the heightened media attention and political backlash from his flip - flopping , the minister collapsed and subsequently announced a two - week sick leave , which was then extended .
The hijab debacle comes on the back of the minister 's other religious - related political defeat over a now - defunct blasphemy law .
Mr. Storberget initially tried to replace the law with a new paragraph that would have protected individuals from defamatory religious statements .
But after much political opposition , the law was repealed and no paragraph introduced .
This has provided political fodder for the opposition Progress Party , which has stoked fears among Norwegians over " sneak Islamization . "
Progress Party leader Siv Jensen spoke out strongly at the party 's national meeting last month against granting special permission for special groups .
She pointed specifically to the case of a largely Muslim neighborhood in Malmö , which she claimed had been partly overrun by Islamic law .
A March poll by Norstat for Norway 's national broadcasting station NRK showed that Progress Party soared 8.5 percentage points to 30.1 percent in the polls from a month earlier .
Three government coalition partners , Labor , Socialist Left , and Center Party , all lost ground .
The center - left coalition holds 87 out of 169 parliamentary seats , while the Progress party holds 38 seats , the second largest after Labor .
A continuing shift to the right could pose a threat to reelection chances in September for Jens Stoltenberg , Norway 's Labor prime minister .
" If they continue to spin these irrational fears , I 'm afraid it could lead to a lot of commotion , " said Thorbjørn Jagland , Norway 's parliamentary leader and former Labor prime minister , during a highly - attended religious debate in Oslo this week .
Some 500 people lined up around the block to hear Mr. Jagland , religious professor Torkel Brekke , the bishop of the Church of Norway , and leader of Norway 's Muslim Student Society discuss why religion is suddenly a hot topic .
The panelists discussed the recent media focus surrounding the hijab debate and blasphemy paragraph , the provocation caused by the burning of a hijab on International Women 's Day on March 8 by a Norwegian Muslim woman in protest of the garment , and fears among " religious nationalists " and " secular intellectuals " toward Norway 's Muslim minority .
" We could very well live with the mosques because they stayed in them .
But when this began to affect our cultural values , then it became a conflict , and then it became politicized , " Jagland told the crowd .
" But Islam is not a threat to Norway . "
" I do n't see Norway as a tolerant society at all , partly based on these debates and how they react to people coming to Norway , " said Professor Brekke , from the University of Oslo .
" It 's tolerant in that you can practice any religion , but you have large sections of Norwegian society that react strongly to alien cultures . "
Immigrants make up 9.7 percent of Norway 's 4.8 million inhabitants .
Norway has granted permission to about one - fourth of the 328,000 immigrants who arrived from non-Nordic countries between 1990 and 2007 to stay as refugees .
The largest immigrant population is Polish , who are traditionally Catholic , followed by Pakistani .
Islam accounts for 20 percent of the 9 percent of the population belonging to religious communities outside the Church of Norway .
Sweden has a more liberal policy in accepting refugees than Norway and allows hijabs in its police uniform , as does Britain .
France has banned the use of hijabs and other ostensible religious items in its state schools since 2004 .
The religious debate has overshadowed the economic one in Norway , which has been relatively shielded from the financial crisis thanks to its vast petroleum resources as the world 's third largest gas exporter .
Norway has a large budget surplus to help fund its financial stimulus packages and relatively mild unemployment – 3 percent , compared to 8.1 percent in the US .
Moreover , it has invested its oil revenues in a $ 329 billion Government Pension Fund .

So apparently wealthy Russians are paying up to $ 5,000 a pop to go on pirate hunting vacations .
On board yachts manned by heavily armed mercenaries , they cruise around the coast of Africa trying to lure Somalian pirates into attacking them .
Should any pirates be foolhardy enough to do so , the Russians then fire a flurry of bullets and explosives at them , who often react to this surprising development by dying .
If this sounds to you like wealthy assholes murdering people under the thinnest possible pretense of " self defense , " congratulations on not being a monster .
Your parents clearly did n't fuck up that bad .

Killing people for sport used to be one of our cultures most hallowed touchpoints .
From short stories to novels to about 30 different episodes of Star Trek , the premise has been used in dozens of different forms .
Which is great , when it 's fiction .
Normal healthy people like comedy writers have long learned to enjoy fiction as a release when we have those " I wonder what killing some dudes with a crossbow feels like " moments .
So why have n't the Russians ?
It occurred to me that Russians have n't had nearly the same exposure to Western pop culture that I have , me having been born in a video store and raised by a tape of recorded Knight Rider episodes .
So I decided that to help Cracked 's wealthy Russian readership , I 'd enumerate the best fictional examples of people being hunted for sport that civilization ever produced on the VHS format .
Non-wealthy - Russian readers will derive no pleasure from this at all .

It could n't be simpler !
Here 's an ultra-simple way to build a pulsejet engine without using a lathe , milling machine , welder , or any other expensive machinery .
In fact , all you 'll need are the tools shown in this picture , somewhere to work , and a bench - vise .
A drill ( electric prefered ) with a set of drill bits
A hacksaw
A screwdriver
A hammer
A file
Some scissors or metal snips
A tape - measure or ruler
A black felt marker
A center - punch
Some muffler sealant paste
Using these simple tools , you can convert this pile of metal into your own pulsejet engine .
The materials consist of : Some 0.060 " to 0.010 " spring steel or shim steel .
a length of steel or stainless - steel tubing .
a cheap stainless steel drink flask
a length of scrap aluminum bar
4 x self - tapping screws
4 x small bolts
a short length of copper tubing
a hose - clip ( jubilee clip )
And the result is this engine which is capable of several pounds of thrust and , if built with thin enough tubing , is light enough for use on model boats , planes or cars .
An abridged set of instructions for this project will be uploaded to the website shortly .
The full step - by - step set of comprehensive instructions are already on my CDROM -- which includes a VCD - quality video showing the entire construction sequence with plenty of tips and advice .
Monday ’s can really stink .
I knew Phandroid readers would get a laugh out of the following story so I saved it .
See that ?
We ’re always looking out for you – and so is Joe who sent the story in [ Thanks dude ! ] .
As you know , Google gave away Google Ion ( HTC Sapphire ) phones to all the participants of Google I / O 2009 .
I used that phone for the free 30 days that came with it , and right around that time , my other HTC phone ’s touchscreen stopped working .
So , being the android phan that I am , I decided to go ahead and get a new line of service with T - mobile and continue using my Ion .
Just before this happened , I had logged in to the T - mobile website , and told them to send me a temporary password via SMS to my phone , so I could login .
At that time , I saw that “ my account ” had “ 799 ” lines of service , and a balance of over $ 15,000 .
I was n’t concerned , because I knew it was a Google account .
Well , today I open my mail to find a bill from T - mobile , addressed to “ Google Promo Account ” , but sent to MY address , and see : > Total Balance Due : $ 15,939.83
I ’m sure someone at Google is missing a $ 16 k bill , and I ’ll be happy to return it :)
That is , of course , after I ’ve had a chance to scan it and let everyone know that T - mobile can’t even manage to keep track of Google ’s accounts …
( It ’s no wonder that , due to the above sequence of events , I ’m still not the primary account holder of my own account with a whole “ 1 ” line of service ) .
Wow … that is pretty outrageous !
But I questioned the story … afterall , what if this was a hoax from a rival wireless carrier hoping to spread negative and false press through blogosphere rumors ?
I asked Joe for pictorial proof and that is EXACTLY what he provided :
I ’m not sure how the heck T - Mobile could make such a big blunder , but its nice to know that Google is indeed footing the bill for all these devs and not just getting a free pass .
Kinda makes those Ion giveaways even more of a big deal , does n’t it ?
But the circus would continue .
And today I received a hefty package containing an 1850 - page detailed bill ( $ 17.15 in US Priority Mail postage ) .
Obviously I wo n’t be uploading this one .
Oh , and the price has now gone to $ 24 k .
Now if only I could score the $ 9.22 / mo pricetag they paid on each line of service , for my one line ;)
How do you get something like this resolved ?
Apparently T - Mobile ’s own channels were n’t all that accomodating so why not talk to the head android himself ?
I contacted Andy Rubin about this , and he ’s working to get the mistake fixed .
After trying to contact T - Mobile several times , and reaching nothing but brick walls , it ’s nice to know that Google ’s Director of
Mobile Platforms will respond to my emails in 8 minutes flat .
Mistakes happen , but its kind of fun to read about these types of blunders and its comforting to know that Google is standing behind their products with the data plans they paid for and with executives responding directly to consumer comments .
Sure , the magnitude of the comment surely had something to do with it , but still .
Hopefully this fun story helped make your Monday a little less painful !
[ Thanks again , Joe ! ]

What About Herm ?
The Effects Of The Herm Era Linger by this old chief
We ’ve often joked here at Arrowhead Addict that Bernard Pollard did in three years of playing safety what King Carl Peterson could n’t do in twenty years as a GM — find our Chiefs a young franchise quarterback of the future .
All jokes aside , it ’s pretty much the truth .
That ’s the reason I ’ve constructed a timeline of all the major quarterback moves by both Peterson and Pollard .
It really is a gut - busting experience to compare the two timelines .
Enjoy …
Peterson Vs. Pollard :
Carl Peterson Franchise Quarterback Search Timeline :
1989 : Hired by Chiefs as the Chiefs new general manager .
1989 – Drafted Mike Elkins out of Wake Forest in the second round with the 32nd overall pick .
Elkins played in one regular season game for the Chiefs .
Verdict : Bust
This shark no longer had teeth when Peterson signed him .
1989 – Signed dinosaur QB Ron Jaworksi , who was nearly 40 years old .
Jaworksi lasted one year with the Chiefs .
Verdict : Bust
1992 – Drafted Matt Blundin out of Virginia in the second round with the 4oth overall pick .
Blundin played in two games for the Chiefs , a 100 % increase from Elkins .
Verdict : Bust Blunder
1992 – Signed Dave Krieg away from then AFC West rival the Seattle Seahawks .
Krieg started one year for the Chiefs .
Verdict : Rent -A-QB
Montana was no longer the treasure it once was when Peterson acquired it .
1992 – Traded for aging Niners ’ superstar Joe Montana .
He started two seasons for the Chiefs , and took them to the AFC Championship , somewhere the Chiefs had n’t been in decades .
Granted , he was playing with Marcus Allen and a world - class defense .
Verdict : Successful Rent - A - QB , but still a Rent - A - QB
At least this Bono had a personality .
1994 – Traded for Niners ’ “ stud ” back - up ( a phrase Chiefs fans would grow accustomed to , unfortunately ) Steve Bono .
Bono played well enough to get one of the best defenses in the history of the game eliminated in the first round of the 1995 playoffs despite the Chiefs owning homefield advantage .
He missed the playoffs the next year and was done in K.C. Verdict : Rent -A-QB
1995 – Signed Rich Gannon and never really gave him a chance to flourish .
The Chiefs buried him on the bench behind Bono and Elvis Grbac during his four - year stint with the team .
He went on to win the MVP award with the hated Raiders , possibly our most bitter rival .
Verdict : Self - Inflicted Bust
Right before he died on the toilet , which is what Grbac did , too .
1997 – Signed Elvis Grbac , another “ stud ” back - up for the Niners .
Grbac did make one Pro Bowl during his four years as a starter , but he also never won a playoff game .
Watching him play was the visual equivalent of hearing Fran Drescher talk .
Verdict : Rent -A-QB
1998 – Signed Todd Collins .
In five years he never started a single game for the Chiefs .
Collins went on to have limited success for the Redskins .
Verdict : Bust
A moon landing was more likely than going anywhere with Warren .
1999 – Signed 143 - year - old Warren Moon , a fading superstar to put it politely .
The only thing Moon was an All - Pro at while in K.C. was night life .
Verdict : Bust
2001 – Traded for Trent Green .
He was a six - year starter for the Chiefs who put up flashy numbers , but never managed to win a playoff game despite a supporting cast of Larry Johnson , Priest Holmes , Tony Gonzalez and arguably the league ’s best offensive line .
Verdict : Successful Rent - A - QB , but still a Rent - A - QB
2004 – Signed Damon Huard .
Huard was the Chiefs ’ de facto starter for one season , but he never belonged in that role and it was obvious .
He liked getting hit about as much as Peter McNeeley .
Verdict : Bust
Croyle has been anything but Unbreakable for the Chiefs .
2006 – Drafted Brodie Croyle out of Alabama in the third round with the 85th overall pick .
Croyle started a bunch of games for the Chiefs , but has never won a regular season game as a pro .
Hell , he ’s barely lasted an entire game as a pro .
Verdict : Bust
2007 – Signed Tyler Thigpen .
Thigpen was never comfortable under center , so offensive coordinator Chan Gailey created a spread offense similar to the one Thigpen played in in college .
Thigpen responded by winning one game despite starting most of the season .
Verdict : Bust
Overall Verdict : 20 years , no young franchise QB of the future
Bernard Pollard Franchise Quarterback Search Timeline :
2006 – Drafted by the Chiefs .
2008 – Injures Patriots ’ superstar QB Tom Brady , sidelining him for the season .
Matt Cassel has a prolonged audition during the rest of the season , and impresses his current and future boss , Scott Pioli , during that process .
The He -Man of a safety helped find his Chiefs a Cassel .
2009 – The Chiefs trade Matt Cassel as a result of his strong play while filling in for Tom Brady , an opportunity that would have likely never presented itself if not for GM Jr. Bernard Pollard .
Verdict : Labeled as a franchise QB and future stud by most experts and pundits
Overall Verdict :
Three years , one likely young franchise QB of the future
Eat your heart out , Carl Peterson .
The Bonecrusher is now also the Thronecrusher .
Sorry , Jason Whitlock , but if Cassel owes any of his contract to somebody it ’s Pollard — not Randy Moss .

We first met Gil Portalatin -- a twenty - five year veteran at Ford -- when testing the 2010 Fusion Hybrid in Los Angeles .
In a fuel - economy competition against the media , Gil ( an engineer by trade ) effortlessly triumphed by racking up economy numbers that significantly bested the journalists and EPA estimates .
Expert :
It takes much more energy to push a car through the air at 75 mph than at 65 mph .
On some runs , Gil 's Fusion returned nearly 47 mpg .
We immediately wanted to know Gil 's fuel economy secrets so we could tell them to you .
To learn Gil 's special driving techniques , we visited his group 's modest offices in Dearborn , Michigan , the city Henry Ford ( founder of Ford Motor Company ) put on the map .
After a brief interview that covered technical aspects of Ford 's new hybrid technologies as well as touching on a running dispute with Toyota , we went for an instructional drive .
The 2010 Ford Fusion hybrid
In case you missed our coverage from the 2008 Los Angeles and 2009 Detroit Auto Shows , teams of skilled engineers in and around Detroit are creating great products .
Really .
Some would have you believe that Detroit is incapable of engineering a tissue box let alone a competitive modern car , but those voices are ignorant .
Proof comes in the form of the 2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid , a car that demonstrates active minds are working on great cars in Detroit .
The crisply styled sedan is rated at 41 mpg city , 36 mpg highway .
For the record , the Fusion bests the Toyota Camry Hybrid by 8 mpg around town and 2 mpg on the highway .
While hundreds of individuals contributed to the new Fusion Hybrid , Portalatin is the point man for Ford 's hybrid vehicles .
AOL Autos : Least expensive hybrids
According to Gil , whose official title is Hybrid Propulsion System Applications Manager , getting good mileage out of any vehicle goes well beyond maintenance basics like making sure your tires are aired up .
Gil believes that the driver is the key to great mileage .
( Drivers control the car , not the other way around . )
Following Gil 's advice will help improve the mileage in any car , not just in hybrids .
However , Gil also has special tips just for them .
AOL Autos :
How fuel grades can save you money
Tip 1 : Easy on the throttle , then glide
Gil says , " Most people accelerate way too hard from a stop .
This wastes huge amounts of energy .
You 'll get much better mileage accelerating gently up to the speed limit .
Once you 're at the limit , then you need to glide . "
By this , Gil means releasing most of the pressure on the accelerator so you 're using the bare minimum amount of power to maintain your speed .
In most cars , this will enable the automatic transmission to shift into its highest , most efficient gear .
Tip 2 : Anticipate traffic
Gil is a keen observer , " I watch people drive and waste gas every day .
Most drivers do n't pay attention to the flow of traffic .
If you 're in traffic , you know you 're going to stop again , so anticipate that stop by easing off the accelerator pedal early and coasting as much as you can .
Looking way down the road helps you anticipate traffic flow because you can see when traffic lights are going to change and how other cars are behaving . "
Gil knows that this driving technique wo n't put you in the pole position at every traffic light , but your mileage will go up , as will the life of your vehicle 's braking system components .
Tip 3 : Slow down on the highway
Gil explains , " I drive 50 miles each way to work , so I 've had plenty of time to study and test techniques for getting the best highway fuel economy . "
The advice is not complex .
Gil notes , " People just have to slow down .
Unless you work in an aerodynamic lab , you do n't understand how much more energy it takes to push a car through the air at 75 mph than at 65 mph , but it 's huge . "
During our drive , Gil went on to note that most cars have a " sweet spot " of efficiency between 65 - 70 mph , so you do n't have to drive at snail - like speeds to improve your mileage , although driving between 55 - 65 mph will improve mileage even further .
AOL Autos : Top 10 most fuel - efficient crossovers
Tip 4 : Drive with the terrain , and drive smoothly
Pointing out the obvious , Gil says , " It takes more energy to climb a hill than roll down the other side .
So when you 're on the highway , it 's OK to lose a few miles per hour when you 're driving up an incline .
You can regain the lost speed when you head down the other side . "
While this tip may seem easy , it requires constant attention .
Gil opines , " Some drivers will be better off just driving with their cruise control .
This helps those drivers who are constantly on and off the accelerator .
That kind of throttle control kills mileage .
A smooth , steady accelerator pressure is much greener , regardless of the speeds you travel . "
AOL Autos : See all hybrid SUVs
Hybrid Tip 1 : Do n't accelerate too slowly
" This is something that trips up hybrid drivers ; in their excitement to use only battery power , they accelerate too slowly from a stop .
While super - gentle acceleration keeps the vehicle in electric - only mode , it also drains the batteries quickly , often causing the gasoline engine to come on just to recharge the battery pack . "
Gil recommends this ; instead of accelerating so slowly , accelerate with a bit more vigor , and then lift off the throttle .
Once at speed ( up to nearly 50 mph in the Fusion Hybrid ) , the gasoline engine will often shut completely off , leaving propulsion to the battery powered motor to maintain cruising speed .
This technique yields maximum mileage .
Hybrid Tip 2 : Keep the batteries charged
All hybrids have two fuel tanks ; one holds gasoline and the other electrons ( the hybrid battery pack ) .
Both " tanks " need to be kept full to go the farthest distance , but the process for filling up on electrons is a bit different than stopping at the gas station .
Gil recommends this , " Coasting and gentle braking are the fastest and most efficient way to recharge your hybrid 's batteries .
On our Fusion , you can see by the gauges that when you coast or apply the brakes that the hybrid system is using the car 's kinetic energy to recharge the batteries .
The longer you can coast or gently slow down , the more energy you can store .
Keeping the batteries above 50 - percent full extends the distance you can run on battery power , saving fuel . "
Ford versus Toyota --
The hybrid technology war of words
There 's a rumor going around that Ford is using Toyota - patented technology in their hybrid vehicles .
The insinuation is that Ford is incapable of engineering their own competitive hybrid , so they are using Toyota's .
According to Gil ( and this represents the official Ford Motor Company stance ) the rumor is completely untrue .
AOL Autos : Toyota Prius vs. the Honda Insight
Here are the facts : Gil explains , " When we started developing our hybrid system , it was the normal course of business to do a patent search .
We realized that some of our ideas might infringe on Toyota 's hybrid patents .
We contacted them .
It just so happened that Toyota was developing some diesel engine technology that might infringe on existing patents owned by Ford .
The companies decided to allow the patent infringement as kind of a trade . "
But there 's more , and Gil continues , " While our hybrid technologies are broadly similar , they were not developed together .
There are no interchangeable parts between Ford and Toyota vehicles , as our hybrid drive units are engineered differently and use completely unique software to manage the whole system . "
Heroes are anointed their status because they do , or stand , something important .
Quite by accident , Gil Portalatin has become a hero to many in Detroit .

Every time some people go out into the sun , they sneeze : why does it happen ?
( Image : RESO / Rex Features )
Are you a photic sneezer ?
Take the questionnaire and find out
I WAS rounding the corner to the bus stop when it hit me – a bright shaft of sunlight smack between the eyes .
My reaction was immediate : an unpleasant prickling in my nose , a quickening of my breath , an uncontrollable watering of my eyes .
Then , almost as quickly as the sensation came , relief , blessed relief .
Aaaaa - tisshoo !
A sneeze .
It was n’t the first time .
In fact , the same thing happens every time I go into the sun .
For a long time , I thought it was a quirk all of my own .
Then a friend mentioned she was similarly afflicted .
Next my mother came out of the closet .
With a bit of digging around I came to a startling realisation : not only am I not alone , but the “ photic sneeze reflex ” is actually common .
Quite how common , no one knows exactly – but anything between 1 in 10 and 1 in 3 of us might be affected .
The more I looked , the more mysterious things became .
Sunlight is the most widespread , but by no means the only , odd stimulus that sets off sneezing .
Thinking about sex , eyebrow tweezing , eating chocolate or a mint , or drinking a glass of wine – all these activities can leave us groping around for handkerchiefs .
Members of one Kuwaiti family were even reported to sneeze whenever they had a full stomach – a phenomenon dubbed “ snatiation ” .
Then there was the case of the medical student who sneezed with almost …

He 's had it for seven years , since he was two years old .
During that time we 've lived in three countries -- Ireland , the United Kingdom , and Italy -- and he has had excellent treatment in each country . [...]
I 've calculated the cost of all that over seven years , and here 's what it comes to : zero . [...]

Okay , I 've now been able to get independent information from multiple sources that all of this precedes what are said to be possible federal indictments against Palin , concerning an embezzlement scandal related to the building of Palin 's house and the Wasilla Sports Complex built during her tenure as Mayor .
Both structures , it is said , feature the " same windows , same wood , same products . "
Federal investigators have been looking into this for some time , and indictments could be imminent , according to the Alaska sources .
The BRAD BLOG has not been able to receive confirm from any federal sources on this .
Our information comes from local Alaskans who follow Palin , and who have been keeping an eye on this for some time , while keeping it quiet at the request of federal investigators .
From October , 2008 , posting on the Plaid Lemur blog :
Remember the massive , and horribly overpriced sports complex that Sarah Palin pushed through in Wasilla ?
Well , it seems that the sports complex contractors and architect have strong links and ties to Palin .
Spenard Building Supplies was one , and would n’t you know , they also supplied the materials for the Palin ’s home .
Sure , a small connection , but get this –Spenard also was the supplier for Ted Stevens cabin .
This one building supply company is involved with Palin , Stevens , the Wasilla sports complex , and is a financial contributor to Palin .
Keep in mind that the sports complex was being constructed at the very same time as the Palin ’s home .
This connection is neither fleeting , nor minor .
This appears to be a pattern of concurrent events that makes it more and more likely that the Palin ’s home may have been some sort of quid pro quo arrangement for the massive influx of money into the building supply company .
An area that could reinforce this connection would be if the architect of the Wasilla sports complex , Blase Burkhart ( also a contributor to Palin ) , had anything to do with the construction of the Palin ’s home .
Another interesting twist to the story is that Sarah Palin was , at the time , also running for Lieutenant Governor , a position that could further reward those contributing to her campaign , and those that were involved with the Wasilla sports complex and the construction of Sarah Palin ’s home .
We know that Alaska has been a bastion of corrupt political activities .
Update [ 2009 -7-3 21:11:12 by Glic ] : tier1express points to a Village Voice article from October 8 , 2008 article :
THE $ 12.5 MILLION sports complex and hockey rink that is the lasting monument to Palin 's two terms as Wasilla mayor is also a monument to the kind of insider politics that dismays Americans of both parties .
Six months before Palin stepped down as mayor in October 2002 , the city awarded nearly a half - million - dollar contract to design the biggest project in Wasilla history to Kumin Associates .
Blase Burkhart was the Kumin architect on the job — the son of Roy Burkhart , who is frequently described as a " mentor " of Palin and was head of the local Republican Party ( his wife , June , who also advised Palin , is the national committeewoman ) .
Asked if the contract was a favor , Roy Burkhart , who contributed to her campaign in the same time frame that his son got the contract , said : " I really do n't know . "
Palin then named Blase Burkhart to a seven - member builder - selection committee that picked Howdie Inc. , a mostly residential contractor owned at the time by Howard Nugent .
Formally awarded the contract a couple of weeks after Palin left office , Nugent has donated $ 4,000 to Palin campaigns .
Two competitors protested the process that led to Nugent 's contract .
Burkhart and Nugent had done at least one project together before the complex — and have done several since .
A list of subcontractors on the job , obtained by the Voice , includes many with Palin ties .
One was Spenard Builders Supply , the state 's leading supplier of wood , floor , roof , and other " pre-engineered components . "
In addition to being a sponsor of Todd Palin 's snow - machine team that has earned tens of thousands for the Palin family , Spenard hired Sarah Palin to do a statewide television commercial in 2004 .
When the Palins began building a new family home off Lake Lucille in 2002 — at the same time that Palin was running for lieutenant governor and in her final months as mayor — Spenard supplied the materials , according to Antoine Bricks , who works in its Wasilla office .
Spenard actually filed a notice " of its right to assert a lien " on the deed for the Palin property after contracting for labor and materials for the site .
Spenard 's name has popped up in the trial of Senator Stevens — it worked on the house that is at the center of the VECO scandal as well .
Todd Palin told Fox News that he built the two - story , 3,450 - square - foot , four - bedroom , four - bath , wood house himself , with the help of contractors he described as " buddies . "
As mayor , Sarah Palin blocked an effort to require the filing of building permits in the wide - open city , and there is no public record of who the " buddies " were .
The house was built very near the complex , on a site whose city purchase led to years of unsuccessful litigation and , now , $ 1.3 million in additional costs , with a law firm that 's also donated to Palin collecting costly fees from the city .

As David Letterman might ask , " IS THIS ANYTHING ? "
It 's not easy being a NASA researcher .
You can spend years of your professional career working on a particular project , only to have it abruptly cancelled because a new Administration takes office or ... well , the country just shifts its sights and priorities .
And your particular project no longer fits on the list .
It 's happened so many times over the agency 's 50 - year history that it 's almost predictable .
And the reasons for those shifts are numerous , and sometimes complex .
Science Times noted , NASA is coming to yet another research fork in the road .
I saw this one coming back in January 2004 , when President George W. Bush announced we were going to go back to the Moon , and on to Mars ... and then did n't actually allocate any extra money for the effort .
NASA slashed other research budgets and drastically shifted program priorities to comply with the new directive , and began developing the basic technology the first steps of the effort would require .
But as a piece in this week ' snoted , NASA is coming to yet another research fork in the road .
I saw this one coming back in January 2004 , when President George W. Bush announced we were going to go back to the Moon , and on to Mars ... and then did n't actually allocate any extra money for the effort .
NASA slashed other research budgets and drastically shifted program priorities to comply with the new directive , and began developing the basic technology the first steps of the effort would require .
It was clear to me , even at the beginning , that the program was more of a nice PR moment than any real commitment or serious priority .
Money talks , and the money was n't allocated .
What 's more , a new President is now in power , and he 's indicating that more budget cuts in the program may be in the offing .
So after decimating science and aeronautical programs to fund Moon and Mars - oriented technology development , the agency finds itself , once again , facing the possibility of having to tell its researchers , " never mind . "
It 's " a hell of a way to run an airline , " as the saying goes .
But in the article 's discussion of possible funding and program options , one particular comment caught my attention .
One cost - saving option on the table would be to bypass a Moon landing , and concentrate research efforts on a series of long - duration space flights ( the type that a Mars mission would require ) .
But Gabrielle Giffords , chairwoman of the House subcommittee on space and aeronautics , reportedly commented that she did n't find that option particularly exciting , and did n't imagine her constituents would , either .
My first thought was , " why does space research have to be exciting ? "
Do we require cancer research to be dramatic material for prime - time viewing ?
Of course not .
All we care about is results .
But the human space flight program , some argue , exists primarily not for its scientific value , but for its inspirational value .
In which case , I guess its " excitement " factor becomes more relevant .
On the other hand , it 's not entirely clear what Giffords meant by her comments .
Perhaps she was n't arguing that the space program ought to be a lightweight version of " exciting , " as in " ready - for - prime - time photo ops , " but exciting in the sense of its potential impact .
And if that 's the case , then I agree with her .
Research , in cancer , technology , or space , should hold exciting potential for advancement or discovery .
Even if the " big bang " advancement lies some distance in the future .
But what constitutes exciting ?
To some people , developing the technology to allow humans to live for extended periods of time on another planetary body is incredibly exciting .
" So far , we have n't been space explorers .
We 've been space backpackers , taking everything we need to survive with us , " says K.R. Sridhar , a scientist and engineer who developed oxygen generators for NASA 's Mars research program , only to have the project cancelled just before launch .
Maybe living on Mars does n't sound like a particularly fun or worthwhile experience .
But developing the technology to allow humans to live beyond planet Earth ... that 's kind of exciting .
And perhaps even important , if we want our species to have the ability to survive cosmic disasters .
On the other hand , there are lots of other exciting research possibilities in space that do n't involve the cost of a human space flight effort .
The Kepler telescope , launched in March , is designed to search out planetary bodies orbiting distant suns at the right distance ( ergo temperature ) to allow water , and life as we know it , to exist .
The telescope uses a sophisticated photometer to measure dips in brightness in the suns , indicating the passage of planetary bodies in front of them .
By the size and frequency of the shadows , scientists will be able to determine the planets ' orbital distance from the suns .
Newsweek that eventually , we might launch " a probe that can travel near the speed of light and gets there , shows us pictures , listen to their radio stations and television stations , and gives us a much better understanding of this new planet . "
What does that do for us ?
As they 've gained knowledge about just how massive the universe and numerous its galaxies are , scientists have become more confident that there must be life elsewhere .
If Kepler can narrow the search down to some candidates with at least the first prerequisite for life ( distance from a medium - sized sun ) , they might be able to do further scans , with other instruments and telescopes , to determine if elements like ozone , CO2 , or oxygen exist in those distant atmospheres .
What then ?
Kepler 's principal investigator , a scientist named Bill Borucki , who championed the idea for decades before finally convincing his peers to support the research , said in a recent interview withthat eventually , we might launch " a probe that can travel near the speed of light and gets there , shows us pictures , listen to their radio stations and television stations , and gives us a much better understanding of this new planet . "
If that 's not exciting , I do n't know what is .
NASA 's researchers have struggled for years with how to keep the public interested in what they do , because doing anything in space is expensive .
NASA , and its predecessor , the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NACA ) were formed to tackle problems and explorations that do n't have a clear commercial benefit , and so are n't likely to be pursued by commercial companies , or are too risky to be pursued by commercial companies .
And even with the advent of more commercial space companies , that difference in goals and risk - tolerance still exists .
But since the public is footing NASA 's bill , there 's additional pressure for its work to appeal to a voting public with many more near - term concerns than how to save the species if an asteroid threatens or the sun explodes .
So although there 's worth in any new knowledge or technology ... with limited resources , choices have to be made .
Some already question the value of the International Space Station which , in the Moon / Mars plan currently on the books , would be dismantled only five years after its completion to free up funds for the next effort .
A lot of other research was sacrificed to fund the Space Station .
We surely do n't want to keep doing that , if we are n't really excited about the results we get in the end .
We have a lot invested in the human space flight program , and the impact of dismantling it would be huge .
Jobs , infrastructure , and knowledge now in place to pick up any new project would disappear -- or at least scatter .
Which means rebuilding it later , if we wanted to do that , would be an onerous task .
( Dismantling it would also be politically tough , because of the jobs and local economic impact involved . )
But maybe , radical as it might seem , " in the neighborhood " human space flight is something NASA can now turn over to the commercial sector .
And maybe , especially in a time of tight budgets , NASA 's money would be better used funding many smaller but very exciting projects like Kepler , and doing the risky work of figuring out how to explore the universe beyond our eight small planets .
Rockets , after all , do n't need humans on them to test new technology in ion or other propulsion systems , and even habitat technology like oxygen generators .
Then , if Kepler 's descendants one day find a planet that looks suspiciously like a big blue marble , and has some interesting sounds bouncing across its ionosphere , we might have a reason to put humans back on the top of research rockets .
A really , really , exciting one .

Some of the first eerie signs of a potential health catastrophe came as bizarre deformities in water animals , often in their sexual organs .
Frogs , salamanders and other amphibians began to sprout extra legs .
In heavily polluted Lake Apopka , one of the largest lakes in Florida , male alligators developed stunted genitals .
In the Potomac watershed near Washington , male smallmouth bass have rapidly transformed into “ intersex fish ” that display female characteristics .
This was discovered only in 2003 , but the latest survey found that more than 80 percent of the male smallmouth bass in the Potomac are producing eggs .
Now scientists are connecting the dots with evidence of increasing abnormalities among humans , particularly large increases in numbers of genital deformities among newborn boys .
For example , up to 7 percent of boys are now born with undescended testicles , although this often self - corrects over time .
And up to 1 percent of boys in the United States are now born with hypospadias , in which the urethra exits the penis improperly , such as at the base rather than the tip .

UPDATE : Amazon issued a statement Friday night saying , " When we were notified of this by the rights holder , we removed the illegal copies from our systems and from customers ' devices , and refunded customers .
We are changing our systems so that in the future we will not remove books from customers ' devices in these circumstances . "
However , the company did not touch on whether it would monitor more closely what books get uploaded as part of its self - serve system for publishers to avoid such circumstances altogether .
The press loves a juicy story , and Amazon served one up on a silver platter this morning by automatically deleting certain copies of George Orwell 's 1984 and Animal Farm from customers ' Kindles .
But many facts were left out of this media frenzy , namely that the ebooks were essentially pirated copies sold for 99 - cents by a company that had no rights to the material .
Amazon was able to remove the titles because the Kindle is configured to automatically sync up with the user 's Bookshelf via the electronic book reader 's WhisperNet wireless service .
When the company removed the unauthorized books from customers ' accounts , they also disappeared from the Kindle .
Amazon then delivered a cryptic e-mail about what happened :
Advertisement
" We recently discovered a problem with a Kindle book that you have purchased .
We have processed a refund to the payment method used to acquire this book .
The next time the wireless is activated on your device , the problematic item will be removed .
If you are not in a wireless coverage area , please connect your device to a computer using your USB cable and delete the file from the documents folder . "
Naturally , the media went wild .
Amazon deleting books remotely ?
And the book in question being 1984 , the dystopian classic where deep surveillance and censorship is the norm ?
It could only get more ironic if it was Ray Bradbury 's Farenheit 451 .
David Pogue at The New York Times hopped on the story early , claiming that " the publisher changed its mind about offering an electronic edition , " and stated that Amazon " electronically deleted all books by this author . "
Pogue asserted that " Amazon ... caved " on the matter .
The normally - reliable Harry McCracken at Technologizer wrote , " The books ' publisher decided that it was n't so hot on the idea of electronic rights after all . "
TechCrunch went so far as to compare Amazon 's action to burning books , writing that the retailer deleted " perfectly legal versions " of 1984 and Animal Farm .
" Big Brother is in your Kindle .
Watching , " TechCrunch 's MG Siegler wrote .
According to the NYT's Pogue , " it 's like Barnes & Noble sneaking into our homes in the middle of the night , taking some books that we 've been reading off our nightstands , and leaving us a check on the coffee table . "
Oh , give me a break .
Whatever happened to a little fact checking ?
I guess we do n't bother with that when a juicy story can be used to drum up comments and pageviews .
I hate to be a party pooper ( " Kindles " is now a top trend on Twitter with comments on this nearly every second ) , but let 's get some facts straight before we compare Amazon to Big Brother :
The two books in question were published for the Kindle by a company called Mobile Reference , which offers public domain books for around $ 1 . Mobile Reference did not have the right to sell Orwell 's novels because 1984 and Animal Farm are still under copyright protection in the United States .
They were not legitimate or " perfectly legal " copies of the books , but rather illicit copies that should not have been sold in the first place .
Contrary to what the New York Times reported , the publisher did not change its mind , nor did Amazon cave to pressure .
Rather , Amazon was notified that copyrighted material was being sold on the Amazon store without permission and it removed said material .
In addition , the NYT 's claim that Amazon deleted all works by this author is incorrect .
In fact , there are still multiple copies of 1984 still for sale on the Kindle -- just not for 99 - cents from a company that had no rights to do so .
Other ebooks published by Mobile Reference that do fall under public domain are also still for sale .
This is not the first time such an event has happened .
Amazon has had to perform widespread recalls from the Kindle at least two other times in the past , and the company sent out the exact same notification .
Ayn Rand 's books were put up on the Kindle Store without consent from the Ayn Rand Institute and had to be pulled down , while unauthorized copies of Stephenie Meyer 's popular Twilight series had to be removed as well .
Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince was reportedly offered for sale for a few hours on Monday , even though electronic versions of the books have not been authorized .
Of course , those titles do n't invoke the delicious irony of Amazon lurking inside your Kindle and deleting 1984 .
That 's not to say that Amazon 's actions were completely justifiable .
The two ebooks may have been illegal copies , but they were purchased by the customer .
In the real world , if you purchase stolen goods , you do n't get to keep those goods , but you 're also properly informed of the situation .
This is where Amazon messed up .
Instead of being honest about what happened -- that it sold unauthorized ebooks and has done so in the past -- Amazon only told customers that there was " a problem . "
While removing such titles from a customer 's Bookshelf and in turn deleting them from the Kindle may be standard policy , a lack of communication about what actually happened has led to a media firestorm that will surely last through the weekend .
Amazon also could have offered customers a legitimate replacement copy of 1984 or Animal Farm and footed the difference , because in the end , this was Amazon 's mistake .
Perhaps most importantly , this case and the others before it highlight a major problem with Amazon 's Kindle Store .
The retailer should n't have been selling copyrighted material in the first place , and it needs to take a serious look at its acceptance policies to prevent such occurrences in the future .
By comparison , Apple has stringent reviews of all applications submitted to its iPhone App Store .
So is Amazon going to come take legitimate books off your nightstand because a publisher changed its mind , or even burn down your library as TechCrunch implies ?
No .
But hopefully it will put policies into place on the Kindle Store so it wo n't need to recall unauthorized ebooks in the future .
Ask anybody to chart the trajectory of the S&P500 over the past 10 years and you will get this chart .
And while the tech boom of the late 1990's was driven by some very real secular shifts caused by unique technological innovation which , aside from the exuberance associated with some of the dot com names , brought a marked benefit to the global economy , how does one explain the subsequent ramp up as the credit bubble was being inflated and subsequently imploded ?
Simple - it was all liquidity driven .
The best way to visualize it is to take the SPX and to divide it by the sum of domestic reserves and foreign custodial holdings ( a topic discussed on Zero Hedge previously here ) .
The result is that represented on this relative basis , the underlying market did absolutely nothing for the duration of the entire credit bubble .
This should come as no surprise to anyone who has been following the theme of the Fed 's balance sheet expansion and why the market has been ramping up markedly even , or specifically because of , the Fed 's balance sheet growing over the past decade and recently hitting unprecedented levels in the $ 2 trillion + range .
One can play with the denominator and add other money aggregates such as MZM , but the result would not change materially .
And the scariest part of the chart is the tail end : even with the unleashed dam of liquidity , the market still has a massive retracement ahead of it before it can recover the adjusted losses it has suffered since the last credit bubble .
Ironically a 50 % run up in the S&P has not been enough to offset on an apples - to - apples basis the unprecedented liquidity efforts let lose by Chairman Ben .
The bottom line is that when viewed from the perspective of liquidity fueling the market , the S&P 500 has never been in a worse situation .
And alas , as the Fed 's balance sheet climbs to $ 4 trillion + , absent a multi - year parabolic rise in stocks , liquidity will increasingly lose its power to sustain markets to historical overbloated levels .
But Ben Bernanke will go down in flames , and take down America with him , trying to disprove this hypothesis .

Children and teenagers may not seek help for headaches
One in five young teenagers suffer headaches at least once a week , say researchers .
Of 1,000 12 - 15 year olds in Exeter questioned for the study , 10 % had more than two headaches a week .
That group had a poorer quality of life than children with asthma , diabetes or cancer , the British Journal of General Practice reported .
The researchers said many children were suffering unnecessarily with headaches at home and at school .
Study leader Dr David Kernick said headache was the most common type of pain in children but estimates on the prevalence of headache in teenagers and children vary widely .
The needs of many adult headache sufferers are unmet , and this study shows that in children the need is even more significant
Dr David Kernick
Study leader
Also there is little known about the impact of headache in children , he said .
The study participants - half boys and half girls - completed a questionnaire to find out not only how often they had headaches but also what effect that had on their quality of life .
For 20 % of students , headaches affected their ability to function at home or school on more than 12 days in a three - month period .
Those worse affected struggled with their normal lives for 17 days over three months , the researchers found .
It means headache is more common than diseases that receive considerably more attention , such as diabetes and asthma , they said .
Services lacking
It is known that many adults who suffer headaches do not go to the GP and correct diagnosis and treatment is lacking .
This problem is likely to be even worse for children who may not be able to articulate how they feel .
Dr Kernick said GPs needed to do more to help children who suffer from headaches .
He said the underlying cause was complex and linked with factors such as anxiety and depression .
" The needs of many adult headache sufferers are unmet , and this study shows that in children the need is even more significant .
" Many children are suffering unnecessarily at home and at school .
" We need to do more to recognise and treat this problem , and the Royal College of GPs is working hard towards this . "

Domain name investing has been around almost as long as domain names were open for purchase by the general public , and the practice has picked up since the mid-90s , as companies stake out their spot on the digital frontier .
Domain names can be so valuable , in fact , that people actually steal them to sell to unsuspecting companies or other domain name investors .
The legal process to combat a domain name thief is complicated at best , but there is hope , as police have arrested a man accused of stealing the domain P2P.com .
An initial investigation by Florida police , where the victims reside , was dropped for lack of evidence .
The rightful owners of P2P.com then filed a civil suit as they believed it was their only recourse .
However , Detective Sergeant John Gorman of the New Jersey State Police Cyber - Crimes
Unit later reviewed the case , and asked the victims if they wanted to pursue the case in New Jersey , where the alleged thief lived .
Based on evidence gathered for the civil suit , the NJ District Attorney approved an indictment .
On July 30 , Daniel Goncalves , a 25 - year - old computer technician for a NJ law firm , was arrested at his home and his computers were seized .
The first - ever criminal arrest for domain name theft has been made in the great state of New Jersey .
The story begins several years ago .
In 2005 , husband and wife Albert and Lesli Angel got together with investor and partner Marc Ostrofsky — known for his sale of the domain business.com for $ 7.5 million — and bought P2P.com for $ 160,000 .
Sometime before late 2006 , Gonclaves hacked into the Angels ' e-mail account , obtained login details for the couple 's Godaddy.com account , and transferred the domain to an account he controlled using a fake name .
He even falsfied Paypal transaction records to make it appear as though he had rightfully purchased P2P.com for $ 900 .
Gonclaves then put the domain up for sale on eBay , and sold it to LA Clippers player and part time domain name investor Mark Madsen for $ 110,000 .
With the help of professional " cyber " investigators , the Angels gathered enough evidence to file a civil suit against Madsen and Goncalves to retrieve the domain name .
That case is still pending , and has since been amended to include Gonclaves ' brother as a co-conspirator and Godaddy.com for negligence and contributory trademark infringement under Anti-Cyber Piracy statute .
The outcome of both the civil and criminal case are likely to set precedents for similar cases in the future .
The main problems affecting victims of domain name theft are lack of experience of law enforcement , lack of clear legal precedents , and the money necessary to launch an investigation .
DomainNameNews , which first reported the arrest , relates the Angels ' experience in reporting the crime .
When the Angels called Florida police to report the theft , a uniformed officer in a squad car was sent to their home .
" What 's a domain ? " the officer asked them , according to DomainNameNews .
Then , there is the fact that domain names are n't necessarily considered property .
" The laws do not specifically identify domains as property , " attorney Paul Keating told DomainNameNews .
" That has been the subject of various court decisions — not all courts have issued consistent decisions . "
Finally , because domain name theft is such a legal gray area , most people would n't have the money or the wherewithal to pursue an investigation .
There is little legal precedent for criminal investigation and only one civil case has been successfully litigated in California .
Goncalves is currently out of jail on $ 60,000 bail .
Meanwhile , prosecutors in New Jersey intend to pursue the criminal case and are pushing for a felony conviction .
The Angels , along with Ostrofsky , are pressing on with their civil case against Goncalves as well .
Goncalves may have thought he had gotten away scott free — he had an in - ground pool installed at his home , drove a Lotus and a Mercedes , and bragged about frequent travel — but his days of wine and roses may soon be at an end .

From TPM :
Jonah Goldberg , editor - at - large of National Review Online , went on Fox News today to fan the flames of the latest fabricated " death panel " controversy .
Goldberg equated a Veterans Affairs pamphlet -- one that 's reportedly no longer being used -- with Nazi eugenics , saying " death panels may not be too far off the horizon . "
The pamphlet in question is one that , Fox reported this weekend , encourages disabled veterans to decide whether their lives are worth living .
Tammy Duckworth , an assistant secretary of the VA , told Fox on Sunday that the department instructed VA doctors to stop using the pamphlet in 2007 .
But Fox has ignored that insistence , saying soldiers returning from Iraq are given the pamphlet .
By George Friedman
At Friday prayers July 17 at Tehran University , the influential cleric and former Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani gave his first sermon since Iran 's disputed presidential election and the subsequent demonstrations .
The crowd listening to Rafsanjani inside the mosque was filled with Ahmadinejad supporters who chanted , among other things , " Death to America " and " Death to China . "
Outside the university common grounds , anti-Ahmadinejad elements — many of whom were blocked by Basij militiamen and police from entering the mosque — persistently chanted " Death to Russia . "
Death to America is an old staple in Iran .
Death to China had to do with the demonstrations in Xinjiang and the death of Uighurs at the hands of the Chinese .
Death to Russia , however , stood out .
Clearly , its use was planned before the protesters took to the streets .
The meaning of this must be uncovered .
To begin to do that , we must consider the political configuration in Iran at the moment .
The Iranian Political Configuration
There are two factions claiming to speak for the people .
Rafsanjani represents the first faction .
During his sermon , he spoke for the tradition of the founder of the Islamic republic , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , who took power during the 1979 Iranian Revolution .
Rafjsanjani argued that Khomeini wanted an Islamic republic faithful to the will of the people , albeit within the confines of Islamic law .
Rafsanjani argued that he was the true heir to the Islamic revolution .
He added that Khomeini 's successor — the current supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — had violated the principles of the revolution when he accepted that Rafsanjani 's archenemy , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , had won Iran 's recent presidential election .
( There is enormous irony in foreigners describing Rafsanjani as a moderate reformer who supports greater liberalization .
Though he has long cultivated this image in the West , in 30 years of public political life it is hard to see a time when he has supported Western - style liberal democracy . )
The other faction is led by Ahmadinejad , who takes the position that Rafsanjani in particular — along with the generation of leaders who ascended to power during the first phase of the Islamic republic — has betrayed the Iranian people .
Rather than serving the people , Ahmadinejad claims they have used their positions to become so wealthy that they dominate the Iranian economy and have made the reforms needed to revitalize the Iranian economy impossible .
According to Ahmadinejad 's charges , these elements now blame Ahmadinejad for Iran 's economic failings when the root of these failings is their own corruption .
Ahmadinejad claims that the recent presidential election represents a national rejection of the status quo .
He adds that claims of fraud represent attempts by Rafsanjani — who he portrays as defeated presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi 's sponsor — and his ilk to protect their positions from Ahmadinejad .
Iran is therefore experiencing a generational dispute , with each side claiming to speak both for the people and for the Khomeini tradition .
There is the older generation — symbolized by Rafsanjani — that has prospered during the last 30 years .
Having worked with Khomeini , this generation sees itself as his true heir .
Then , there is the younger generation .
Known as " students " during the revolution , this group did the demonstrating and bore the brunt of the shah 's security force counterattacks .
It argues that Khomeini would be appalled at what Rafsanjani and his generation have done to Iran .
This debate is , of course , more complex than this .
Khamenei , a key associate of Khomeini , appears to support Ahmadinejad 's position .
And Ahmadinejad hardly speaks for all of the poor as he would like to claim .
The lines of political disputes are never drawn as neatly as we would like .
Ultimately , Rafsanjani 's opposition to the recent election did not have as much to do with concerns ( valid or not ) over voter fraud .
It had everything to do with the fact that the outcome threatened his personal position .
Which brings us back to the question of why Rafsanjani 's followers were chanting Death to Russia .
Examining the Anomalous Chant For months prior to the election , Ahmadinejad 's allies warned that the United States was planning a " color " revolution .
Color revolutions , like the one in Ukraine , occurred widely in the former Soviet Union after its collapse , and these revolutions followed certain steps .
An opposition political party was organized to mount an electoral challenge to the establishment .
Then , an election occurred that was either fraudulent or claimed by the opposition as having been fraudulent .
Next , widespread peaceful protests against the regime ( all using a national color as the symbol of the revolution ) took place , followed by the collapse of the government through a variety of paths .
Ultimately , the opposition — which was invariably pro-Western and particularly pro-American — took power .
Moscow openly claimed that Western intelligence agencies , particularly the CIA , organized and funded the 2004 - 2005 Orange Revolution in Ukraine .
These agencies allegedly used nongovernmental organizations ( human rights groups , pro-democracy groups , etc. ) to delegitimize the existing regime , repudiate the outcome of the election regardless of its validity and impose what the Russians regarded as a pro-American puppet regime .
The Russians saw Ukraine 's Orange Revolution as the break point in their relationship with the West , with the creation of a pro-American , pro-NATO regime in Ukraine representing a direct attack on Russian national security .
The Americans argued that to the contrary , they had done nothing but facilitate a democratic movement that opposed the existing regime for its own reasons , demanding that rigged elections be repudiated .
In warning that the United States was planning a color revolution in Iran , Ahmadinejad took the Russian position .
Namely , he was arguing that behind the cover of national self - determination , human rights and commitment to democratic institutions , the United States was funding an Iranian opposition movement on the order of those active in the former Soviet Union .
Regardless of whether the opposition actually had more votes , this opposition movement would immediately regard an Ahmadinejad win as the result of fraud .
Large demonstrations would ensue , and if they were left unopposed the Islamic republic would come under threat .
In doing this , Ahmadinejad 's faction positioned itself against the actuality that such a rising would occur .
If it did , Ahmadinejad could claim that the demonstrators were — wittingly or not — operating on behalf of the United States , thus delegitimizing the demonstrators .
In so doing , he could discredit supporters of the demonstrators as not tough enough on the United States , a useful charge against Rafsanjani , whom the West long has held up as an Iranian moderate .
Interestingly , while demonstrations were at their height , Ahmadinejad chose to attend — albeit a day late — a multinational Shanghai Cooperation Organization conference in Moscow on the Tuesday after the election .
It was very odd that he would leave Iran during the greatest postelection unrest ; we assumed he had decided to demonstrate to Iranians that he did n't take the demonstrations seriously .
The charge that seems to be emerging on the Rafsanjani side is that Ahmadinejad 's fears of a color revolution were not simply political , but were encouraged by the Russians .
It was the Russians who had been talking to Ahmadinejad and his lieutenants on a host of issues , who warned him about the possibility of a color revolution .
More important , the Russians helped prepare Ahmadinejad for the unrest that would come — and given the Russian experience , how to manage it .
Though we speculate here , if this theory is correct , it could explain some of the efficiency with which Ahmadinejad shut down cell phone and other communications during the postelection unrest , as he may have had Russian advisers .
Rafsanjani 's followers were not shouting Death to Russia without a reason , at least in their own minds .
They are certainly charging that Ahmadinejad took advice from the Russians , and went to Russia in the midst of political unrest for consultations .
Rafsanjani 's charge may or may not be true .
Either way , there is no question that Ahmadinejad did claim that the United States was planning a color revolution in Iran .
If he believed that charge , it would have been irrational not to reach out to the Russians .
But whether or not the CIA was involved , the Russians might well have provided Ahmadinejad with intelligence of such a plot and helped shape his response , and thereby may have created a closer relationship with him .
How Iran 's internal struggle will work itself out remains unclear .
But one dimension is shaping up : Ahmadinejad is trying to position Rafsanjani as leading a pro-American faction intent on a color revolution , while Rafsanjani is trying to position Ahmadinejad as part of a pro-Russian faction .
In this argument , the claim that Ahmadinejad had some degree of advice or collaboration with the Russians is credible , just as the claim that Rafsanjani maintained some channels with the Americans is credible .
And this makes an internal dispute geopolitically significant .
The Iranian Struggle in a Geopolitical Context
At the moment , Ahmadinejad appears to have the upper hand .
Khamenei has certified his re-election .
The crowds have dissipated ; nothing even close to the numbers of the first few days has since materialized .
For Ahmadinejad to lose , Rafsanjani would have to mobilize much of the clergy — many of whom are seemingly content to let Rafsanjani be the brunt of Ahmadinejad 's attacks — in return for leaving their own interests and fortunes intact .
There are things that could bring Ahmadinejad down and put Rafsanjani in control , but all of them would require Khamenei to endorse social and political instability , which he will not do .
If the Russians have in fact intervened in Iran to the extent of providing intelligence to Ahmadinejad and advice to him during his visit on how to handle the postelection unrest ( as the chants suggest ) , then Russian influence in Iran is not surging — it has surged .
In some measure , Ahmadinejad would owe his position to Russian warnings and advice .
There is little gratitude in the world of international affairs , but Ahmadinejad has enemies , and the Russians would have proved their utility in helping contain those enemies .
From the Russian point of view , Ahmadinejad would be a superb asset — even if not truly under their control .
His very existence focuses American attention on Iran , not on Russia .
It follows , then , that Russia would have made a strategic decision to involve itself in the postelection unrest , and that for the purposes of its own negotiations with Washington , Moscow will follow through to protect the Iranian state to the extent possible .
The Russians have already denied U.S. requests for assistance on Iran .
But if Moscow has intervened in Iran to help safeguard Ahmadinejad 's position , then the potential increases for Russia to provide Iran with the S - 300 strategic air defense systems that it has been dangling in front of Tehran for more than a decade .
If the United States perceives an entente between Moscow and Tehran emerging , then the entire dynamic of the region shifts and the United States must change its game .
The threat to Washington 's interests becomes more intense as the potential of a Russian S-300 sale to Iran increases , and the need to disrupt the Russian - Iranian entente would become all the more important .
U.S. influence in Iran already has declined substantially , and Ahmadinejad is more distrustful and hostile than ever of the United States after having to deal with the postelection unrest .
If a Russian - Iranian entente emerges out of all this — which at the moment is merely a possibility , not an imminent reality — then the United States would have some serious strategic problems on its hands .
Revisiting Assumptions on Iran
For the past few years , STRATFOR has assumed that a U.S. or Israeli strike on Iran was unlikely .
Iran was not as advanced in its nuclear program as some claimed , and the complexities of any attack were greater than assumed .
The threat of an attack was thus a U.S. bargaining chip , much as Iran 's nuclear program itself was an Iranian bargaining chip for use in achieving Tehran 's objectives in Iraq and the wider region .
To this point , our net assessment has been accurate .
At this point , however , we need to stop and reconsider .
If Iran and Russia begin serious cooperation , Washington 's existing dilemma with Iran 's nuclear ambitions and its ongoing standoff with the Russians would fuse to become a single , integrated problem .
This is something the United States would find difficult to manage .
Washington 's primary goal would become preventing this from happening .
Ahmadinejad has long argued that the United States was never about to attack Iran , and that charges by Rafsanjani and others that he has pursued a reckless foreign policy were groundless .
But with the Death to Russia chants and signaling of increased Russian support for Iran , the United States may begin to reconsider its approach to the region .
Iran 's clerical elite does not want to go to war .
They therefore can only view with alarm the recent ostentatious transiting of the Suez Canal into the Red Sea by Israeli submarines and corvettes .
This transiting did not happen without U.S. approval .
Moreover , in spite of U.S. opposition to expanded Israeli settlements and Israeli refusals to comply with this opposition , U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates will be visiting Israel in two weeks .
The Israelis have said that there must be a deadline on negotiations with Iran over the nuclear program when the next G - 8 meeting takes place in September ; a deadline that the G - 8 has already approved .
The consequences if Iran ignores the deadline were left open - ended .
All of this can fit into our old model of psychological warfare , as representing a bid to manipulate Iranian politics by making Ahmadinejad 's leadership look too risky .
It could also be the United States signaling to the Russians that stakes in the region are rising .
It is not clear that the United States has reconsidered its strategy on Iran in the wake of the postelection demonstrations .
But if Rafsanjani 's claim of Russian support for Ahmadinejad is true , a massive re-evaluation of U.S. policy could ensue , assuming one has n't already started — prompting a reconsideration of the military option .
All of this assumes that there is substance behind a mob chanting " Death to Russia . "
There appears to be , but of course , Ahmadinejad 's enemies would want to magnify that substance to its limits and beyond .
This is why we are not ready to simply abandon our previous net assessment of Iran , even though it is definitely time to rethink it .
Annie Leibovitz , perhaps the highest - paid celebrity photographer in the world , is profoundly broke .
She hocked every photograph she 's ever produced and now the high - end pawnshop that gave her $ 24 million has filed suit to force her to sell it all .
Art Capital Group is a financial firm that specializes in lending money for people who own valuable art .
They 're happy either getting back in cash or taking the art .
Leibovitz , whose financial difficulties have been well - documented , mortgaged her homes and all her photographs to Art Capital and yesterday they filed suit for breach of contract , claiming she wo n't cooperate in their attempts to sell her pictures .
Art Capital has loaned Leibovitz a total of $ 24 million since September of last year .
They took as collateral the negatives and copyright to all of Leibovitz 's photographs , as well as her homes in Rhinebeck , N.Y. , and Greenwich Village .
But they also extracted from her , according to a lawsuit filed today by Art Capital , both an agreement to sell her archives to repay the loan and the exclusive rights to arrange the sale .
And they claim that she is refusing to honor that agreement , frustrating their attempts to sell the photos and refusing to allow real estate agents into her homes .
The suit is n't over the debt , per se .
The original loan , according to the suit , was premised on the likelihood that Leibovitz was eventually going to have to sell her archives in order to repay the debt by this September , when it comes due .
And according to a sales agreement signed by Leibovitz and included in the suit , Leibovitz agreed to let Art Capital " identify buyers , " " solicit offers , " and " consummate such sales . "
But so far , Leibovitz has refused to cooperate .
Art Capital took physical custody of Leibovitz 's negatives when it made the loan , so it would n't have any trouble selling those to recover some of the money if it wished .
But the real money is in the intellectual property rights to Leibovitz 's portfolio , and for that , it needs her cooperation to get the most value .
" The agreement with her was that they'd go out and sell it for more than $ 24 million , " says a source close to Art Capital .
" And now , she 's not making herself available .
Any likely buyer would say , ' Gee , can I meet with Annie ? '
I do n't think anyone would buy it if they do n't feel they have a cooperative seller . "
Leibovitz 's refusal to cooperate raises the question of whether she ever intended to pay Art Capital back , or whether she has already surreptitiously sold the archive using another agent .
Her relationship with Art Capital began to go south in March , when Getty Images announced that it was taking on Leibovitz under a " a special multi-assignment collaboration . "
It 's unclear what that means , but Getty 's release implies that Leibovitz 's " name and talent " had been added to the company 's " roster of elite photographers available for commission photography . "
That was a surprise to Art Capital , who , according to the suit , thought Leibovitz had pledged them the " right of first refusal to act as agent in connection with ... the engagement by third parties of photographic services " provided by her — a way of hedging against the loan by at least getting commission on any of Leibovitz 's photos .
According to a source close to the deal , Leibovitz did n't inform Art Capital of the Getty arrangement .
Art Capital 's suit seeks to compel Leibovitz to honor the contract and help the company sell her photos and homes .
It also claims she owes " hundreds of thousands of dollars " in bills associated with the deal .
Leibovitz 's attorney declined to comment .
The suit is silent on how much , if any , of the $ 24 million she owes Art Capital has been paid back , though it 's highly unlikely that the company would move forward to force the sale if Leibovitz had made much of a dent in what she owes .
So no matter what happens with the suit , she 's almost certainly deep in a hole with no clear way out aside from the sale .
In May , one of Leibovitz 's other creditors , a lighting company that claimed she owes them $ 189,000 prepared a petition for involuntary bankruptcy against her , which would turn the decision over a sale of her assets over to a bankruptcy judge .
The petition has n't been filed yet , and a lawyer for the company did n't immediately return phone calls , but today 's suit may well increase the likelihood that Leibovitz is forced into bankruptcy .

On his FNC show Studio B with Sheppard Smith today , host Shep Smith went against the Fox News definition reconciliation as the nuclear option by explaining what it really involves , then he added , “ If you are interested in this matter of reconciliation … you should go to Google and Google it … do your own research . ”
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :

After telling his viewers what reconciliation really is , and has been used for in the past , he brought in Carl Cameron to discuss the legislative status of healthcare reform , Smith added , “ If you are interested in this matter of reconciliation , how it ’s been used in the past , where it fits into the Constitution and all the rest , you should go to Google and Google it .
There are a lot of quotes probably from your senator or representative . ”
It is at this point that Cameron the good company man jumped in and added , “ Or talk to us . ”
Smith continued , “ Oh yeah , talk to us , but Google it .
Do your own research .
It is too important to just listen to me about , that ’s for sure . ”
Shep Smith is encouraging FNC viewers to not blindly follow the network , but to do their own research and think .
Is he trying to get fired ?
I would have loved to have seen what would have happened if Cameron had not been there to pull him back .
I am sure this wo n’t the die hard right wingers who were already calling for Smith ’s head on a platter very happy .
The problem is that Smith does n’t always fit the Fox News agenda because he has a bad habit of using facts .
I believe that Smith is correct .
People should think for themselves instead of being told what to think by any television network or personality , however there is loads of misinformation out there on the Internet too .
The best thing a person can do is actually read the source information and not some interpretation of a bill or a program by either a liberal or conservative host .

Reveling in Constraints
The Google Web Toolkit is an end - run around Web development obstacles .
Bruce Johnson , Google
The Web ’s trajectory toward interactivity , which began with humble snippets of JavaScript used to validate HTML forms , has really started to accelerate of late .
A new breed of Web applications is starting to emerge that sports increasingly interactive user interfaces based on direct manipulations of the browser DOM ( document object model ) via ever - increasing amounts of JavaScript .
Google Wave , publicly demonstrated for the first time in May 2009 at the Google I/O Developer Conference in San Francisco , exemplifies this new style of Web application .
Instead of being implemented as a sequence of individual HTML “ pages ” rendered by the server , Wave might be described as a client / server application in which the client is a browser executing a JavaScript application , while the server is “ the cloud . ”
The key browser technologies responsible for enabling this new generation of Web applications are not especially new : JavaScript runs within the browser to manipulate the browser DOM as a means for actually rendering the UI and responding to user events ; CSS ( cascading style sheets ) are used to control the visual style of the UI ; and the XHR ( XmlHttpRequest ) subsystem allows JavaScript application code to communicate asynchronously with a Web server without requiring a full - page refresh , thus making incremental UI updates possible .
There are many more browser technologies that read like alphabet soup : XML , VML , SVG , JSON , XHTML , DTD … the list goes on .
Curiously , these browser technologies have been available for many years , yet it has taken until now for mainstream developers to cobble them together to create compellingly interactive Web applications .
Why ?
The opinion of the Google Web Toolkit team — a perspective that can , of course , be endlessly debated — is that the primary obstacle is literally the implementation details .
It is simply too hard to code them all to work together in a way that provides quick and reliable performance on the wide range of browsers available .
Our response was to design GWT ( Google Web Toolkit ) , which allows developers to spend most of their time writing and debugging application code using the Java language rather than JavaScript .
Working in Java means developers can leverage the productivity of Java IDEs ( integrated development environments ) .
Then , once they ’re happy with their Java code , developers can use GWT ’s cross-compiler to convert Java source code into functionally equivalent , and optimized , JavaScript .
The idea of cross-compilation tends to raise eyebrows , and we ’ve heard more than our fair share of incredulity about this , so let ’s take a step back to describe how we decided on this approach — and how things have actually worked out .
GWT began life as a prototype that Google software engineer Joel Webber and I produced as a way to address what might best be described as the over - constrained problem of Web development .
Thanks largely to the success of Google Maps and Gmail , several points had simultaneously become clear to us :
End users really liked and wanted browser - based applications .
Rich client - side interactivity ( for example , Maps and Gmail ) made such applications much more responsive and usable than typical Web 1.0 page - at - a - time applications and thus much more compelling .
Each major browser was technically capable of enabling such interactive applications .
They could all run JavaScript and support dynamic HTML , but bugs , inconsistencies , and proprietary APIs and behaviors prevented any single JavaScript program from working consistently and efficiently on the majority of the modern browsers .
Support for the JavaScript language itself — that is , for the “ pure ” language syntax and core JS libraries , excluding DOM APIs — was , to our surprise , quite consistent and reliable across browsers .
In other words , the browser — in particular , XHR , JavaScript , and the DOM — presented a capable , albeit frustrating , platform for delivering applications .
JavaScript Reservations
At the same time , we had questions about whether JavaScript was a good language in which to write business - critical applications .
On the one hand , JavaScript is a flexible , dynamically typed language that makes certain types of code easy to write and pleasantly succinct .
On the other hand , that same flexibility can make JavaScript harder to use within a team environment because there is no easy way to enforce the use of consistent conventions automatically across an entire codebase .
It is true that , with significant extra work , a JavaScript team could insist that all script be augmented with extra metadata ( JSDoc , for example ) and then use additional tools to verify that all script complies with the agreed - upon conventions .
This would also necessarily restrict the developers to a statically analyzable subset of JavaScript , since some of JavaScript ’s most dynamic constructs — eval ( ) and the with statement are good examples — thoroughly defeat static analysis .
All this extra stuff — the metadata and verification tools — seemed an awful lot like an ad - hoc static type system and a compiler front end .
Furthermore , we badly wanted an IDE .
Our experience had thoroughly convinced us that IDEs are a boon to productivity , quality , and maintenance .
Features that are status quo in modern Java IDEs such as code completion , debugging , integrated unit testing , refactoring , and syntax - aware search were virtually nonexistent for JavaScript .
The reason for this , again , is related to the dynamism of JavaScript .
For example , it is n’t possible to provide sound code completion in a JavaScript editor in the general case because different runtime code paths can produce different meanings for the same symbols .
Consider this legal JavaScript :
function foo( m ) { alert ( “ You called foo with the message : “ + m ) ; } if ( dayOfWeek ( ) == “ Wednesday ” ) { foo = 3 ; } foo ( “ Hello ? ” ) ; // [ 1 ]
At [ 1 ] , it ’s impossible to tell statically whether foo is a function or a variable , so IDE code completion can only provide “ potentially correct ” suggestions , which is an optimistic way of saying that you must double - check the IDE ’s code completion suggestions , which in turn is likely to diminish much of the would - be productivity gain to be realized from a JavaScript IDE .
For similar reasons , automated refactoring tools for JavaScript are rarely seen , even while such tools are ubiquitous in the Java world .
These observations made JavaScript seem less attractive as a language in which to write large applications .
We finally realized that we wanted to develop our source code in the Java language , yet deploy it as pure JavaScript .
By choosing the Java language as the origination language , we could immediately leverage the great ecosystem of Java tools , especially the great Java IDEs out there .
The only question was how to produce JavaScript from the Java source input .
Our answer was to build a Java - to - JavaScript compiler — an optimizing compiler , in fact , because we figured that since we were going to the trouble of writing a compiler anyway , why not make sure it produced small , efficient JavaScript ?
Furthermore , we discovered that because Java has a static type system , it allowed for many compile - time optimizations that JavaScript — being dynamically typed — would not .
As an example of this , consider the interaction between inlining and devirtualization ( that is , the removal of polymorphism in a method invocation ) .
In JavaScript , developers often simulate object - oriented constructs such as polymorphism .
For example , if you wanted to have a simple Shape hierarchy in JavaScript , you might write this :
function Shape ( ) { } Shape.prototype.getArea = function ( ) { } function Circle ( radius ) { this .radius = radius ; } Circle.prototype = new Shape ( ) ; Circle.prototype.getArea = function ( ) { return this .radius * this .radius * Math. PI ; } function Square ( length ) { this .
length = length ; } Square.prototype = new Shape ( ) ; Square.prototype.getArea = function ( ) { return this .
length * this .length ; } function displayArea ( shape ) { alert ( “ The area is “ + shape.getArea( ) ) ; } function runTest ( ) { var shape1 = new Circle ( 3 ) ; var shape2 = new Square ( 2 ) ; displayArea( shape1 ) ; displayArea( shape2 ) ; }
The same thing written in the Java language for use with GWT might look like this :
abstract class Shape { public abstract double getArea( ) ; } class Circle extends Shape { private final double radius ; public Circle ( double radius ) { this .radius = radius ; } @ Override public double getArea ( ) { return radius * radius * Math .
PI ; } } class Square extends Shape { private final double length ; public Square ( double length ) { this .
length = length ; } @ Override public double getArea ( ) { return length * length ; } } static void displayArea( Shape shape ) { Window.alert ( “ The area is “ + shape.getArea( ) ) ; } static void runTest ( ) { Shape shape1 = new Circle ( 3 ) ; Shape shape2 = new Square ( 2 ) ; displayArea( shape1 ) ; displayArea( shape2 ) ; }
The source for the two examples looks nearly identical , except for minor syntax differences , the use of @ Override ( which is useful for helping to prevent bugs ) , and the presence of explicit type names sprinkled on fields , methods , and local variables .
Because of the extra type information , the GWT compiler is able to perform some optimizations .
The unobfuscated version of the GWT compiler output looks approximately like this :
function runTest ( ) { var shape1 , shape2 ; shape1 = $ Circle ( new Circle ( ) , 3 ) ; shape2 = $ Square ( new Square ( ) , 2 ) ; alert ( ‘ The area is ‘ + shape1.radius * shape1.radius * 3.141592653589793 ) ; // [ 1 ] alert ( ‘ The area is ‘ + shape2.length * shape2.length ) ; // [ 2 ] }
Note that in [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] above , a cascade of optimizations was made .
First , the compiler inlined both calls to the displayArea ( ) method .
This proved helpful because it removed the need to generate code for that method .
Indeed , displayArea( ) is completely absent from the compiled script , resulting in a minor size reduction .
Even better , the inlined code is amenable to being further optimized in a usage - specific context where more information is available to the optimizer .
Next , the optimizer noticed that the types of shape1 and shape2 could be “ tightened ” to types more specific than their original declaration .
In other words , although shape1 was declared to be a Shape , the compiler saw that it was actually a Circle .
Similarly , the type of shape2 was tightened to Square .
Consequently , the calls to getArea( ) in [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] were made more specific .
The former became a call to Circle ’s getArea ( ) , and the latter became a call to Square ’s getArea ( ) .
Thus , all the method calls were statically bound , and all polymorphism was removed .
Finally , with all polymorphism removed , the optimizer inlined Circle ’s getArea ( ) into [ 1 ] and Square ’s getArea ( ) into [ 2 ] .
Both getArea ( ) methods are absent from the compiled script , having been inlined away .
Math .
PI is a compile - time constant and was also trivially inlined into [ 1 ] .
The benefit of all these optimizations is speed .
The script produced by the GWT compiler executes more quickly because it eliminates multiple levels of function calls .
For obvious reasons , large codebases tend to be written with an emphasis on clarity and maintainability rather than just on sheer performance .
When it comes to maintainability , abstraction , reuse , and modularity are absolute cornerstones .
Yet , in the previous example , maintainability and performance come into direct conflict : the inlined code is faster , yet no software engineer would write it that way .
The “ maintainability vs. performance ” dichotomy is n’t unique to Java code , of course .
It is equally true that writing modular , maintainable JavaScript tends to produce slower , larger script than one would prefer .
Thus , all developers building complex
Web applications have to face the reality of this trade - off .
The pivotal question would seem to be just how amenable your codebase is to optimization once you ’ve written it .
In that regard , the Java type system provides great leverage , and that is how the GWT compiler is able to include many optimizations similar to the ones shown here to help mitigate the “ abstraction penalty ” you might otherwise end up having to pay in a well - designed object - oriented codebase .
Bringing Together Two Worlds
Of course , the creation of an environment that allows developers to build browser - based applications in Java addresses only one part of the development cycle .
Like most developers , we do not produce perfect code , so we knew we would also have to address the issues involved in debugging GWT programs .
Upon first hearing about GWT , people often assume you use it in the following way :
Write Java source .
Compile to JavaScript with GWT ’s compiler .
Run and debug the JavaScript in a browser .
In fact , that is not the way you work in GWT at all .
You spend most of your time in GWT ’s hosted mode , which allows you to run and debug your Java code in a normal Java debugger ( for example , Eclipse ) , just as you ’re accustomed to doing .
Only when the application is written and debugged do you need actually to compile it into JavaScript .
Thus , everyone ’s reflexive fear of never being able to understand and debug the compiled JavaScript proves to be unfounded .
The secret to making hosted mode an effective debugging environment is that it does not merely simulate the behavior of a browser while debugging in Java .
Hosted mode directly combines true Java debugging with a real browser UI and event system .
Hosted mode is conceptually simple , and it executes in a single JVM ( Java Virtual Machine ) process :
Launch an instance of an actual browser , embedded in - process , that can be controlled by Java code via JNI ( Java Native Interface ) .
We call this the hosted browser .
Create a CCL ( compiling class loader ) to load the GWT module ’s entry - point classes .
Whenever the CCL is asked to fetch a class , it checks to see if the class has JSNI ( JavaScript Native Interface ) methods .
If not , the class can be used directly .
If native methods are found , the class gets compiled from source and the JSNI methods are rewritten .
Run the bytecode of the entry - point class , which will in turn request other classes be loaded by the CCL , which repeats the process from step 3 .
Step 3 , rewriting JSNI methods , is the really neat part here .
JSNI is the way to implement native Java methods in handwritten JavaScript , such as :
// This is Java! static native Element createDivElement ( ) /*-{ //
This is JavaScript ! return document.createElement(“ div ” ) ; }-*/;
The CCL knows about JSNI and rewrites it to look something like this :
// A static initializer is introduced in the class .
static { hostedBrowser.injectFunc(“createDivElement ” , “ return document.createElement ( \” div\ ” ) ; ” ) ; } //
The method becomes all - Java and is no longer native .
static Element createDivElement ( ) { return hostedBrowser.invokeInjectedFunc(this , “ createDivElement ” ) ; } ;
Thus , the hosted - mode CCL turns JSNI methods into thunks that redirect their calls into the hosted browser ’s JavaScript engine , which in turn drives the real browser DOM .
From the JVM ’s point of view , everything described here is pure Java bytecode and can therefore be debugged normally using a Java debugger .
From the developer ’s point of view , he or she can see the true behavior of a real browser being driven by the Java source code without it first having been cross-compiled into pure JavaScript .
Which brings up perhaps the most exciting point about hosted mode : because it works dynamically with Java code and does not depend on invoking the GWT cross -compiler ( which can be slow ) , hosted mode is really fast .
This means developers get the same kind of run / tweak / refresh behavior they enjoy whenever working directly with JavaScript .
GWT thus manages to combine the benefits of a traditional optimizing compiler with the quick development turn - around of dynamic languages .
Although the compilation technology may appear complex , it is actually fairly standard fare for optimizing compilers .
The real technical problems we encountered along the way revolved around our efforts to create UI libraries to simultaneously account for browser - specific quirks without compromising size or speed .
In other words , we needed to supply many different implementations of UI functionality — version A for Firefox , version B for Safari , and so forth — without burdening the compiled application with the union of all the variations , thereby forcing each browser to download at least some amount of irrelevant code .
Our solution is a unique mechanism we dubbed deferred binding , which arranges for the GWT compiler to produce not one output script , but an arbitrary number of them , each optimized for a particular set of circumstances .
Each compiled output is a combination of many different implementation choices , such that each script has exactly ( and only ) the amount of code it requires .
It ’s worth mentioning that in addition to dealing with browser variations , deferred binding can specialize compilations along other axes as well .
For example , deferred binding is used to create per-locale specializations ( for example , why should a French user have to download strings localized for English , or vice versa ? ) .
In fact , deferred binding is completely open ended , so developers can add axes of specialization based on their needs .
This approach does create a large number of compiled scripts , but we reasoned it was a welcome trade - off : you end up spending cheap server disk space on many optimized scripts , and , as a result , applications download and run more quickly , making end users happier .
In any event , our experience in developing GWT has thoroughly convinced us that there ’s no need to give in to the typical constraints of Web development .
That is , with a bit of creativity and some dedicated effort , we now know it is indeed possible to retain the richness of more familiar development environments without compromising the experience application users are ultimately to enjoy .

The developer of a massive hydroelectric project in Borneo plans to set fire to thousands hectares of logged over rainforest in the dam area , contributing to polluting haze already blanketing the region and raising the risk of forest fires in adjacent areas , reports a local environmental group .
The Sarawak Conservation Action Network ( SCANE ) has learned that Sarawak Hidro Sdn Bhd , the operator of the Bakun Hydroelectric Power Dam project , is in the process of clear - cuting 80,000 hectares ( 200,000 acres ) of rainforest set to be flooded by the dam .
The remnants are being torched , in direct violation of Malaysia ’s laws against open burning .
SCANE reports :
“ SCANE was told that one of the conditions as stipulated in the contract is that the contractors and / or its sub - contractors , agents and / or workers are required to do burnings on the cleared and felled forest , without which they would not be fully paid for the work done and / or their contract would be terminated .
Over the past few months , large tracts of forest have already been cleared and felled within the Bakun dam reservoir area …
Bakun dam in Sarawak .

With the current long spell dry weather , the Sarawak Hidro Sdn Bhd ’s contractors and / or its sub - contractors , agents and / or workers have been doing a series of forest burnings .
SCANE has received reports that there were open burnings carried out in the area .
Fires were reported at different locations and sites in the area …
The unscrupulous activity of clearing and open burning of forests by Sarawak Hidro within the Bakun dam reservoir area is clearly violating to the Natural Resources and Environment Ordinance ( NREO ) .
It is such outrageous that Sarawak Hidro actions to wipe out the forest within the reservoir area without having any sense of responsibility and sensitivity toward the environment , though knowingly that its activity would cause immeasurable impacts to environment .
Green groups have fought the 2400 - megawatt Bakun dam for more than a decade , citing displacement of forest communities and destruction of biologically - rich rainforest as chief concerns .
The dam , which will create a reservoir the size of Singapore , will generate electricity for mining projects as well as power - hungry cities in Singapore and other parts of Malaysia .
In recent months Malaysia , Singapore , and Indonesia have been plagued by “ haze ” , resulting from large - scale bush and forest fires .
Malaysia has a ban on open - burning but the rule is widely flouted by plantation developers and farmers .
It ���s not even a week - old here , but Warner Bros Pictures��� big hit of the year , The Hangover , is giving Bollywood ideas already .
The film that conquered the US with box office figures of $ 200 million and still counting , has gone down well with Indian audiences and critics , which is rare .
It is a new kind of comedy about a bachelor party gone horribly wrong .
Two days before his wedding , Doug ( Justin Bartha ) and his three buddies ( Bradley Cooper , Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis ) drive to Las Vegas for a blow - out night they ���ll never forget .
But when the three groomsmen wake up the next morning with pounding headaches , they can ���t remember a thing .
Their posh hotel suite is beyond trashed and the groom is nowhere to be found .
With no clue about what happened and little time to spare , the trio must attempt to retrace their bad decisions from the night before in order to figure out where things went wrong and hopefully get Doug back to LA in time for his wedding .
However , the more they begin to uncover , the more they realise just how much trouble they ���re really in .
According to Denzil Dias , deputy managing director , Warner Bros Pictures , ���We are getting several offers from Indian filmmakers to remake The Hangover in Hindi and other languages , which proves that this film has a universal connect .
It is one of those rare instances where the selling point of the film are the audiences themselves , as the word of mouth on the film is phenomenal !��
�But who from Bollywood would like to remake this film , is being kept a secret for the time being .
Last weekend , we journeyed to Boston to attend a college graduation .
Thousands of callow scholars were on display .
Each was handed his papers and then marched out of the hockey stadium .
To the tune of  Pomp & Circumstance ,  wearing a long , red robe , he entered the outside world solemnly like a patsy joining a poker game .
So far , not a single major university has asked us to make the commencement address .
Nor a minor college .
Not even a school of cosmetology or taxidermy .
But here in London , protected by a broad ocean and a narrow reading of the First Amendment , we will give them — and UK graduates too — advice no one asked for .
 Plastics ,  was the advice given to college graduates in Mike Nichols ’ ’ 67 film .
But that was when there was still hope for America ’s manufacturing sector .
Even then , it was too late .
The percentage of GDP from the manufacturing sector fell for the next four decades , from over 20 % in the last ’ 60s to barely 12 % last year .
Better advice would have been derivatives .
They stank just as bad , but they were much more profitable .
While only 8 % of GDP , finance accounted for 40 % of corporate profits in 2007 .
And derivatives grew from nothing to a face value of 16 times the GDP of the entire planet .
But your elders are always giving you bum advice .
 You cannot decline the burdens of empire and still expect to share its honors ,  said Pericles to the class of 430BC .
He lived during a time not unlike your parents ’ era in the USA — when Athens was on top of the world .
But vanity got the better of him .
He launched an attack on Sparta that backfired badly .
He soon died of plague and Athens was not only ruined , but enslaved .
Athens ’ golden age turned to lead .
Young Athenians should have shrugged off the burden rather than accept it .
You should do the same .
When you were born 20 - some years ago , the nation ’s total debt per person was less than $ 90,000 — adjusted to ’09 dollars , of course .
While that was a lot of money , it was nothing compared to what was coming .
Now it ’s $ 186,717 per person — more than twice as much , in real terms .
Fortunately , private debt is not inheritable .
But it comes to you as a lien against property .
Instead of paying off their mortgages and leaving you a house , free and clear , the baby boomer generation spent the equity u201D in their houses even faster than they got it .
House prices rose .
But mortgage debt rose faster .
While your grandparents owned 80 % of their houses , by 2007 , the typical homeowner only really owned 4 rooms of an 8 - room house .
And then , when house prices fell , so did his remaining equity to the point where one out of six homeowners in America is now underwater .
You could still eventually inherit a house , but you may have to scrape the barnacles off the front porch .
Mobs , Messiahs , and Ma ... Will Bonner , Lila Rajiva Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 8.01 ( as of 04:35 EST - Details )
But that ’s not even the half of it .
While your parents had control of the US government they allowed themselves a little larceny .
Add the unfunded retirement and healthcare benefits they voted for themselves to the official national debt , and together they are scheduled to cost your generation 4 times the total annual output of the US .
This is over and above the private debt they accumulated .
Some of this debt can be carried .
Some will have to be paid down .
But as it stands , as much as $ 77 trillion of post - ’09 earnings must be stolen from the future in order to pay for the liquor your parents drank the bombs they dropped on god-forsaken foreigners and the interest on their debts .
So , forget about saving for a European vacation or a house of your own .
Even if every penny of your savings — and every other American ’s savings — are put to the task you will still be paying for your parents ’ expenses all your life .
But wait , there ’s more !
The burden is getting heavier .
Federal budget projections show an additional $ 7 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years .
Described as the cost of fighting recession , the present generation buries its own mistakes under cash that the next generation has n’t even earned yet .
Today ’s bankers , businessmen and speculators are being bankrolled by you — tomorrow ’s bankers , businessmen and speculators .
Today ’s homeowners get a helping hand from whom ?
Tomorrow ’s homeowners — you .
Today ’s employees get a boost too .
Same story .
Where do you think the money came from to pay Wall Street bonuses this year ?
How do you think GM stays in business and Fannie Mae and AIG
Who pays those salaries ?
Who pays to keep troops all over the world and keep old people supplied with new drugs ?
Who pays for hundreds of billions ’ worth of  shovel ready  boondoggles ?
You will .
At least , that ’s the plan .
The luck of one generation is the curse of the next .
Like Pericles , your parents inherited a dollar ; they leave you a peso .
They took over the strongest , richest , most competitive nation in the world .
And like Pericles they minded everyone ’s business but their own .
Now , not only does the US owe money all over town , its government puts out trillions more in IOUs every year — each one with your name on it .
You ’re not even out in the real world yet , and you ’re getting the bill for 50 cents of every dollar the feds spend — almost none of it earmarked for you .
But that is the thing about the real world your teachers probably forgot to tell you about .
It is more unreal and fantastical than anything you studied .
Here ’s what ’s real :
You ’ve been dealt a bad hand .
From the bottom of the deck your parents have slipped you some nasty cards .
Our advice ?
Fold ’em .
Get up from the table before they clean you out .

The Best of Bill Bonner
Are we shocked here ?
Shocked that the CIA lies ???
Oh , yeah , only the Republicans are shocked , since they said that the CIA would NEVER mislead congress !!
From Keith Olbermann and h/t to jazmen8 over @ Daily Kos
The column began by thoroughly misrepresenting the philosophy of Founding Father Thomas Jefferson .
While any free - thinking observer of the press would keep a watchful eye on the media and retain their right to criticize it , O'Reilly flatly states that Jefferson " did n't much like the press . "
However , the truth is that Jefferson regarded the press as an essential component of a free society .
He said :
" ... were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government , I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter . "
With that disinformational kickoff , O'Reilly set about to discredit a poll by the New York Times that found that a majority of Americans would prefer healthcare reform that covers everyone , even if it means paying more in taxes .
Never mind that most polls reveal the same preference , O'Reilly 's only real purpose was to dispute the validity of a poll with which he disagreed .
The gist of O'Reilly 's complaint was that the Times oversampled Obama voters , producing a skewed result .
The problem with his typically shallow analysis is that 50 % of Republicans in the poll expressed the same preference as Democrats .
What 's more , as a pollster testing the mood of the nation , the goal is not to balance respondents by political affiliation .
The goal is to have a representative sample of the public at large .
By that standard , the sampling of the Times poll was accurate .
Nevertheless , O'Reilly can't contain his disdain for anyone who disagrees with him .
His outrage is so intense that it led him to say this :
" The most frustrating part about this is that nothing can be done .
The Times has an ombudsman , but he 's a joke , and no outside agency has any power over the paper .
It can pretty much do what it wants , and does . "
Stop the presses !
You mean to say that a newspaper can do whatever it wants ?
How the heck did that happen ?
Why is n't here an outside agency that has power over these papers ?
No wonder O'Reilly is tee 'd off .
He would be much happier if journalists all had to have their work approved by editorial boards that could certify the conservative purity of the message before being disseminated to the people .
You know , like the way Fox News does it .
This is a man whose daily delusions can't be summed up simply by describing them as paranoid .
A new word must be coined to encompass the naked madness he embodies ( Paranoxious ? ) .
His perception of enemies lurking in every shadow is enough to warrant institutionalization .
Yet , instead , this is a man who has his own TV show and millions of viewers to whom he can peddle dangerous ideas like " outside agencies " that have power over the press .
This is n't the first time that O'Reilly has expressed a desire to control the press .
He frequently rails against it and ferociously attacks it .
It is nearly impossible to go a day without hearing him besmirch the media as a bastion of hate that poses a very real risk to society :
" Knowing that partisan hostility is boiling over in America , the Secret Service is tense because the candidates are exposed when they campaign in public .
Hatred is definitely in the air and the media is partially to blame . "
You have to give O'Reilly credit for his superhuman capacity for denial , in that he does n't recognize himself in that statement .
He even refutes it entirely in his recent defense of his provocative comments regarding the murdered doctor , George Tiller .
In that case it is not , to him , the least bit inflammatory to refer to someone as a " baby killer " who " has blood on his hands " .
This is also a man who has a severe fear and hatred of the media - that 's right - the media that he works so hard to demolish despite his prominent role in it .
Take , for example , this brazen threat to journalists everywhere :
" [ T ] here is a huge problem in this country and I 'm going to attack that problem .
I 'm going to attack it .
These people are n't getting away with this .
I 'm going to go right where they live .
Every corrupt media person in this country is on notice , right now .
I 'm coming after you ... I 'm going to hunt you down [...] if I could strangle these people and not go to hell and get executed ... I would . "
That 's what we 're up against .
That 's the sort of mindless hostility that is being spread throughout the mediasphere .
And it is n't just O'Reilly .
It is Glenn Beck , Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh , Ann Coulter , Michael Savage , etc .
It would be tempting to ask what can be done about these freaks .
But that would just be adopting their response that promotes censorship and suppression .
The real question is how do we educate the people who watch and listen to this garbage ?
How do we replace those sensationalistic rantings with honest and deliberative discourse ?
And how do we do it before it erupts into ( more ) violence ?
That 's a difficult assignment , as snarling shoutfests seem to make for more popular viewing than rational dialogue .
But it 's an assignment that we need to complete for the sake of our country , if not for our mental health .
How the Bible and Evolution Conflict
An Analysis of the Tension Between Two Worldviews
Let 's first make the point that the tension between the Bible and evolution is not at all about the age of the earth !
While some Christians hold to a young earth , other Christians hold to an old earth .
Both camps have evidence to back up their claims .
The debate is much deeper than that .
The tension between evolution and creation is more philosophical than scientific .
Here are some points :
Creationism and evolutionism begin from two radically different points .
Creation :
In the beginning there was God. Evolution :
In the beginning there was random chance .
Darwinian doctrine insists that the evolution of life is a random process — that we are here by a series of pure accidents ( e.g. , mutations , and molecules in motion , gene recombinations and duplications ) .
This is in direct conflict with the biblical doctrine of election — that life is not merely a series of accidents .
According to the Bible , each believer is in some sense individually foreknown and chosen by God from before the foundations of the world .
( 1 Samuel 16:7 - 12 ; Psalm 139:16 ; Jeremiah 1:5 ; Matthew 24:31 , 25:34 ; Romans 8:29 - 30 ; 1 Corinthians 2:7 ; Galatians 1:15 ; Ephesians 1:4- 12 ; 2 Thessalonians 2:13 ; 1 Peter 1:1 - 2 , 2:9 ) The God of the Bible is more than Creator and Savior .
He is also Sustainer .
With evolution , life is a self - sustaining process ruled by fate , and God plays no role in the universe or in the ongoing lives of men .
This contradicts the biblical doctrine of providence — that all things happen under the authority of God , and that God is still at work sustaining ( though not re-creating )
His creation .
( Genesis 45:7 - 8 , Nehemiah 9:6 ; Esther 4:14 ; Psalm 104:30 , 145:16 , 147:9 ; Proverbs 16:9,33 , Isaiah 45:1,7 , 46:10 ; Matthew 6:26 , 10:29-31 ; John 5:17 , 14:16 - 17 , 15:26 , 16:13 -15 ; Acts 17:26 , 18:9-11 ; Romans 8:9-11 ; Colossians 1:17 , Hebrews 1:3 ) Still another aspect of the God of the Bible is that He is Judge .
The Bible makes a major point of an afterlife in heaven or hell .
Indeed , Jesus discusses this concept more than any other biblical figure .
As part of the process of ultimate judgment by God , a new type of resurrection body will emerge to another life — to either be glorified in heaven or condemned for eternity .
Evolution is in great conflict with this view , including the fact that the physical cannot evolve into an afterlife .
( Matthew 5:22,29,30 , 23:33 , 24:31 ; 1 Corinthians 15:42 -53 ; 2 Peter 2:4-10 )
The Bible says that man was created as a special being — in the image of God , as opposed to the evolutionary view that has man is just another animal in the evolutionary process .
( Genesis 1:26 - 27 , 2:7 )
The Bible indicates that creation was a completed event in the past , and is not continuing as evolution suggests .
( Genesis 2:1 - 3 ; Ecclesiastes 3:14 ; Hebrews 4:3-11 )
As put by the Concordia Study Bible ( annotations page 8 ) , " His creative work was completed — and it was totally effective , absolutely perfect , 'very good . '
It did not have to be repeated , repaired or revised , and the Creator rested to commemorate it . "
Given the above , the creation by God of distinct " kinds " as described in Genesis 1 and 1 Corinthians 15:38 - 39 implies that transmutations between kinds is precluded , or at least superfluous .
The Bible indicates that there is clear physical evidence of creation .
( Psalm 19:1 - 6 ; Acts 17:24 -29 ) Evolution denies the evidence for creation .
If Darwinism were a reasonable hypothesis , atheists would have a perfectly good excuse , in contradiction to Romans 1:20 .
On the other hand , creation is a consistent theme throughout the Bible .
There is no hint of evolution in the Bible .
While this is an argument from silence and thus does not necessarily preclude evolution , such an important concept as to origins would surely have been suggested in the Bible due to its theological implications .
On the other hand , special creation is a consistent theme throughout the Bible .
It is mentioned approximately 64 times in 18 books of the Bible .
Evolution is a philosophy based on naturalism and materialism .
Naturalism holds that nature is all there is and that the universe is self - sufficient without a supernatural cause or control of the world .
Materialism regards matter as the original cause of all — that matter did its own creating .
Materialism denies the existence of the soul .
The philosophical assumption of evolution is therefore essentially atheistic or agnostic , thus clearly incompatible with special creation and the other miracles of the Bible .
With evolution , if God exists ,
He is so distant as to be irrelevant .
The Bible teaches that God created man by fiat , that is , by supernatural power , not by natural processes .
( Genesis 2:7 ; Psalm 33:6,9 ; Psalm 148:5 ; 2 Corinthians 4:6 ; Hebrews 11:3 ) Some 75 passages of Scripture including those by Jesus , refer to the creation narrative of Genesis 1 - 2 , confirming it as actual history .
( Matthew 19:4 ; Mark 10:6 ; Luke 3:38 , Revelation 2:7 ) See
In the Beginning elsewhere on our site .
There is an important reason to interpret from the Bible that Adam was a real person .
Unless the concept of original sin through Adam is true , Jesus ' coming makes no sense .
That is , Christians believe that Christ 's atoning sacrifice for our sins was necessary because of man 's sin nature inherited in some sense from Adam .
The Bible teaches that Jesus was the " second Adam . "
So if Adam was not real , thus did not bring sin into the world , Christ 's redemptive sacrifice was not necessary .
( Genesis 3:15 - 19 ; Romans 4:22-25 , 5:12-21 ; 1 Corinthians 15:21-23,45-57 ; 1 Timothy 2:13 - 14 ) .
The overarching theme of the Bible is Creation / Fall / Redemption .
( God created the universe " very good . "
Then man spoiled it by his rebellion — the " Fall " , necessitating God 's redemption of mankind through Christ . )
This sequence is crucial to Christian theology .
Did God really create things bad , not " very good " as the Bible says ( Genesis 1:31 ) ?
If things were bad to start with , the Fall becomes a superfluous concept .
( The Fall presupposes that there was something good from which to fall . )
Thus , a major point of tension exists between the Bible and evolution at the heart of the biblical doctrine of the Fall .
Note the following quote from G. R. Bozarth , The American Atheist magazine , September 1978 , 30 : " Christianity has fought , still fights , and will fight science to the desperate end over evolution , because evolution destroys utterly and finally the very reason Jesus ' earthly life was supposedly made necessary .
Destroy Adam and Eve and the original sin , and in the rubble you will find the sorry remains of the son of God .
If Jesus was not the redeemer who died for our sins , and this is what evolution means , then Christianity is nothing . "
Evolutionism , indeed , denies that man even has a sinful nature or else suggests that we should not be faulted for our human nature because " that is just our nature . "
Thus evolution is inconsistent with the Christian belief that man is indeed fallen and in need of a savior .
The theory of evolution itself has continually changed over time .
This is in contrast to the Bible , which has not changed over time .
Morality in evolutionary thought is a function of natural selection , survival of the fittest , or situation ethics .
The Bible teaches transcending moral truth , given by God. ( Exodus 20:1 - 17 ; Isaiah 5:20 - 21 ) Evolution is closely associated with the philosophy of secular humanism , which accepts human beings as the ultimate source of meaning and value .
The Bible , of course , places God as the ultimate source of meaning and value .
The Bible teaches that man was created for a special purpose .
Evolution denies that man has a divine purpose , or at least implies that man 's purpose in life is whatever one wants to make of it ( secular humanism ) .
( Isaiah 43:7 ; Jeremiah 29:11 ; Matthew 6:10 ; Romans 8:28 , 14:12 ; Galatians 1:15 ; Ephesians 2:10 , 3:21 ; 2 Timothy 1:9 ; 1 Peter 4:10 ) Since evolution offers no real purpose for life , it results in an absence of meaning , and therefore an absence of objective moral values .
This is clearly in conflict with the Bible .
Evolution results in a philosophy of nihilism ( the denial of any basis for truth ) , which ultimately ends in despair .
The Bible claims to have the Truth , which gives ultimate hope .
( John 14:6 ; Colossians 1:27 ) The Bible not only fits the evidence of scientific investigation , it provides an answer for why the world was created .
Evolution does neither .

The National Flu Service will go live at the end of next week Twenty - nine people have now died in the UK after contracting swine flu , up from 17 on Monday , the government has said .
It comes as the number of new cases hit 55,000 last week and the NHS has seen a surge in calls and consultations .
Ministers in England have responded by promising the National Flu Service will go live at the end of next week to relieve pressure on hospitals and GPs .
The government has also warned that deaths from swine flu this winter could be between 19,000 and 65,000 in the UK .
Experts said it was impossible to predict exactly , but with a third of the population perhaps becoming infected in the coming months the death toll could rise to such numbers .
The World Health Organisation has also described the pandemic as the fastest - moving one ever , adding it was now pointless to count every case .
THE PANDEMIC FLU SERVICE
The flu service has always been part of the government 's contingency plans , although it had been delayed and was not expected until the autumn
The version that goes live next week will be manned by up to 2,000 call centre staff at any one time
They will use a checklist to diagnose whether the person calling has swine flu and will be able to give them a voucher number to get anti-viral drugs if they are believed to be infected
The public will also be able to use a website to fill in the checklist as well and get access to the voucher number that way People will still be able to go direct to GPs and parents of children under one and those with underlying health conditions should still contact a doctor if swine flu is suspected
The number of staff will be increased if necessary and there are plans to roll it out across the UK if necessary
Time for concern , not panic
The pandemic flu service will allow people to get access to anti-flu drugs by calling in or using the internet .
It will not be available in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland as officials believe the demands being placed on the health service there are not as great .
In England , the rate of calls to NHS Direct is four times higher than would be expected for the winter , while the number of people in hospital has doubled to 652 .
Some 53 of these are in a critical condition .
In the worst hit areas , hospitals have reported having wards full of children with swine flu , while GP practices have said they are seeing between 50 and 60 flu cases a day .
Every region of England has seen a rise in demand for services during the past seven days with only Yorkshire and the Humber not now reporting " exceptional " levels .
Pressure Chief Medical Officer Sir Liam Donaldson said : " The flu service will mean the pressure will get taken off front - line staff to allow them to concentrate on the most serious cases . "
But he said there were still no signs the virus was mutating and becoming more severe .
And he added despite reports of delays with a vaccine , the UK was still expecting the first batches by the end of August with 60 m doses by the end of the year .
Of the 29 deaths , 26 have been in England and three in Scotland .
The most recent victims include a Swindon patient and a female tourist who died in Scotland .
The woman - who suffered underlying health problems - died after being admitted to hospital in Inverness three weeks ago .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
However , Sir Liam said it was important to keep the rising death toll in context .
During the 1999 to 2000 winter , seasonal flu deaths reached 21,000 and even during average winters there are normally anywhere between 6,000 to 8,000 deaths .
Professor Stephen Field , president of the Royal College of GPs , said : " The flu service has come at the right time .
GPs in the hotspots were under a lot of pressure and this should help . "
He later told BBC Radio Four 's Today programme that with thousands of deaths expected every year from seasonal flu , the NHS was always planning services based on assumptions .
" The problem is that the public do n't understand that this is the sort of thing that we expect every year anyway , so it 's very difficult to get the balance right , " he said .
However , he added that it was unusual for a pandemic to " take off " at this time of year in the way swine flu had .
Meanwhile Shadow health secretary Andrew Lansley questioned whether the NHS would be able to cope .
He said there was little guidance for GPs and the outbreak was going to " dramatically " test the capacity of hospitals .
He added that with a hospital system that ran at close to full capacity all the time it was difficult to add additional capacity .
" So some of the decisions about priorities , of cancelling elective operations , of deciding who to treat in hospital and who not to treat in hospital - they will be quite difficult decisions if some of the assumptions about the increase in the number of cases is as great as the government are predicting .

CELEBRATING DOCTOR FATE ( AND NEARLY BLUE DEVIL ) IN THE SUPER POWERS COLLECTION !
Fourteen different blogs have combined forces today to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Kenner ’s Super Powers Collection !
While we ’ll be looking at Doctor Fate here ( as well as the proposed Blue Devil figures ) , every other blog in the crossover will cover different action figures or mini-comics from the Super Powers Collection .
Back in 1984 , Kenner released the first wave of Super Powers action figures based upon heroes and villains from DC comics .
While there was a fairly large marketing campaign , I doubt they realized just how celebrated these figures would become .
ACTION FIGURES
The first wave of figures had characters like Superman , Batman , Robin , Wonder Woman , Green Lantern , Flash , Aquaman , Hawkman , the Joker , Lex Luthor , Brianiac and the Penguin .
Two more waves were released , bringing the line to a total of 33 figures .
One of the primary reasons the Super Powers Collection became so successful was that the molds were very good .
These figures actually looked like the characters in the comics .
That may sound like a no - brainer in the age of DC Direct and McFarlane Toys , but keep in mind prior to the Super Powers Collection adherence to characters likeness was n’t exactly a priority .
Another reason for the line ’s success was the inclusion of popular heroes and some relatively unknown characters ( I mean , who really demanded a Tyr figure anyway ? ) .
This mixture proved to be popular with comic book fans and kids alike .
Finally , some people will argue that the “ Power Action ” hidden gimmick in each figure was a big selling point .
I do n’t necessarily agree with that , but hey , everyone ’s entitled to their own opinion , right ?
The Doctor Fate action figure was released as part of Wave 2 in 1985 .
This figure was really the first tangible piece of Doctor Fate merchandise , outside of his comic book appearances .
To this day , I still think his helmet looks phenomenal !
Check out the Super Powers Collection Doctor Fate action figure below !
Below - Left is a picture of the Super Powers Collection Doctor Fate still on the card .
This is the Canadian version , which I ’ve seen advertised recently on the card for as much as $ 369 in near - mint condition .
Below - Right is the file card found on the back of the packaging explaining more about Doctor Fate .
…
Each of the Super Powers figures had a hidden gimmick , referred to as “ Power Action ” .
In Doctor Fate ’s case it was a “ Power Action Mystic Spell Cast ” .
By squeezing his legs together , his arms would move up and down .
I suppose this was to simulate Doctor Fate casting one of his trademark Ankh Bolts .
While the gimmick was nice ( especially since it did n’t disrupt the appearance of the figure ) , it really was n’t necessary to the character .
To see the “ Power Action Mystic Spell Cast ” in action , check out the Super Powers review site done by Cool Toy Review .
Go to the bottom of the page and roll over the photo to see Doctor Fate in action .
MINI -COMICS
The first two waves of Super Powers action figures each came with a mini-comic book starring that particular character .
These comics were 4.5 inches by 2.75 inches , and had 13 pages of story .
Not much information exists about who the writers and artists were for these mini-comics .
Paul Kupperberg ( writer of the full - sized DC Super Powers mini-series from 1985 and 1986 ) had this to say about Kenner ’s Super Powers Collection mini-comics , “ I wrote only one of the Kenner minis , for Steppenwolf ( #13 ) .
Alas , I have no real memory of having done it .
Art looks to be Jose Delbo .
The rest were probably written by the likes of Jack Harris , Rozakis , and the like .
Wish I could remember more about them : do n’t even recall who the project editor was …probably Barry Marx , who worked under Joe Orlando in Special Projects . ”
Special thanks to The Aquaman Shrine for the quote !
Doctor Fate had his own mini-comic in which he battled the brainwashed Superman and Martian Manhunter .
The mini-comics served to introduce the characters to new readers , as well as to promote other action figures in the line .
While both Superman and Martian Manhunter co-starred in Doctor Fate ’s mini-comic , they also had figures of their own in the Super Powers line .
In the same vein , Doctor Fate appeared in the mini-comics of Steppenwolf , Kalibak , Desaad , and the Parademons .
Here is the Doctor Fate Super Powers Collection mini-comic in its entirety :
For more Superman Super Powers coverage , be sure to check out Michael ’s blog today , FORTRESS OF BAILEYTUDE .
For more on Martian Manhunter ’s Super Powers activities , be sure to check out Frank ’s IDOL - HEAD OF DIABOLU blog today .
I remember at the time being very confused by Doctor Fate ’s mini-comic and his appearance in the full - sized 1985 DC Super Powers mini-series .
In both stories , Doctor Fate ( who was from Earth - 2 ) was interacting freely with characters from Earth - 1 .
This made no sense to my youthful continuity - laden brain .
While I knew there were rare crossovers between the two Earths , it would have been worth mentioning if the good Doctor had indeed crossed the multiverse .
The truth behind Doctor Fate ’s presence would become apparent five months later when Crisis on Infinite Earths began to wrap up .
The multiverse was destroyed , leaving one unified Earth in which Doctor Fate coexisted with all the other DC characters .
However , for those five months I was one confused kid .
Doctor Fate also appeared in the Paul Kupperberg written Steppenwolf mini-comic .
I have to say that I found it interesting that the mystical guy is the one who reparied the computer problem .
Unusual .

UNPRODUCED BLUE DEVIL AND SHOCKWAVE SUPER POWERS FIGURES
Many people do n’t realize this , but there were additionally planned , yet unproduced action figures for the Super Powers Collection .
Turns out that Kenner was working on several figures for release after the third wave .
You can read all about it , see presentation artwork , and mock - up figures by clicking here .
Two of the unproduced figures were Blue Devil and Shockwave ( a Blue Devil villain ) .
While we do n’t know when they were hoping to release them , we do know the Shockwave figure got fairly far along in the manufacturing process .
A prototype for the Shockwave figure was found by a collector and can be seen below .
The detail is amazing on this prototype !
Below is a custom mock - up of what Blue Devil ’s Super Powers action figure could have looked like .
Nicely done by Jason Geyer .
It makes me sad these figures never came to be .
They would have been a revered part of my childhood .

Picture the universe as a star - salted blue - black expanse .
Chances are that image came from the Hubble Space Telescope , which has churned out space vistas for nearly 20 years from its orbit above Earth .
This past week the Hubble got the handy - man treatment from astronauts who made a floating house call from the space shuttle Atlantis .
New gyroscopes , fresh batteries , a camera and a computer data unit were installed .
Matching the marvel of Hubble was the treatment it got .
The space crews made repairs never before done in space .
The altitude of 350 miles put the team in a anger zone created by whizzing space junk .
There was no safety net if the shuttle was damaged or a repair mishandled .
It all went smoothly , though with a trace of regret .
The Hubble can now back to work peering into deep space , but there wo n't be another house call .
After a long life and $ 10 billion , the telescope will wind down , its job done in another five to 10 years .
What did the Hubble achieve , besides sending back screen - saver art and magazine cover pictures ?
It was a rigorous scientific tool , measuring the universe 's expansion , the nature of black holes , and the formation of our planetary system .
The telescope encapsulated the challenge of space .
Amid dangers and uncertainties , the Hubble and its human attendants persevered .
Science and human spirit are infinitely better for it .
THAT people , from politicians to priests , cheat and lie is taken for granted by many .
But scientists , surely , are above that sort of thing ?
In the past decade the cases of Hwang Woo - Suk , who falsely reported making human embryonic stem cells by cloning , and Jan Schön , a physicist who claimed astonishing ( and fabricated ) results in the fields of semiconductors and superconductors , have shown that they certainly are not .
However , on these occasions the claims made were so spectacular that they were bound to attract close scrutiny , and thus be exposed eventually .
In the cases of Dr Hwang and ex-Dr Schön , the real question for science was not whether it harbours a few megalomaniac fantasists , but why the frauds were not exposed earlier when the papers that made the claims were being reviewed by peers .
Lower - level fraud , however , is much harder to detect : the data point invented or erased to make a graph look better , or to make a result that was not quite statistically significant into that scientific desideratum , the “ minimum publishable unit ” ; the results “ mined ” retrospectively for interesting correlations , rather than used to test pre-existing hypotheses ; the photograph that has been “ enhanced ” to bring out what the researcher regards as the salient features .
How often this sort of thing happens is hard to say .
But Daniele Fanelli of the University of Edinburgh thought he would try to find out .
His results , published in the Public Library of Science , suggest it is commoner than scientists would like the rest of the world to believe .
Dr Fanelli's own laboratory was the internet .
He hunted down past surveys of scientific honesty and subjected them to what is known as a meta- analysis .
This is a technique that allows the results of entire studies , which may not have used the same methods , to be pooled in a statistically meaningful way .
Dr Fanelli found 18 surveys that met the criteria for his meta - analysis , and a few others that he also included in a general review .
Admissions of outright fraud ( ie , having fabricated , falsified or modified data to improve the outcome at least once during a scientific career ) were low .
According to the meta - analysis , 2 % of researchers questioned were willing to confess to this .
But lower - level fraud was rife .
About 10 % confessed to questionable practices , such as “ dropping data points based on a gut feeling ” or “ failing to present data that contradict one 's previous research ” — though this figure was just a straight average of the underlying studies , since the relevant parts of the underlying studies were too disparate to run through the meta- analysis .
Moreover , when it came to airing suspicions about colleagues , the numbers went up .
The meta - analysis suggested that 14 % of researchers in the underlying studies had seen their colleagues fabricate , falsify , alter or modify data .
If the question was posed in more general terms , such as running experiments with deficient methods , failing to report deficiencies or misrepresenting data , the straight average suggested that 46 % of researchers had seen others get up to such shenanigans .
In only half of the cases , though , had the respondent to a survey tried to do anything about the misconduct he said he had witnessed .
How much this actually matters is moot .
Fabricating data is a heinous scientific sin .
It steers people down paths that do not lead anywhere and discourages them from following those that do .
But cleaning data up has a long tradition .
Robert Millikan , the physicist who first measured the charge on the electron , discarded results that did not match his expectations , yet he won a Nobel prize — because he was right .
The results of Gregor Mendel , the father of modern genetics , are also suspiciously over - accurate by the tenets of modern statistics .
When such practices shade into dishonesty is itself a shady area .
Just as everyone thinks himself a better - than - average driver , these results ( assuming that they are honest ) suggest people are more willing to see sin in others than in themselves .
And that , at least , proves something that is sometimes forgotten .
Scientists are as human as everyone else .
Ever wondered where were the foundation stones of today ’s technology giants laid ?
What were the places where the seeds of some of the biggest technology innovations first germinated ?
No they were not plush offices , but small garages , apartments or hostel rooms where these companies were set up .
These buildings today mirror the journey of a dream .
Network World recently carried a list of 12 holy sites of IT which it termed Tech Meccas because of their significance in the technology world today .
Some of these are birth places of today ’s IT giants while others are centres which exemplify technology prowess that world has attained over the years .
Here ’s over to the technology ’s holy shrines .
367 Addison Ave , Palo Alto , California
The tree - lined residential street near Stanford University leads to a 12 × 18 - foot garage where in 1939 college friends Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard laid the foundation of today ’s largest personal computer manufacturer , Hewlett - Packard .
The garage served as research lab , development workshop and manufacturing facility for the company ’s early products including Model 200A audio oscillator .
In 1940 , HP moved into larger quarters on Page Mill Road .
The garage was dedicated as the Birthplace of Silicon Valley in 1989 , and the property was acquired by HP in 2000 .
The company paid $ 1.7 million for the 3.6 ×5.4 metre garage which William Hewlett had originally rented for $ 45 per month .
In 2007 , the property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places .
2066 Crist Dr , Los Altos , California
Apple Computer Inc was born in the company ’s CEO Steve Jobs ’ parents spare bedroom .
The room was basically a garage attached to his home at 2066 Crist Dr , Los Altos , California .
It was here that Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak , along with Ronald G Wayne joined together to build Apple Computer in 1976 .
The day was incidentally Fool ’s day .
The garage room served as Apple ’s first manufacturing base , with the first 50 Apple 1s built here .
The consignment was sold to Paul Jay Terrell ’s Byte Shop for $ 500 each .
Talking about his initial days at Apple , Jobs reportedly said in an interview “ It was just the two of us , Woz and me .
We were the manufacturing department , the shipping department and everything . ”
232 Santa Margarita Avenue , Menlo Park , California
This is the address where in the year 1998 , Larry Page and Sergey Brin joined hands to build what eventually became the world ’s no .
1 search engine and Internet company , Google .
The company ’s co-founders rented the garage from Susan Wojcicki , who later also became a Google employee .
The duo took the 2,000 square feet , a four - bedroom home , for $ 1,700 a month .
It was than Google hosted its first data center here .
In a news report they said , “ The office offered several big advantages , including a washer and dryer and a hot tub .
It also provided a parking space for the first employee hired by the new company . ”
When Page and Brin first moved into the garage , Google had just been incorporated with a bankroll of $ 1 million raised from a handful of investors .
By 1999 , Google began serving 500,000 queries a day and the company moved from the four walls garage to a mega Googleplex headquarters in Mountain View , California .
In 2006 , Google paid an undisclosed fee for the 177 - square - metre property in Menlo Park , California .
Reports say that it would have cost them US $ 1.3 million .
There are plans that they may utilize the property as a guest house .
Though the garage has not turned a historic site yet , but the place has been attracting quite a number of eyeballs .
CERN , Geneva , Switzerland
This is the one of the hottest hub of scientific research located astride the Franco - Swiss border near Geneva .
Called European Organization for Nuclear Research , CERN , it is one of the world ’s largest and most respected centres for scientific research .
Its business is fundamental physics , finding out what the Universe is made of and how it works .
At CERN , the world ’s largest and most complex scientific instruments are used to study the basic constituents of matter .
By studying what happens when these particles collide , physicists learn about the laws of Nature .
Founded in 1954 , the organisation has twenty European member states .
The place also holds significance as the birthplace of the World Wide Web .
In 1990 , physicist Tim Berners - Lee and systems engineer Robert Cailliau devised the concept of an information system based on hypertext links .
This is where father of Internet Tim Berners - Lee wrote a proposal for information management showing how information could be transferred easily over the Internet by using hypertext .
Bletchley Park , England
Best known as the Winston Churchill ’s secret intelligence and computers headquarters during World War II , Bletchley Park is also the home town of Milton Keynes .
Situated in Buckinghamshire , UK , it is regarded as the site of secret British codebreaking activities during World War II and also the birthplace of the modern computer .
In 1939 during the World War II , cryptologists based at Bletchley Park successfully broke major codes used by German military and high command and those of other Axis countries .
The most famous break - ins were the ciphers generated by the German Enigma and Lorenz machines .
Today , Bletchley Park houses permanent collection of Enigma and other vintage cypher machines and equipment .
It was in Huts 3,6,4 and 8 that the highly effective Enigma decrypt teams worked .
The huts operated in pairs and , for security reasons , were known only by their numbers .
Their raw material came from the ‘ Y’ Stations : a web of wireless intercept stations dotted around Britain and in a number of countries overseas .
These stations listened in to the enemy ’s radio messages and sent them to Bletchley Park to be decoded and analyzed .
Xerox PARC , Palo Alto , California
Another technology Mecca is PARC ( Palo Alto Research Center , Inc ) , popularly known as Xerox PARC , is a research and development company in Palo Alto , California .
Founded in 1970 as a division of Xerox Corporation , PARC is where the first graphical user interface was invented ( for the Xerox Alto ) and the first Ethernet cables were connected .
This is also the place where first laser printer was invented and the first WYSIWYG text editors were rolled out .
Ubiquitous computing also started here .
PARC currently conducts research on biomedical technologies , “ clean technology ” , user interface design , sensemaking , ubiquitous computing , large area electronics and embedded and intelligent systems .
PARC was incorporated as a wholly - owned subsidiary of Xerox in 2002 .
These days the organisation conducts a regular Thursday lecture series open to general public .
Ames Lab , Iowa State University , Iowa
What makes Ames Lab part of the tech ’s holy sites is that this is the place where John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford Berry built the world ’s first electronic digital computer between the years 1937 and 1942 .
The Atanasoff - Berry Computer ( ABC ) was the world ’s first electronic digital computer that gave the world several major innovations including the use of binary arithmetic , regenerative memory , parallel processing , and separation of memory and computing functions .
In the year 1997 , researchers at Ames Lab built a working replica of the ABC , which is now on display in the lobby of Iowa State ’s Durham Center for Computation and Communication .
In 1973 , US Federal Judge declared Atanasoff the inventor of the electronic digital computer following a trial which declared the ENIAC patent of Mauchly and Eckert invalid .
Moore School of Engineering , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia
Regarded as the birthplace of the computer industry , the Moore School is where the first general - purpose digital electronic computer , the ENIAC ( Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer ) , was built between 1943 and 1946 .
ENIAC was capable of being reprogrammed to solve a full range of computing problems .
ENIAC was designed to calculate artillery firing tables for the US Army ’s Ballistic Research Laboratory , but its first use was in calculations for the hydrogen bomb .
Not only this , the place holds special importance as the first computer course was given at the Moore School in Summer 1946 .
Also , Moore School faculty John Mauchly and J Presper Eckert founded the first computer company , ENIAC , which produced the UNIVAC computer .
The 3 - story Moore School has now been integrated into Penn ’s School of Engineering and Applied Science .
IBM ’s Main Plant , Poughkeepsie , New York
Located on the Hudson River Valley , midway between New York City and Albany , this was the first building of IBM in Poughkeepsie , NY called ‘ Main Plant . ’
Constructed in 1948 , many of IBM ’s computers over the years were assembled and rolled out from this facility .
In April 1953 , the most advanced , most flexible high - speed computer in the world called the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine was unveiled at Main Plant .
For next 56 years , many other IBM mainframes were made and rolled out from this centre .
In 1964 , the centre also rolled out IBM ’s first general - purpose mainframe , the System / 360 family .
What made the site more special was that IBM System / 360 Model 75 helped NASA get Apollo astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the moon and back 40 years ago .
Room 2713 , Dobie Hall , University of Texas , Austin
Dobie Center , a privately - owned twenty - seven story residence hall located adjacent to the University of Texas at Austin campus is the birthplace of today ’s second largest PC maker , Dell .
CEO Michael Dell founded the company at this centre in the room No 2713 of Dobie Center .
From here Michael began selling computers via mail in 1984 .
Kirkland House , Havard University
Ever wondered where is the birthplace of the world ’s most popular social networking site Facebook that today boasts of 250 million users .
At third floor of Kirkland House room , Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook with fellow computer science major students and his room mates Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes while he was a student at Harvard University in the year 2004 .
Kirkland House is one of the 12 undergraduate houses at Harvard University , located near the Charles River in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
Lyman Residence Hall , Stanford University , California
Even before Google brothers rented a garage at 232 Santa Margarita Avenue , California , to set out the task of building what is today ’s most powerful internet company , it is said that the duo began working from Larry Page ’s room in Stanford ’s Lyman Residence Hall in 1997 .
It is widely believed that the room also housed Google ’s first server farm .
However , unlike the Menlo Park property , Google has not so far bought the property .
In both cases , the couples had prepared for a medical emergency , creating living wills , advanced directives and power - of - attorney documents .
As recounted by Ms. Langbehn , the details of the Miami episode are harrowing .
It began in February 2007 , when the family  including three children , then ages 9 , 11 and 13  traveled there for a cruise .
After boarding the ship , Ms. Pond collapsed while taking pictures of the children playing basketball .
The children managed to help her back to the family ’s room .
Fortunately , the ship was still docked , and an ambulance took Ms. Pond to the Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial .
Ms. Langbehn and the children followed in a taxi , arriving around 3:30 p.m .
Ms. Langbehn says that a hospital social worker informed her that she was in an “ antigay city and state ” and that she would need a health care proxy to get information .
( The worker denies having made the statement , Mr. Alonso said . )
As the social worker turned to leave , Ms. Langbehn stopped him .
“ I said : ‘ Wait a minute .
I have those health care proxies , ’ ” she said .
She called a friend to fax the papers .
The medical chart shows that the documents arrived around 4:15 p.m. , but nobody immediately spoke to Ms. Langbehn about Ms. Pond ’s condition .
During her eight - hour stay in the trauma unit waiting room , Ms. Langbehn says , she had two brief encounters with doctors .
Around 5:20 a doctor sought her consent for a “ brain monitor ” but offered no update about the patient ’s condition .
Around 6:20 , two doctors told her there was no hope for a recovery .
Despite repeated requests to see her partner , Ms. Langbehn says she was given just one five - minute visit , when a priest administered last rites .
She says she continued to plead with a hospital worker that the children be allowed to see their mother , even showing the children ’s birth certificates .
“ I said to the receptionist , ‘ Look , they ’re her kids , ’ ” Ms. Langbehn said .
( Mr. Alonso , the hospital spokesman , says that except in special circumstances , children under 14 are not allowed to visit in the trauma unit . )
According to a survey by the American Dietetic Association ( ADA ) , the majority of working people eat lunch ( 67 % ) and snack ( 61 % ) at their desks and over one - third eat breakfast there .
So , we know now most of us have a habit of munching something after every few hours ( workplace snacking habit ) and specially when stressed , under pressure , or bored .
And do n't even realize the amount of intake but can go for something or anything within reach .
If what we are munching is unhealthy and full of calories like chips , cookies , chocolates , pizzas , pastries leads to a lot of fat gain .
Avoiding snacks is not the answer as snacking helps you in overeating at meals and also in keeping up your energy levels .
I take my own lunch still the craving is there .
I am able to resist it in first half but around 4 or 5 , I am starving .
As I am one of those and I just can't change this habit , I opted for something which is healthy and nutritious like fruits or low carb biscuits .
I buy a stock of fruits and bring 1 - 2 each day or on weekends I make some low calorie cookies or biscuits which will be enough for a week .
If you are working and love baking , you can easily make these for you and store in air tight containers .
Trick is to eat with a full glass of water to feel more fuller faster and not coffee or tea .
Munch away your office hours with these low fat , low calorie whole wheat biscuits .

The " General Welfare " Clause by JOHN W. BUGLER
Revised : December 2013 ;
( Original paper : September 1994 ) We Americans find ourselves faced with the disquieting specter of a national debt measured in trillions of dollars : a sum truly inconceivable .
Many economists and politicians tell us this debt portends a disastrous financial collapse in the future and we worry .
Once debt free , we are now the largest debtor nation in the world and as we find ourselves on the precipice we are confounded as to how we got there .
For answers , however , we need look no further than the farewell address of our first President , George Washington , who , in reference to our constitution , warned , " Let there be no change [ in the Constitution ] by usurpation .
For though this , in one instance may be the instrument of good , it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed .
The precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield . "
Change in the constitution by usurpation ?
When did that happen ?
It happened in 1937 !
Few americans realize that up until 1937 the Congress of the United States conducted its business within the boundaries of seventeen enumerated powers granted under Article I Section 8 of the United States Constitution , [ See Appendix I , below ] these powers defined clearly the areas of national purposes over which Congress could enact legislation including the allocation of funds and levying of taxes .
Anything not set down in the enumerated powers was considered outside the purview of the national government and hence , a matter for the states .
There were occasional challenges to the concept but it was not until Franklin Roosevelt 's new deal that it was attacked in deadly earnestness .
Ill winds prevailed against the Constitution in the 1930'S .
The country was in the depression and Franklin D. Roosevelt asked for extraordinary " powers similar to those necessary in time of war , " to meet the emergency .
Poorly crafted legislation , some of it not printed in time for floor vote were rammed through a docile and Compliant 73rd Congress .
Everything he asked for was given , with little or no debate .
The first of the new deal statutes to reach the Supreme Court for review , arrived in January 1935 .
in the sixteen months following , The court decided ten major cases or groups of cases involving new deal statutes .
In eight instances out of ten the decisions went in favor of the United States Constitution and against the new deal .
Eight of the ten pieces of " must legislation " were found to be unconstitutional .
The President reacted as one would after having received a kick in a sensitive area .
He went to the american people with a fireside chat on March 9 , 1937 , and stated : " we have therefore , reached the point as a nation where we must take action to save the Constitution from the Court and the Court from itself . "
The President declared war on the Supreme Court .
To appreciate the depth of FDR 's resolve in such issues , one need only read his correspondence to representative Snyder of Pennsylvania asking Congress to pass the national bituminous coal conservation act regardless of any doubts , " however reasonable , " that it might have about the bill 's Constitutionality .
It appeared in this case at least , the President was urging Congress to disregard the Constitution .
" In November 1936 the Democratic Party won an overwhelming victory at the polls .
The election confirmed the Roosevelt administration in power and inspired the President to attempt a reorganization of the Judiciary in order to win control of that last remaining outpost of conservative Constitutionalism , the United States Supreme Court . "
Constitutional historians refer to what happened next as the " Revolution of 1937 . "
The President proposed that for each sitting justice over the age of seventy there be appointed one new Justice to " help them with their case load . "
In reality FDR wanted to pack the court with six additional justices willing to declare all of his " must legislation " Constitutional .
Chief Justice Hughes was traumatized .
He looked for a way to disengage the Presidents plan which appeared almost certain to pass both houses and be signed into law .
What to do ?
What was about to happen would ultimately lead our country to the clear and present danger of economic insolvency .
One observer noted , " Hughes was profoundly convinced that what was at stake in the crises precipitated by the [ Presidents ] court plan was nothing less than the fate of the Supreme Court 's historic role as guardian of the Constitution . "
He went on to state that what happened next was a " decision to retreat in the immediate skirmish in order to insure victory in the larger , struggle for judicial supremacy . "
The supreme court at the time consisted of four conservatives , three liberals , one moderate , and one swing .
The liberals were ; Stone , Cardozo and Brandeis .
The conservatives were : McReynolds , Sutherland , Butler , and Van Deventer .
The moderate was Hughes .
The swing was Roberts .
Hughes prevailed on Roberts to desert the Conservative camp , swing over with him and join the three liberals in declaring the social security cases Constitutional .
[ Steward Machine Co. v. Davis ( 301 us 548 , May 24 , 1937 ) ]
By doing so , Roberts took the wind from the sails of Roosevelt 's plan to " pack " the Supreme Court .
The court - packing plan then went back to committee and died .
One administration official dubbed the court 's action , " the switch in time that saved nine . "
This decision said in effect , Congress would no longer be held to enumerated powers but instead could tax and spend for anything ; so long as it was for " general welfare . "
However , the words " General Welfare " in the introduction to the enumerated powers of Article I Section 8 were never intended to be an object for extension of the power to tax and spend .
The supreme court surrendered to the new deal on the most fundamental of constitutional issues .
" it is scarcely conceivable that Chief Justice Hughes and Justice Roberts ... were unaware of the political implications of their move .
the President had lost a battle but won a war .
In a remarkable series of decisions . .. the Court executed the most abrupt change of face in its entire history ... " - Justice Roberts , writing in 1951 , said in effect : " We voted against the Constitution to save the Court . "
His exact words were : Looking back it is difficult to see how the Court could have resisted the popular urge ... an insistence by the Court on holding Federal power to what seemed its appropriate orbit when the Constitution was adopted might have resulted in even more radical changes to our dual structure than those which have gradually accomplished through the extension of limited jurisdiction conferred on the federal government .
His statement " limited jurisdiction " - " conferred on the federal government " is understandable only when one considers that very few " extensions " of " limited jurisdiction " had been executed by Congress from the time of the great retreat decisions , [ 1937 ]
Up to the year 1951 .
( The year Roberts book was published ) Nothing much happened immediately after these decisions because of WW II ; then post war reconstruction with a strong conservative Republican leadership under Bob Taft and a coalition of conservative democrats ; then Korea ; then the Eisenhower years ; then Kennedy [ who basically was a fiscal conservative ] ; then Dallas ; then Lyndon B. Johnson and the Great Society , [ 1965 ] the arrival of which signaled the commencement of the full implementation of " Stewart Machine Co. v. Davis " -- 1937 .
Until this time , the American people 's demands on government were modest and for the most part the government lived within its means .
But LBJ and his cohorts , both Democrat and moderate Republican , said in effect , " damn the enumerated powers , full speed ahead . "
Something for everyone : spend now , pay later .
As time went on elected representatives in washington found it virtually impossible to say no to constituent demands .
Many of the demands were for good things .
[ It seemed so , if someone else paid the bill . ]
Most if not all of these things are best left to the states , regional authorities , voluntary agencies and , yes , families .
[ In terms of sheer economic efficiency , nothing in all of history ever equalled the family .
Whatever happened to them ? ]
Fifty legislative debates on the merits and uses of taxpayers dollars for local purposes is very healthy .
Our founding fathers believed in the idea and we practiced it , almost perfectly until 1965 .
This gave great power and strength to our country .
People retained more than 80 % of their wages , whereas today they are left with less than 50 % and many of us find ourselves reduced to asking the general government for this or that .
" Give me , give me , give me . "

Approaching five trillion dollars ( when this paper was first written in 1994 ; now over fifteen trillion dollars ! )
How did this happen ?
A " General Welfare Congress " [ session after session ] made this happen .
With no limits on their taxing and spending power , they became like children in a candy store .
Study the national debt and mandatory program curves ; following full implementation of the " Great Society , " both trends begin to rise exponentially !
The two national parties must share blame for the enormous catastrophe befalling our country and its posterity .
It 's really a " Catch 22 " .
You want to serve your country .
To serve your country you must be in power [ in Congress ] .
To be in power you must be re-elected .
To be re-elected you must out promise your opponent .
To out promise your opponent you must promise to spend for the " General Welfare . "
And it will go on and on and on , forever , until one of three things happen :
We adopt good moral sense and courage and say no to the inordinate demands of our constituents and the special interest groups .
Our nation suffers an inevitable economic collapse and / or a total loss of freedom due to excessive taxation and national debt .
A Constitutional Amendment makes it clear that the phrase " the Common Defense and the General Welfare " in Article I Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution is NOT a grant of power , but merely introductions to the enumerated powers concerning the common defense and the general welfare .
We shall examine these three possible solutions , one by one .
Adopt good moral sense and courage and say no to the inordinate demands of our constituents and the special interest groups .
Unfortunately , this is highly unlikeyly .
Congress prefers to possess the power to buy the allegiance of their constituents by providing for their " general welfare . "
It is a payoff from organized government and " we the people " have been led to believe someone else will pay for it down the line .
i.e. our children .
Look at the behavior of the " new Congress " .
Farm district Representatnes wo n't give back on subsidies .
Inner city Representatnes wo n't give back on aid to teenage mothers .
Defense industry Representatnes wo n't give back on defense spending .
The cotton and tobacco representatnes wo n't give back on their subsidies .
Good americans all .
Some are signers of the contract for america .
But they wo n't give back a dime .
They love the power .
We need a Constitutional Amendment clearly defining just what they can tax and spend for .
[ Governments control people -- constitutions control governments ] and if we the people want them to keep all the power they now have , then so be it .
we can join together , singing , " we do n't have to live in the future , our children do .
We want ours and we want it now . "
Our nation suffers an economic collapse and / or a total loss of freedom due to excessive taxation and national debt .
This is why a proposed balanced - budget amendment is a danger .
Congress will balance the budget on the backs of the american workers and entrepreneurs .
Congress will not resist unlimited spending power .
Why ?
Because it feels too good and they are spending other peoples money .
Your money and my money .
It 's painless when it 's not your money .
Even with a balanced - budget amendment , the nation as we know it today , will continue the ongoing surrender of individual and economic liberty to a form of government that can best be described as legislative despotism .
Our elected Representatives ( or the several state legislatures ) propose a Constitutional Amendment , which states that :
The phrase " the Common Defense and the General Welfare " in Article I Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution are not grants of power but merely introductions to the enumerated powers concerning the common defense and the general welfare .
That all powers seized and accrued to the federal government since the " revolution of 1937 " be submitted to the several states as part of this amendment and they as a whole shall vote up and down as to whether or not these seized powers should be returned to their rightful owners , i.e. the states or the people , or be added to the enumerations presently extant in Article I Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution .
And that all future additions to those enumerated powers for taxing and spending found in Article I Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution be done as the founding fathers provided , by Amendment to the Constitution .
In his farewell address , George Washington , speaking about our dual federal system , stated : " the spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers ... in one , and thus to create ? , . . . a real despotism . *
He went on to warn :
Let there be no change in the constitution by usurpation ; for though this , in one instance , may be the instrument of good , it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed .
Presently our ship of state is aground on the shoals of uncertain centralism .
At this very moment a great storm - and high tide of optimism have begun to shake her free ; but any freedom will be short lived without an amendment enunciating clearly what the founding fathers intended :
The General Welfare clause in Article I Section 8 is an introduction to the enumerated powers that follow and not itself a grant of power .
CLOSING
The limits on federal power to legislate for the " general welfare " remains , to this date , undefined and presumably , boundless
The question that begs an answer is , " if the framers of our Constitution , who labored so resolutely in Philadelphia that torridly hot summer in 1787 intended the powers of Congress to have no boundaries , why did they bother to enumerate seventeen ? "
James Madison , when asked if the " general welfare " clause was a grant of power , replied in 1792 , in a letter to Henry Lee , If not only the means but the objects are unlimited , the parchment [ the Constitution ] should be thrown into the fire at once .

I can see the online spoof now :
The Oregonian 's personal finance columnist today recommended people enduring pay cuts replace that income by issuing their own zero - coupon , high - yield performance bonds .
" With interest rates near zero on savings accounts , investors are chasing yields like creditors chasing Bernie Madoff , " Brent Hunsberger wrote .
" What better time to offer your own , new financial instrument to the beleaguered bond market .
Besides , who really knows what zero - coupon means ?
The word ' coupon ' alone will lure cost - conscious , gullible investors . "
No , this is serious stuff .
Painful , too ; I know .
Even as I write , I stare at a paycheck with a " deposit amount " I wish was erroneous .
" Debited deposit amount " would be more accurate .
I hope these are options you might have overlooked , strategies you should reconsider or ways of looking at cuts that make them more palatable .
First , it 's obvious , but if you have n't started tracking what you spend , you need to start .
Now .
Otherwise , you wo n't know what you can cut , and none of this stuff will work .
Create spending goals or plans and stick to them .
Boost withholdings :
If you took a 10 percent pay cut , you can likely increase your withholding allowances on your W - 4 form to generate more cash flow -- even if it results in only $ 10 more a week .
If you wait for that money to come as a tax refund , you 're essentially giving Uncle Sam an interest - free loan .
The Treasury needs all the help it can get , but you need cash flow .
If you claim too many allowances ( underwithhold ) , you can adjust later or send in an estimated tax payment if necessary just to " catch up , " said Joseph Anthony , a tax consultant in Portland .
But be careful .
" What I always warn people about is that if they significantly underwithhold , then come April 15 they may be owing not just taxes but also interest on underpayments of taxes due , " Anthony said .
Fill out a mock tax form for 2009 to figure out what kind of refund you might get .
That 'll help you safely estimate allowances .

Call your insurance agent : Revisit your policies .

If you have emergency savings built up , you can probably risk raising your deductibles .
If your car is n't worth much , you might drop your comprehensive coverage , which is n't required by state law .
If you 're driving a vehicle fewer than 7,500 miles a year , you could get a lower rate .
And you can also get rebates for consolidating policies with one carrier .
" Sometimes all it takes is a phone call , " said Brian Hicks , a financial adviser at McDonald Franceschi LLC in Portland .
" They ( agents ) know people are out there shopping , and they 're sensitive to it and the last thing they want to do is lose your business . "
Negotiate bills , contest fees :
As with insurance agents , your phone , TV and Internet providers do n't want to lose customers .
Use that to your advantage .
Ask how you can reduce your bill .
Question even medical bills .
Be persistent .
Tell them your other offers .
You wo n't know unless you ask .
Refinance :
At today 's rates , even lowering your existing mortgage by one percentage point could shave a couple of hundred or more off your mortgage payment .
That can help make up for quite a chunk of your pay cut , and there might be some tax advantages , too .
Check with a CPA or financial adviser .
Move :
Many people 's homes are underwater .
But for those whose are n't , there are good deals right now -- not all of them short sales or foreclosures .
If you 've been in your home awhile , moving to a cheaper neighborhood or community might give you more breathing room .
Be nice in new ways : " I have clients who live in a resort area , " explained Marilyn R. Bergen , a financial planner with CMC Advisers in Portland .
" They traditionally have lots of friends and relatives come to stay with them .
It becomes outrageous when they look at increased food costs and alcohol . "
So , this year , they 're telling friends and relatives they 're not accepting company .
Instead , host low - key , bring - your - own - drinks potlucks , she said .
Good friends will understand , and you 'll still socialize .
Institute a personal spending allowance :
Buy all your clothes , coffee and movie tickets out of one monthly pot of cash split evenly between you and your partner .
Set a time limit on cutbacks and allowances :
You 're not going to buy used clothes or skip lattes forever -- just the next 12 months .
" The time frame thing is a helpful piece for people really struggling to cut back , " Bergen said .
" It 's , 'OK I do n't have to do this for the rest of my life .
In 12 months I can re-evaluate . ' "
Do n't cut out all fun : " I have seen clients clamp down very tightly on expenses only to then feel so constrained or discouraged that they give up on the entire effort , " said Derek R. Lenington , a financial planner in Portland .
" Make sure there is something to look forward to at least monthly . "
Know what to buy used : Goods you should never pay full retail price for , according to two marketers : Clothes , housewares , books , CDs & DVDs , electronics and shoes .

Employers , workers creatively cope
By Brent Hunsberger , The Oregonian
Sunday May 17 , 2009 , 8:00 AM
Cliff Conley was only half - joking in an e-mail last week about how he is dealing with his one - day - a - week , unpaid furlough .
" I have eliminated every possible convenience or pleasure in my life , " the maintenance mechanic wrote .
" I simply exist . "
" I now only eat two meals a day , " he added .
" On the upside , I am losing weight . "
He is , of course , not alone .
Workers and business owners of all walks of life are coping with pay cuts and furloughs like never before .
These cutbacks have happened at major local employers : Daimler Trucks North America , the Port of Portland , The Greenbrier Cos. , Tektronix , Oregon Health & Science University and the state of Oregon .
They are the nasty byproduct of deflation , dysfunctional markets and the massive deleveraging of our economy .
Conley , unfortunately , is used to it .
Working in manufacturing over the past decade , he estimates his annual earnings have fallen $ 20,000 .
He 's racked up an estimated $ 30,000 in credit card debt , partly due to paying his wife 's health bills from her battle with cancer .
He is now making only minimum payments on the cards .
He has drastically reduced his rounds of golf , set his thermostat to 65 degrees and brought scrap wood home from work to burn in the fireplace .
He takes on remodeling projects even though his 62 - year - old body protests .
The Conleys have cut out weekend pleasure drives and weekly trips to the movies .
He has canceled dental appointments for crowns and fillings .
His oldest daughter lost her full - time job and recently moved into his three - bedroom home with her 1 - year - old .
In his 1994 Toyota pickup , " I coast whenever I can to save gas , " he said , adding , " You 'd be surprised how far you can coast . "
The pay cuts , some of them unforeseen , have forced workers young and old to get creative in lowering costs and replacing income .
Becca Smith - Morgan , 30 , closed her Pearl District gift shop cheeky b in March after December 's winter storm fell like an avalanche on her make - or - break Christmas season .
More than half her household income is now gone .
She is living off savings and her husband 's food service job at Reed College while looking for work and helping a friend with a business idea .
" I did n't second - guess a shopping trip to Nordstrom 's , " she said of her shop - owning life .
" I did n't second - guess going to a bar and buying my friends drinks . "
Now , she has stopped buying new clothes .
If she does go out , " It 's not on me . "
She favors potlucks or in - home " happy hours " with a couple or two .
" Right now we 're less likely to offer having a hosted dinner party , " said Smith - Morgan .
" We 're not in a position to invite over six of our friends and have a nice fancy dinner . "
She is not concerned about the implications .
" My friends know I 'm cheap . "
She is considering canceling their dental insurance to save $ 53.96 a month .
She is cashing in gift cards from people who did n't know what else to get a gift - shop owner .
She earned $ 900 last month clearing out her basement and selling the items on Craigslist .
Now family members want her to do the same for them .
" For sure , I 'm going to take a cut , " she said .
Larry Shrake is in worse shape .
His Choose & Chew vending - machine - stocking business has fallen by more than half .
His girlfriend , a secretary at a warehouse , had her hours cut , too .
And he lost thousands on a buy - and - flip home remodeling project that tanked with the housing market slump .
He stopped paying his mortgage in October .
He is now helping to sell life insurance and debt reduction services for Primerica Financial Services to bring in more money .
" You got to go ahead and do something , " Shrake said .
" And I do n't want to go ahead and sell Avon . "
For his part , Conley does n't sound panicked or bitter .
He is more accustomed to simply being laid off in downturns , so he is grateful his employer , a glass manufacturer , has imposed less - drastic cuts .
Still , he is not sure how much more he can cut back , unless he downsizes and moves from his Southeast Portland home of 30 years .
" The American dream has kind of gone away for us , " Conley said .
" We 've seen a real erosion in our quality of life . "

Global GDP has grown steadily and continuously since WWII , in step with a growing global population and primary energy consumption ( see below ) .
Oil shocks have caused recessions compensated by higher energy prices that have bolstered global GDP at time of recession in the non-energy economy .
A number of recent posts on The Oil Drum have explored the relationship between energy and the economy .
Francois Cellier provided an overview of links between energy consumption and GDP on a per capita basis .
This post will expand on the work of Francois taking a somewhat different approach .
In a guest post , Ian Schindler provided an overview of the Ayres - Warr model of economic production which I found easier to read and understand than the original Ayres - Warr paper .
Ian made some valuable points about the role of energy efficiency in promoting higher energy prices and higher energy production .
David Murphy looked at the relationship between oil prices and rates of oil price change in relation to US GDP and growth whilst drawing attention to the view that the current recession was in part caused by high oil prices .
In this post I want to explore further links between energy consumption , GDP and energy prices .
But first a quick note on data limitations .
GDP data are taken from the US Department of Agriculture who provide historic data for all countries dating from 1969 based in 2005 $ US ( table titled : GDP Shares by Country and Region Historical ) .
Energy data and prices are taken from the 2009 BP statistical review of world energy .
Primary energy consumption = coal+oil + natural gas+nuclear+hydro , all re-based in millions of tonnes oil equivalent ( mmtoe ) .
A $ value is attached to total primary energy consumption using the historic oil price data provided by BP which are based in 2009 $ US .
Clearly coal , natural gas and other energy sources should not be priced as if they were oil so this is a gross simplification .
It would be a major task to provide true energy costs since there are huge regional variations in the price of coal and natural gas .
Using the oil price provides an approximation that likely over estimates the real price .
Furthermore , using raw energy prices does not provide the full cost of energy to society since much of the energy consumed is processed and costs society significantly more ; for example gasoline and electricity , and this will lead to an under estimation of real costs .
These two major sources of error will therefore to a degree cancel each other and this imperfect exercise does I believe provide some interesting trends that are useful in conceptualising the role of energy in the global economy .
Energy consumption and GDP
Figure 1 shows how global GDP has marched upwards since 1969 in lock step with global energy consumption .
This trend also correlates with growing global population and in simple terms global economic activity has grown with growing population , a larger percentage of the global population participating in economic activity and all of this requires a growing amount of energy use .
Figure 1 Correlation between global GDP and primary energy consumption in millions tonnes oil equivalent ( mmtoe ) .
Primary energy = coal+oil+gas+nuclear+hydro ; data from the 2009 BP statistical review of world energy .
Global GDP data from the USDA , " GDP Shares by Country and Region Historical " .
FRoEI = Financial return on Energy Invested ( see below for further explanation ) .
Click charts to enlarge .
The trend is not linear owing to two factors :
1 Energy efficiency gains
2 Phantom GDP ( which is discussed below )
The energy - GDP trends for individual countries ( Figure 2 ) are also affected by the energy embedded in imported / exported manufactured goods .
The apparent growth in GDP / TOE from $ 3199 in 1969 to $ 4393 in 2008 may be attributed to efficiency gains and phantom GDP .
Energy - GDP national trends
The simple picture of looking at energy and GDP on a global scale ( Figure 1 ) masks significant complexity at national scales .
The GDP - energy trends are plotted for a number of key countries and federations in Figure 2 which shows vast disparities between countries .
For example , China appears to be using over 4 times the amount of energy as Japan to produce similar GDP .
Figure 2 GDP - energy trajectories for key countries and federations .
Europe = 25 countries making up W and E Europe , some small countries excluded .
Data sources as before .
The trends are influenced by population size and demographics ; the type of economy ; trade balances ; endowments of natural resources including food production ; the % of population involved in economic activity ; climate ; global power position etc .
Indutrialising China is on an energy intense trajectory whilst the " post - industrial " mature economies of Europe and the USA appear to be on energy efficient trajectories .
This , however , is oversimplified .
The flattening of the European and US trends introduces the possibility that GDP may be generated without increasing energy use .
To an extent energy efficiency may allow this to happen ( Figure 3 ) .
However , the mature economies benefit from generating GDP from imported goods , which has also caused growth in unsustainable trade imbalances ( Figure 3 ) .
The energy embedded in these goods should rightly be added to the importing countries and deducted from the exporting countries to present a true picture .
This is averaged out in the global view .
The mature economies also benefit from phantom GDP which is described below .
Figure 3 GDP - energy trend for Europe illustrating conceptually how the trend may flatten by the action of energy efficiency , energy embedded in imported goods and from phantom GDP .
Phantom GDP
Phantom GDP as the name implies does not actually exist .
It is generated from trading the assets of other countries ; trading financial instruments that have no intrinsic value ; unmetered inflation ; trading on artificial asset values generated from unregulated and unsustainable fractional banking ; and GDP generated from unsustainable levels of unsecured debt etc .
Phantom GDP may lead to real GDP since the profits produced may be used to purchase goods and services .
Energy cost and GDP
With global GDP , energy consumption and energy price data available , it is worthwhile trying to combine these to further explore the relationship between GDP and energy .
The significant limitations of this exercise are discussed above , but the data trends produced are I believe worthy of consideration .
A $US value has been attached to primary energy consumption by multiplying total primary energy in mmtoe by the annual average oil price ( WTI ) .
This sum was then deducted from total GDP to produce an estimate for global non-energy GDP and the result is plotted in Figure 4 .
Figure 4
The fractional energy cost of GDP .
Global GDP data from the USDA .
Primary energy data and energy prices from the BP statistical reveiw of world energy 2009 .
Whilst global GDP has shown near linear growth since 1969 , the negative impact of high energy prices on the non-energy economy is clearly shown for the three oil shocks ( 1973 , 1979 and 2008 ) .
This exercise also affords the opportunity to plot the ratio of total GDP over total energy cost which I have called the Financial Return on Energy Invested ( FRoEI ) ( Figure 5 ) .
Figure 5 FRoEI estimate for global primary energy consumption , 1969 to 2008 .
One thing that struck me from doing this was that the FRoEI figures are of similar magnitude and range to ERoEI data .
The second oil shock of 1979 caused FRoEI to fall from 10 to 5 and a major recession followed .
Since then , FRoEI grew rather steadily to 1998 where values over 30 were once again attained .
Since then the ratio has declined registering a fall from 8 in 2007 to 6 in 2008 .
The future
As others have pointed out , energy costs and the oil price are limited by the size of the global economy .
For example Francois pointed out that $ 590 / bbl was the theoretical upper limit for the price of oil and that the practical limit was more likely less than $ 200 / bbl .
The average oil price in 2008 was $ 97 / bbl .
Figure 4 shows empirically how rising energy prices flatten growth in the non-energy economy until eventually a negative growth situation is reached .
It is tempting therefore to believe that around $ 100 / bbl may the upper limit for the current configuration of the global economy since energy costs higher than this will push the non-energy part of the economy into recession ( Figure 4 ) which has a corrective influence on energy demand and price .
Price volatility affords the opportunity for brief excursions over $ 100 .
A crucial question that follows from this is what energy supplies ( fossil and other fuels ) can be accessed for $ 100 / bbl ?
With reports that finding and development costs for oil are running close to $ 80 per barrel , it seems that we are approaching the point where new fossil fuel supplies may be too expensive for our economies to bear .
I am intrigued by the fact that ERoEI and FRoEI values lower than 7 may represent threshold values for industrial civilistation .
We are not yet at the point of peak fossil fuel supply though we are likely close to peak oil supply and since oil is the most convenient of the fossil fuels to use this is likely to exert a destabalising influence .
When fossil fuel supplies do begin to fall , the only way that GDP can genuinely grow is through energy efficiency .
As Ian Schindler pointed out , energy efficiency will facilitate higher energy prices and thus energy efficiency will promote higher GDP / mmtoe , higher mmtoe produced and higher prices .
This may enable the global population and economy to grow beyond the date of peak fossil fuel supplies for a while at least ?
Herein lies one of the greatest paradoxes and threats to the human race .
Improving energy efficiency is arguably a major part of our salvation from fossil fuel energy decline but this will merely allow population to grow to higher unsustainable levels .
In arguing for energy efficiency measures one must therefore also argue for measures to ration energy use and population management .
What chance in a world obsessed with extending life expectancy , reducing mortality rates and averse to birth control ?

Good news from the BinNavi front .
For one , our GDB Agent which connects BinNavi with arbitrary GDB servers is now working on Linux .
Since that was the last part of BinNavi which had to be used from Windows , all parts of BinNavi are now usable from Linux .
Even cooler news is that we have made the Cisco router emulator Dynamips work with the GDB Agent .
It is now possible for users of BinNavi to use the GDB server of Cisco devices emulated on Dynamips .
This has a wide range of applications for situations where people had to work with physical devices in the past even though Dynamips would have been sufficient .
Out of the box , the GDB server of Cisco devices is not emulated properly by Dynamips .
There were two issues that had to be fixed in the Dynamips code :
Once the GDB server was active , the console of the Cisco device froze and GDB would neither send nor accept commands
The single - step flag was not honored by the emulator , making single - stepping impossible
I have created a patch that solves these two issues .
You can download the patch file here .
Once this patch is applied to the Dynamips source code , the GDB server of the Cisco 2600 router I used for testing works like a charm and BinNavi can use the GDB server for debugging the emulated device .
Here are some impressions of BinNavi debugging the emulated Cisco 2600 router .
The first screenshot was taken shortly after attaching to the GDB server .
You can see the " trap " instruction at offset 0x8021CCAC .
When you attach to the GDB server for the first time , this is where the debugger halts .
Then I single - stepped a few times to leave the function in the first screenshot .
The second screenshot shows another smaller function where you end up after leaving the first function .
The third screenshot shows a bigger function .
In this function I told BinNavi to record all basic blocks which are ever executed and then I resumed the debugger .
The result can be seen in the Trace log in the lower part of the window .
The address of each basic block hit during execution is shown there in the order in which the basic blocks were hit .
Double - clicking on the trace selects all basic blocks that were hit in the graph .
This makes it very easy to get a quick code coverage analysis to see what basic blocks were executed and those that were not .
In response to " Is this XP user a thief or a customer ? "
Bill wrote with his own frustrating problem with Microsoft .
" My company buys 10 Office Enterprise licenses at a time .
And the remote staff are responsible for installing the software , " he wrote from his home office .
" The main office sent me Office Enterprise 2007 , so I could upgrade from Office XP 2000 . "
He dutifully followed the installation instructions , and -- as instructed -- saved his personal preferences and files to a PST file .
Then he uninstalled the old version of Office 2000 and installed his new Office 2007 Enterprise Edition .
" After I rebooted , " he explains , " I opened Outlook to set it up and check that my addresses and files were intact .
I was asked to verify my copy by Internet .
Imagine my surprise when the program refused to run and asked me to call for a new product key . "
[ Previously on Gripe Line , a Microsoft customer went through a similar ordeal : " Is this XP user a thief or a customer ? " | Frustrated by your tech support ?
You 're not alone .
Get answers in InfoWorld 's Gripe Line newsletter . ]
He phoned technical support to do just that .
And that 's where his troubles began .
" I was told I had an invalid copy of Office 2007 , " he says , " and was refused a product key . "
This was an automated response , so Bill asked to speak to a human representative .
" She told me that the copy had been used too many times .
So I checked with the home office .
They do keep track of such things !
They said only six of the ten copies they purchased had been used . "
Bill was unable to access his e-mail or any of the files stored in that PST file , which left him unable to accomplish much of anything .
" I decided to buy a new copy of Office -- out of my own pocket -- because I am not earning any money while Microsoft fiddles around figuring this out .
I bought a boxed copy of Microsoft Office Standard 2007 . "
This was aggravatingly expensive .
But it should 've fixed it , right ?
" After installation , " says Bill , " the program looked for a previous PST file and attempted to load it .
The new program announced that the old PST file was too large and refused to allow Outlook to start !
I renamed the old file and tried again , but the damage is already done .
It will not allow it . "
Desperate now , Bill called Microsoft support for help again .
" Someone in India informed me that it will cost $ 137 for help getting my four - hour - old Office suite to work . "
Bill was frustrated , angry , and wishing he could swear never again to buy another Microsoft product .
" But , of course , like every other corporate user , I am stuck in a Microsoft universe for now . "
Bill asked the Gripe Line to intervene .
Could I help him get back to work with no more outlay of his personal cash ?
" So far , I am out about $ 300 for an unusable product and I 'm losing money by the minute in my inability to access necessary records . "
I tried .
I forwarded Bill 's letter to Microsoft a couple of weeks ago .
And after a bit of back and forth and the involvement of several people at the software company and its PR firm , I finally got a response this morning :
" No comment . "
Ouch !
That is harsh .
Any of you have ideas for Bill ?
Got gripes ?

Harry Potter fans wanting to illicitly download movies such as ' Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince ' are being advised to wait until the movie is released .
Cybercriminals are reportedly targeting popular peer - to - peer ( P2P ) networks in order to take advantage of fans wanting to download the movie in advance of its screening .
When a user comes across optimized , illegitimate links to download the movie , they are baited by offers to watch Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince online for " free . "
When the user clicks the link , they are redirected to an online blog post containing images from the movie .
Streamviewer : Trojan in Disguise
Here 's where you need to pay attention :
Clicking on any one of those links redirects the user to an illegitimate site where they are prompted to download and install " streamviewer " to view a sneak peek of the film .
Streamviewer is actually a " malware Trojan / dropper file " which , once installed on a machine , proceeds to install malware ( spyware ) onto the users ' computer .

Executives of three of the nation ’s largest health insurers told federal lawmakers in Washington on Tuesday that they would continue canceling medical coverage for some sick policyholders , despite withering criticism from Republican and Democratic members of Congress who decried the practice as unfair and abusive .
The hearing on the controversial action known as rescission , which has left thousands of Americans burdened with costly medical bills despite paying insurance premiums , began a day after President Obama outlined his proposals for revamping the nation ’s healthcare system .
An investigation by the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations showed that health insurers WellPoint Inc. , UnitedHealth Group and Assurant Inc. canceled the coverage of more than 20,000 people , allowing the companies to avoid paying more than $ 300 million in medical claims over a five - year period .
It also found that policyholders with breast cancer , lymphoma and more than 1,000 other conditions were targeted for rescission and that employees were praised in performance reviews for terminating the policies of customers with expensive illnesses .

“ No one can defend , and I certainly cannot defend , the practice of canceling coverage after the fact , ” said Rep. Michael C. Burgess ( R - Tex . ) , a member of the committee .
“ There is no acceptable minimum to denying coverage after the fact . ”
The executives -- Richard A. Collins , chief executive of UnitedHealth ’s Golden Rule Insurance Co. ; Don Hamm , chief executive of Assurant Health and Brian Sassi , president of consumer business for WellPoint Inc. , parent of Blue Cross of California -- were courteous and matter - of - fact in their testimony .
But they would not commit to limiting rescissions to only policyholders who intentionally lie or commit fraud to obtain coverage , a refusal that met with dismay from legislators on both sides of the political aisle .
Experts said it could undermine the industry ’s efforts to influence healthcare - overhaul plans working their way toward the White House .

“ Talk about tone deaf , ” said Robert Laszewski , a former health insurance executive who now counsels companies as a consultant .
Democratic strategist Paul Begala said the hearing could hurt the industry ’s efforts to position itself in the debate .
“ The industry has tried very hard in this current effort not to be the bad guy , not to wear the black hat , ” Begala said .
“ The trouble is all that hard work and goodwill is at risk if in fact they are pursuing ” such practices .
Rescission was largely hidden until three years ago , when The Times launched a series of stories disclosing that insurers routinely canceled the medical coverage of individual policyholders who required expensive medical care .

Sassi said rescissions are necessary to prevent people who lie about preexisting conditions from obtaining coverage and driving up costs for others .
“ I want to emphasize that rescission is about stopping fraud and material misrepresentations that contribute to spiraling healthcare costs , ” Sassi told the committee .
But rescission victims testified that their policies were canceled for inadvertent omissions or honest mistakes about medical history on their applications .
Rescission , they said , was about improving corporate profits rather than rooting out fraud .
“ It ’s about the money , ” said Jennifer Wittney Horton , a Los Angeles woman whose policy was rescinded after failure to report a weight - loss medication she was no longer taking and irregular menstruation .

“ Insurers ignore the law , and when they find a discrepancy or omission , they rescind the policy and refuse to pay any of your medical bills -- even for routine treatment or treatment they previously authorized , ” Horton said .
She and others from around the country accused insurers in testimony of gaming anti-fraud laws to take policyholders ’ premiums , only to drop people who developed serious illnesses .
They testified that they or a deceased loved one had had policies canceled over innocent mistakes and inadvertent omissions on their applications .
A Texas nurse said she lost her coverage , after she was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer , for failing to disclose a visit to a dermatologist for acne .
The sister of an Illinois man who died of lymphoma said his policy was rescinded for the failure to report a possible aneurysm and gallstones that his physician noted in his chart but did not discuss with him .

The committee ’s investigation found that WellPoint ’s Blue Cross targeted individuals with more than 1,400 conditions , including breast cancer , lymphoma , pregnancy and high blood pressure .
And the committee obtained documents that showed Blue Cross supervisors praised employees in performance reviews for rescinding policies .
One employee , for instance , received a perfect 5 for “ exceptional performance ” on an evaluation that noted the employee ’s role in dropping thousands of policyholders and avoiding nearly $ 10 million worth of medical care .
Committee members took turns , alternating Democrats and Republicans , condemning such practices .
“ When times are good , the insurance company is happy to sign you up and take your money in the form of premiums , ” said Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) .
“ But when times are bad . . . some insurance companies use a technicality to justify breaking its promise , at a time when most patients are too weak to fight back . ”

“ I think a company does have a right to make sure there ’s no fraudulent information , ” said Rep. Joe Barton ( R - Tex . ) .
“ But if a citizen acts in good faith , we should expect the insurance company that takes their money to act in good faith also . ”
Late in the hearing , Stupak , the committee chairman , put the executives on the spot .
Stupak asked each of them whether he would at least commit his company to immediately stop rescissions except where they could show “ intentional fraud . ”
The answer from all three executives :
“ No . ”

Rep. John Dingell ( D - Mich . ) said that a public insurance plan should be a part of any overhaul because it would force private companies to treat consumers fairly or risk losing them .
“ This is precisely why we need a public option , ” Dingell said .
Proponents of a public plan seized upon the hearing , saying it showed why access to healthcare cannot be left to private insurance companies .
“ This could reshape the debate , ” said Jerry Flanagan , a patient advocate with Santa Monica - based Consumer Watchdog .

“ When insurance companies go under oath and admit they are canceling innocent patients when they get sick , it makes it very difficult for lawmakers to pass a law that requires every American to buy a policy or face a tax fine .
It opens the way for a public option to hold the companies in check . ”
Rescission has fueled consumer outrage , particularly in California , where lawmakers are considering legislation to limit the practice to cases of intentional misrepresentation .
It has also led to a flurry of lawsuits .
In November 2007 , The Times reported that insurer Health Net Inc. paid bonuses to employees based in part on their involvement in rescinding policies .
According to internal corporate documents disclosed through litigation , Health Net saved $ 35 million over six years by rescinding policies .
The disclosures in part led an arbitration judge to levy $ 9 million in damages against Health Net in a case involving the company ’s rescission of the policy of a woman diagnosed with breast cancer .
Advertisement
At the time , Blue Cross told The Times that it did not link employee performance reviews to rescission .
Blue Cross also said at the time that it had conducted audits to ensure that claims reviewers were not given any “ carrots ” for canceling coverage .
The company reiterated that position Tuesday in spite of the committee ’s disclosure of two employee performance evaluations from 2003 discussing rescission levels and savings .
In a statement , WellPoint spokesman Jerry Slowey said the company had “ no policy to factor either the number of rescissions or the value of claims not paid in the evaluation of employee performance or when calculating employee salary or bonuses . ”
Last year , while reviewing documents for the committee , two employee reviews from 2003 were discovered “ that made reference to savings in a section of the review that contains many other factors , ” Slowey said .
Advertisement
“ Once we discovered this reference , more than 100 other individuals ’ reviews were reviewed , and no other such references were found . ”
“ The fact that two out of more than 100 individuals handling possible rescissions points to the fact that this was just two associates in the same area recognizing the work done that year to uncover fraud and abuse , ” he said .

Mr. Moussavi , who had called for the rally on Sunday but never received official permission for it , joined the crowd , as did Mohammad Khatami , the reformist former president .
But the crowd was so vast , and communications had been so sporadic  the authorities have cut off phone and text - messaging services repeatedly in recent days  that many marchers seemed unaware they were there .
“ We do n’t really have a leader , ” said Mahdiye , a 20 - year - old student , who like many protesters declined to give a last name because of fears of repercussions .
“ Moussavi wants to do something , but they wo n’t let him .
It is dangerous for him , and we do n’t want to lose him .
We do n’t know how far this will go . ”
The protesters said they would continue , with another major rally planned for Tuesday .
But it was too soon to tell whether Ayatollah Khamenei ’s decision to launch an inquiry , or the government ’s decision to let the silent rally proceed , would change the election results .
Many in the crowd said they believed that officials expected the protests to dissipate , as smaller protest movements did in 1999 and 2003 .
Later on Monday , Mr. Moussavi said on his Web site that he was not optimistic that the authorities would overturn the election results .
Demonstrators , though , expressed hopes that the tide had turned in their favor .
“ Anything is possible , ” said Hamid , a 50 - year - old financial adviser .
“ If the people insist on this movement , if it continues here and in other parts of Iran , the pressure will build and maybe Ahmadinejad will be forced to resign . ”
The police mostly stood on the sidelines on Monday .
But after sunset , violence erupted after members of the Basij militia opened fire , leaving one dead and several others injured .
In Isfahan , south of Tehran , more violence broke out on Monday , with the police attacking a crowd of several thousand opposition protesters and rioters setting fires in parts of the city .

On MSNBC ’s Hardball tonight , host Chris Matthews faced off with GOP Rep. John Campbell ( R - CA ) that would require future presidential candidates to submit a birth certificate .
Matthews asked Campbell “ Was he born in this country ? ” Campbell answered , “ Yes , I believe so . ”
Even a birther believes that Obama is really a citizen .
Here is the video :
Advertisements
Matthews called Campbell ’s proposal crazy .
Campbell tried to say that this controversy has come up before with Barry Goldwater , John McCain , and Mitt Romney .
“ Congressman , nice try , ” Matthews replied .
“ What you ’re doing is appeasing the nutcases . ” Matthews held up a copy of Obama ’s birth certificate and continued , “ That ’s the way to deal with this , mail this birth certificate to the whacko wing of your party , so they say I agree with this it ’s over .
What you are doing is doing what Roosevelt got elected to a third and fourth term .
They said you ca n’t do it again .
You are verifying the paranoia ”
The Hardball host pounced , after Campbell dodged the question about Obama ’s citizenship , “ It ’s on the screen now , take a close look .
It says “ Barack Hussein Obama . ”
He was born August 4 , 1961 in Honolulu , is that a state ?
Yes it was .
His mother was caucasian , his father was African .
What more do you want ?
He ’s male .
He was born , by the way at 7:20 P.M. in the island of Oahu .
What more do you want ?
I mean , I ’m serious , you say “ as far as you know ? ”
You are playing to the crazies . ”
Matthews asked Campbell seven times if he believes that Obama is a citizen , and after a relentless hammering , Matthews asked Campbell again if he thought that Obama was born in this country .
Campbell replied , “ Yes , I believe so . ”
As soft as Chris Matthews was on Michael Steele yesterday , was as tough as he was on Campbell today .
Of course the reason for this is that Chris Matthews plays favorites .
He likes Michael Steele as a person , but he has no taste for this wacky birther nonsense .
Matthews was correct in saying that passing any legislation about birth certificates will only add fuel to the fire .
The best way for this to go away is if Republicans stop playing to the birther crowd , and do what John McCain did during the 2008 campaign .
They need to make it clear that they believe that Obama is a citizen .
Having rendered themselves irrelevant on every major issue , Republicans consoled themselves last week with a delusional round robin .
First , the Drudge Report , linking to a Pew Poll , featured a headline denying what most of us observe in the real world : “ President Polarize : Poll Shows Historic Divide … Partisan Gap in Obama Job Approval Widest in Modern Era . ”
Perhaps demonstrating that Drudge , not Limbaugh , is the maestro of the GOP chorus , the point was quickly picked up by Karl Rove on the house network , Fox News .
Then The Washington Post ’s Michael Gerson , one of the few Bush aides to emerge from that administration with a reputation worth having , vigorously banged the same tin drum , arraigning Obama as “ the most polarizing new president . ”
The charge is based on what could only be a conscious misreading of the Pew report .
Analyzed honestly , the poll suggests that it is Republicans who are polarized , not the country .
In their first months in office , according to Pew , both Obama and Ronald Reagan rolled up high , nearly identical approval ratings among voters — about five points higher than George W. Bush ’s and 10 points higher than Bill Clinton ’s .
However , contemporary Republicans disdain Obama ; their faithful gather in a shrunken and angry corner of the electorate while the party ’s moderates have defected to become independents who support this president with near - record enthusiasm .
What the Pew poll really shows is that Obama is on his way to redrawing the political demography of America .
In politics , the smaller a party gets , the more small - minded it becomes .
With only 24 percent of voters identifying themselves as Republicans , the GOP is being miniaturized .
The pettiness plays out on every conceivable stage — from the do - nothing , denounce - everything Republican minority in Congress to the do - anything Republican attempt to overturn the Senate election in Minnesota , and the say - anything attacks of right - wing talk radio .
Democrats , who had every reason to be bitter after the 2000 election , actually gave Bush a job approval rating almost 10 points higher than the one Republicans now begrudge Obama — and they did so during the floundering , pre-9/11 muddle of the Bush presidency .
This is the Republican Party the country sees , a spectacle of resentments and recriminations vying for attention with a president who pursues sweeping economic change while conquering hearts and minds overseas and coolly dispatching the shoot - to - kill order that freed an American ship captain from Somali Pirates .
Republican intransigence does not constitute a strategy but a suicide note .
Undeterred by the steep rise in the ranks of Americans who believe the nation is now headed in the right direction — up almost threefold from the rock - bottom dregs of the Bush years — the Republican remnant continues on its march of folly .
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who speaks to the sour soul of his party , propagates an alternate reality in which Americans are yearning to repudiate Obama ’s activist reach for economic recovery , health - care reform , and energy independence .
Festooned in Newt ’s Technicolor dream coat , congressional Republicans seem poised to dig themselves an even deeper hole as the anti-party , opposed to every measure the president proposes to restore growth , improve health care , or protect the environment .
You name it , they ’re against it .
No wonder the latest New York Times survey finds the Republicans ’ favorability collapsing to 31 percent , the lowest rating recorded in the poll ’s quarter - century history .
Their situation grew more dire last week with reports that the White House intends to move ahead on immigration reform .
This will guarantee conservative outbursts of barely disguised ethnic - baiting that is sure to alienate Hispanic voters , the fastest - growing segment of the electorate .
Without a foothold among Hispanics , it ’s almost impossible for the GOP to win a presidential contest ( ask John McCain ) or regain a competitive edge in Congress .
Texas could evolve into a Democratic state , just as California did following Republican Gov. Pete Wilson ’s tactical immigrant - bashing in 1994 .
The GOP ’s crude nativism is matched by its crude nationalism , manifest in the predictable denunciations of the president ’s success in Europe .
Americans know that George W. Bush ’s foreign policy of dictates and sneers was a colossal failure .
For good reason , they prefer a president who can lead the world and not just insult it .
In the face of popular rejection , the Republicans offer nothing but the sound of “ wind in dry grass . ”
You can hear it in their threat to unseat their own Pennsylvania Sen .
Arlen Specter , who commits the mortal sin of occasional moderation , by nominating instead a right - winger with no chance of winning the state .
Similarly , Arnold Schwarzenegger , the most successful Republican on the West Coast , is despised by his own party .
So yes , there is a new polarization in this country : Americans are moving toward true North , the Obama pole .
Will it be permanent ?
Of course not .
That notion is just as foolhardy as Karl Rove ’s post -2004 prediction of lasting Republican dominance .
Every political period , era , or moment has an end .
The Republicans are n’t dead — just comatose .
If Obama fails , they will be back .
But that outcome appears increasingly chimerical .
Meantime , amid the Republican ruins , delusion provides a temporary shelter and psychic self - satisfaction .
How many defeats will it take for Republicans to rebuild a credible party of ideas ?
It ’s bound to happen some day , but who knows how or when ?

Several missing Somali -Americans are believed to have fought there .
" He must have been somewhat disillusioned and indoctrinated , because he did n't have any clue about Somalia at all , " his mother said , fighting back tears and barely able to speak about her eldest son .
Jamal Bana had been missing for months from his Minneapolis home .
His family is still grappling with the circumstances surrounding his death in a land they had fled -- an African nation wracked by chaos and violence .
The FBI said Bana 's death is part of a sweeping federal investigation into a recruiting effort in the United States by a Somali terrorist group called Al - Shabaab , which has ties to al Qaeda .
More than a dozen young men of Somali descent have disappeared from the Minneapolis area in recent months .
At least three , including Bana , have ended up dead in Somalia , community leaders say .
Watch the harrowing saga of Jamal Bana »
Bana was the kind of son a modest immigrant family pins its hopes on .
He was the eldest of seven and studying engineering at local colleges .
But last fall , his family said , he disappeared without any warning .
A few days later , the phone rang .
All that could be heard was a quick sentence .
" I'm in Somalia , " his mother quoted him as saying .
He then hung up .
Communication from then on was scarce .
In calls or text messages , the family said , Bana was guarded , as though someone was watching or listening to him .
On July 11 , the family received the call telling them to look on the Internet .
Bana 's father broke down in tears when he saw the photos .
One image was a close - up of his son's face , a bullet wound on one side of his head .
Another showed the body being carried through the streets of Mogadishu on a stretcher .

His parents said they believe their son was brainwashed and recruited to fight in the civil war between Somalia 's unstable transitional government and Al - Shabaab .
Al - Shabaab remains entrenched in northeast Somalia and in sections south of Somalia 's capital , Mogadishu , after fighting that has uprooted more than 200,000 people since early May , according to the United Nations .
The question immigrants in the United States want answered is :
How have their youth ended up so far away ?
One of the missing youth , Shirwa Ahmed , 27 , blew up himself and 29 others last fall in Somalia in what is believed to be the first suicide bombing carried out by a naturalized U.S. citizen .
Ahmed had traveled from Minneapolis .
The attack raised red flags throughout the U.S. intelligence community and sparked an investigation by the FBI .
Just weeks ago , community activist Abdirizak Bihi lost his 17 - year - old nephew , Burhan Hassan , in Somalia .
Asked if his nephew had been kidnapped from Minneapolis , Bihi said , " They kidnap them in the sense of mental kidnapping , not physically .
But they play a male role of mentor . "
Bihi and community leader Omar Jamal said they hold one place at least loosely responsible : the Abubakar as - Saddique Islamic Center , the largest mosque in Minneapolis .
" All these kids missing , they all have one thing in common :
They all participated in youth programs in that mosque , " said Jamal .
Jamal and Bihi said leaders of the mosque , at the very least , allowed people to come around their facility and recruit young men to fight in Somalia -- a charge the head imam denies .
CNN was not allowed inside the mosque , but was granted an interview with the imam at a different location .
" This is the baseless accusation really , " said Sheikh Abdirahman Sheikh Omar Ahmed .
" The mosque -- the mission of the mosque -- is to worship .
And people come to worship and go .
We do n't have any control over what comes through everybody 's mind or ideology . "
Sheikh Ahmed said at least two of the young men who died in Somalia did worship at his mosque .
But he said no recruiters came around the mosque to pull them away , and said his mosque does not support Al - Shabaab .
He added that he has encouraged local families to keep their young sons from going to Somalia .
Federal authorities recently made their first arrests in the case , charging two Minnesota men , Salah Osman Ahmed and Abdifatah Yusuf Isse , with one count each of providing material support to terrorists and conspiracy to kill , kidnap , maim or injure people overseas , according to the indictment .
CNN could not reach Salah Osman Ahmed 's attorney for comment .
Published reports indicate he planned to plead not guilty .
Isse has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with federal authorities , officials said .
In court papers obtained by CNN , Isse 's attorney said , " Mr. Isse will not be the last defendant indicted . "
A local attorney involved in the case said at least seven Somali - Americans have been questioned by a grand jury .
An FBI official said the bureau cannot rule out the possibility that some of the young men involved could be trained to carry out terrorist attacks on U.S. soil .
Meanwhile , CNN has learned more about how Shirwa Ahmed and Burhan Hassan made their way overseas .
A travel agent in Minneapolis , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the two men paid about $ 1,800 in cash for tickets to Nairobi , Kenya , or to Dubai , U.A.E .
The travel agent said he thinks the two men then made their way to Mogadishu from those cities on a Somali carrier .
For Bana 's family , it 's all too much to bear .
Omar Boley is a close friend who grew up in the same tribe as Bana 's family .
He said Bana 's mother is having difficulty coping with everything that has happened in recent months .
" She does n't want to hear the story again , " he said .
" She told me , ' Whenever I see someone talking about my son , I feel bad .
I can't sleep .
I feel sick .
So this happened , nothing I can do .
We pray for him . '
That 's what she said , and that 's what I believe . "

Selective logging , understory fires , fuelwood harvesting , and other forms of forest degradation are a substantial source of greenhouse has emissions , reports a policy brief issued by The Nature Conservancy ( TNC ) at U.N. climate talks in Bonn , Germany .
The brief , titled “ Do n’t Forget the Second ‘ D’ : The Importance of Including Degradation in a REDD Mechanism ” , says that forest degradation is often overlooked by policy makers , but accounts for a large share of emissions , including at least 500 million tons of C02 per year from selective logging alone .
TNC highlights research showing that logging in the Brazilian Amazon generates 20 percent of the region ’s emissions while in some years fire can cause 10 - 45 percent of total forest carbon emissions .
The brief also notes that degradation — which can include reduction of any amount up to 90 percent of forest canopy cover — is often a precursor to deforestation .
Forest transitions often start with degradation
before complete conversion .
The phases and
timing of these transitions depend upon location .
For example , in Indonesia , oil palm or other tree
crops may replace ranching .

Given the significance of degradation in both emissions and deforestation , TNC says that the “ degradation ” component of REDD must explicitly dealt with .
Failure to do so will reduce the effectiveness of the mechanism in mitigating climate change .
It would also undermine efforts to preserve biodiversity , since many species cannot survive in heavily degraded forest landscapes .
TNC says a framework that effectively addresses degradation will also pay dividends for rural populations , some of whom are among the poorest and most natural resource - dependent in the world .
“ Incorporating degradation into a REDD framework is also critical for channeling incentives to the diverse range of stakeholders involved in the spectrum of activities that determine the fate of forests and their carbon emissions , ” stated the brief .
Challenges
But addressing degradation wo n’t be easy .
Monitoring degradation has long been a technical challenge but new technologies , including The Carnegie Landsat Analysis System ( CLAS ) , a method for evaluating forest cover using satellite imagery , and high resolution remote sensing technologies like Lidar , are greatly improving measurement and tracking .
Further challenges will result from poor governance over forest resources .
To help address this , TNC says funds from the early stages of a REDD mechanism should go support institutional reform and capacity building in developing countries to increase transparency , simplify administration , improve land tenure systems , and foster cross-sector collaboration between governmental agencies .
TNC identifies practices in forest areas that can reduce degradation including fire management approaches to minimize the impact of catastrophic forest fires and sustainable forest management as a means to reduce emissions from forest exploitation .
Reduced impact logging ( RIL ) techniques can reduce emissions by 30 - 50 percent relative to conventional selective logging methods by cutting peripheral damage during harvesting .
TNC says RIL can be encouraged by certification schemes ( like the Forest Stewardship Council that offer a premium for producers .
But some environmentalists are concerned by any form of logging of old - growth forests , which are store more carbon and house higher levels of biodiversity than logged forests .
“ If carbon monies pay for non-existent ‘ sustainable management ’ and other industrial development of primary forests , replacing them with plantations and much diminished secondary forests ( both in terms of biodiversity and carbon ) , it will facilitate the biosphere ’s continued decline , ” said Glen Barry , an activist who runs Ecological Internet and Forests.org .
A new report from Global Witness , titled “ Vested Interests – Industrial logging and carbon in tropical forests “ , expresses a similar worry .
“ Industrial logging is a major source of carbon emissions , a primary driver of deforestation and threatens to derail the UN process to reduce deforestation , ” Global Witness warned in the report .
The Ecosystems Climate Alliance ( ECA ) , a coalition of activist and environmental organizations that includes Global Witness — agrees that the impact of logging depends largely on forestry rules and governance structures .
The Environmental Investigation Agency ( EIA ) , a member of the ECA that works on international trade and demand issues , believes a framework on REDD should incorporate rules for demand in consuming countries , since deforestation is as much driven by market demand in industrialized nations as it is by poverty in developing nations .
“ My major concern is that until we talk about these demand issues in a meaningful way , we are n’t talking about a real solution , ” EIA Forest Campaigns Director Andrea Johnson said .
Johnson believes funds for supplemental activities under the Waxman - Markey bill could be directed towards joint implementation of demand - side laws like the U.S. Lacey
Act , which is used to fight illegal logging by requiring companies to respect environmental laws in the countries from which they obtain plant and wildlife products .
First , the nickel tour of my family : I am the mother of two special needs kids , ages 3 and 5 .
They are sweet , loving and considered to be " high functioning " but on the autism spectrum .
My daughter loves animals , astronauts , babies and playing games on nickjr.com .
My son loves puzzles , Wiggles , cars , trains and counting ( he can already count to 10 , something I am so proud of as a parent ) .
I have decided to stay at home to help them , while hubby works your regular , white - collar job .
Parents of special needs kids are very protective of them , almost to a literal fault - like the time I was at a neighbor 's birthday party and ended up manning the pinata game so that I could make sure my kids did n't inadvertantly get wacked with a stick or start screaming because they did n't yet grasp the concept of taking turns .
I 'm sure every parent of a special needs kid has a story like mine , where they find themselves embarrassed , bossing someone else 's event simply because they know their own kids and they 're trying to make sure the kids can survive the experience without too many stares from other well - meaning but confused adults and older children .
So , in that spirit , I 'm about ready to stick my big foot out there and call you out , Ms. Palin :
Leave My Kids Alone !
You see , Sarah , every time you use your special needs child as a political prop in your ongoing mission to convert the country to Palinism , you make it that much harder for all of the rest of us parents out here who are just trying to advocate for our kids , and who just want to " blend in " as much as possible .
Every time you make up some ridiculous conspiracy theory that a cause like health care reform - one which would do so much to help my kids and others like them , who need physical , developmental , speech and language and out - of - classroom , one - on - one assistance - you hurt my children 's chances at getting the intervention they need .
So , just stop it .
Children - especially special needs children - should not be a part of the political bloodsport .
Quit trying to use them as pawns in that game .
UPDATE : Thank you so much for the recs , everyone .
Autism is something that 's been left out of the health care debate so far , but if there 's a way to have that conversation without putting special needs children in the crosshairs , I hope that 's something that 'll happen soon .
US researchers have ’ cured ’ obesity in mice by injecting them with a synthetic peptide that simultaneously mimics two naturally occurring hormones .
The weight loss in the mice has been described as ’ staggering ’ , and opens the prospect for the development of a drug treatment for obesity in humans - something that has so far proved elusive .
The synthetic molecule possesses key features of two natural peptide hormones , glucagon and glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( GLP - 1 ) , which are involved in regulating glucose metabolism and appetite control .
When injected into obese mice , after one week the animals ’ body weights had decreased by 25 per cent and their body fat by 42 per cent .
Repeated treatment resulted in greater effect .
While both peptides are known to suppress appetite , glucagon has the effect of raising blood glucose while GLP - 1 lowers glucose in the blood .
The researchers , led by Richard DiMarchi of Indiana University , postulated that if both hormones were administered at the same time , the risk of glucagon dangerously elevating blood glucose levels could be negated by the effect of GLP - 1 .
The two peptides are similar but differ in a few crucial aspects .
The research team engineered a new peptide that retained the key features of each .
They had to introduce a cyclic amide functionality in the peptide chain to stabilise its helical structure , and they bolted a huge polyethylene glycol group onto the molecule to prevent it from being filtered away by the kidneys .
’ We found that if you make a few judicious modifications in the molecule you get a hormone that has full potency at both the glucagon receptor and GLP receptor , ’ says DiMarchi .
’ We did not have to dumb the molecule down at all to make it a co-agonist - it was fully functional at both receptors . ’
When the drug was injected into obese mice , massive weight loss was observed .
’ Over a period of four weeks you can see these animals , which are about double normal size , return to their normal phenotype , ’ DiMarchi says .
’ This is absolutely spectacular . ’
Further investigation showed that the GLP component of the drug was mainly suppressing appetite , while the glucagon was working to stimulate the burning of calories .
DiMarchi says that it remains uncertain whether both these mechanisms would be seen in primates , but that it is ’ something we are committed to finding out . ’
Terry Herbert , who researches the role of GLP - 1 in diabetes at the University of Leicester in the UK , says that the US researchers ’ construction of the peptide hormone with dual activity is ’a technical tour de force in itself . ’
Herbert adds , ’ This is potentially very exciting .
The idea that a single dose of a peptide could lead to this incredible weight loss is staggering . ’
However , a lot more work is required to discover if similar benefits can be seen in humans , and to assess possible side - effects , Herbert says .

It 's an awesome bike .
The frame is a 1984 Schwinn World Sport , a collabo between US frame designers and Taiwanese frame builders , that is dressed in a gray metal flake colourway with oh so retro pink - and - white lettering .
The paint is in surprisingly good condition , considering it 's older than the target market for this listing .
The bike sits on a new set of Sun Ringle deep - v rims in black with black spokes and hubs .
The hubs roll like butter down a hot corn cob and the rear is a flip flop with a 17t fixed gear and an 18t freewhell already installed .
The freewheel has never been used .
I may not be hipster , but nobody 's calling me a poseur .
The rubber on this bike is from Soma and has plenty of wear left , with absolutely no flat spots from skid stopping .
You 'll be turning a 46t Sugino Messenger crank onthis baby , so bring your A game if you planning on crossing the bridge and rolling through the East Nashville hills .
There 's a new tektro brake installed on the front wheel with a crosstop BMX lever on the bullhorns , but do n't worry , it 's easily removable .
There 's also a set of drop bars and a new adjustable stem included in the sale for those who prefer a more tracky look .
I 've also go a new seatpost and a Ritchey pro headset pressed in .
The saddle is a classic Schwinn stinger in candy apple red .
I realize that pink and red is generally considered to be a faux pas , but I 'm counting on potential buyers for the bike sharing my contempt for the Tsars of fashion .
The color scheme on this ride is guaranteed to instantly boost your street cred .
I picked up on the pink in the bikes ' native lettering , and as such , the bike has been finished with pink bar tape , pink toe cages , a pink chain and a pink bottle cage .
The bottle cage is capable of holding both tallboys and 40s of malt liquor , or standard water bottles in case you prefer to rub the V and T on your Saturday cruise .
Because the bike is sized for riders 5 ' 3 " to 5 ' 9 " and pink , it 's totally chick friendly .
It will be a perfect pussy magnet for any hipster dude , at once displaying your sensitivity and your security in heterosexuality .
For girls .... hey , it 's pink .
I 'm sure you have a pair of light green Rocket Dogs laying around .
Perfect !
This bike will make a perfect gift for your GF or hipster fiancee .
Plus , at my price you 'll have plenty of extra cash to have tribal bands tattooed on your wedding fingers .
That , or you can cruise down to Planned Parenthood and split the bill for the abortion .
Whatever , I 'm not judging anyone , just trying to sell a bike .
Listen guys , if you 're long on green and low on hipster rep , come buy this bike .
Hurry up before I change my mind and quit shaving .

Is it August of 2008 already ?
Wow , it feels like just yesterday I was waiting in a long - assed line for the 2007 " I Am 8 - Bit " show in Los Angeles .
Oh how those beloved pixels can make the time fly by .
This year , they moved the show to World of Wonder in Hollywood - a venue that is basically twice as large as the one from 2007 .
Well , it did n't do much to reduce the size of the crowd ... in fact , I 'd say it was even larger this year .
But hey , there was twice as much artwork to see , so it was worth the wait for anyone in line regardless .
Once again , those of you who do n't live in L.A. are in luck , because we took over 225 photos of the show so you can check out every single piece of brilliant video gaming artwork that was on display at the opening reception .
Just like last year , you 'll have to excuse the odd angles we had to take the photos at sometimes ... it was insanely crowded in there and we were n't about to shove people out of the way just to get a perfectly centered photo every time .
With that being said , enjoy all 9 pages of this mega photo gallery from the big 2008 I Am 8 - bit show !
Another huge line to get in this year , but we got lucky and were randomly picked out of the entire crowd
and brought in by some really nice guy by the name of James St. James who was interviewing people .
Not sure
why he picked us , but he brought us all the way to the front of the line and let us right in , so I 'm not complaining .
Thanks James !
Now let 's get to the actual art !
There are still more " I Am 8 - Bit " photos to see !

Claim : Photographs show a mass migration of rays in the Gulf of Mexico .
TRUE
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , February 2009 ]
Stingray Migration , Gulf Of Mexico Stingray Migration , Gulf Of Mexico Mass Migration of Golden Cow - nose rays Looking like giant leaves floating in the sea , thousands of Golden Rays are seen here gathering off the coast of Mexico .
The spectacular scene was captured as the magnificent creatures made one of their biannual mass migrations to more agreeable waters .
Gliding silently beneath the waves , they turned vast areas of blue water to gold off the northern tip of the Yucatan Peninsula .
Sandra Critelli , an amateur photographer , stumbled across the phenomenon while looking for whale sharks .
She said : ‘ It was an unreal image , very difficult to describe .
The surface of the water was covered by warm and different shades of gold and looked like a bed of autumn leaves gently moved by the wind . ’
Do n’t forget to share this with others !
Let your friends enjoy the beauty of nature , too !
Origins : Some of the images shown above are reminiscent of M.C. Escher ’s tessellations , but they ’re all photographs of cownose rays , a type of ray known for undertaking long migrations in large groups :
Cownose rays are known for their long migrations in large schools .
They are strong swimmers , able to cover long distances .
In the Atlantic Ocean , their migration is northward in the late spring and southward in the late fall .
The population in the Gulf of Mexico migrates in schools of as many as 10,000 rays , clockwise from Cownose rays are known for their long migrations in large schools .
They are strong swimmers , able to cover long distances .
In the Atlantic Ocean , their migration is northward in the late spring and southward in the late fall .
The population in the Gulf of Mexico migrates in schools of as many asclockwise from western Florida to the Yucatan in Mexico .
Cownose rays have poisonous stingers , but even in large groups they ’re shy and not threatening .
In 1608 , Captain John Smith , an East Coast settler and explorer , learned about the nature of a cownose ’s sting .
While Smith was spearing a ray with his sword near the Rappahannock River , the ray defended itself by stinging Smith in the shoulder .
The pain was so terrible that the crew were convinced Smith was dying , so they dug a grave for him .
But John Smith overcame the pain and felt well enough that evening to eat the ray for supper .
The place where this happened is still known as Stingray Point .
As this ray swims through the ocean , its wingtips often break the surface , resembling the dorsal fin of a shark , which sometimes causes undue alarm for swimmers and divers .
Occasionally , they jump out of the water and land with a loud smack , a behavior thought to be a territorial display .
The above - displayed pictures of rays captured during one such migration were taken in the Gulf of Mexico by Italian photographer Sandra Critelli , who currently lives and works in New York City .
Ms. Critelli ’s remarkable photographs of the ray migration were featured in a number of publications , for one of which she provided an explanation of how she came to snap these images :
We were motoring around Holbox Island in the Gulf of Mexico , trying to find whale sharks so we could snorkel with them and photograph them .
It was June .
I was searching the horizon when I spotted this astonishing “ wave ” of cownose rays .
We turned the boat towards the school , turned off the engine , and watched them move past us .
There were thousands !
They were swimming on the surface , and deep down , and all going in the same direction .
They looked like beautiful leaves moving softly and gently by the wind .

Later I learned that they migrate 10,000 at a time and are found in the warm currents from Brazil all the way to southern New England .
Passive creatures , they can live until about 13 years of age and can be abundant in the Chesapeake in the summer .
As quickly as they appeared that magic day , the migrating rays disappeared .
I felt very fortunate to experience something so beautiful .
The migrating ray photographs can also be found in the Marine Life section of Sandra Critelli ’s web portfolio .

You see Nouriel RoubiniÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s name in the news a great deal lately , and more often than not , he is warning of a Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ double - dipÃ¢â ‚
¬
Â recession that he believes is our combined fate .
No , there is no Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ VÃ¢â‚ ¬Â or Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ UÃ¢â‚ ¬Â curve recovery for Mr. Roubini Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ he is of the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ WÃ¢â‚
¬Â curve school and he believes that we have merely reached the mid-point of this fickle letter .
This of course begs the question , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ does Roubini know what the heck he is talking about ?
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Well , he is currently a professor of Economics at the Stern School of Business ; he has worked with the International Monetary Fund and the Federal Reserve ; he also served on the Council of Economic Advisers for the Clinton Administration before moving on to the Treasury Department under Timothy Geithner .
Oh , and he also called the collapse of the US housing market , saying how it would trigger a world - wide recession .
Back in September 2006 , Roubini warned that Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The United States was likely to face a once - in - a - lifetime housing bust , an oil shock , sharply declining consumer confidence , and , ultimately , a deep recessionÃ¢â‚ ¬Â. OK Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ so it seems he got that all pretty - much right , but other economists also warned of an impending housing bubble ; however , Roubini was so vociferous , and so shrilly did he sound the alarm , that he was especially singled - out by the nay - sayers as being an overly - pessimistic Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ permabearÃ¢â‚ ¬
Â .
He was even ridiculed by the New York Times who famously labeled him as Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ Dr. DoomÃ¢â‚ ¬Â .
Despite the growing optimism generated by the news that several economies including Japan , Hong Kong , France , and Germany all posted positive growth in the past week , Roubini still believes this rally is doomed .
In a commentary published in yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Financial Times , Roubini defended his position on two key points ; the winding - down of government stimulus spending , and the rapid rise in energy prices .
Roubini believes that much of the recovery we have seen to date , is directly attributable to government stimulus spending that in itself , is not sustainable .
Worse still , this flurry of spending has forced many governments into a deficit position resulting from not just an increase in spending , but a dramatic reduction in tax revenues stemming from lower personal incomes and weak consumer and business spending .
Policymakers are Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as Roubini describes them in yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s article Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ damned if they do and damned if they donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢tÃ¢â‚ ¬Â , and sooner or later , governments will be forced to address their operating deficits through some combination of tax increases and reduced spending .
If this indeed is the case , it is inevitable that the fledgling recovery will be impacted to some degree , with the very strong likelihood that the economy could be pushed back into a recession .
What if governments simply choose to ignore the rapidly accumulating debts ?
The danger here of course , is that bonds yields will be pushed higher , leading in turn to higher borrowing costs and giving rise to increased inflation .
This combination of low productivity and high inflation could actually lead to the most dreaded of all conditions – stagflation !
And then there is the little matter of oil prices .
Once again Ã¢â‚¬â€œ just as we saw last year , oil prices are on the rise fuelled much more by speculation than by economic fundamentals .
Roubini believes that the economy cannot stand another energy shock and should prices get near the $ 100 a barrel mark again , the rather Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ anemicÃ¢â ‚
¬
Â recovery we are seeing now will soon be replaced by another bout of negative growth Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ or as Dr. Doom calls it , the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ double dipÃ¢â ‚ ¬Â of recession .

Relations between China and Australia may be at their lowest point for years on many fronts , but that has n't stopped the signing of a massive deal last night which is the biggest single investment ever seen in Australia .
PetroChina has agreed to buy $ 50 billion worth of liquefied natural gas - 2.25 million tonnes a year over the next two decades - from the yet - to - be developed Gorgon field off the coast of Western Australia .
The deal virtually guarantees that the Gorgon project will go ahead , creating 6,000 jobs at its peak .
Australia 's Resources and Energy Minister , Martin Ferguson , was in Beijing to witness the signing ceremony , which was held behind closed doors .
" The ExxonMobil $ 50 billion LNG export contract to China represents the biggest export contract in the history of Australia , " he said .
" It also potentially underpins the biggest single construction project in the history of Australia , which could see 6,000 workers on the job at the peak construction period . "
Mr Ferguson says it is a foundation deal for the purpose of securing the Gorgon investment , and creating jobs and economic opportunities in Australia , while creating a sense of energy security for China .
" In the past , for example , such foundation agreements have underpinned the north - west shelf , " he said .
" The ExxonMobil Chinese contract is one of the foundation contracts that enable the Gorgon project to stack up financially , and in doing so , enables the joint venture partners to actually move closer to final investment decision .
" China is resource and energy - hungry ; Australia 's well - placed to meet the needs of China as it goes forward on the development phase .
With any relationship there are tensions from time to time , but life goes on commercially .
" China needs our resource and energy products , and we 're looking to actually sell those resources and energy products to China .
So the relationship is mutually beneficial . "
Yet there are still indications of tension and nervousness between China and Australia , who have seen their relations strained by the arrest of four Rio Tinto executives in Shanghai .
The actual ceremony was held behind closed doors .
Australia 's greatest trade deal to date was signed with not a correspondent in sight to witness it , and journalists were n't even told where the event was happening .
Mr Ferguson says the deal has been resolved commercially , at arm 's length to the Government .
ExxonMobil 's Richard Ellis hailed the deal as a significant step forward for the joint - venture partners who will shortly decide whether to proceed with the Gorgon project .
" It 's certainly a significant deal , both in terms of the provision of clean gas from the Gorgon project to China , and as we move towards a final investment decison in coming months , " he said .
Jobs bonanza
Mining analyst Peter Strachan says the deal virtually guarantees the Gorgon project .
" They would n't be selling the gas if they did n't think it was going to go ahead , " he said .
" I mean , it 's getting pretty serious now .
" There 'll be jobs for everyone from cleaners through to engineers , safety people , nurses , pilots ... whatever you can think of , there 'll be a lot of people involved in supporting the development of a project like this . "
Mr Ferguson says if the Gorgon project gets the final go ahead , he expects to see construction work starting on Barrow Island before Easter , and the first export contracts to China in 2015 .
He says the agreement is of major economic importance to Australia as the country comes out of the global economic crisis .
" In a lot of ways , it represents a bigger investment in Australia than the Government 's last economic stimulus package - hence the significance not only to the west coast of Australia , but the whole Australian economy , " he said .
" The LNG sector is going to be very important as Australia goes into an economic recovery stage and the Government is hopeful a final investment decision is made prior to Christmas .
" Assuming an investment decision is made prior to Christmas , we will see construction workers on Barrow Island prior to Easter , and if everything went well we can see the first export contracts to China in 2015 . "

Email Address Obfuscator
Sadly there are a number of " spambots " which roam the web " harvesting " email addresses to send spam to .
Often you have no choice but to include a mailto link with an email address in a web page .
Fortunately most of these spambots do not seem to have complete HTML parsers , and most do not execute JavaScript .
This free Email Address Obfuscator uses obfuscation to generate a " mailto : " link which will confuse naïve spambots , but will still work in standard browsers .
It also generates an alternative version which requires a Spambot to execute JavaScript .
Email Address : ( Needs JavaScript ) Obfuscated Address Link

A French photographer has captured a stunning photo of the space shuttle Endeavour docked with the International Space Station crossing the face of the sun .
You could n't just aim your digital camera at the sky and get results like this .
Thierry Legault , who is known for his amazing astronomical imagery , uses specialized solar filters to capture the images .
When the shuttle docked with the ISS on July 15 , the combined crews set a new record for space - vehicle occupancy .
The 13 people aboard the station are the most that have been aboard the same vehicle in space .
The astronauts have installed a " porch " on the space station for space - exposed experiments .
The new addition effectively completes the Japanese Kibo laboratory .
Astronauts are deploying a variety of other scientific installations , too .
One public - interest project , the Tomatosphere II , exposes millions of tomato seeds to space , which are then returned to Earth and distributed to classrooms across North America .
If you like Legault 's photograph , make sure to check out his other work , including his shot of the space shuttle Atlantis solo - transiting the sun .

Democrats turned back a late - breaking Republican effort to punish the Organization of American States for its support of ousted Honduran president Manuel Zelaya ( pictured here ) .
$ 49B foreign aid budget clears House
A record $ 49 billion State Department and foreign aid budget cleared the House Thursday evening after Democrats turned back a late - breaking Republican effort to punish the Organization of American States for its support of ousted Honduran president Manuel Zelaya .
Cuban - American conservatives were prominent players behind the motion which sought to cut $ 15 million from U.S. contributions to the OAS and move the money instead to the National Endowment for Democracy .
Rep Ileana Ros-Lehtinen ( R. , Fla . ) led her colleagues in chants of " Nada " to the OAS , and Rep. Lincoln Diaz - Balart ( R. , Fla . ) said the protest reflected a broader anger toward the OAS in regards to its treatment of the Castro regime in Cuba and Venezuela President Hugo Chavez .

" They are basically at the call of Chavez , " Diaz - Balart told POLITICO .
" It 's not just the Honduran situation . "
But the vote 's timing — amid continued turmoil in Honduras and new talks in Costa Rica Thursday to resolve the crisis- made it difficult to separate the two events .
In a scathing response , House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman ( D , Cal. ) said Republicans were only cloaking their real purpose by not speaking directly of the June 28 military coup which removed the leftist Zelaya .
" The real agenda here is cause some people here do n't care that people they like better in a country called Honduras ... are willing to resort to a military coup and a totally anti-democratic approach to changing leadership , " Berman told the House " They are embarrassed to be associated with a military coup . "
" The party proposing this motion .is the same party that held the White House for eight years while our policy and relationships toward the entire Latin American region so degraded our reputation and effectiveness that they should be embarrassed to be making suggestions ' '
Arizona Rep. Jeff
Flake , one of just two Republicans to go against his leadership on the 233-192 vote , agreed .
" It did n't make sense that we should move money from the OAS to the National Endowment for Democracy because we were supportive of the military coup , " Flake told POLITICO .
" I do n't know .
It seemed a little strange to me . "
The underlying 2010 budget bill represents a departure from past foreign aid budgets in that President Barack Obama has sought to wrap in Iraq and Afghanistan aid previously treated as outside emergencies under his predecessor , former President George W. Bush .
The picture is further complicated by the fact that Democrats used a wartime spending bill last month to front load about $ 2.5 billion from the 2010 budget into the current fiscal year .
And both parties have manipulated the numbers to gain advantage .
Republicans peg the bill as a 33 % increase ; Democrats say it is actually less than what has already been appropriated for the same accounts for the current fiscal year ending Sept , 30 .
In truth , when the different pieces are lined up in order , the increase appears to be in the range of 7 % .
Much as they complained about the cost , a solid bloc of 76 Republicans supported the measure on the final 318 - 106 vote .
The 3 - 1 margin contrasts with much narrower votes in the past on foreign aid and reflects both the power of the pro-Israel lobby and the legacy of Bush , who convinced many in his party to be more supportive of foreign aid .
Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor , the House Republican whip , voted for passage , for example , as did Rep. Pete Sessions ( R. , Tex . ) who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee , the party 's campaign committee .
A Japanese TV station broke a major piece of news on the progress of China Blue High Definition ( a China - grown competitor to Blu-ray ) in the China market last week , but the English - language technology press , through a translation mistake , misreported the news .
It turns out that CBHD penetration in China appears to have hit a staggering 30 percent , in only a few months on the market .
The story , from TV - tokyo. co.jp , features text and video , and on perusing a Google translated version of the text , and spotting the number " 6 " next to " DVD , " " 3 " next to " CBHD " and " 1 " next to Blu - Ray , one site reported that CBHD had " a 3 % market share lead on Blu-ray . "
A number of other publications picked up the story and reported similarly .
One even went so far as to claim CBHD dominance in Japan .
A more accurate translation obtained by Ars from professional Japanese translator Camellia Nieh shows that the true story is far more interesting .
TV Tokyo visited Gome , a major retail chain in China , where CBHD discs and players were flying off the shelf , while Blu - Ray players and discs languished .
They also visited a factory for one of the largest CBHD manufacturers .
Sources in these companies tell TV Tokyo that , in the China market , CBHD already constitutes some 30 percent of all disc players sold , while Blu - Ray accounts for 10 percent , similar to its penetration in the USA .
DVD is responsible for the remaining 60 percent .
That China has achieved 30 percent CBHD penetration , the sources say , reflects the strength of the format , as well as the determination of a nationalistic Chinese government and industry seeking to avoid foreign licensing fees on DVD and BD technology and make a greater profit on domestic sales .
At the retail store , a pretty shop girl ( some things do n't need translation ) tells TV Tokyo that while the players are more expensive than DVD players ( almost $ 300 ) , the discs are cheap , and she expects the format to spread rapidly because of a marked difference in quality between DVD and CBHD .
Retail cost of CBHD discs worked out to about US $ 7.40 , while Blu - Ray discs cost US $ 29.60 — close to what they do in the USA .
At the CBHD factory , owned by Shanghai United Optical Disc corporation , a joint consortium between China Record Shanghai and Japanese Memory Tech , managers expressed excitement over CBHD .
They said that while the components of a CBHD player are more expensive , the homegrown format , with some technology licensed from the defunct HD DVD players at a bargain , avoids about $ 21 in licensing fees on each player compared to DVD , and even more compared to BD , leaving a much higher profit .
Meanwhile , the discs are almost as cheap to press as DVDs .
They expect to be pressing over a hundred titles in CBHD within the year , and hundreds next year .
The ultimate spread of the new format will be controlled partly by its adoption by American movie studios .
Of the six major studios , only Warner Brothers is currently shipping its library on CBHD , leaving WB titles and domestic Chinese films as the only legitimate CBHD content .
Of course , content from other studios may well end up on the new format , since commercial piracy is widespread in China .
If penetration rises as rapidly as it has so far , nearly the whole
Chinese market may transition in a matter of a year or two , leaving
hundreds of millions of players ready and eager for cheap , available
American films .
Given this , content providers may be interested in making at least some money off the CBHD distribution of their titles , and sign with CBHD defensively .
Indeed , if the CBHD scaleup is so rapid , and costs so low , why not take the new format beyond China 's shores ?
The engineer interviewed at the CBHD factory believes there 's a strong market for the player in other emerging countries , and that the new format could come to dominate HD sales in other parts of the world , and possibly even in western strongholds where Blu - Ray is currently the only physical HD format in town .
If this happens , it would represent a major victory for China , which has , in the past , mostly licensed technology from other countries .
Building on its success with Super Video CD ( SVCD ) in the domestic Chinese market , the Chinese manufacturing machine would have begun to flex its muscle with Chinese IP , abroad .
The Egyptian Book of the Dead
The Egyptian Book of the Dead dates from 1580 - 1350 BCE ( before the Bible . )
Many of the major concepts from the Bible are completely unoriginal .
Most of the ancient religious texts that predate the Bible are from Egypt , the hieroglyphs and vignettes ( drawing and etchings ) discovered rang from around 3000 B.C.E to about 400 AD .
Concepts of the Egyptian religion consisted of , souls , judgment at death to decide whether you go to heaven or not , resurrection , eternity , a creation myth , communion , and the list goes on .
Here are excerpts from the first half of The Egyptian Book of the Dead .
Selected passages from the first 20 plates :
Plate I ( III )
" Homage to thee , O thou who art Ra when thou ( 4 ) risest and Tmu when thou settest .
Thou risest , thou risest ; thou shinest , ( 5 ) thou shinest , thou who art crowned king of the {p. 251} gods .
Thou art the lord of heaven , [ thou art ] the lord of earth , [ thou art ] the creator of those who dwell in the heights ( 6 ) and of those who dwell in the depths .
[ Thou art ] the One god who came into ( 7 ) being in the beginning of time .
Thou didst create the earth , ( 8 ) thou didst fashion man , thou didst make the watery abyss of the sky , thou didst form Hapi [ the Nile ] , and thou art the maker of streams and of the ( 9 ) great deep , and thou givest life to all that is therein .
Thou hast knit ( 10 ) together the mountains , thou has made mankind and the beasts of the field , thou hast created the heavens and the earth .
Plate II
Text : ( 1 ) [ HYMN TO OSIRIS . ]
" Glory be to Osiris Un-nefer , the great god within Abydos , king of eternity , lord of the everlasting
(8) Homage to thee , King of kings , Lord of lords , Prince of princes
Plate III
Judgment of the Dead
[ 7 ]
Thoth , the righteous judge of the great company of the gods who are in the presence of the god Osiris , saith : " Hear ye this judgment .
The heart of Osiris hath in very truth been weighed , and his soul hath stood as a witness for him ; it hath been found true by trial in the Great Balance .
There hath not been found any wickedness in him ; he hath not wasted the offerings in the temples ; he hath not done harm by his deeds ; and he uttered no evil reports while he was upon earth . "
Plate VI
( 4 ) " O ye who give bread and ale to perfected souls in the Hall of ( 35 ) Osiris , give ye bread and ale at the two seasons to the soul of Osiris Ani
(2) " Homage to you , O ye lords of kas , ye lords of right and truth , infallible , who shall endure for ever and shall exist through countless ages , grant that ( 3 ) 1 may enter into your [ presence ] .
I , even I , am pure and holy , and I have gotten power over the spells which are mine .
judgment ( 4 ) hath been passed
upon me in my glorified form .
Deliver ye me from the crocodile which is in the place of the lords of right and truth .
Grant ye unto me ( 5 ) my mouth that I may speak therewith .
May offerings be made unto me in your presence , for I know you and I know your names , and I know ( 6 ) the name of the great god .
Grant ye abundance of food for his nostrils .
The god Rekem passeth through the western horizon of heaven .
He ( 7 ) travelleth on , and I travel on he goeth forth , and I go forth .
Let me not be destroyed in the place Mesqet let not the Fiend get the mastery over me ; let me not be driven back from your gates ; ( 8 ) let not your doors be shut against me ; for I have [ eaten ] bread in Pe and I have drunken ale in Tepu .
If my arms be fettered in the ( 9 ) holy habitation , may my father Tmu stablish for me my mansion in the place above [ this ] earth where there are wheat and barley in abundance which can not be told .
May feasts be made for me there , for my soul and for my ( 10 ) body .
Grant me even offerings of the dead , bread , and ale , and wine , oxen , and ducks , linen bandages and incense , wax , and all the good and fair and pure things whereby the gods do live .
May I rise again in all the forms which ( 11 ) I desire without fail and for ever .
Plate XIV
(1) The great godlike rulers in the judgment of the dead are Thoth , Osiris , Anubis , and Astennu .
Now ( 2 ) the " condemnation of those who are to be blotted out " is the withholding of that which is so needful to the souls of the children of impotent revolt .
( 6 ) who saith : Hail all ye gods of the Temple of the Soul , [ 4 ] who weigh heaven and earth in the balance , and who provide food and abundance of meat .
Hail Tatunen
Plate XVIII
Text [ CHAPTER IX . ] : ( 1 ) THE CHAPTER OF COMING FORTH BY DAY , HAVING PASSED THROUGH THE TOMB .
Saith Osiris Ani : " Hail Soul , thou mighty one of strength !
( 2 ) Verily I am here , I have come , I behold thee .
I have passed through the underworld , I have seen [ my ] father ( 3 ) Osiris , I have scattered the gloom of night .
I am his beloved one .
I have come ; I behold my father ( 4 ) Osiris .
I have stabbed Set to the heart .
I have done the things [ needed ] by my father Osiris . ( 5 ) I have opened every way in heaven and upon earth .
I am the son beloved of his father Osiris ( 6 ) .
I have become a ruler , I have become glorious , I am furnished [ with what I need ] .
Hail , all ye gods , and all ye shining ones , make ye a way for me , the Osiris , the scribe Ani , triumphant . "

And I have come before thee that I may be with thee to behold thy Disk every day .
May I not be shut in the tomb , may I not be turned back ( 13 ) , may the limbs of my body be made new again when I view thy beauties , even as do all thy favoured ones , { 14 ) because I am one of those who worshipped thee whilst they lived upon earth .
May I come in unto the land of eternity , may I come even ( 15 ) unto the everlasting land , for behold , O my lord , this hast thou ordained for me . "

Permit thou not me to be judged according to the mouths of the multitude .
May my soul lift itself up before [ Osiris ] , having been found to have been pure when on earth .
May I come into thy presence , O Lord of the gods ; may I arrive at the Nome of Maati ( Truth ) ; may I rise up on my seat like a god endowed with life ; may I give forth light like the Company of the Gods who dwell in heaven ; may I become like one of you ; may I lift up my footsteps in the town of Kher - Aha ; may I look upon the Sektet Boat of the god , Saah , the holy one , as it passeth across the sky ; may I not be repulsed ; may I look upon the Lords of the Tuat , or , according to another reading , the Company of the Gods ; may I smell the savour of the divine food of the Company of the Gods ; may I sit down with them ; may my name be proclaimed for offerings by the KHER - HEB priest at the sacrificial table ; may I hear the petitions which are made when offerings are presented ; may I draw nigh unto the Neshem Boat ; and may neither my Heart - soul nor its lord be repulsed .

Update : Since this post was written , we have rebuilt the New Media Campaigns website .
There still is a filtering portfolio , but it is now based on the jQuery isotope plugin .
This is a much better plugin however it does cost $ 40 for commercial use .
The plugin below still works great , but it does n't animate quite as nicely .
See a Demo
Read The Documentation
Download the Plugin and Zip
Last week we finally launched our new site design .
One of our favorite new features is our filtering portfolio .
We 've selected 50 of the websites we 've done to be featured and we 've categorized each one .
Using jQuery , it is possible to filter through the big list to see sites that apply to certain categories .
Feel free to test it out and sort through it here .
Some of the requirements we had when we built it were :
It should be easy to update
Each item should be able to be in multiple categories
We should be able to link to certain filters with a url hash
To get this done , Josh , Eli and I collaborated on different aspects .
We 've finally finished it up and wrapped it up in a plugin that can be used by anyone .
To download a zip with the plugin , see the bottom of this post .
Documentation
Markup
The plugin is configurable to work with just about any markup .
Here is an example of what we used for the filters and the portfolio items .
Filters
< ul id=" portfolio - filter " > < li > < a href= " #all " >
All</a></li> < li >< a href= " #jquery " rel= " design " >
jQuery </a></li> ...</ul > < p>< strong > Portfolio Items</ strong ></p> < ul id=" portfolio- list " > < li class = " business partner jquery " >< a href= " # " >< img src= " /hifi/site/edit/blog / " alt= " " /></a> < p> Saranac</p> </li > ...</ul >
Of course the markup can be completely arbitrary .
All of the styling is done in css .
There are only two major requirements :
Linking Filters to Items -
The hashed href of the filter link must match the class of the portfolio item .
In the example above , the #jquery filter matches the last class of the only portfolio item .
Portfolio Items are Wrapped -
As you 'll see in the JS section below , the plugin is called on a wrapper of the portfolio items .
In this case , the wrapper is the .
Javascript / jQuery Setup
The jQuery is really simple to set up .
If you use the same markup as I have , you can even leave out the settings and it should work out of the box .
Simply do the following after you have included the filterable plugin :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( ' portfolio- list ' ) .filterable ( ) ; } ) ;
The plugin will also take a number of optional parameters .
These are the defaults :
settings = $. extend ( { useHash : true , animationSpeed : 1000 , show : { width : ' show ' , opacity : ' show ' } , hide : { width : ' hide ' , opacity : ' hide ' } , useTags : true , tagSelector : ' # portfolio - filter a ' , selected TagClass : ' current ' , allTag : ' all ' } , settings ) ;
To change any of the defaults , just pass them in to the initial call :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( ' portfolio - list ' ) .
filterable ( { animationSpeed : 2000 , show : { height : ' show ' } useTags : false , etc ... } ) ; } ) ;
Fun Features
Adding a Hash to a Url
If you have the useHash setting enabled , you can link directly to a single filter .
You can see this in effect on our portfolio by visiting https://www.newmediacampaigns.com/section/portfolio#jquery.
Exposed Events
Once filterable ( ) has been called , there are a number of events that get bound to the wrapper .
Here they are :
/* Handles the state of the filter buttons as well as the portfolio items * Expects " tagToShow " to include a hash .
*/ $ ( this ) .bind ( " filter " , function ( e , tagToShow ) {} ) ; /* Just switches the portfolio items .
Expects a class name */ $ ( this ) .bind ( " filterportfolio " , function ( e , classToShow ) {} ) ; /*
Shows a tag in addition to those being shown - expects a selector */ $ ( this ) . bind ( " show " , function ( e , selectorToShow ) {} ) ; /*
Hides a tag - expects a selector */ $ ( this ) . bind ( " hide " , function ( e , selectorToHide ) {} ) ;
The most useful of these is the first .
It will allow you to programatically change the state of the filters and portfolios .
So lets say you have a link somewhere on a page that you want to use to make sure your jQuery tag is shown .
You could code something like the following :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( ' portfolio- list ' ) .filterable ( ) ; $ ('#linkID ').click ( function ( ) { $ ( ' portfolio - list ' ) .
trigger ( ' filter ' , [ '# jquery ' ] ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
For more details about these exposed events , feel free to check out the source or ask a question in the comments .

Twenty years after Chinese troops brought the massive pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square to a bloody end , Beijing is in lockdown .
Active dissidents have been confined to their homes or forced to leave the city and their mobile phones have been shut down .
Social networking and image - sharing websites such as Twitter and Flickr have been closed to prevent discussion of the anniversary .
Near the square itself , workmen have been preparing Chang 'an Avenue , the Avenue of Eternal Peace , for a huge parade to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Communist Party 's accession to power , but the 4 June massacre will be marked with tight - lipped silence and a steadfast official refusal to revisit the events of that day .
Twenty years ago Tiananmen Square was full of frantic students wearing headbands and lobbying for democratic change .
Today it is full of tourists eager to get their photograph taken in front of the Forbidden City with its huge portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong .
Shiny Mercedes and Buicks now swish along the road at the point on the avenue where a lone , unknown protester stood in front of the tanks with his shopping bags 20 years ago , and briefly halted the advance of the People 's Liberation Army .
The Communist Party has forbidden discussion of the events of that day 20 years ago , and the official line is that the crackdown , officially called " the political incident " , was necessary to ensure stability .
The student movement that drove the democracy activism in late 1980s China has largely evaporated , its leaders all in exile or no longer active .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The high drama of Tiananmen Square 's protests set in motion the chain of events which led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the opening up of eastern Europe .
But in China the revolution was stillborn .
A year after the crackdown , Jiang Zemin , who was president at the time , dismissed international condemnation of the Tiananmen massacre as " much ado about nothing " .
The massacre caused horror around the world , and China was marginalised by the international community , but as Deng Xiaoping reportedly said : " The West always forgets . "
The lure of China 's huge potential market was too great for condemnation to last long , and China was soon back at the high table of the international community .
Twelve years after the crackdown , China was a member of the World Trade Organisation and is now the world 's third largest economy .
China is a very different place these days .
The government has begun to implement some of the freedoms the protesters on the square had sought , such as getting rid of rules dictating where Chinese could live or work , and even the person they could marry .
The past two decades of astonishing economic advances have given millions of Chinese a say in their destinies .
One of the students ' key demands was for an end to the corruption that blighted daily life in China .
The Chinese government is engaged in a highly public campaign to crack down on the corruption which it once denied existed , though in the absence of a free media or speech , critics say the campaign is doomed to fail .
But some things have not changed .
All power in China flows exclusively from the Communist Party and independent political activity is forbidden .
Nearly all of China 's active dissidents have been exiled or imprisoned .
The recent Charter 08 campaign , a petition calling for legal and political reform , was the closest thing to a pro-democracy movement that China has seen for years , and one of the chief architects of Charter 08 and one of China 's best - known intellectual critics , Liu Xiaobo , has been detained .
Mr Liu spent two years in prison for his role in supporting the Tiananmen students .
He also prevented more bloodshed by successfully negotiating with the army the evacuation of the last remaining students on Tiananmen Square in the early morning of 4 June .
The text of Charter 08 included a direct reference to the events on 4 June , as an example of the " long trail of human rights disasters " caused by the Communist Party 's monopoly on power , Human Rights Watch said .
" Liu Xiaobo epitomises how the Chinese government has responded to Tiananmen in particular and peaceful critiques in general : by stifling them , " said Sophie Richardson , Human Rights Watch 's Asia advocacy director .
The San Francisco - based rights group Dui Hua estimates that 30 people remain in prison for offences related to the Tiananmen crackdown .
The prisoners – then mostly young workers – were jailed for burning army trucks , stealing equipment or attacking soldiers as the military advanced toward the protesters .

Cui Weiping , a professor at the Beijing Film Academy , recently called for open discussion of the events of that day .
" What kind of negative impact has it had on our society for us to keep silent and to conceal the event for two decades ?
How has it harmed the spirit and morality of this nation ? " she wrote in a paper .
"
If the situation remains the same for another 10 years , 4 June will no longer be a crime that was committed by a small group of people , but one that we all participated in , " she said .
Tiananmen memories : Stories from the square
Survivor 's guilt of exiled student leader
Wu'er Kaixi was one of the most famous student leaders , and while on hunger strike and wearing a hospital gown , he met Li Peng , the premier who subsequently ordered the tanks into Tiananmen Square , in a live TV interview , during which he rebuked Li Peng in a remarkable show of defiance .
He lives in exile in Taiwan , but yesterday tried to turn himself in to the Chinese authorities in Macau in the hope of seeing his parents again .
" Every day for the past 20 years , I have to deal with several kinds of emotion .
Guilt is definitely one very important sensation that I have to deal with every day , survivor 's guilt , the guilt of the captain of the sinking ship , and then , of course , anger , homesickness .
And I guess , the guilt part is going to last as long as I live .
" I was at one of the front lines , at Dongzhimen .
People were stopping the soldiers , imploring them , do n't kill your brothers .
It 's amazing how angry Chinese people were , very emotional , and the retaliation was irrational , unreal , the forces were disproportionate , but it did n't stop people from crying .
" In 1989 we were at no point trying to overthrow the Communist Party .
The mass was very restrained , very rational , very well organised .
There are criticisms that the students pushed the government too far , which led to the massacre .
I strongly object to that .
Blaming the students is like blaming the victim who is being shot for not dodging the bullets fast enough , before blaming those who pulled the trigger . "
' The doctors let my son bleed to death '
Xu Jue is a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences .
" On 21 May 1989 , my son Wu Xiangdong went out with his girlfriend and never came home .
We found a note saying he wanted to make a sacrifice for his country 's democracy and freedom .
We are really proud of him as he was prepared to sacrifice his love for his parents and girlfriend for our country .
He had supported the students ' movement for a while , so I knew he would take part in this .
Then my husband and I went to look for him .
The next time I saw my son was in the hospital .
He had been shot at Muxidi in the city , around 11 pm on 3 June .
But he was not dead .
He was taken to hospital , but the doctor told me he was forbidden to save my son's life .
For two hours they just let him bleed to death ...
It was terribly painful .
Everything changed .
I continuously had severe headaches , I nearly went mad .
The brainwashing began .
Some people began to inform on others .
Beijing was under martial law .
Every night soldiers knocked on people 's doors .
We did not dare to turn on the lights at night .
Some people were taken by the army and beaten severely .
" I was terribly depressed but I had to hide my sorrow .
I even tried to commit suicide .
I put on white clothes and walked through the streets .
There were few other people walking because of martial law .
But I walked through the streets because the soldiers were there , and I wanted them to shoot me . "
20 years of threats and harassment
Pu Ziqiang is now 44 and a lawyer in the city .
" We students only wanted to reform the political system .
We did not cause any riot , rebellion or violent disorder .
I was a graduate student at China University of Political Science and Law and before that I was a middle school teacher for two years .
I did n't hesitate to take part in this movement as I thought it was what I must and should do .
" The government did not list me as a wanted person so I just went back home and resumed my life .
Because of what they have done , reform of the Chinese political system has stagnated for 20 years .
In the past 20 years I have suffered threats and harassment by the police .
Everything the police do to me is illegal .
During those 20 years , I also have thought a lot .
In my view , what we called democracy was kind of empty at that time .
Democracy is specific and concrete .
We did not have a clear target .
It contained more emotion than reason .
But the government did not treat us properly .
It was a crime .
Now my hope is that the government will carry out a thorough investigation of what happened on 4 June . "
' So many died – but our dream lives on '
Wang Dan is an iconic student leader who was twice jailed in China and is still a figurehead for resistance .
He now lives in exile between Los Angeles and Taiwan .
" I was n't on the square on that night , 3 June , I was in Beijing University , so I did n't witness what took place .
The next day , 4 June , some people told me what happened and with some others we escaped to southern China .
I stayed there for about one month , hiding in my friend 's apartment , but then I thought that if I keep on hiding it 's no different from jail .
So I went back to Beijing and I was arrested the very next day , 2 July .
" We escaped to watch what would happen .
We still had some hope .
Maybe there 's some positive change , like the political struggle , maybe the leaders will go in the other direction , but we were wrong .
I was very young .
" I was released in 1993 and imprisoned again in 1995 .
Of course , I could n't shut up .
So many people died and the dream we had was still a dream , I thought it was still my responsibility to fight again .
I did n't want to betray my ideals .
And that 's my belief , to push China to go in the direction of democracy and human rights . "
" Beijing insisted no more than 250 died ...
For many these claims are hard to believe "

The structures could be the best place to search for life Scientists say the possible discovery of mud volcanoes on Mars could boost the search for the planet 's past life .
If life ever existed on Mars , the evidence could be buried deep below the surface , where it may be warm enough for water to remain in a liquid state .
Mud volcanoes could transport rocks from depths of several kilometres up to the surface , where robotic explorers could reach them .
Details were presented at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Texas .
Using images taken by Nasa 's Mars Odyssey spacecraft , Carlton Allen and Dorothy Oehler of Nasa 's Johnson Space Center in Houston identified dozens of mounds in the northern plains of Mars which they say bear a striking resemblance to mud volcanoes .
Infrared data also show the domes cool more quickly at night than the surrounding rock , as one might expect if they were made of sediment .
Together with David Baker from Brown University , the researchers used instruments on Nasa 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) to observe several of these structures in a northern region known as Acidalia Planitia .
Data from the MRO 's Crism experiment indicate that the material in the domes is more oxidised than the rock of the surrounding plains .
This might suggest the presence of iron oxides , which form in the presence of liquid water .
They also took pictures of the structures with the HiRise camera on MRO ; the images show the bright domes standing out against the dark basaltic rock of the surrounding plains .
Dr Allen told BBC
News the structures resembled smooth cones with " no breaks " , which visibly feathered out towards the margins .
The observations , he said , were consistent with material that is " smooth , soft and easily eroded " .
Gas vents
Mud volcanoes are relatively common on Earth On Earth , the largest concentration of mud volcanoes is in Azerbaijan and the adjacent Caspian Sea .
But they have been found at more than 40 sites on land and at more than 20 locations beneath the sea .
They are formed when pressurised gas and liquid from as much as several kilometres down , breach the surface .
They belch out slurries of fluid , mud and rocks , as well as gases such as methane .
" In Azerbaijan , there is so much methane coming out that they can catch fire , " said Dr Allen .
This raises the possibility that mud volcanoes could contribute to the methane observed in the Martian atmosphere .
Methane should last for only a short time in the atmosphere until it is destroyed by sunlight , so its continued presence means it is being replenished by some unknown process .
Dr Allen said the area with the mud volcanoes has not been well surveyed for atmospheric methane .
He said the team had found no evidence that the domes could be active today , as most show clear evidence of erosion .
But he suggested they could have formed in the last 10 million years .
Other researchers caution that other processes such as the retreat of glaciers can form similar mound structures .
But they suggest that , if life does exist deep beneath the Martian surface , mud volcanoes could be one of the best ways to get at the evidence .

The traditional throwing of a bride 's bouquet for luck ended in disaster at an Italian wedding when the flowers caused a plane to crash .
The bride and groom had hired a microlight plane to fly past and throw the bouquet to a line of women guests , Corriere della Sera reported .
However , the flowers were sucked into the plane 's engine causing it to catch fire and explode .
The aircraft plunged into a hostel .
One passenger on the plane was badly hurt .
But about 50 people who had been in the hostel escaped unscathed , as did the pilot .
Entangled
The incident happened at Montioni park in Suvereto , near Livorno , where the wedding reception was being held , Corriere della Sera said .
A passenger on the microlight , named as Isidoro Pensieri , 44 , had the job of throwing the bouquet as pilot Luciano Nannelli flew past .
It is believed the bunch of flowers became entangled as it was thrown , and was sucked into the engine .
Mr Pensieri suffered multiple fractures and a head injury .
He was taken to hospital in Grosseto by helicopter and then transferred to another in Pisa , Italian media reported .
10 Catalyst models in 10 days1
Catchy enough for you ?
I ’ve been lax in my Perl Iron Man participation .
Excepting a recent little 9th grade essay , I ’m way behind so being the over - compensating type let ’s catch - up too much .
10 in 10 on github
Update , July 25 .
The code for this project is in github now — p5 - myapp - 10in10 .
If you have tweaks , corrections , patches , etc , do them against that .
Thank you for your interest in these articles and Catalyst , the best web framework going .
Introduction
This is part gimmick and the code discussions wo n’t be deep but it should be fun for anyone interested and useful for newcomers to Catalyst and Perl hackers looking to blaze into wilder territories .
I feel that the model part of the MVC is the crux of any application and has the most room to play and improve an application .
Your Controllers are half - done from the jump .
If you ’re doing straight HTTP and trying to be REST - ful , the dispatch mostly writes itself .
Your Views are somewhat similar .
JSON or XML or nice bare XHTML .
It ’s neither that difficult nor that likely to be elaborate — well , CSS can be quite elaborate — unless yur doin ’ it rong .
Your Models can handle more and remove the necessity of more logic trees from the app than you ’d expect .
To some degree this is just pushing the complexity around but it ’s the right way , unquestionably2 , to do it .
This list is subject to change but now I ’ve at least committed to ten of them .
Most will be a bit fluffy but the techniques can be used in any Catalyst application and it should give a decent range of things to try and ways to do them .
These will get you thinking about models more as services and maybe get you to approach them more creatively .
Models we ’ll tackle
Random quote .
Moon phase information .
Cover images via Amazon.com ’s APA .
Random numbers and really truly random numbers .
Stock quotes ( Catalyst : : Model : : Adaptor ) .
Log file model ( Apache access log ) .
Page view counter ( SQLite ) .
Graphical title elements .
The Schwartz job queue .
Fixing legacy code by not fixing it .
In the final post I ’ll include the sample code every article as a regular Perl distribution in a Catalyst app so you can run the examples without having to put them together in each article .
Note that manually putting them together is the best way to get the knowledge under your belt .
So play along if you can .
All examples proceed from the following set - up
Some of the display notes reference JavaScript interactive actions .
Your JavaScript is off .
It ’s by no means required but you should enable it in your browser .
I use emacs and that ’s what ’s on the command line examples .
You can use any editor you like , of course .
Create your test application
catalyst.pl MyApp
created " MyApp " created " MyApp / script " created " MyApp/ lib " created " MyApp / root " created " MyApp/ root / static " created " MyApp/ root / static / images " created " MyApp / t " created " MyApp/lib / MyApp " created " MyApp/ lib / MyApp / Model " created " MyApp/ lib / MyApp / View " created " MyApp/ lib / MyApp / Controller " created " MyApp/ myapp.conf " created " MyApp/lib / MyApp.pm " created " MyApp/lib / MyApp / Controller / Root.pm " created " MyApp / README " created " MyApp / Changes " created " MyApp/t/01 app.t " created " MyApp/t/02pod.t " created " MyApp/t/03podcoverage.t " created " MyApp/ root / static / images/catalyst_logo.png " created " MyApp/ root / static / images/btn_120x50_built.png " created " MyApp/ root / static / images/btn_120x50_built_shadow.png " created " MyApp/ root / static / images/btn_120x50_powered.png " created " MyApp/ root / static / images/btn_120x50_powered_shadow.png " created " MyApp/ root / static / images/btn_88x31_built.png " created " MyApp/ root / static / images/btn_88x31_built_shadow.png " created " MyApp/ root / static / images/btn_88x31_powered.png " created " MyApp/root / static/images/btn_88x31_powered_shadow.png " created " MyApp/root / favicon.ico " created " MyApp / Makefile .
PL " created " MyApp / script / myapp_cgi.pl " created " MyApp / script/ myapp_fastcgi.pl " created " MyApp/ script/ myapp_server.pl " created " MyApp/ script/ myapp_test.pl " created " MyApp/ script/ myapp_create.pl "
Make a few local modifications
cd MyApp / rm myapp.conf mv root / static / images root/static/img
That ’s some slight bias on my part .
I hate the Config : : General format and typing “ images ” is much harder than “ img ” if you have to do it a thousand times and the element name is < img /> .
Edit the main application module
We want to use unicode , automatic configuration loading , and static service of images and such when running the test server .
Changing the static include_path is n’t always done but I find it much cleaner and only marginally more verbose to set - up in whatever webserver ( Apache , lighttpd , nginx , varnish , et cetera ) when you are ready to let the static stuff be served appropriately .
This is not discussed in these articles .
emacs lib / MyApp.pm
package MyApp ; use strict ; use warnings ; use Catalyst :: Runtime 5.80 ; use parent qw ( Catalyst ) ; use Catalyst qw ( Unicode ConfigLoader Static :: Simple ) ; our $ VERSION = ' 0.01 ' ; __PACKAGE__ -> config ( name => " 10 Example Catalyst Models , v$ VERSION " , setup_components => { except => qr , [ ^:\w ] , } , static => { include_path => [ __PACKAGE__ -> path_to ( ' root ' , ' static ' ) ] , } , ) ; __PACKAGE__ -> setup ( ) ; 1 ;
Then you can run your test server with the following command and it should nicely restart whenever you make changes –
./script/myapp_server.pl -d -r -p 3000
The -r flag is for “ restart . ”
It ’s one of the best things about Catalyst development if you did n’t already know .
You can develop and see changes instantly ( well , as fast as the server can restart ) and without having to do anything yourself .
Take that , compiled languages .
Note , port 3000 is the default .
It ’s included FYI and so you can tweak without looking it up .
Requirements
One example in particular — the log parser — requires Perl 5.10 as it uses named captures in its regular expression and some 5.10 features ; if you leave that out a high 5.8 or 5.9 should do .
Catalyst 5.8 is required in the Makefile .
PL for MyApp because we use Moose in the log model but everything else will run on 5.7 for sure and the log might just anyway if for some reason you do n’t want to upgrade to 5.8 .
There are a good handful of modules you ’ll need to install to do the various examples .
They ’ll be listed in each article .
You can definitely start with getting to know local : : lib .
It ’s not discussed but it is awesome for setting up local CPAN stuff where you do n’t have root permissions or do n’t want to mess with the environment for other users .
You ’ll have to have these modules installed , at least : Catalyst : : Runtime , Catalyst : : Devel , Catalyst :: Plugin : : Unicode , Catalyst :: Plugin:: ConfigLoader , and Catalyst :: Plugin:: Static :: Simple .
cpan Catalyst :: Runtime Catalyst:: Devel
cpan Catalyst :: Plugin:: Unicode
cpan Catalyst :: Plugin:: ConfigLoader
cpan Catalyst :: Plugin:: Static:: Simple
They come with a long list of dependencies — many modules will need to be installed to run Catalyst .
I used to balk at this .
I do n’t anymore .
The dependencies pull in some awesome code from some really smart hackers .
Trying to replace it yourself or thinking you do n’t need it is developmental suicide .
I have taken to using quite a few of the modules I used to think were overkill — like Path : : Class , URI , and DateTime — in my daily code .
Embrace modern Perl .
It ’s harder at first .
It ’s easier for every moment after that from edits and feature additions to debugging and packaging for distribution .
I also strongly recommend you update to the latest CPAN.pm .
Older ones make some installation issues much more problematic .
cpan CPAN
All articles , including this one are very likely to be updated as we go and I see things that should have been more clear or are plain wrong .
Tune in tomorrow for our first entry — Catalyst Model # 1 : Random quotes .
Child resources of 10 Catalyst models in 10 days1
Last week , Apple released iTunes update 8.2.1 which prevented the Palm Pre from syncing up with iTunes .
Earlier today , Palm responded with an update of its own with the release of webOS 1.1 , an update which , among other things , re-enables the ability of the Pre to sync up with and transfer media files from iTunes .
On its blog , Palm writes :
Oh , and one more thing : Palm webOS 1.1 re-enables Palm media sync .
That ’s right — you once again can have seamless access to your music , photos and videos from the current version of iTunes ( 8.2.1 ) .
I see what you did there , Palm .
Steve Jobs is known for saying “ .. and one more thing ” before he introduces a revolutionary new product , but Palm used the phrase to emphasize the fact that it ’s not gonna lay down and wither in the face of Apple blocking the Pre from syncing up with iTunes .
Oh Palm , your wit knows no bounds !
But in all seriousness , and as we ’ve pointed out before , having the Pre sync up with iTunes seems like an incredibly short - sighted move from Palm .
What happens in 2 weeks when Apple hypothetically updates iTunes again , and once more removes the Pre ’s ability to sync with iTunes ?
Will Palm wait a week and issue another update to combat Apple ’s latest update ?
But more importantly , what happens to all the Palm Pre users who ’ll find themselves stuck in the middle of a Silicon Valley cat and mouse game ?
One week they ’re able to hook up their Pre to iTunes and one week they are n’t – what a horrible situation to for users to get stuck in the middle of , and it makes absolutely zero sense that Palm would subject its users to that .
The online music streaming service Spotify , which has more than two million users in Europe , is recruiting staff for an imminent assault on the US music scene despite admitting that it is struggling to hit its target of making a profit by the end of the year .
Founded by two Swedish entrepreneurs , Spotify provides an online jukebox allowing users to listen to a library of more than six million tracks , funded either by regular advertising breaks or by a monthly subscription for uninterrupted listening .
The model has proved phenomenally popular since its launch in October and has been hailed as a viable alternative to Apple 's iTunes .
On a visit to New York , Spotify 's co-founder , Daniel Ek , told the Observer that he was hiring employees and seeking office space for a launch in the US in the " third or fourth quarter " .
But he revealed that Spotify may not meet its often - stated goal of making a profit by the end of 2009 .
" We still hope to do that , but given the recession and so on , it might take a little longer , " said Ek .
" It may be next year . "
The 26 - year - old entrepreneur has been in negotiations with record labels about extending Spotify 's European licensing deals to stream music in the US market .
He insisted that he remains confident about the company 's financial progress : " Why would I go to the US and try to get more extensive licences if I had trouble covering our costs in Europe ? "
Based in Stockholm but with offices in London , Spotify is viewed in internet circles as one of the most promising start - ups of recent years .
The site is adding 50,000 registered users per day , with members spending an average of an hour a day on the service .
On the day of Michael Jackson 's death , Spotify users in Britain accessed his songs more than 10 million times in 20 hours .
Ek said he was already familiar with most US music publishers because Spotify has negotiated with them over European copyright : " Most of our deals are done from the US anyway so I speak to these people on a weekly basis - I know them , I know their numbers , I know their wives ' names . "
In contrast to the pay - per - download model favoured by iTunes or Amazon 's music store , Spotify supports itself through a choice of radio - style commercial breaks or a monthly fee - set at £ 9.99 in Britain - for an enhanced service with no advertising , higher quality audio and exclusive content .
Spotify 's advertisers in Europe include Nike , Ikea , H&M and Sky Television .
But the company will face competition in the US from rivals such as Pandora , an online personalised radio service ; LaLa , a California - based online music store ; and Imeem , a social networking site specialising in sharing music and video .
Spotify will shortly launch a mobile phone version of its service - a move viewed as crucial by analysts .
Mike McGuire , a digital music expert at research firm Gartner , said : " The mobile element will be an important one to be adding fairly quickly .
We 've seen some decent uptake in music from customers with smart phones . "
Expansion in the US will be through word - of - mouth and viral marketing .
Ek is hoping that social networks such as Twitter will spread the word about Spotify among Americans : " Do n't expect a fancy marketing campaign .
The money we could have spent on marketing is better spent on developing a better product . "
Unusually , Spotify sells its own advertising rather than using an agency to pull in customers .
Ek maintains that Spotify 's strength is its ability to match suitable advertisers closely with the age , location and music tastes of its customers .
" We know for a fact that music history and demographic history can tell you a lot about brand preferences , " he said .
The site has a " click through " rate of about 0.5 % of users who alight on advertisements , although when audio ads are matched with display promotions , this rises to 1 % - higher than most websites .
Ek and his business partner , Martin Lorentzon , who founded e-marketing company TradeDoubler , have invested € 8 m ( £ 6.9 m ) of their own money in Spotify .
Ek was tight - lipped on recent reports that Spotify has put a £ 200 m valuation on itself in a capital - raising effort .
" If someone 's willing to pay £ 200 m for it , that 's what it 's worth .
But would I sell the business for £ 200 m ?
The answer is no , " said Ek .
" If it 's done right , this could be a billion - dollar company . "

From Motorola Dynatac to Apple iPhone , Kyle Bean 's amazing matrioshka models detail the history of cellphone design from 1983 to what looks like 2007 ( that 's a first - generation iPhone if we 're not mistaken ) .
In between are some of the most influential and popular handsets from the intervening 24 years .
Without looking at the Google , I 'm going to see how many I can name .
Second in is the Nokia Cityman from 1987 , second from right is the Razr , before that is the Nokia 3310 ( a slightly squat version ) .
The one in the very center looks like an old Motorola I used to have , and of course we have the Dynatac and iPhone bookending them all .
Anyone recognize the others ?

From the reviews :
The book is , in spite of the author 's more modest claims , an introductory survey of main developments in those disciplines which were particularly important in Medieval Islamic mathematics ...
No knowledge of mathematics ( or of the history of mathematics ) beyond normal high - school level is presupposed , and everything required beyond that ( be it Apollonian theory of conics or the definitions of celestial circles ) is explained carefully and clearly .
Scattered throughout the work are a number of lucid remarks on the character of Islamic mathematics or of mathematical work in general .
The book will hence not only be an excellent textbook for the teaching of the history of mathematics but also for the liberal art aspect of mathematics teaching in general .
- Jens Høyrup , Mathematical Reviews
... as a textbook , this work is highly commendable ...
It is definitely the product of a skillful mathematician who has collected over the years a reasonably large number of interesting problems from medieval Arabic mathematics .
None of them is pursued to exhaustion , but all of them arranged in such a way , together with accompanying exercises , so that they would engage an active mind and introduce a subject , which I am sure the author agrees with me is , at this stage , very difficult to introduce .

The national parties have noticed how close I came last year .
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has listed this race as one of their top eight pick - up opportunities .
And just last week the National Republican Congressional Committee acknowledged that Michele Bachmann is one of their most vulnerable incumbents .
I 've thought a lot about the last campaign , and have sought guidance and insight from many wise and experienced people .
I have learned a lot , I have become a better candidate , and I am using what I 've learned to assemble a team and to run a campaign that can win next November .
I will tell you more about my campaign over the next few days , but I have hired a campaign manager who 's run two straight winning campaigns against incumbent Republican members of Congress , and a team of consultants who over the last two elections have helped defeat dozens of incumbent Republican members of Congress .
The Sixth District of Minnesota needs better representation in Congress .
In my professional life , as a minister , as a mayor , as a leader in transportation , I 've worked to bring people together and build on our common interests and foster trust and cooperation .
Michele Bachmann acts in opposition to those principles , and instead seeks to divide people , to spread cynicism , and instill distrust and exploit differences and fear .
I have a record of accomplishments , while she has a history of embarrassments .
We need someone in Congress who will serve the people of Central Minnesota , and not a small radical fringe motivated by distrust and fear .
In the last two elections eight Democrats who had previously lost to a Republican incumbent were elected to Congress .
I intend to speak with each of these eight members of Congress , to learn from them , and apply the lessons they learned with what I 've learned from my last campaign .
I 'm determined to build a great campaign operation , to work tirelessly , and to take the fight to Michele Bachmann and never let up .
I am running for Congress against Michele Bachmann , and I 'm running to win .
Sincerely ,
El Tinklenberg
P.S. You 'll be hearing more about my campaign over the next few days .
But in the meantime , I 'd love it if you would invest in my victory with an early contribution .
A reason we came up short last time is that so much of our resources came in at the end , so an early contribution will help us take the fight to Michele Bachmann right from the start .
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A bride in Germany spent her wedding night passed out next to a crate of vodka in the back seat of a car and had to be rescued by police when the BMW began to overheat in the sun .
Police in the western city of Cologne said Monday the inebriated 30 - year - old remained unconscious even after they smashed the car window to get her out .
“ Only after being shaken several times did she eventually regain consciousness , ” police said in a statement .
Still clad in her wedding dress , the dazed woman had to scramble through the broken window because she had no idea where the car keys or her husband were , police said .

Ankles provide a rare opportunity to recreate a seminal medical study in the comfort of your own home .
Back in the mid-1960s , a physician , wondering why , after one ankle sprain , his patients so often suffered another , asked the affected patients to stand on their injured leg ( after it was no longer sore ) .
Almost invariably , they wobbled badly , flailing out with their arms and having to put their foot down much sooner than people who ’d never sprained an ankle .
With this simple experiment , the doctor made a critical , if in retrospect , seemingly self - evident discovery .
People with bad ankles have bad balance .
Remarkably , that conclusion , published more than 40 years ago , is only now making its way into the treatment of chronically unstable ankles .
“ I ’m not really sure why it ’s taken so long , ” says Patrick McKeon , an assistant professor in the Division of Athletic Training at the University of Kentucky .
“ Maybe because ankles do n’t get much respect or research money .
They ’re the neglected stepchild of body parts . ”
At the same time , in sports they ’re the most commonly injured body part — each year approximately eight million people sprain an ankle .
Millions of those will then go on to sprain that same ankle , or their other ankle , in the future .
“ The recurrence rate for ankle sprains is at least 30 percent , ” McKeon says , “ and depending on what numbers you use , it may be high as 80 percent . ”
A growing body of research suggests that many of those second ( and often third and fourth ) sprains could be avoided with an easy course of treatment .
Stand on one leg .
Try not to wobble .
Hold for a minute .
Repeat .
Video
This is the essence of balance training , a supremely low - tech but increasingly well - documented approach to dealing with unstable ankles .
A number of studies published since last year have shown that the treatment , simple as it is , can be quite beneficial .
In one of the best - controlled studies to date , 31 young adults with a history of multiple ankle sprains completed four weeks of supervised balance training .
So did a control group with healthy ankles .
The injured started out much shakier than the controls during the exercises .
But by the end of the month , those with wobbly ankles had improved dramatically on all measures of balance .
They also reported , subjectively , that their ankles felt much less likely to give way at any moment .
The control group had improved their balance , too , but only slightly .
Similarly , a major review published last year found that six weeks of balance training , begun soon after a first ankle sprain , substantially reduced the risk of a recurrence .
The training also lessened , at least somewhat , the chances of suffering a first sprain at all .
Why should balance training prevent ankle sprains ?
The reasons are both obvious and quite subtle .
Until recently , clinicians thought that ankle sprains were primarily a matter of overstretched , traumatized ligaments .
Tape or brace the joint , relieve pressure on the sore tissue , and a person should heal fully , they thought .
But that approach ignored the role of the central nervous system , which is intimately tied in to every joint .
“ There are neural receptors in ligaments , ” says Jay Hertel , an associate professor of kinesiology at the University of Virginia and an expert on the ankle .
When you damage the ligament , “ you damage the neuro - receptors as well .
Your brain no longer receives reliable signals ” from the ankle about how your ankle and foot are positioned in relation to the ground .
Your proprioception — your sense of your body ’s position in space — is impaired .
You ’re less stable and more prone to falling over and re-injuring yourself .
For some people , that wobbliness , virtually inevitable for at least a month after an initial ankle sprain , eventually dissipates ; for others it ’s abiding , perhaps even permanent .
Researchers do n’t yet know why some people do n’t recover .
But they do believe that balance training can return the joint and its neuro - receptor function almost to normal .
Best of all , if you do n’t mind your spouse sniggering , you can implement state - of - the - art balance training at home .
“ We have lots of equipment here in our lab ” for patients to test , stress , and improve their balance , Hertel says .
“ But all you really need is some space , a table or wall nearby to steady yourself if needed , and a pillow . ”
( If you ’ve recently sprained your ankle , wait until you comfortably can bear weight on the joint before starting balance training . )
Begin by testing the limits of your equilibrium .
If you can stand sturdily on one leg for a minute , cross your arms over your chest .
If even that ’s undemanding , close your eyes .
Hop .
Or attempt all of these exercises on the pillow , so that the surface beneath you is unstable .
“ One of the take - home exercises we give people is to stand on one leg while brushing your teeth , and to close your eyes if it ’s too easy , ” Hertel says .
“ It may sound ridiculous , but if you do that for two or three minutes a day , you ’re working your balance really well . ”
He said : " It was difficult to produce , there was a little bit of trial and error when it came to binding , as I 'd never tried to produce a book of that scale before .

Last night Karl Rove was on FNC’s The O’Reilly Factor where he appears to have confirmed that the Bush administration routinely hid information from Congress , because they believed that the legislative branch could not be trusted .
Rove stated that it is dangerous to give Congress any information .
This attitude sums up the secrecy of the Bush White House .
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :
Rove said , “ Well , because , look , it ’s interesting .
The CIA briefed Congress to this , I guess , in June .
And the Congress immediately leaks it .
That , itself is , a violation , I think , of several statutes and indicative of why it is so dangerous to give Congress information . ”

He continued , “ Remember , this is about according to The Wall Street Journal a program that was designed and for which people were trained , but a program which was never put into effect .
And so Congress is saying we want you to — we want you to brief us .
We , the left wing in Congress , want you to brief us on ideas you have .
Not necessarily on programs that you executed . ”
Notice Rove ’s choice of words .
He never denied that the Bush administration hid information from Congress , but instead tried to justify why the information was hidden .
This is about as close to a public confirmation as the public will probably get out of Rove as he is staring down the possibility of multiple congressional investigations .
Rove ’s idea that Congress does n’t need to be briefed on ideas is in direct violation of Sec. 501 of the National Security Act of 1947 , which states , “ The President shall ensure that the congressional intelligence committees are kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the United States , including any significant anticipated intelligence activity as required by this title . ”
All presidential administrations worry about Congress leading information , but this not legal justification for secret programs .
Rove dodges the questions about the Bush administration violating their legal responsibility to brief Congress .
Rove tries to blur the issue by making it about briefing the whole Congress .
This is n’t about the congressional leaks .
It is about the Bush administration not following the laws , and as the days pass , it is looking like an investigation will be necessary .

A senior Pakistani official , also speaking on the condition of anonymity because the interchanges with Washington have been both delicate and highly classified , said the American accusation was “ incorrect . ”
The official said that the missile tested was developed by Pakistan , just as it had modified North Korean designs to build a range of land - based missiles that could strike India .
He said that Pakistan had taken the unusual step of agreeing to allow American officials to inspect the country ’s Harpoon inventory to prove that it had not violated the law , a step that administration officials praised .
Some experts are also skeptical of the American claims .
Robert Hewson , editor of Jane ’s Air -Launched Weapons , a yearbook and Web - based data service , said the Harpoon missile did not have the necessary range for a land - attack missile , which would lend credibility to Pakistani claims that they are developing their own new missile .
Moreover , he said , Pakistan already has more modern land - attack missiles that it developed itself or acquired from China .
“ They ’re beyond the need to reverse - engineer old U.S. kit , ” Mr. Hewson said in a telephone interview .
“ They ’re more sophisticated than that . ”
Mr. Hewson said the ship - to - shore missile that Pakistan was testing was part of a concerted effort to develop an array of conventional missiles that could be fired from the air , land or sea to address India ’s much more formidable conventional missile arsenal .
The dispute highlights the level of mistrust that remains between the United States and a Pakistani military that American officials like to portray as an increasingly reliable partner in the effort to root out the forces of the Taliban and Al Qaeda on Pakistani territory .
A central element of the American effort has been to get the military refocused on the internal threat facing the country , rather than on threat the country believes it still faces from India .
Pakistani officials have insisted that they are making that shift .
But the evidence continues to point to heavy investments in both nuclear and conventional weapons that experts say have no utility in the battle against insurgents .
Over the years , the United States has provided a total of 165 Harpoon missiles to Pakistan , including 37 of the older - model weapons that were delivered from 1985 to 1988 , said Charles Taylor , a spokesman for the Defense Security Cooperation Agency .
The country ’s nuclear arsenal is expanding faster than any other nation ’s .
In May , Pakistan conducted a test firing of its Babur medium - range cruise missile , a weapon that military experts say could potentially be tipped with a nuclear warhead .
The test was conducted on May 6 , during a visit to Washington by President Asif Ali Zardari , but was not made public by Pakistani officials until three days after the meetings had ended to avoid upsetting the talks .
While it may be technically possible to arm the Harpoons with small nuclear weapons , outside experts say it would probably not be necessary .

Get used to it : real estate falling into the sea .
And not just beach houses and seaside time - shares .
Think towns and cities .
These images of Shishmaref village on Alaska ’s remote west coast reveal the tip of a terrain melting so fast it will carry whole cultures away with it — rich and poor , polluters and nonpolluters , all vulnerable to the great leveler , the ocean .
You think South Pacific island nations and remote Arctic outposts will be the only victims ?
Wrong .
Because no matter what we do on the carbon emissions front in the coming decades , the world ocean is forecast to warm and rise for the next millennium or more .
Pictures like these will soon be commonplace .
In Shishmaref , calamity has already arrived .
The village of 600 Inupiaq lies on the fragile barrier island of Sarichef , where sea ice forms later each year , exposing the land to autumn storms that carve away 50 feet or more of shoreline a season .
Two houses have slipped into the sea ; 18 others have been moved back from the encroaching ocean ; others buckle from the melting permafrost .
Ten million dollars has been spent on seawalls , to no avail .
Residents have concluded permanent resettlement is their only option .
But considering America has yet to seriously tackle New Orleans ’ sea - level problems , no one on this distant edge of the Chukchi Sea imagines the $ 180 million needed to relocate Shishmaref will be easy to come by .
And Shishmaref is not alone .
A 2004 Government Accountability Office report found that of Alaska ’s 213 Native villages , 184 are battling floods and erosion , while another assessment foresees that in the coming decades , Alaska will require $ 6.1 billion to repair global warming ’s domino effect of fallen bridges , burst sewer pipes , and disintegrating roads .
Worldwide , the situation is more dire , more expensive : Oxfam suggests the United States owes $ 22 billion , or 44 percent — our polluting share — of the $ 50 billion needed each year for poor nations to adapt to climate change .
We are taught in school that the Earth has a closed hydrologic system ; water is continually being recycled through rain and evaporation and none of it leaves the planet ’s atmosphere .
Not only is there the same amount of water on the Earth today as there was at the creation of the planet , it ’s the same water .
The next time you ’re walking in the rain , stop and think that some of the water falling on you ran through the blood of dinosaurs or swelled the tears of children who lived thousands of years ago .
While there will always be the same amount of water , we can render water unusable for ourselves and for the planet .
The growing scarcity of potable water stems from a variety of causes .
Per capita water consumption is doubling every 20 years , more than twice the rate of human population growth , which itself is exploding .
Technology and sanitation systems , particularly those in the wealthy industrialized nations , have encouraged people to use far more water than they need .
Yet even with this increase in personal water use , households and municipalities account for only 10 percent of water use .
Industry claims 20 to 25 percent of the world ’s fresh water supplies , and its demands are dramatically increasing .
Many of the world ’s fastest growing industries are water intensive .
For example , in the U.S. alone , the computer industry will soon use over 396 billion gallons of water each year .
Nonetheless , it is irrigation that is the real water hog , claiming 65 to 70 percent of all water used by humans .
Increasing amounts of irrigation water are used for industrial farming .
These water - intensive corporate farming practices are subsidized by governments and their taxpayers , and this creates a strong disincentive for farm operations to move to conservation practices such as drip irrigation .
Along with population growth and increasing per capita water consumption , massive pollution of the world ’s surface water systems has placed a great strain on remaining supplies of clean fresh water .
Global deforestation , destruction of wetlands , dumping of pesticides and fertilizer into waterways , and global warming are all taking a terrible toll on the Earth ’s fragile water systems .
The world is running out of fresh water .
By the year 2025 , there will be 2.6 billion more people on Earth than there are today .
As many as two - thirds of those people will be living in conditions of serious water shortage , and one - third will be living with absolute water scarcity .
Demand for water will exceed availability by 56 percent .
Water as a commodity
The combination of increasing demand and shrinking supply has attracted the interest of global corporations who want to sell water for a profit .
The water industry is touted by the World Bank as a potential trillion - dollar industry .
Water has become the “ blue gold ” of the 21st century .
The move to privatize water coincides with the rise of the Washington Consensus as the dominant world economic philosophy .
This philosophy calls for trade and investment liberalization , and turning responsibility for social programs and resource management over to the private sector .
In this case , it is an assault on the ancient commons of water .
Global trade agreements have become perhaps the most important tool for corporations trading in water and their allies .
All of the multinational governing bodies , the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs ( GATT ) , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , define water as a commodity .
As a result , water is now subject to the same rules and regulations governing other commodities like oil and natural gas .
Under these combined international rules , a country cannot prohibit or limit the export of water without risking censure by the WTO .
Nations are also restricted from denying the import of water from any country .
NAFTA ’s “ proportionality clause ” means that if a country turns on the tap to export its natural resources , it cannot turn off the tap until it runs out of that resource .
In addition , the push to privatize water services will be greatly enhanced by new rules governing cross - border trade in services at the WTO , known as the GATS ( General Agreement on Trade in Services ) .
Under the proposed GATS rules , not only will governments face added pressures to deregulate and privatize their water systems , but once a city ’s water services have been taken over by a foreign - based corporation , efforts to take these services back into public hands will invite severe economic penalties under the WTO .
Leading the charge for privatization are three big transnational corporations based in Europe : Vivendi , Suez , and RWE .
All three have systematically bought out smaller rivals to become the dominate powers in the business of water all over the globe .
The long - range strategy of these companies began with their efforts to take over the public water systems in Third World countries where they hoped to position themselves as the saviors of the water crisis .
Instead , a series of private - sector fiascoes in the Third World derailed their plans .
The case of Buenos Aires is especially instructive .
Buenos Aires was to be the flagship operation of Third - World water privatization .
Suez , through its subsidiary Aguas Argentinas , took over the Buenos Aires water and sewage system in 1992 .
A common argument for privatizing water systems is that , unlike the cash - strapped public sector , the private sector has the capital necessary to update or refurbish aging water systems .
But public sources like the World Bank , International Monetary Fund , and other smaller banks supplied 97 percent of the $ 1 billion necessary for the Suez privatization experiment .
Suez did expand water and sewage service by a small increment , but failed to meet its projected targets in both areas .
Nonetheless , the company managed to reap annual profits of around 25 percent in the mid-1990s .
Recently , Suez announced that it plans to pull out of Argentina because the country ’s currency crisis has cut into its profits .
There have been other private - sector fiascoes in places like Johannesburg , New Delhi , Manila , and most famously in Cochabamba , Bolivia .
The effort to privatize Third World water systems has become a target of civil society protests .
Representatives of an international civil society network appeared at a meeting of chief executive officers at the World Water Forum in Kyoto , Japan , in March .
The group took over the microphones and offered a series of testimonials about the impact of water privatization around the world .
Toward the end of the event , a water activist from Cancun , Mexico , stepped to the microphone and held up a glass of pitch - black , putrid - smelling water .
He explained that he had taken the water from his home tap in Cancun , where Suez runs the municipal water system .
He then requested that the moderator pass the glass of black , smelly water up on stage to the CEO of Suez , inviting him to drink it .
Targeting First World water
The big water companies are now changing their strategy and concentrating their operations and their investment on more secure markets in North America and Europe .
Eighty - five percent of all water services in the U.S. are still in public hands .
That ’s a tempting target for conglomerates like Suez , Vivendi , and RWE .
Within the next 10 years , they aim to control 70 percent of water services across the United States .
They have positioned themselves to move aggressively .
Vivendi , Suez , and RWE have bought up the leading U.S. water companies , U.S. Filter , United Water , and American Water Works , respectively .
These water companies had largely serviced small towns and communities , but under the tutelage of the global giants they have become the engines for privatization in the United States ( see page 16 ) .
When transnational water conglomerates take over a municipal water system , it feels like a local problem , but because the same corporate players are targeting communities all over the world , we must build alliances and connections , learn from one another , and start to build a frontal attack .
At the Polaris Institute , we propose a three - pronged strategy .
First , develop a water - alert network so we can know where companies are operating and where they are going next .
How are they going to move ?
And how can we get ahead of them ?
Second , we need water - action teams that bring citizens together to build local water - watch coalitions and develop campaigns to protect their water supplies and services from conglomerates .
Then we should link those local campaigns with the national campaigns of groups like Public Citizen or the Council of Canadians .
Third , we need to offer alternatives .
It is not enough to say we want to defend our public water systems against private takeovers .
There are problems with public water systems , and we must find new ways of revitalizing them in our own communities through citizen participation .
Engaged citizens can act as watchdogs for their local water systems .
Our local actions should be informed by three global principles .
One is water conservation .
We cannot kid ourselves about water scarcity .
Water may be abundant in one place , but it ’s scarce in others .
Water conservation must be a top priority .
The second principle is that water is a fundamental human right .
People need water to live .
Water must be provided equitably to all people and not on the basis of the ability to pay .
The third principle is water democracy .
We cannot leave the management of our most precious resource in the hands of bureaucrats in government or the private corporations , whether or not they are well intentioned .
We , the people , must preserve this special trust , we must fight for it , and we must take our proper role and demand water democracy .
Uh oh Microsoft , this can't be good news .
HTC , the premier manufacturer of Windows Mobile cellphones is rumored to be shifting half of its handsets to Google 's Android OS in 2010 .
To put this in perspective , HTC lists 28 devices on its European website and of those , just 2 run Android , the rest are WinMo. DigiTimes ' sources also claim that HTC is on track to make 30 % of its 2009 handsets Android - based which means that several of Andy Rubin 's 15 to 20 Android handsets coming this year would have to be HTC branded for this to be true .
DigiTimes also claims that HTC will launch a handset that 's simultaneously a " high - profile 3G handset " and " entry - level model " with touchscreen and TouchFlo 3D / Sense UI .
HTC is said to achieve this seemingly contradictory feat by basing the handset on Qualcomm 's BREW Mobile Platform when it launches in September or October .
Of course , none of this is confirmed , but will undoubtedly be a topic of discussion when HTC reports earnings on July 30th .
So says Fox News Channel Legal Analyst , and former Judge , Andrew Napolitano :
Civil liberties attorney Harvey Silvergate agrees :
Under well - established First Amendment jurisprudence , what Gates said to Crowley–even assuming the worst–is fully constitutionally protected .
After all , even “ offensive ” speech is covered by the First Amendment ’s very broad umbrella (…)
Today , the law recognizes only four exceptions to the First Amendment ’s protection for free speech : ( 1 ) speech posing the “ clear and present danger ” of imminent violence or lawless action posited by Holmes , ( 2 ) disclosures threatening “ national security , ” ( 3 ) “ obscenity ” and ( 4 ) so - called “ fighting words ” that would provoke a reasonable person to an imminent , violent response .
As Silvergate goes on to discuss in an article well - worth reading , none of these four exceptions can reasonably be said to have applied to the confrontation between Crowley and Gates .
Additionally , as Jacob Sullum notes , neither would Massachusetts state law on disorderly conduct justify the arrest in this case :
In Massachusetts , as in many states , the definition of disorderly conduct is drawn from the American Law Institute ’s Model Penal Code .
A person is considered disorderly if he “ engages in fighting or threatening , violent or tumultuous behavior … with purpose to cause public inconvenience , annoyance or alarm ” or “ recklessly creates a risk thereof . ”
Crowley claims
Gates recklessly created public alarm by haranguing him from the porch of his house , attracting a small crowd that included “ at least seven unidentified passers - by ” as well as several police officers .
Yet it was Crowley who suggested that Gates follow him outside , thereby setting him up for the disorderly conduct charge .
It ’s hard to escape the conclusion that Crowley was angered and embarrassed by Gates ’ “ outburst ” and therefore sought to create a pretext for arresting him .
“ When he has the uniform on , ” Crowley ’s wife later told The New York Times , “ Jim has an expectation of deference . ”
As the Massachusetts Appeals Court has noted , “ the theory behind criminalizing disorderly conduct rests on the tendency of the actor ’s conduct to provoke violence in others . ”
Yet police officers often seem to think the purpose of such laws is to punish people for talking back to cops .
And yet , that ’s not what the law says , as Massachusetts ’ highest Court has recognized :
The officers ’ presence , alone , did not suffice to prove the public element , regardless of any concern they may have felt as they witnessed the defendant ’s confrontation with Sergeant Boss .
As recognized in the commentaries to the Model Penal Code , behavior that has an impact only upon members of the police force is significantly different from that affecting other citizens in at least two respects : it is an unfortunate but inherent part of a police officer ’s job to be in the presence of distraught individuals ; and , to the extent that the theory behind criminalizing disorderly conduct rests on the tendency of the actor ’s conduct to provoke violence in others , “ one must suppose that [ police officers ] , employed and trained to maintain order , would be least likely to be provoked to disorderly responses . ”
Model Penal Code § 250.2 comment 7 , at 350 .
Accordingly , police presence in and of itself does not turn an otherwise purely private outburst into disorderly conduct .
( 9 )
In other words , the mere act of talking back to a cop does not constitute a crime and should not justify arrest .
Gates was a hothead , but Crowley stepped outside the bounds of his Constitutionally - limited authority .
August 29 2009 CNN
( Heather ) : Well , it looks like the Secret Service has paid someone a visit .
Good .
That 's the least they should be doing .
This is important .
This , my friends , I believe you will agree , is chilling .
You may remember that we heard him say on camera that he is prepared to resort to forceful resistance against the Obama administration .
Now , today , I want to tell you about the church that that man attends .
And , in particular , I am going to play for you parts of the sermon that were delivered from the pulpit on the very day before the president arrived in Phoenix , Arizona .
Now , I need to have you keep in mind today as we add details to this story of what we 're going to share with you here .
I want to take you back 11 days ago , when Mr. Obama visited Phoenix , Arizona .
Do you remember this man ?
He 's one of a dozen or so people who carried guns to that presidential event that we have been checking on .
A CNN source with very close to the U.S. Secret Service confirmed to me today that threats on the life of the president of the United States have now risen by as much as 400 percent since his inauguration , 400 percent death threats against Barack Obama -- quote -- " in this environment " go far beyond anything the Secret Service has seen with any other president .
It is my duty as a journalist to make you aware of a deeply disturbing trend taking that is taking place in our country and how it ironically folds into yet another story that I shared with you just last week .
SANCHEZ : All right .
Hello again , everybody .
I 'm Rick Sanchez with the next generation of news .
This is a conversation .
It is not a speech .
And it is your turn to get involved .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
PASTOR STEVEN ANDERSON , FAITHFUL WORD BAPTIST CHURCH :
Tonight , I want to preach this sermon .
And you have probably never heard a sermon like this before .
Actually , you probably have if you have been coming to church here for a while .
But you know what ?
Here is my sermon , why I hate Barack Obama .
That 's my sermon tonight , because Barack Obama is coming to town tomorrow morning .
Barack Obama is coming to town .
And he is going to be here tomorrow morning .
Who knew that he was coming to town ?
I did n't know .
I just found out recently with his health care and everything like this .
And I 'm going to tell you something .
I hate Barack Obama .
You say , well , you just mean you do n't like what he stands for .
No , I hate the person .
Oh , you mean you just do n't like his policies .
No , I hate him .
( END AUDIO CLIP )
SANCHEZ : There is more and it is much worse .
First , I want you to know the voice you heard there was that of Pastor Steven Anderson of the Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe , Arizona .
On the day before the president 's visit , Mr. Anderson told his parishioners that he hates Barack Obama and wants him dead .
This was Anderson from the pulpit saying the president deserves to die for supporting abortion rights .
That is what he means when he uses the word violence .
All right .
Here is some more .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
ANDERSON : What goes around comes around .
You love violence .
You hate that which is right .
You love to harm others .
You love to hurt or kill the unborn or the innocent or the righteous .
He is saying , God is going to bring that upon your own head , because whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap .
Now , turn back to Psalm 58 and let me ask you this question .
Why should Barack Obama melt like a snail ?
Why should Barack Obama die like the untimely birth of a woman ?
Why should his children be fatherless and his wife a widow , as we read in this passage ?
Well , I will tell you why .
Because , since Barack Obama thinks it is OK to use a salty solution , right , to abort the unborn , because that 's how abortions are done , my friend , using salt -- and I would like to see Barack Obama melt like a snail tonight .

SANCHEZ : Joining me from New York , a man who used to work for the U.S. Secret Service .
He is Scott Alswang .
He personally guarded Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush .
Thank you , sir , for being with us .
SCOTT ALSWANG , FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT :
Thank you , Rick .
SANCHEZ : We are also going to be joined by Mike Brooks , who is standing right here next to me who has been digging down on this story .
Mike , thank you for being here .
MIKE BROOKS , CNN SECURITY ANALYST : Sure .
SANCHEZ : This looks serious .
This almost looks like this is coming to the point where we are even beyond maybe where this nation was on November 22 of 1963 , when JFK was assassinated , when there was also an environment of hate in this country .
When you hear that , what are your thoughts ?
ALSWANG : Well , I 'm confident that my former organization , the Secret Service , is doing everything they can to keep the president and his family safe .
There are a lot of people that like attention in these cases .
SANCHEZ : What about this case ?
Do you know if the Secret Service has knocked on this pastor 's door ?
Should they be knocking on this pastor 's door ?
ALSWANG : I am confident that they have already knocked on his door , that through counterpart means in local and state and federal authorities , that this has come to be explained to .
And for the media to bring it out , I definitely think that it has come to their attention .
SANCHEZ : Mike , were you going to add something to that ?
BROOKS : No , no , I have been talking to some folks .
And he has been interviewed by the U.S. Secret Service .
But , boy , he walks the fine line .
And , Scott , you will agree with me .
I was with the Metropolitan Police who worked on the presidential and vice presidential details when I was there for 26 years .
And I can tell you , we used to run into people like this all the time , who knew how to walk that fine line without making a direct threat .
And that 's what he did ...
( CROSSTALK )
SANCHEZ : Well , hold on a minute .
Here is Statute 18 , U.S. Code , Section 871 .
We looked it up today , about threatening the president of the United States .
It is against the law to do so , as I 'm sure you both know and I am just recently becoming expert on .
( CROSSTALK )
SANCHEZ : Let me read you the quote : " Whoever knowingly and willfully threatening to take the life of , to kidnap , or to inflict bodily harm upon the president of the United States . "
That 's the way we were able to decipher those words .
It sounds like both of you are saying that this man directly is not doing that .
Is that right , Mr. Alswang ?
ALSWANG : He is walking a fine line .
The problem I have with it is that he seems to be inciting his congregation to go and act in a direction toward the president .
And that , at least on a local level , would seem to me to be an inciting charge .
And if someone in that congregation had mental disabilities or were prone toward violence or had a direction of interest toward the president or his family , there could be grave consequences .
SANCHEZ : Well , that 's interesting .
Let me show the viewers something .
Do we have that shot of Chris ?
Chris is the guy , Chris Broughton .
It 's taken us a long time to dig down and find out who this guy is .
Chris Broughton is that gentleman who had an AR - 14 , right , Mike ?
BROOKS : AR - 15 type weapon .
SANCHEZ : AR - 15 , sorry .
There he is right there .
He is outside where the president was speaking .
We have found out that Chris was actually in attendance when that sermon was given on the eve of the president 's arrival .
Now , let 's listen to just a little bit more of that sermon , as we consider that chilling thought .
( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP )
ANDERSON : You are going to tell me that I 'm supposed to pray for the socialist devil , murderer , infanticide who wants to see young children and he wants to see babies killed through abortion and partial - birth ( INAUDIBLE ) everything ?
You are going to tell me I am supposed to pray for God to give him a good lunch tomorrow while he's in Phoenix , Arizona ?
No .
I am not going to pray for his good .
I am going to pray that he dies and goes to hell .
( END AUDIO CLIP )
SANCHEZ : And , by the way , I should add once again that I have reached out to the pastor today .
He has agreed that he will join us , he will talk to me on this show , most likely over either the weekend or Monday , was not able to do so today , because we want to reach out to him .
It 's interesting as you listen to the last words there .
Let me read those back to you .
" I am going to pray for his good " --
" I 'm not going to pray for his good .
I am going to pray that he dies and goes to hell . "
Again , most of us law - abiding Americans listen to those words and we start to get worried for our president , whether he is a Democrat or a Republican or what he is .
What is Secret Service 's responsibility with people like this ?
And what are your concerns ?
High - rises on hold :
What to do with empty lots ?
DEVELOPMENT
The vacant lot sits idle at 535 Mission St. on , Saturday June 27 , 2009 , in San Francisco , Calif .

What to do with empty lots ?
1 / 9 Back to Gallery
The high - rise boom has gone quiet , and a new challenge faces San Francisco : deciding what to do with land cleared for towers that may not rise for another decade - if at all .
At least a dozen large development sites in the city 's South of Market district now sit empty or covered by asphalt because of the recession .
If history is any guide , developers will either leave them fenced off or use them as parking lots .
But there 's another alternative - one that , if successful , could influence cities across the nation .
With ingenuity and a modest investment , San Francisco could breathe life into these voids until the demand for development returns .
Some could be landscaped with fast - growing trees and shrubs that offer environmental benefits .
Others could display art or offer casual spots for social interaction .
There are no clear models to follow :
Any initiative must be acceptable to landowners , with details worked out in advance regarding such issues as maintenance and security .
Done well , though , the payoff could far exceed the cost - creating short - term showcases rather than blight that drags its neighbors down .
Big plans laid low
Parcels stranded by the boom - turned - bust can be seen across the city , but two especially vivid examples are on display at either end of San Francisco 's zone of high - rise change , the terrain south of Market Street bounded by the bay , South Van Ness Avenue and Interstate 80 .
One is the northeast corner of Harrison and Fremont streets on Rincon Hill , where cars spill from a Bay Bridge off - ramp .
The other is the southwest corner of 10th and Market streets , a portal for drivers heading in from the city 's western neighborhoods .
Each site was cleared of buildings last year , and the owners have permission to construct towers .
Yet each sits in limbo , empty and grim .
At 10th and Market , where 35 - and 19 - story towers would contain 719 condominiums , bricks are stacked crudely along the edge of a craterlike concrete basement - all that remains of the bank operations center that occupied the corner for decades .
Even the foundations are gone at 399 Fremont St . And instead of 393 condominiums in a 41 - story tower , there 's a terraced excavation longer than a football field , covered by sand , rubble and straggly weeds .
These sites are conspicuous , but hardly unique : Open parcels throughout the neighborhood have building proposals in the works .
Some were cleared recently , others predate the boom .
None is likely to be filled anytime soon .
" We are seeing a lull " that in many cases could last several years , said John Rahaim , the city 's planning director .
" There 's the credit crunch as well as the housing slump . "
Experimentation elsewhere
The construction freeze is n't confined to San Francisco .
And most cities respond the same way - giving developers extra time to break ground while , often , allowing interim use as parking lots .
On Rincon Hill , for instance , developers are required to start construction within 18 months of receiving their planning approvals .
If there are delays , they can request a procession of 12 - month extensions .
That 's what happened last month for two Rincon sites , including 399 Fremont .
The Planning Commission voted to extend the approvals , stipulating that the lots be kept free of trash and graffiti and asking owners to come back with ideas on how to make things a bit more scenic .
In other cities , you 'll find more novel efforts to fill in the blanks .
-- In New York , sculpture exhibitions may adorn a large downtown site .
The concept is the brainchild of owner Trinity Real Estate and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council , though details are still being worked out .
-- In Miami , elected Commissioner Marc Sarnoff has offered developers a deal :
The city will rent empty sites at $ 1 a year to create temporary parks .
The developers would help fund the landscaping , but their entitlements would remain for the life of the lease .
-- After the recession stalled a hotel one block from Seattle 's Pike Place Market , developer Urban Visions let food vendors use a portion of the parking lot to serve up barbecued pork in May .
" This is a horizontal canvas we 're playing with , " said Urban Visions ' Greg Smith .
" Someday the highest and best use of this corner is a more urban development .
In the meantime , this is a way to bring energy and life without a 20 - year investment . "
The one initiative in San Francisco concerns Octavia Boulevard , the four - block roadway created after the Central Freeway was removed in 2003 .
Six years later , the city 's vision of midrise housing along the boulevard remains elusive - causing frustrated neighbors to suggest that for now , some of the lots could serve as dog parks or community gardens .
" Our starting point is , how do you make a problem into an opportunity ? " said Jim Warshell of the Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association .
" What 's there is ugly , as opposed to an asset . "
Alternatives to asphalt
Octavia offers a promising start :
The lots are city - owned and relatively small .
But the stakes are higher south of Market Street .
As long as prominent sites sit neglected in emerging districts like Rincon Hill , they 're dampers on change .
Imagine if , instead , the city loosened its rules to allow development rights to be extended three or five years - but only if developers in return allow interim landscapes on their land .
This does n't mean extravagant plantings .
On a half - acre lot , for instance , it would cost less than $ 2,000 to install an irrigation system .
Cover the site with fast - growing trees like Brisbane box , and within three years there 'd be a leafy bosque taking carbon from the air and sending fresh oxygen toward passers - by .
A developer seeking favorable attention could instead offer a site on a rotating basis to local artists or landscape architects .
Doug Wildmon of Friends of the Urban Forest offers another concept : Join up with a youth job - training program and run a tree farm .
Chilean soapbark - well suited to serve as a street tree - could be arrayed in 7 - gallon boxes at a cost of $ 50 per tree .
With the proper care , in three years they'd be 12 feet tall - and ready to be sold at a wholesale cost of $ 150 each .
" You either get fast - growing trees and pulp them , or container trees that increase in size and can be planted somewhere else , " Wildmon concluded .
Planning Director Rahaim said the city is open to creative short - term uses .
" The challenge is to make these parcels visually attractive while still sending a message that they 're temporary , " Rahaim said .
At the very least , " it 's incumbent on us to work with developers to clean them up , make sure they 're safe and not a haven for illegal acts . "
Economic tumult aside , today 's urban centers are being redefined in remarkable and lasting ways .
Neighborhoods are no longer defined by only one or two activities .
The blocks south of Market Street offer an increasingly fine - grain blend of culture , commerce and housing .
More and more , that 's what people want .
The future of healthy urban centers is the attraction of the place itself .
Large empty lots - whether filled with cars or covered with weeds - detract from what can be .
Conversely , imaginative use of prominent spaces could signal that San Francisco is a city of innovation , where unpredictability is part of the allure .
It deserves a try .
When plans go awry , lots empty for years Developers talk of empty lots as short - term blanks , sure to be filled when the economy shifts .
But " temporary " conditions have a way of becoming permanent , as these two parcels show .

If someone had planted and tended a redwood tree at the northwest corner of Pine and Kearny streets when the site was cleared in the 1970s , by now it could be a statuesque counterpoint to the Bank of America tower across the street .
Instead , the fenced - off lot sits mangy and unkempt .
The site was owned for decades by powerhouse developer Walter Shorenstein , who filed a lawsuit in 1981 to block San Francisco 's transit fee on new buildings .
Not only did the city triumph , it then said that Shorenstein could n't proceed with plans for a tower at this corner because it would cast a shadow on nearby St. Mary 's Square .
" Now , our inclination is to do nothing , " he sniffed at the time .
The lot recently changed hands , but it 's still forlorn , and long overdue for spiffing up .
--
Looking at the small parking lot at 524 Howard St. , you would n't know this midblock site was approved for a 23 - story tower - in 1989 .
That developer has come and gone since then , as have two others , with construction never quite getting started .
The current owner made noise in 2007 about hiring New York architect Richard Meier to produce a sleek new design - but that was before the economic tide went out yet again .
Is there still an entitled project ?
The city says no , the developer 's attorney says yes .
One thing is certain :
The parking lot wo n't disappear anytime soon .

In Australia , an oversupply crisis has led to a situation where wine prices are being pushed down to such a level that they became cheaper than some bottled water .
The wine industry faces an unprecedented meltdown and a fire - sale of unprofitable vineyards .
Price collapse and over - planting have forced players to sell many of their unprofitable vineyards .
A detailed report suggests that the fire - sale of vineyards and plummeting prices is the reality check the industry had to have .
Anyway , if you get wine cheaper than water , would you like to change your drinking behavior by replacing water with wine ?

It 's pretty well - known that Hitler and his propaganda minister , Paul Joseph Goebbels , looked to American advertising for inspiration .
What I did n't realize was how proud the advertising industry was about it .
In its July 20 , 1933 , issue , Printers '
Ink , one of the lead advertising trade journals of its time , speaks approvingly of Hitler 's methods :
[ Hitler ] has depended almost entirely upon slogans made effective by reiteration , made general by American advertising methods … [ S] logans on billboards and newspapers and in publications of national circulation have made a new Germany which has raised much excitement , made many changes .
Many changes , indeed .
And many more to come !
It continues :
" As is well known , the word propaganda in Germany is used synonymously with the word advertising .
Although in this country and in Great Britain propaganda has the unfortunate connotation of being free instead of being paid for , this distinction does not exist in Germany . "
Ah , yes , that unfortunate connotation of freedom !
Interesting that this is the only negative connotation of " propaganda " at this time .
In fact , the ( American ) author makes sure to point out that in the Hitler speech that follows the word " propaganda " should be read as " advertising . "
Apparently , the trade mag wants credit for schooling the Führer .
The article then goes on to quote Hitler at length talking about something that Americans who worked in advertising at the time already believed : that the masses are morons who respond only to simple messages repeated thousands of times ( a perspective I discuss at length in my book ) .
Seventy - some years later , this belief is as popular with the powers that be as it was in 1933 .
Which , if nothing else , provides a shred of evidence connecting the makers of the Head - On commercial to the Nazis .
One thing is for sure , people love to eat , and even more individuals still love the amazingly greasy Bacon strips … enough to get a colorful tattoo immortalized on their arm for all to see .
As if Bacon accessories such as the Bacon Wallet or the Bacon Skateboard are n’t enough to profess your love for the All American breakfast meat , Friendly Fire had to scar their own skin ( meat and flesh ) with a crazy and geeky tattoo .
Better yet , such a food item to be so close to the hairy armpit is another thing that raises a question of the individual ’s own sanity .
Still , since people love tattoos and Bacon so much , it probably ends up as one of those : “ Man !
That thing is awesome , but I would n’t get it myself ” .
Which does n’t really say anything about the actual artwork , does it ?

AMERICA'S recent history has been a relentless tilt to the West — of people , ideas , commerce and even political power .
California and Texas , the nation 's two biggest states , are the twin poles of the West , but very different ones .
For most of the 20th century the home of Silicon Valley and Hollywood has been the brainier , sexier , trendier of the two : its suburbs and freeways , its fads and foibles , its marvellous miscegenation have spread around the world .
Texas , once a part of the Confederacy , has trailed behind : its cliché has been a conservative Christian in cowboy boots , much like a certain recent president .
But twins can change places .
Is that happening now ?
It is easy to find evidence that California is in a funk ( see article ) .
At the start of this month the once golden state started paying creditors , including those owed tax refunds , business suppliers and students expecting grants , in IOUs .
California 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , also said that the gap between projected outgoings and income for the current fiscal year has leapt to a horrible $ 26 billion .
With no sign of a new budget to close this chasm , one credit agency has already downgraded California 's debt .
As budgets are cut , universities will let in fewer students , prisoners will be released early and schemes to protect the vulnerable will be rolled back .
They paved paradise and put up the parking taxes
Plenty of American states have budget crises ; but California 's illustrate two more structural worries about the state .
Back in its golden age in the 1950s and 1960s , it offered middle - class people , not just techy high - fliers , a shot at the American dream — complete with superb schools and universities , and an enviable physical infrastructure .
These days California 's unemployment rate is running at 11.5 % , two points ahead of the national average .
In such Californian cities as Fresno , Merced and El Centro , jobless rates are higher than in Detroit .
Its roads and schools are crumbling .
Every year , over 100,000 more Americans leave the state than enter it .
The second worry has to do with dysfunctional government .
No state has quite so many overlapping systems of accountability or such a gerrymandered legislature .
Ballot initiatives , the crack cocaine of democracy , have left only around a quarter of its budget within the power of its representative politicians .
( One reason budget cuts are inevitable is that voters rejected tax increases in a package of ballot measures in May . )
Not that Californian government comes cheap : it has the second - highest top level of state income tax in America ( after Hawaii , of all places ) .
Indeed , high taxes , coupled with intrusive regulation of business and greenery taken to silly extremes , have gradually strangled what was once America 's most dynamic state economy .
Chief Executive magazine , to take just one example , has ranked California the very worst state to do business in for each of the past four years .
By contrast , Texas was the best state in that poll .
It has coped well with the recession , with an unemployment rate two points below the national average and one of the lowest rates of housing repossession .
In part this is because Texan banks , hard hit in the last property bust , did not overexpand this time .
But as our special report this week explains , Texas also clearly offers a different model , based on small government .
It has no state capital - gains or income tax , and a business - friendly and immigrant - tolerant attitude .
It is home to more Fortune 500 companies than any other state — 64 compared with California 's 51 and New York 's 56 .
And as happens to fashionable places , some erstwhile weaknesses now seem strengths ( flat , ugly countryside makes it easier for Dallas - Fort Worth to expand than mountain - and - sea - locked LA ) , while old conservative stereotypes are being questioned : two leading contenders to be Houston 's next mayor are a black man and a white lesbian .
Texas also gets on better with Mexico than California does .
American conservatives have seized on this reversal of fortune : Arthur Laffer , a Reaganite economist , hails the Texan model over the Gipper 's now hopelessly leftish home .
Despite all this , it still seems too early to cede America 's future to the Lone Star state .
To begin with , that lean Texan model has its own problems .
It has not invested enough in education , and many experts rightly worry about a “ lost generation ” of mostly Hispanic Texans with insufficient skills for the demands of the knowledge economy .
Now immigration is likely to reconvert Texas from Republican red to Democratic blue ; Latinos may justly demand a bigger , more “ Californian ” state to educate them and provide them with decent health care .
But Texas could then end up with the same over - empowered public - sector unions who have helped wreck government in California .
Second , it has never paid to bet against a state with as many inventive people as California .
Even if Hollywood is in the dumps ( see article ) , it still boasts an unequalled array of sunrise industries and the most agile venture - capital industry on the planet ; there is no prospect of the likes of Google decamping from Mountain View for Austin , though many start - ups have .
The state also has an awesome ability to reinvent itself — as it did when its defence industry collapsed at the end of the cold war .
Perhaps the rejection of tax increases will “ starve the beast ” and promote structural reform .
A referendum on a new primaries system could end its polarised politics .
Mr Schwarzenegger 's lazy governorship could come to be seen not as the great missed opportunity , but as the spur for reform .
Fifty laboratories , one magic formula
The truth is that both states could learn from each other .
Texas still lacks California 's great universities and lags in terms of culture .
California could adopt not just Texas 's leaner state , but also its more bipartisan approach to politics and its more welcoming attitude towards Mexico .
There is no perfect model of government : it is America 's genius to have 50 public - policy laboratories competing to find out what works best — just as it is the relentless competition of clever new firms from Portland to Pittsburgh that will pull the country out of its current gloom .
But , to give Texas some credit and serve as a warning to Mr Schwarzenegger 's heir , at this moment America 's two most futuristic states look a lot more like equals than ever before .

AT FIRST glance , the resolution on “ religious defamation ” adopted by the UN's Human Rights Council on March 26th , mainly at the behest of Islamic countries , reads like another piece of harmless verbiage churned out by a toothless international bureaucracy .
What is wrong with saying , as the resolution does , that some Muslims faced prejudice in the aftermath of September 2001 ?
But a closer look at the resolution 's language , and the context in which it was adopted ( with an unholy trio of Pakistan , Belarus and Venezuela acting as sponsors ) , makes clear that bigger issues are at stake .
The resolution says “ defamation of religions ” is a “ serious affront to human dignity ” which can “ restrict the freedom ” of those who are defamed , and may also lead to the incitement of violence .
But there is an insidious blurring of categories here , which becomes plain when you compare this resolution with the more rigorous language of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , adopted in 1948 in a spirit of revulsion over the evils of fascism .
This asserts the right of human beings in ways that are now entrenched in the theory and ( most of the time ) the practice of liberal democracy .
It upholds the right of people to live in freedom from persecution and arbitrary arrest ; to hold any faith or none ; to change religion ; and to enjoy freedom of expression , which by any fair definition includes freedom to agree or disagree with the tenets of any religion .
In other words , it protects individuals — not religions , or any other set of beliefs .
And this is a vital distinction .
For it is not possible systematically to protect religions or their followers from offence without infringing the right of individuals .
What exactly is it the drafters of the council resolution are trying to outlaw ?
To judge from what happens in the countries that lobbied for the vote — like Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Pakistan — they use the word “ defamation ” to mean something close to the crime of blasphemy , which is in turn defined as voicing dissent from the official reading of Islam .
In many of the 56 member states of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference , which has led the drive to outlaw “ defamation ” , both non-Muslims and Muslims who voice dissent ( even in technical matters of Koranic interpretation ) are often victims of just the sort of persecution the 1948 declaration sought to outlaw .
That is a real human - rights problem .
And in the spirit of fairness , laws against blasphemy that remain on the statute books of some Western countries should also be struck off ; only real , not imaginary , incitement of violence should be outlawed .
Good manners , please ; not censorship
In much of the Muslim world , the West 's reaction to the attacks of September 2001 , including the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq , has been misread as an attack on Islam itself .
This is more than regrettable ; it is dangerous .
Western governments , and decent people everywhere , should try to ensure that the things they say do not entrench religious prejudice or incite acts of violence ; being free to give offence does not mean you are wise to give offence .
But no state , and certainly no body that calls itself a Human Rights Council , should trample on the right to free speech enshrined in the Universal Declaration .
And in the end , given that all faiths have undergone persecution at some time , few people have more to gain from the protection of free speech than sincere religious believers .
The United States , with its tradition of combining strong religious beliefs and religious freedom , is well placed to make that case .
Having taken a politically risky decision ( see article ) to re-engage with the Human Rights Council and seek election as one of its 47 members , America should now make the defence of real religious liberty one of its highest priorities .
Kudlow 101 : Deflating $ Supply
A closer look at the Fed and its impact on money supply , with CNBC's Larry Kudlow and Joe LaVorgna , Deutsche Bank .
( CNN ) --
Black employees at a Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , waste transfer plant were harassed , humiliated and discriminated against by their supervisor for decades , says an attorney representing two workers who filed a complaint against the city .
Among the allegations in the complaint is that for decades , John Gill , the Northwest Transfer Station 's superintendent , limited one restroom to whites only , said the attorney , Howard K. Trubman .
The restroom -- which he called the " supervisors ' bathroom " -- was supposedly for the sole use of upper - level officials with the city 's Streets Department , Trubman said .
As far back as 1996 , it became apparent to black employees that they were being slighted , said Trubman .
They would watch white co-workers walk into the segregated bathroom , conveniently located one floor above Gill 's office .
" If you tried to use the bathroom , you might get suspended , " said Leslie Young , a former worker at the facility .
Young , along with Gibson Trowery , who still works at the station , filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission in October 2007 .
Young said he recalled that a lock was placed on the restroom door , with keys distributed only to white workers .
The restroom black workers could use was down five flights of stairs and was " not in the greatest condition , " Trubman said .
Some employees were forced to ask Gill 's permission before they could make the trip , he said .
" It was very degrading and humiliating , " said Young .
" I saw it wreck peoples ' home lives -- picking on you for nothing . "
Gill , asked for comment Friday , referred CNN to his lawyers , saying , " If you want to write a fair story , wait for after the trial to finish writing it . "
The city solicitor 's office , which is defending the case , said , " We do n't comment on allegations .
...
Based on what we know , we have no reason to believe there is any merit , and that will come clear as the litigation proceeds . "
Because the human relations commission was unable to resolve the complaint within a year , Young and Trowery had the option of filing the complaint in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas , which they did .
In May , a Philadelphia judge dismissed a separate suit against Gill , leaving the complaint filed against the city intact .
Trubman said they are seeking Gill 's dismissal and monetary damages .
He expects a trial to begin by next summer .
The issue did n't end with the bathroom at the facility , which is a transfer station where garbage trucks bring citywide waste to be distributed to various landfills .
Black employees complained that they were stuck with the oldest garbage trucks .
Whites , they say , were frequently upgraded to newer vehicles .
" Gill would hide the white drivers ' keys and pretend that he did n't know where they were , " Trowery said .
" But I saw him keep the keys in his drawer . "
According to Young , in the sweltering summer of 2007 , Gill would only allow whites access to a water cooler kept in his barricaded office .
Black employees were forced to use a water fountain elsewhere in the building .
" It made me feel like less of a man , " said Young .
" But I got kids , I got a mortgage .
I 'm a trash man .
I have no college degree -- not too many places I 'm going to get a job . "
Young said he was a shop steward in 2006 and 2007 .
It was his job to inform Gill about unhappy workers , he said .
When he told Gill about some resentment felt by some of the employees , he said , Gill launched into a diatribe , saying those unhappy at " the Northwest Plantation Station " could leave .
" As a man I would have put my elbow down his throat , " said Young .
" You 're not going to talk to me like that . "
Another former employee at the facility , Walter Bingham , who worked there five years , said that every year on December 31 white workers would be allowed to schedule their vacation times for the coming year , leaving black employees with limited choices .
The problems persisted for more than a decade , Trubman contends .
Black workers , led by Young , began to document instances of discrimination in 1999 , he said .
" We spent most of our day calming each other down , " Young said .
" We had people running to his office .
[ But ] everybody has homes and pensions and kids . "
Tension between white and black workers ran deep , Young said ; the two groups would stick to themselves and hardly spoke .

Guns OK Outside Obama Town Hall ; Kerry Pins Brought Arrest At Bush Rally
By Lori Price , www.legitgov.org 17 Aug 2009 Bush 's Waffen - SS arrested ( and strip - searched ) people with Kerry - Edwards buttons pinned to their T - shirts and paper protest signs at his at his GOP - only appearances .
But , when a Reichwinger attends a New Hampshire town hall meeting with a gun -- merely yards from President Obama -- the protester not only gets to remain at the meeting but also gets to be a guest on MSNBC's ' Hardball . ' -- Lori Price Armed Men Attend Obama Speech : Man carrying assault rifle attends Obama protest 17 Aug 2009
About a dozen people carrying guns , including one with an AR - 15 assault rifle , milled among protesters outside an event where President Barack Obama was giving a speech Monday in Phoenix .
It 's the latest incident of gun-rights advocates visibly displaying firearms near the president .
Phoenix police say the people with guns , including a man carrying the assault rifle , did n't need permits .
Men with guns -- outside town hall 11 Aug 2009
Outside the event where President Obama will conduct his town hall , there is an anti-Obama protestor with a gun -- a pistol strapped to his lower leg .
The local police chief said it 's legal for the man to have a registered handgun -- as long as it is not concealed .
What 's more , he is on private property , a church yard , which has given him permission to be there .
*** UPDATE *** William Kostric is passing out a bookmark that says , " Join the Second Amendment Revolution , the most exciting pro-liberty movement in over 200 years . "
The local police say he is within his rights to carry a handgun openly under state law .
He was carrying a 9 - mm Smith and Wesson strapped to his lower leg .
Police say he 's OK on a public sidewalk .
Kostric says he has permission from a church just down the street from the high school to be on its private property ...
When Obama arrived , the police had Kostric under surveillance .
A local police captain said the Secret Service has been " in the loop . "
Kostric has been about 50 to 75 yards from the entrance to the high school , since about 11:00 am ET , doing interviews and carrying a sign and his gun and police have had their eye on him .
Obama Defends Health - Care Effort at Town - Hall Event 11 Aug 2009 ( Portsmouth , NH ) President Barack Obama , confronting boisterous protests and serious questions about his health plan , slammed talk of " death panels " and Medicare cuts , urging supporters to confront the opposition that has forced him onto his political heels .
William Kostric of Manchester , N.H. , carried a sign quoting Thomas Jefferson 's aphorism that the tree of liberty needed to be watered by the blood of patriots from time to time .
" Sometimes you have to move really far to one [ political ] side to pull people out of their complacency , " he said , " not that I 'm advocating violent revolution at this point . "
[ He also carred a gun .
Murdoch 's ' Wall Street Urinal ' forgot to add that fact . ]
Arrested Bush dissenters look to the courts 23 Jul 2006 ( Cedar Rapids , IA )
When school was canceled to accommodate a campaign visit by President [ sic ]
Bush , the two teachers reckoned the time was ripe to voice their simmering discontent with the administration 's policies .
Christine Nelson showed up at the Cedar Rapids rally with a Kerry - Edwards button pinned on her T - shirt ; Alice McCabe clutched a small , paper sign stating " No More War . "
What could be more American , they thought , than mixing a little dissent with the bunting and buzz of a get - out - the - vote rally headlined by the president ?
Their reward : a pair of handcuffs and a strip search at the county jail .
In the months before the 2004 election , dozens of people across the nation were banished from or arrested at Bush political rallies , some for heckling the president , others simply for holding signs or wearing clothing that expressed opposition to the war and administration policies .
Similar things have happened at official , taxpayer - funded , presidential visits , before and after the election .
Some targeted by security have been escorted from events , while others have been arrested and charged with misdemeanors that were later dropped by local prosecutors .
Now , in federal courthouses from Charleston , W.Va. , to Denver , federal officials and state and local authorities are being forced to defend themselves against lawsuits challenging the arrests and security policies .

In an interview released today by Digg and the Wall Street Journal , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was pressured about the growing popular movement to Audit the Fed spearheaded by Texas Congressman Ron Paul .
A visibly uncomfortable Geithner attempts to dismiss the question by stating " I 'm sure people understand that you want to keep politics out of monetary policy . "
When Geithner is again pressed on the issue , he makes the stunning assertion that conducting an audit of the Federal Reserve — something never before done in its 96 year history — is a " line that we do n't want to cross , " proclaiming that such a move would be " problematic for the country . "
Watch the interview in the player below : Geithner 's response that auditing the Fed would give politicians dangerous control over American monetary policy is mistaken at best and a deliberate lie at worst .
Allowing the public to know what happened to their $ 24 trillion in bailout money does not give undue control of monetary policy to the people 's elected representatives .
Instead , such an audit would finally allow the public to see how their money has been spent in the midst of the largest spending binge in the history of the world 's economy , hardly an unreasonable demand given the well - documented revolving door between the Treasury and Goldman Sachs , the main recipient of bailout funds .
Ultimately , the Treasury Secretary is left spewing the absurdity that " I think even the sponsor of that bill recognizes how important it is to us to have the Fed independent of politics , " which can only be said to be true insofar as Ron Paul — the sponsor of House Resolution ( HR ) 1207 — wants to abolish the Federal Reserve system altogether .
That the Wall Street Journal would even pressure the Treasury Secretary on serious issues like the Audit the Fed movement may be surprising , given that the Wall Street Journal is a mouthpiece of the financial oligarchy and that editor Paul Gigot , like Geithner himself , is a Bilderberg attendee .
Needless to say , this was not a typical inside - the - beltway interview .
Instead , questions were submitted and voted on by the Digg community , with the top 10 questions being posed to Mr. Geithner .
As a result , the Secretary was bombarded by pointed questions about his documented tax evasion from 2001 - 2004 , the wisdom of spending trillions of dollars in the light of long - term dollar devaluation and even , in the words of one particularly irate questioner , " Why are you running the Treasury Department ? "
Despite presumably having had time to prepare responses to each question well in advance , Geithner is still visibly discomfited by the entire exchange , picking at his shirt cuff and coughing nervously throughout the interview .
In one particularly telling moment , Geithner even admits " We have been forced to do just extraordinary things and , frankly , offensive things to help save the economy . "
That these questions are only being asked now , almost a year into the bailout and several months after the new administration has taken office , further highlights how the controlled corporate media is doing everything in its power to keep to well - trodden and uncontroversial areas in their interviewing of key administration officials .
This interview is testimony to the power of the citizen journalism movement that is attempting to hold those in power accountable for their actions .
We can only hope that the Obama Administration lives up to their promise to be the " cyber " administration by allowing more such question - and - answer sessions in the future .

URUMQI , China --
Chinese security forces clamped down on large parts of this city of 2.4 million Monday , a day after long - simmering ethnic tensions erupted in rioting that authorities said left 156 dead and more than 1,000 injured .
The fatalities , if confirmed , would represent one of the deadliest outbreaks of violence in China in decades .

A group of neurosurgeons analyzing the dangerous teen activity known as car surfing has concluded that its popularity corresponds with the release of the Grand Theft Auto video game series and YouTube clips glorifying the activity .
Car surfing , thought to have originated in the Bay Area in the 1980s , is a stunt in which the " surfer " sits or stands on the hood , roof or trunk of a moving vehicle , hangs onto the sides or is dragged from a rope trailing behind .
It is also called ghost riding .
From 1998 to 2006 , 51 California youths died in car - surfing accidents .
The study , published in the Journal of Neurosurgery , is the first comprehensive look at the rising rate of injuries related to car surfing and why teens engage in such reckless behavior .
The authors analyzed statistics from the states with the most car - surfing injuries -- California , Florida and Texas -- and found a steady rise in accident rates starting in 2000 .
The increase in injuries corresponded to the release of the Grand Theft Auto video games ( editions one through three ) and the Jackass video game series and movie in 2002 , according to the authors of the paper , from University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children 's Hospital in Ohio .
An increase in fatalities occurred from 2004 to 2005 with the release of GTA San Andreas and the growing popularity of YouTube , the study finds .
A search of YouTube archives from 2006 to 2008 produced 350 video clips showing children and teenagers engaging in car surfing .
In a study of seven car - surfing injuries at their own hospital , the authors found most injuries were to males ; the average age was 13.4 years ; all sustained head injuries ; four suffered longterm neurologic damage .
Why would kids do this ?
The report is unusual because the authors conducted a broad search of statistics and popular culture to show how video games and YouTube clips appear to influence the behavior , says Dr. Ann-Christine Duhaime , in an editorial accompanying the paper .
" People do stupid things , and adolescents do some of the stupidest , " Duhaime wrote , in what is perhaps one of the most accurate observations in medical literature on accidental injuries .
" It is well documented that children and adolescents imitate what they see in the media , even when this is deleterious to their health . "
Adults , she says , need to channel teens ' need for adventure into " activities with less likelihood of life - altering , or life - ending , outcomes . "

Bringing fresh attention to its blockade of the Gaza Strip , Israel on Tuesday turned back a boat attempting to deliver three tons of medical supplies to Gazans .
After a radio message asking the small ferry to turn back was ignored , the Israeli Navy boarded the boat and redirected the vessel to the Israeli port of Ashdod .
Reuters quoted a police source as saying that the activists aboard , members of the US - based Free Gaza movement , would " likely be deported . "
" Yesterday evening the Israeli Navy contacted the boat while at sea clarifying that it would not be permitted to enter Gaza coastal waters because of security risks in the area , and the existing naval blockade , " the Israeli military said in a statement , adding that humanitarian aid would be sent to Gaza " subject to authorization . "
The naval blockade – part of a wider Israeli effort to seal off the tiny coastal strip controlled by the Islamist militant group Hamas – not only prevents such shipments , it is also devastating a key Gazan industry and source of food : fishing .
Citing security concerns and fears of arms smuggling , Israel has progressively tightened the blockade over the past 15 years .
Once a thriving enterprise , Gaza 's fishing industry is now on the verge of collapse .
Fishermen are cut off from the heavily populated shoals , and have seen total revenue drop by half in less than a decade .
" We are witnessing a huge crisis where the livelihoods of thousands of fishermen , associated laborers , and their dependents have been decimated by Israel 's blockade and closure , " says Erminio Sacco of the United Nations ' Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) .
Following the Oslo peace accords , signed in 1994 between Israel and the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) , Israel permitted the fishermen to go 20 nautical miles ( NM ) out to sea .
This was restricted to 12 NM in 2002 , after the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada in 2000 .
This area was further limited to the current 3 NM when the Islamic movement Hamas wrested control of Gaza after an intense fight with its rival Fatah led to a collapse of a unity government headed by Western - backed Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
Those fishermen who go further out risk being arrested , shot , and killed , or having their boats destroyed or confiscated .
However , human rights organizations have reported that fishermen have been attacked even within the 3 - NM zone .
Click here to read about fisherman Mohammed Hassuna , who says he and his crew were recently surrounded by Israeli Navy boats , shot at , forced to strip , and swim in frigid water to the Navy gunboat , where they were handcuffed , blindfolded , and their feet chained .
Catch dropped by two - thirds since 2007
According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) , Israel 's restrictions undermined the sardine season , which started in March and peaked in mid-April .
The bulk of sardines are located beyond six NM , with the UN estimating that a distance of 12 - 15 NM off Gaza is the minimum required to access the larger shoals of fish for maximum economic benefit .
Shoals closer to shore have been depleted and unable to replenish themselves .
" During March 2007 , 248 metric tons of fish were caught .
In March 2008 this figure dropped to 121 tons and in March this year , the catch was only 89 tons , " says Mr. Sacco .
A total annual catch of 2,700 tons was caught in 2008 , down from nearly 4,000 tons in 1999 , according to Gaza 's General Syndicate of Marine Fishers .
OCHA states that at the end of the 1990s , Gaza 's fishing industry was worth about $ 10 million annually .
This represented approximately 4 percent of the Palestinian economy .
Nezar Ayyash , from Gaza 's fishing syndicate , which has 3,500 registered fishermen , says this figure was halved between 2001 and 2006 .
" It has become too expensive for many fishermen to take the bigger boats out to sea , so only some smaller boats venture out , " says Sacco .
The cost of one fishing trip can vary between $ 125 and $ 625 , depending on the size of the vessel , nets , and crew ; many fishermen cannot cover these costs .
Fishing employed 45,000 Gazans
About 45,000
Gazans once worked in fishing and its associated industries , including repairs , onshore support , or as merchants .
With Gazans having an average family size of seven , the fishing industry used to help support many times more of Gaza 's 1.4 million residents .
It also supplemented a diet critically short of animal protein .
Gaza faces chronic unemployment , poverty , and malnutrition in part as a result of Israel 's blockade , which now allows only food and medicine – but not as much as aid workers say is necessary to sustain the population .
Everything from pasta to catheters have been turned back , frustrating aid workers who have been unable to obtain a list of permitted items .
A ban on steel and cement , which Israel says can be used to fortify tunnels along the Gaza border that are used for smuggling , has prevented many Gazans from rebuilding after the war , with some resorting to mud bricks for their homes .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- A 49 - year - old man impersonated his dead 77 - year - old mother in paperwork -- and sometimes in person -- for six years , collecting more than $ 100,000 in her name , according to the Brooklyn district attorney .
Surveillance video shows Thomas Parkin , left , dressed as his mother at a DMV office on April 29 , authorities say .
The man sometimes dressed as his mother and , with an accomplice , collected more than $ 52,000 in Social Security benefits and another $ 65,000 in city rent subsidies , prosecutors said .
Thomas Parkin and a man accused of being his accomplice , Mhilton Rimolo , 47 , pleaded not guilty Wednesday to a sweeping 47 - count grand jury indictment that includes charges of perjury , grand larceny , conspiracy , forgery and criminal impersonation , Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes told reporters .
Their bail was set at $ 1 million each .
If convicted , they could each face up to 25 years in prison .
" These defendants ran a multiyear campaign of fraud that was unparalleled in its scope and brazenness , " Hynes said .
Authorities allege Parkin impersonated his late mother , Irene Prusik , after her death in September 2003 .
On April 29 , surveillance video captured Parkin posing as his mother to renew her driver 's license at a state Department of Motor Vehicles office in Brooklyn , authorities said .
Parkin was wearing a blonde wig , a red sweater , sunglasses and a scarf around the neck , authorities said .
Next to him was Rimolo , who was pretending to be her nephew , authorities said .
Watch report on the case »
" [ Parkin ] did a pretty good job of covering himself up so that those that did n't know what to look for would n't be able to see anything , " said Michael Vecchione , chief of the Brooklyn district attorney 's rackets division .
According to the indictment against him , the source of the fraud dates as far back as 1996 , when Prusik ceded the deed of a building she owned in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn to her son .
By 2000 , he had gotten into debt after purchasing properties with business partner Rimolo , " presumably for speculation , " Hynes said .
Parkin forged his mother 's death certificate when she died , writing a false Social Security number and birth date , according to the indictment against him .
He began collecting her Social Security and also began filing lawsuits in his mother 's name against a man who had bought under foreclosure the building she had owned , the indictment said .
Authorities launched an investigation in 2008 after the man who was the target of the lawsuits involving the disputed building claimed that Prusik and Parkin were filing false affidavits against him .
" Unknown to [ the man ] -- and in fact , anybody -- Irene Prusik , at the time that these actions were instituted , had died , " Hynes said .
Hynes said that initially , investigators could find no evidence of Prusik 's death , but a deeper inquiry led them to the forged death certificate .
Throughout the investigation , authorities said they had two taped meetings with Parkin -- one in which he was himself and one , at the disputed building , where he dressed as his mother .
Rimolo also was at both meetings , claiming to be Prusik 's nephew , authorities said .
Hynes said authorities were surprised when Parkin and Rimolo agreed to have investigators meet Prusik at the disputed building .
There , Hynes said , " the case went from strange to truly bizarre . "
When investigators arrived for the May 11 meeting , they saw Parkin dressed as his mother , wearing a red sweater , lipstick and an oxygen mask , authorities said .
Authorities said Parkin used the oxygen mask to support his earlier claims that his mother was too sick to speak .
Parkin was arrested Tuesday .
" I held my mother when she was dying and breathed in her last breath , so I am my mother , " Parkin told authorities during his arrest , according to a law enforcement source close to the investigation .
When asked by CNN's Susan Candiotti if he 's seen any case like this before , Hynes said , " Not anything close .
For creativity , this comes out number one . "

Yet there is real reason for longer - term worry in the form of a persistent , anecdotal drift toward disillusionment among some of the president ’s supporters .
And not merely those on the left .
This concern was perhaps best articulated by an Obama voter , a real estate agent in Virginia , featured on the front page of The Washington Post last week .
“ Nothing ’s changed for the common guy , ” she said .
“ I feel like I ’ve been punked . ”
She cited in particular the billions of dollars in bailouts given to banks that still “ act like they ’re broke . ”

But this mood is n’t just about the banks , Public Enemy No. 1 .
What the Great Recession has crystallized is a larger syndrome that Obama tapped into during the campaign .
It ’s the sinking sensation that the American game is rigged  that , as the president typically put it a month after his inauguration , the system is in hock to “ the interests of powerful lobbyists or the wealthiest few ” who have “ run Washington far too long . ”
He promised to smite them .
No president can do that alone , let alone in six months .
To make Obama ’s goal more quixotic , the ailment that he diagnosed is far bigger than Washington and often beyond politics ’ domain .
What disturbs Americans of all ideological persuasions is the fear that almost everything , not just government , is fixed or manipulated by some powerful hidden hand , from commercial transactions as trivial as the sales of prime concert tickets to cultural forces as pervasive as the news media .
It ’s a cynicism confirmed almost daily by events .
Last week Brian Stelter of The Times reported that the corporate bosses of MSNBC and Fox News , Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric and Rupert Murdoch of News Corporation , had sanctioned their lieutenants to broker what a G.E. spokesman called a new “ level of civility ” between their brawling cable stars , Keith Olbermann and Bill O’Reilly .
A Fox spokesman later confirmed to Howard Kurtz of The Post that “ there was an agreement ” at least at the corporate level .
Olbermann said he was a “ party to no deal , ” and in any event what looked like a temporary truce ended after The Times article was published .
But the whole scrape only fed legitimate suspicions on the right and left alike that even their loudest public voices can be silenced if the business interests of the real American elite decree it .
It 's all over for Joel Tenenbaum — except for the size of the check he 'll be told to write the RIAA .
In a reversal of her decision last night , Judge Nancy Gertner has granted the record labels ' motion for a directed verdict on the issue of copyright infringement .
Tenenbaum is now liable for infringing all 30 songs at issue in the case .
All that will be left to the jury is to determine the size of the damage award and whether the infringement was willful .
Judge Gertner 's change of heart came after she had a chance to review the transcript of Thursday 's testimony by Joel Tenenbaum .
During direct examination , Tenenbaum was asked a simple question by the labels ' counsel : " on the stand now , are you admitting liability for downloading and distributing all 30 sound recordings that are at issue and listed on Exhibits 55 and 56 of the exhibits ? "
His simple " yes " answer was enough to hand the labels a victory on the question of liability .
" Notwithstanding the protestations of Tenenbaum 's counsel , Tenenbaum 's statement plainly admits liability on both downloading and distributing , does so in the very language of the statute ( no ' making available ' ambiguity ) and does so with respect to each and every sound recording at issue here , " wrote Judge Gertner .
When the jury gets back to court Friday morning , they 'll hear the closing arguments from each side and then decide whether Tenenbaum 's infringement was willful and the amount of the damages that can be awarded .
If the jury concludes that the infringement was willful , he could be forced to pay damages to the tune of $ 150,000 per song .
For all of the theatrics in the months leading up to the trial , things have gone down differently since the trial started Monday morning .
Judge Gertner eviscerated Tenenbaum's Fair
Use defense right before things got underway , and it has been all downhill from there for the defendant .
Should the jury throw the book at Tenenbaum on the issue of damages , his counsel , Harvard Law professor Charles Nesson , will challenge the constitutionality of the damage provisions of the Copyright Act .
But that 's another chapter ; this one is all but written .

Bobcat Goldthwait does n't make movies for morons
" When you make a comedy now , if it 's an R - rated comedy , it 's really trying to get 13 - year - old boys to buy it or see it , " said Bobcat Goldthwait , writer and director of the new R- rated comedy " World 's Greatest Dad . "
So does that thinking mean Goldthwait tailored that film to appeal to this big ticket - buying demographic ?
Um , not so much .
" Teenagers are idiots and I do n't want them to go to the movie , " he said .
" I did n't make it for them and I think they 're really morons . "
Goldthwait will perform at The Improv Comedy Club ( 441 S. 4th St. ) 8 p.m. on Aug. 4 . General admission tickets are $ 20 and available online or at the box office .
" World 's Greatest Dad , " starring Robin Williams , was released on Amazon Video On Demand last month .
It opens in theaters in New York and Los Angeles on Aug. 21 before heading to other platforms around the country .
Bobcat Goldthwait does n't make movies for the masses or for bestiality fiends either
" I always end up it seems at odds with what I 'm going to call ' mainstream media and personalities , ' " Goldthwait said .
" The last two movies I made [ " Sleeping Dogs Lie " and " Windy City Heat " ] , the furthest thing from my mind was trying to appeal to everyone . "
" And that 's not someone who 's licking his wounds going ' Boo - hoo , ' " he said .
" It 's clearly not for everyone . "
" The last movie [ " Sleeping Dogs Lie " ] , I jokingly say it 's a romantic comedy but it had a tasteful amount of bestiality .
That 's a little part of the story because I needed something that would be impossible for most people to get past in a relationship , " Goldthwait said .
Some critics , however , could n't get past the bestiality -- not that it was in the movie , but that there was n't enough of it .
" There 's a whole generation of reviewers and people who post on blogs that grew up where the Farrelly brothers had jizz in a lady 's hair [ a scene in " There 's Something About Mary " ] , " he said .
" They actually were disappointed that there was n't an actual graphic scene of a woman trying to blow a dog . "
Bobcat Goldthwait prefers writing and directing to acting ( especially costarring with a talking horse )
" People confuse you if you 're in a movie with the writing of it .
That 's really why I write and direct and I try not to be in things .
The stuff I 'm saying now is really how I feel about the world .
When I was acting in ' Hot to Trot ' that really did n't . "
Bobcat Goldthwait wants to read your college thesis
" Those movies that people seem to talk to me about a lot or criticize me for are movies I made when most people were in college .
Now , I still took the money and I still did the Grover voice .
I 'm guilty to a point , " Goldthwait said .
" But sometimes when these people are busting balls , I really wish I had their college thesis on my lap because I 'm sure it 's pretty cringe - worthy too . "

The highest resolution snapshots yet showing how bacteria adapt to survive treatment with quinolone drugs are giving drug makers an additional weapon in the fight against antibiotic resistance .
Scientists at King ’s College London and St. George ’s , University of London , have shown exactly how quinolones , which are the second line of defence against diseases like pneumonia and meningitis , interact with their topoisomerase IV enzyme target .
The researchers captured detailed crystal structures using high power x-rays produced at the Diamond synchrotron in the UK and its French counterpart , Soleil .
From these images the team has been able to identify the amino acids that mutate in resistant bacteria , providing vital information to drug developers .
Mark Sanderson from KCL told Chemistry World that some US pharmaceutical companies have already approached his team in order to screen other antibiotics against topoisomerase IV .
He says that the level of detail now available will tell these and any other interested parties immediately whether their compounds are active through the same mechanism .
’ Very high brilliance synchrotron radiation is essential to attain high resolution on these new drug - enzyme complexes , ’ Sanderson said .
’ Researchers in the pharmaceutical industry were excited to see our quinolone - topo IV structure , ’ added Mark Fisher of St. George’s .
’ It provides a starting point to understand unrelated inhibitors of topoisomerase IV that could be lead compounds for antibacterial drug development . ’
Topoisomerases cut and rejoin DNA chains regularly throughout the lifetime of organisms including bacteria and humans .
Quinolones specifically target topoisomerase IV in dangerous gram positive pathogens like Staphylococcus aureusand Streptococcus pneumoniae .
The London researchers have identified how these drugs trap the enzyme on the DNA chains it is cutting .
Two drug molecules bind a cleaved DNA strand to the enzyme , essentially sealing it shut .
This rules out several alternative theories suggesting that four quinolone molecules combine to lock the cleavage complex together .
Whereas their previous experiments had produced 7 ?
resolution images , Diamond and Soleil enabled Sanderson and his colleagues to improve that to 4 ?.
As well as confirming exactly how quinolones exert their antibiotic effect , the crystal structures show which amino acids are altered near the quinolone binding site in drug resistant bacteria .
The most frequent mutations introduce a bulky side chain into this binding pocket .
Emmanuelle Cambau , an expert on the mechanism and clinical importance of quinolones at the University of Paris , called these findings ’ very important ’ and echoed the hope that they could result in new drugs .
’ Data should also be obtained with DNA gyrase , which is the main topoisomerase drug target in several other bacteria , ’ she added .

I met and interviewed dozens of people who use and champion both CSS and JavaScript .
After interviewing so many developers , designers and browser representatives , I discovered a technical and human story to be told .
What you ’re about to read is purely observational and as unbiased an account as you will be able to find on the subject of web animation .
Flash May Be Gone , But The Era Of Web Animation Has Just Begun
Since the era of Flash , it ’s become fashionable to think of animation as little more than decoration , a “ flashy ” afterthought , often in poor taste , like an unwelcome blink tag .
But unless we want to display nothing other than copy on a screen , animation is still very much our friend .
For user interface designers , animation reinforces hierarchy , relationships , structure , and cause and effect .
Research going back to the early ’90s demonstrates that animation helps humans understand what ’s happening on screen .
Animation stitches together app states and offloads that work to the brain ’s GPU — the visual cortex .
For interaction developers , complex visuals — from infographics on dashboards to video games on tablets — are impossible to create without animation to glue all the pieces together .
If we want those things on the Internet , we still need animation .
Sadly , we have fallen behind in the motion design race .
Products that use animation to benefit their users will succeed where their static or animation - abusing competitors will fail .
As it stands , native apps are beating the pants off the web .
App developers have been incorporating animation into their designs and fleshing out workflow and prototyping tools like Flinto and Mitya from day one .
But things might be turning around .
iOS ’ Safari team pushed out the CSS animation and transition specifications so that websites can look and feel as good as iOS apps do .
Even Google has picked up on this , putting animation front and center in its Material Design recommendations , with careful do ’s and don’ts to apply animations and transitions meaningfully , with purpose .
Animation is the natural next step in the evolution of our application and device ecosystem .
It makes the digital world more intuitive and interesting for users of all ages .
And so long as our devices sport GPUs , it ’s not going away .
Animating All The Things
At its core , animation is just a visual representation of a rate of change over time and space .
All animation can be distilled into three types :
Static animation runs from a start point to an end point , with no branching or logic .
This can be accomplished with CSS alone , as the abundance of CSS loading animations testifies .
Stateful animation in its simplest form takes boolean input — a click to open a menu and a click to close it , for instance — and animates between the two states .
This is currently achieved in JavaScript frameworks by applying and removing classes with scoped CSS animation .
Dynamic animation can have many outcomes depending on user input and other variables .
It uses its own logic to determine how things should animate and what their endpoints are .
It could entail “ dragging ” a page along behind your finger according to the speed of your swipe , or dynamically changing a graph as new data comes in .
This is the trickiest kind of animation to accomplish with the tools at our disposal today .
CSS alone cannot be used for this kind of animation .
More States != Dynamic Animation
The astute CSS developer might point out that , with enough states , CSS animation could closely resemble dynamic animation .
This is true to a point .
But truly dynamic animation has more end states than you can possibly anticipate .
Just imagine the humble loading bar .
Having a different class for every percentage point of “ fullness ” would easily run to a hundred lines of CSS , not to mention the number of times your JavaScript would have to touch the DOM to update the classes and the browser repaints .
We definitely could write a more performant dynamic loader with JavaScript alone .
CSS animation is declarative : Aside from a handful of pseudo - classes , such as : hover and : target , it accepts context from neither the user nor the user ’s surroundings .
It does only what its author tells it to do and cannot respond to new inputs or a changing environment .
There ’s no way to create a CSS animation that says “ If you ’re in the middle of the page , do this ; otherwise , do that . ” CSS does n’t contain that sort of logic .
When CSS - first developers need logic , they often start by scoping CSS to state classes , with JavaScript handling the logic of when to apply which class .
Frameworks such as AngularJS support states , and many UI interactions adapt easily to a handful of states like “ loading , ” “ open ” and “ selected . ”
These animations also degrade gracefully in old browsers , providing a much needed UX boost where CSS animation and transitions are supported .
Interaction developers have had a different time of it .
CSS animation is often too declarative to handle the things these developers want to build .
Paying clients demand reliable animation across a wide spread of browsers ; so , many interaction developers and their studios have done what all clever developers do : make labor - saving libraries customized to their own processes .
Some of these libraries , like GSAP and Velocity , are available to and developed for the public .
But many others will never be released in the wild , because the people and agencies who created them do n’t have the time or money ( or will ) to support an open - source project .
This is a deeply worrying story that I ’ve heard over and over again , and it suggests that many developers are reinventing the wheel without moving the web forward .
There is n’t enough demand for something considered “ nice to have ” to support many competitors .
It ’s easy to see how libraries like GSAP must be commercial in order to survive , or how sponsorships buoy libraries like Velocity .
And Flash was a benevolent dictator , for its people did have a visual timeline UI .
Flash did a great thing by giving interaction developers and UI designers a universal workflow that accommodates all kinds of animations and a platform on which to edit them .
But since Steve Jobs announced back in 2010 that the iPhone would never support Flash , many former Flash developers have quietly gone into exile , taking their niche knowledge with them .
Now , an entire generation of web designers has come online with relatively no knowledge of the possibilities and challenges we face when ramping up animation complexity .
But things are about to get quite… animated .
The Web Animation API : The Greatest An API You ’ve Never Heard Of
The Web Animation API is a W3C specification that provides a unified language for CSS and SVG animations and that opens up the browser ’s animation engine for developer manipulation .
It does the following :
provide an API for the animation engine , enabling us to develop more in - browser animation tools and letting animation libraries tap into performance boosts ;
give ( qualifying ) animation their own thread , getting rid of jank ;
support motion paths ;
provide post-animation callbacks ;
reintroduce nested and sequenced animations that we have n’t seen since Flash ;
enable us to pause , play , seek , reverse , slow down or speed up playback with timing dictionaries and animation player objects .
Here ’s just one example of what the Web Animation API can do that CSS alone cannot .
See the Pen Running on Web Animations API by Rachel Nabors ( @rachelnabors ) on CodePen .
Support
The Web Animation API has been over two years in the making , and its features have been rolling out in Chrome and Firefox nightlies for the past six months .
Mozilla is the major force behind the specification .
Meanwhile , the Chrome team has been prioritizing the shipment of features .
Microsoft has the API “ under consideration ” for Internet Explorer .
Apple , surprisingly , has also adopted a wait - and - see approach for Safari .
And we can only fantasize about when the API will hit those web app engines powered by ancient forks of open - source browsers .
Early adopters who want to explore the API can try out a polyfill for the Web Animations API , which is being replaced by Web Animations Next literally any day now ( more about the polyfill and the API can be found on the website for the Polymer project ) .
However , for browsers that do n’t support the API , the polyfill is still less performant than GSAP , the reigning champion of JavaScript - based animation libraries .
Thus , the polyfill is n’t something interactive that developers will want to put into production for high - performance projects .
It will be some time before this API is supported across the board .
With half of browser makers waiting to see how developers will use it and most developers refusing to use a tool that is n’t widely supported , the API faces a chicken - and - egg scenario .
However , in an on - stage conversation with Google ’s Paul Kinlan at Fronteers , I suggested that , were the API to be fully supported in a closed and monetizable system for web apps , such as Google Play , developers would be able to safely use it in a walled garden until it reaches maturity and fuller support .
Performance
The API ’s authors and implementers hope that animation library developers will start feature - sniffing for the API ’s support to tap into its performance benefits .
Because the Web Animation API uses the CSS rendering engine , we can expect CSS levels of performance .
Animations will run on their own thread as long as they do n’t depend on anything happening in the main thread , such as JavaScript or layout .
Speaking of layout , reflowing remains one of the biggest processing hurdles for browsers .
No CSS or JavaScript animation can get around it unless you ’re pumping everything through WebGL straight to the GPU ( which some clever in - house library developers have been doing ) .
Aside from opacity and transform , animating the bulk of CSS properties will cause a reflow , a change in layout and / or a repaint of the pixels on the screen .
The will - change CSS property helps some by enabling us to point at something and tell the browser , “ That , that thing is going to change .
You do what you have to do change it efficiently . ”
The hope is that as browsers get smarter about graphics , they ’ll move those elements into their own layer or otherwise optimize the way they handle those graphics .
It ’s the first step in eliminating hacks like translateZ ( 0 ) .
Such “ performance hacks ” often get slapped on as a magic fix whenever an animation is janking , but they often cause performance issues when used unwittingly .
Performance decisions are truly best left to the browser in the long run .
Fortunately , browser makers are scrambling to get fewer properties to trigger reflows , thus keeping them off the main thread .
For animation library developers , this means that the Web Animation API could be a winning partner for performance in the near future .
Anyone working with web animation yearns for proper animation development tools : a timeline , property inspection , better editors , and the ability to pause , rewind and otherwise inspect an animation while debugging .
The Web Animation API will open the guts of the CSS rendering engine to developers and the browser vendors themselves to create these tools .
Both Chrome and Firefox are preparing animation features for their development tools .
This API opens up those possibilities .
The Web Animation Community Today
Not many people other than those working on it are aware of the Web Animation API .
The standards community is eager for real - world feedback from interaction and animation library developers .
However , many developers feel that the standardistas live in an ivory tower , far removed from the rigors of the trenches , the demands of clients and the lessons learned from Flash .
The old king ’s champion sent into exile by the very people he once served .
To be fair , the standardistas have n’t exactly come out to meet their audience in the field .
To join the “ official ” Web Animation API conversation , you must jump through some hoops , and getting on the email chain threatens to overflow the inbox of any busy developer .
Alternatively , you could get on IRC and join the conversation there — if only designers used IRC .
The conversation that needs to happen is unlikely to happen if the people who have the most to say simply are n’t there .
Vendors and specification authors will need to find more ways to reach out to their key audience or else risk building an API without an audience .
But the standardistas are n’t the only ones with communication problems here .
As a community , we are very judgmental and quick to deride things that we deem unworthy , be it Flash or an API we do n’t like the look of .
Many of us invest our egos in our tools and processes .
But those things do n’t define us .
What we create together defines us .
Animation library developers , read the specification .
It is long , but if GreenSock ’s Jack Doyle can do it , so can you .
, read the specification .
It is long , but if GreenSock ’s Jack Doyle can do it , so can you .
Interaction developers who do n’t have all day to read a huge specification , just read the readme on the polyfill ’s page .
It ’s a perfect TLDR .
Now that you know what ’s coming , you will know when it might be useful to you , whether for optimizing your library ’s performance or building an in - browser timeline UI .

Designers , prioritize JavaScript at work .
Play with the polyfill , and play with GSAP and Velocity .
Find out what these things can do for your work that CSS alone cannot accomplish .
With web animation , we have a rare chance to put our egos aside and come together as a community to build a tool with which future generations of designers and developers can build great things .
For their sake , I hope we can .

WARNING : some images may be disturbing .
The history books are full of accounts of dreadful plagues and diseases which wiped out large numbers of peoples ( sometimes by their millions ) .
This list takes a look at 10 of the more well known and interesting diseases and looks at their effect on history ( either through high death toll or changes to the way we deal with the sick ) .
Feel free to mention other interesting illnesses in the comments .
This list is no particular order .
10 Typhus
Typhus is any of several similar diseases caused by Rickettsiae .
The name comes from the Greek typhos meaning smoky or hazy , describing the state of mind of those affected with typhus .
The first reliable description of the disease appears during the Spanish siege of Moorish Granada in 1489 .
These accounts include descriptions of fever and red spots over arms , back and chest , progressing to delirium , gangrenous sores , and the stink of rotting flesh .
During the siege , the Spaniards lost 3,000 men to enemy action but an additional 17,000 died of typhus .
Epidemics occurred throughout Europe from the 16th to the 19th centuries , and occurred during the English Civil War , the Thirty Years ’ War and the Napoleonic Wars .
In the Thirty Years ’ War , an estimated 8 million Germans were wiped out by bubonic plague and typhus fever .
During Napoleon ’s retreat from Moscow in 1812 , more French soldiers died of typhus than were killed by the Russians .
9 Ebola
Ebola hemorrhagic fever is named after the Ebola River , where the first recognized outbreak of the fever occurred .
The viruses are characterized by long filaments , and have a shape similar to that of the Marburg virus , also in the family Filoviridae , and possessing similar disease symptoms .
Ebola first emerged in 1976 in Zaire .
It remained largely obscure until 1989 with the outbreak in Reston , Virginia .
The virus has been confirmed to be transmitted through body fluids , however , transmission through oral exposure and through conjunctiva exposure is possible .
In the early stages , Ebola may not be highly contagious .
Contact with someone in early stages may not even transmit the disease .
As the illness progresses , bodily fluids from diarrhea , vomiting , and bleeding represent an extreme biohazard .
Due to lack of proper equipment and hygienic practices , large - scale epidemics occur mostly in poor , isolated areas without modern hospitals or well - educated medical staff .
8 Malaria
Some symptoms of malaria are anemia , fever , chills , and even coma or death .
This disease is usually spread when people are bitten by an Anopheles mosquito , which got the infection from another human .
Every year , there are about 400 million cases of malaria , killing millions of people .
This disease is one of the most common infectious diseases , and a serious problem .
Currently , no vaccine that has huge impact has been created , but many are being invented .
7 Cholera
In its most severe form cholera is very fatal .
If not treated within three hours , an infected person may die .
Symptoms are diarrhea , shock , nosebleed , leg cramps , vomiting , and dry skin .
The first cholera outbreak was in Bengal , and from there spread to India , China , Indonesia , and the Caspian Sea .
When the pandemic finally ended in 1826 , there were over 15 million deaths in India alone .
Oral rehydration therapy and antibiotics treat cholera .
6 Smallpox
Smallpox is believed to have begun infecting humans in 10,000 B.C.
In England during the 18th century this disease killed around 400,000 people each year and was responsible for a large portion of blindness .
The main symptom is an outbreak of small bumps all over the body .
Other signs include vomiting , back ache , fever , and head ache .
The earliest evidence of small pox was in Ancient Egyptian mummies .
It is thought that Egyptian traders brought the disease over to India , where it remained endemic for 2000 years .
After successful vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , the WHO certified the eradication of smallpox in December 1979 .
To this day , smallpox is the only human infectious disease to have been completely eradicated .
5 Spanish Flu
The 1918 flu pandemic ( commonly referred to as the Spanish flu ) was an influenza pandemic that spread to nearly every part of the world .
It was caused by an unusually virulent and deadly Influenza A virus strain of subtype H1N1 .
Historical and epidemiological data are inadequate to identify the geographic origin of the virus .
Most of its victims were healthy young adults , in contrast to most influenza outbreaks which predominantly affect juvenile , elderly , or otherwise weakened patients .
The pandemic lasted from March 1918 to June 1920 , spreading even to the Arctic and remote Pacific islands .
It is estimated that anywhere from 20 to 100 million people were killed worldwide , or the approximate equivalent of one third of the population of Europe .
Interestingly , the Spanish flu comes from the same subtype ( Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 ) as Swine flu .
4 Yellow Fever
Yellow fever ’s symptoms are things such as fever , chills , slow heartbeat , nausea , vomiting , and constipation .
The WHO estimated that this disease causes around 30,000 deaths every year , when left unvaccinated .
A famous outbreak of yellow fever was in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania in 1793 .
The illness killed as many as 10,000 people in Philadelphia alone .
Most of the population fled the city , including the president .
But , the mayor stayed and life and order were soon restored .
Pictured above is a yellow fever quarantine station .
3 Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis , or “ consumption ” as it was commonly known , caused the most widespread public concern in the 19th and early 20th centuries as an endemic disease of the urban poor .
In 1815 , one in four deaths in England was of consumption ; by 1918 one in six deaths in France were still caused by TB .
In the 20th century tuberculosis killed an estimated 100 million people .
TB is an often deadly disease that normally affects the lungs .
Symptoms are coughing , weight loss , night sweats , and blood tinged sputum .
Skeletal remains show that people back in 7000 B.C. were infected with TB .
2 Polio
Polio is highly contagious .
It is a disease that affects the central nervous system and spine , sometimes leaves the victim paralyzed .
Symptoms are headache , neck , back , and abdominal pain , vomiting , fever , and irritability .
In 1952 , an outbreak in the United States left over 20,000 children paralyzed and over 3,000 dead .
Since then a vaccine has been created and most children are protected .
1 Bubonic Plague
Swollen lymph glands , skin turning red then black , heavy breathing , aching limbs , blood vomiting , and horrible pain are some of the symptoms .
The pain is caused by the rotting / decaying of the flesh .
All together this illness has caused over 200 million deaths .
Perhaps the most famous and horrible pandemic was in Europe in the late 1300s .
It was known commonly as the Black Death .
This incident almost halved the population of Europe .
The bubonic plague is caused normally by the bite of an infected flea .
Now , in modern times , several vaccines have been created , and people infected now are treated and cured .
Pictured above is a man who suffered bubonic plague during the outbreak in Algeria in 2003 .
Police have been criticised for refusing to let a woman who told them she was bleeding leave a cordon for five hours during the G20 protests .
Her GP later told her the bleeding she suffered could have been a miscarriage - though this was never confirmed .
The woman , who cannot be identified , spoke to Glenn Campbell for Newsnight .
There has never been a shortage of bad writers .
Almost anyone can bang out an atrocious book , but to achieve fame and adulation for it takes a certain kind of genius .
In this literary sub - genre , Irish writer Amanda McKittrick Ros reigns supreme .
" Uniquely dreadful , " proclaims the Oxford Companion to Irish Literature .
" The greatest bad writer who ever lived , " says author Nick Page .
Ros , who died in 1939 , abused ( some would say , tortured ) the English language in three novels and dozens of poems .
She refers to eyes as " globes of glare , " legs as " bony supports , " pants as a " southern necessary , " sweat as " globules of liquid lava " and alcohol as the " powerful monster of mangled might . "
The Oxford literary group " The Inklings , " which included C. S. Lewis and J.R.R .
Tolkien , held competitions to see who could read her work aloud longest while keeping a straight face .
Mark Twain considered her first book , Irene Iddesleigh , as " one of the greatest unin­tentionally humorous novels of all time . "
Consider this passage : " Speak !
Irene !
Wife !
Woman !
Do not sit in silence and allow the blood that now boils in my veins to ooze through cavities of unrestrained passion and trickle down to drench me with its crimson hue ! "
In Ros ' last novel , Helen Huddleson , she named characters after fruits , including Lord Raspberry ( and his sister Cherry ) , Sir Peter Plum , Christopher Currant and the Earl of Grape .
And Ros ' penchant for alliteration resists restraint :
The villainous Madame Pear , she wrote , " had a swell staff of sweet - faced helpers swathed in stratagem , whose members and garments glowed with the lust of the loose , sparkled with the tears of the tortured , shone with the sunlight of bribery , dangled with the diamonds of distrust , slashed with sapphires of scandals .... "
Ros ' husband , a train station manager in a small Northern Ireland town , financed the publication of Irene Iddesleigh as a tenth wedding anniversary present .
A reader sent a copy to humorist Barry Pain , who in an 1898 review called it " a thing that happens once in a million years . "
Initially entertained , he soon " shrank before it in tears and terror . "
In the preface to her next book Ros attacked Pain as a " clay crab of corruption " and a " cancerous irritant wart . "
Like many novelists , she believed her critics lacked the intellect to appreciate her talent and came to believe that her growing legion of detractors conspired against her for revealing the corruption of the ruling class — thereby disturbing , as she put it , " the bowels of millions . "
In the past century , a few Ros enthusiasts have kept her legend alive .
A biography — O Rare Amanda ! — was published in 1954 ; a collection of her most memorable passages was anthologized — Thine in Storm and Calm — in 1988 ; and two years ago , she was feted at a Belfast literary festival .
Ros imagined " the million and one who thirst for aught that drops from my pen , " and predicted she would " be talked about at the end of a thousand years . "
She 's well on her way .

I ’m a big fan of change , as you can probably guess , since I ’m writing on a blog called “ The Change Blog ” .
I ’m very much in favour of growth : people finding their path through life , taking the next steps , learning , discovering and doing new and fulfilling things .
Sometimes , though , it ’s necessary to hold back from change .
Sometimes , you might be tempted to implement a big change in your life – but a nagging feeling warns you against it .
Not all changes are appropriate for everyone , and even if a change is right for you , you may need to be cautious about implementing it at the right time .
Over -hasty change can exact a high price .
At a minimum , you ’ll probably end up wasting some valuable time – and quite possibly some money .
In worse cases , you could lose friends , spoil relationships , make yourself ill , or even suffer a financial set - back which takes you years to recover from .
So when might the price of change simply be too high ?
Here are a few situations when you might want to stop and think hard before making a particular change :
When external circumstances are against you
When you have important values or commitments that go against the desired change
When the impulse for change comes from outside
When the change would have irreversible consequences
When External Circumstances Are Against You
Now , like most people , I ’m prone to make excuses at times .
It can be easy to put off making real change because of “ the situation ” ( Sid Savara has a great post on “ the situation ” as a personal development roadblock . )
But in some cases , you may need to take the hard decision that while you want to change something in your life , the time is n’t yet right .
For example , if you want to quit your job , you may need to wait until you ’ve built up an emergency fund .
After I read Steve Pavlina ’s popular 10 Reasons You Should Never Get A Job , my growing feelings that the corporate world was n’t quite right for me became impossible to deny .
But it took me about 20 months to be in a financial position ( and with the freelancing skills and contacts I needed ) to quit my job .
Even if you ’re feeling hugely inspired by a book like Tim Ferriss ’ Four Hour Work - Week or Jonathan Fields ’ Career Renegade , you might need to stick it out in your day job or current career until you ’ve build up the resources – both financial and skill - based – to move on .
When Your Values And Commitments Go Against The Change
Another situation when you need to hold back from a change is when you feel it contradicts your own values , or the way you want to live .
For example , I know I would have more time to pursue personal projects and paid work if I cut back on my voluntary roles at church – and I know that many secular life coaches or personal development writers would advise me to do so .
However , these roles are important to me , and I ’m not willing to ditch my commitments here , even for the sake of faster change in other areas of my life .
Many of us struggle to make change when it involves dumping relatives , lovers or friends .
Some personal development gurus recommend cutting “ negative ” people out of your life : for me , though , and I ’m sure for many of you , this is often simply not an option .
That might mean that some of our energy is going on people who are “ high maintenance ” friends or relatives – but to make changes here would mean going against our key values .
When The Impulse For Change Comes From Outside
In some cases , you might have a particular goal that requires a change in your life .
A popular one is becoming an early riser – huge numbers of people seem to have this as a target in their life .
But in many cases , I suspect the impulse from change comes from outside – from a personal development writer who happens to be a morning person .
I myself find mornings a good time to write and to work .
I enjoy being up early and getting on with my day .
But many , many people are simply not at their best at 7 am – and there ’s nothing wrong with that .
If you do your best work in the afternoons or evenings , stick to that pattern .
There ’s no sense in pushing yourself towards a change because you feel you “ should ” do it .
The price of achieving it – forcing yourself on despite a lack of real motivation – is likely to involve you becoming unhappy or grouchy .
When The Change Would Have Irreversible Consequences
Some changes – getting up at 6 am , jogging daily , writing a novel – do n’t have huge or irreversible consequences .
( If getting up at 6 am makes you hellish to live with , you can always just start lying in again . )
Other changes , though , may exact too high a price :
Quitting your job to start your own business ( you might be able to go back if it all falls apart , but you ’ll have lost money in the meantime )
Dumping a partner or friend ( if you do decide it was an awful mistake , it ’ll be hard to patch up the relationship – and things will never be quite the same )
Investing a lot of money in a new scheme or idea ( if it fails , the money ’s gone )
Moving to a new country ( again , you can go back , but you ’ll have lost money and possibly acquaintances in the process )
Of course , if you want to make a big life change that you ’ve reasoned through and that you ’re passionate about – go ahead , and the best of luck to you !
What I ’m cautioning against here is getting fired up by a self - help book or by a passing impulse .
Do invest serious time into thinking about and planning for large changes in your life – and determine what the price would be if it does n’t work out .
Have you ever considered making a change , but decided against it because the price was too high ?
What was it – and how did you make your decision ?
Alternatively , have you ever madeover - hasty changes that you now regret ?

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - U.S. troops pulled out of Baghdad on Monday , triggering jubilation among Iraqis hopeful that foreign military occupation is ending six years after the invasion to depose Saddam Hussein .
Iraqi policemen take part in a ceremony transferring authority from the U.S. Army to Iraqi forces , in Basra , 420 km ( 261 miles ) southeast of Baghdad , June 29 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Atef Hassan
Iraqi soldiers paraded through the streets in their American - made vehicles draped with Iraqi flags and flowers , chanting , dancing and calling the pullout a “ victory . ”
One drove a motorcycle with party streamers on it ; another , a Humvee with a garland of plastic roses on the grill .
U.S. combat troops must pull out of Iraq ’s urban centers by midnight on Tuesday under a bilateral security pact that also requires all troops to leave the country by 2012 .
All had left the capital by Monday afternoon , Major - General in Staff , Abboud Qanbar , head of Iraqi security forces in Baghdad , told Reuters .
Another Iraqi official who would not be named said some units in cities outside Baghdad would leave at the last minute .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said 30 bases remained to be handed over .
There are still some 130,000 U.S. troops in Iraq .
Addressing military leaders in Baghdad , Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki said : “ Our sovereignty has started and ... we should move forward to build a modern state and enjoy ( the ) security which has been achieved . ”
Many Iraqis were elated even though they feared militants might use the withdrawal as an opportunity to step up attacks .
“ The American forces ’ withdrawal is something awaited by every Iraqi : male , female , young and old .
I consider June 30 to be like a wedding , ” said Ahmed Hameed , 38 , near an ice cream bar in Baghdad ’s upmarket Karrada district .
“ This is proof Iraqis are capable of controlling security inside Iraq , ” added the recent returnee from exile in Egypt .
The government has declared June 30 a national holiday , “ National Sovereignty Day . ”
“ BIG JOY ”
A spate of bombings in recent days , including two of the deadliest for more than a year that killed 150 people between them , have raised fears militants will try to step up the pace of attacks .
Yet few Iraqis see that as reason for the Americans to stay .
“ It is a big joy to see them leaving , ” said Abu Hassan , 60 , a shop owner .
“ There might be some more attacks because of struggles between the different parties , but Iraqis are controlling security now .
It ’s up to our forces now . ”
At a ceremony outside central Baghdad ’s old defense ministry building , the last Baghdad location to be handed over by U.S. forces , a military band played while soldiers and army college students paraded through a square festooned with Iraqi flags .
“ Baghdad is safe , Iraq is safe .
We are moving to sovereignty in secure steps , ” Qanbar said at the ceremony , which unusually was not cordoned off , despite the presence of the commander of U.S. forces in Baghdad , Major - General Daniel Bolger .
U.S. troops will remain at two giant bases near Baghdad airport that are defined as non-urban , in case the Iraqis need to draw on their firepower .
“ They ’ll ask us for help whenever they need something but they ’ve got a lot of capability .
This is their country .
It only makes sense they should secure their own cities , ” Bolger said .
Ultimately , Iraq ’s future depends not on U.S. firepower but on efforts to reconcile fractious ethnic and sectarian groups .
In an interview with Reuters on Monday , the new U.S. ambassador to Iraq Chris Hill said the U.S. did not seek a long term military presence in Iraq , contrary to the fears of some Iraqi political groups , only a long term diplomatic presence .
“ But at the end of the day the Iraqis are going to have to work out the political problems themselves , ” he said .
More than six years of U.S. occupation and the orgy of sectarian violence it unleashed have left most Iraqis feeling at best ambivalent about U.S. forces .
Many complain their lives have improved little since then , with daily struggles caused by power cuts and water shortages .
“ They did a good job getting rid of that tyrant , Saddam , and we thank them for that , but it ’s really time for them to leave , ” said Talib Rasheed , 70 , sitting outside in one of Baghdad ’s leafier suburbs .
“ Maybe they could leave us some electricity ? ”

Today I ’ve got Rob Carson below demonstrating how to make my favorite version of pumpkin soup : curry pumpkin soup 😀 .
This is some delicious stuff , if you like pumpkin anything , you ’ll love this .
It ’s rather thick and can come before a meal or it can be a meal in and of itself .
I ’d like to note that some versions of this recipe ( ones from the U.K. , typically ) will substitute Creme Fraiche instead of sour cream , this is fine .
Also , you ’ll note that he ’s using a food processor : great if you ’ve got one , use a blender if you do n’t , no big deal .
I ’ve also got another recipe afterward that I highly recommend for some lovely ginger pumpkin bisque .
Enjoy :
Ginger Pumpkin Bisque
Ingredients :
3 tablespoons of softened margarine
4 slices whole wheat bread
1 tablespoon of brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 15 oz can of pumpkin puree
1 cup of chopped onions
2 tablespoons of melted butter
2 14.5 oz cans of chicken broth
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup of heavy whipping cream
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
Directions :
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit ( 200 degrees Celsius ) .
Combine the butter , brown sugar , and cinnamon together , then spread the butter mixture evenly over one side of each slice of bread .
Put the bread , buttered side up , on a baking sheet and bake for 8 to 10 minutes , or until the bread is crisp and the topping is bubbly .
Cut each slice of bread into 8 small triangles or squares .
Saute the onion in butter in a medium sized saucepan until tender .
Now , add 1 can of the chicken broth and stir well .
Bring to a boil , then cover , reduce heat , and simmer for 15 minutes .
Transfer the broth mixture into the container of a blender or processor and process until smooth .
Return the mixture to the saucepan .
Add the remaining can of broth , along with the pumpkin , ground ginger , salt , ground cinnamon , and ground pepper ; stir well .
Bring to a boil , then cover , reduce heat , and simmer for 10 minutes while stirring occasionally .
Now stir in the whipping cream and heat through , but do not let it boil .
Ladle into individual soup bowls , then top each serving with your cinnamon croutons .

Well , the talks between the NFL and the players union are n’t going well .
Per the Associated Press , NFLPA Executive Director De Smith told reporters in Indianapolis on Monday that he ’s convinced that owners will lock out the players after the current Collective Bargaining Agreement expires following the 2010 season .
Smith said he still wants to know why owners opted to reopen the current labor deal two years early .
For the past several months , one of the primary NFLPA talking points has centered on the refusal of the NFL to generally open the books regarding whether and to what extent the franchises are making money .
The question , however , is n’t whether the teams are making money ( and we ’re told that some of them actually are now operating in the red , and that more will follow if tickets do n’t sell in sufficient numbers this season ) , but whether the teams are making enough money to maintain the value of the franchises and justify the investment of time and capital that has been devoted to these billion - dollar enterprises .
Though the average person might interpret the fact that the Packers generated an operating profit of $ 20.1 million in the club ’s most recent fiscal year as evidence that the Packers are doing well , large businesses have much bigger profit goals than that ..
For example , the operating profit of NBC Universal was $ 539 million for the second quarter of 2009 ( we should have asked for more money ) — and that was regarded as bad news ( regardless , we should have asked for more money ) .
So even if the union were able to point to the balance sheets of the NFL teams and argue that they are making money , the real question is whether they ’re making enough money to justify the significant value of the organizations — and the ongoing ownership of the franchises .
At some point , the question becomes whether it makes sense for the owners to cash out and put their money into other ventures that entail a greater return .
Thus , Smith needs to get past the trial lawyer shtick aimed at swaying the uninformed observer who would potentially be in the jury pool if any of this stuff were going to be introduced at a trial , and he needs to begin consulting with experts who can interpret the information already available to the union .
At best , Smith and his colleagues at the NFLPA are playing dumb in order to try to score points in a public - opinion debate that has no real relevance .
At worst , Smith and company are n’t feigning ignorance .

An immigrant baby boom is fuelling Britain ’s fastest population growth in half a century .
The number of people in the UK has passed 61 million for the first time , figures showed yesterday .
Record immigration levels over the past decade have driven up the number of women of childbearing age .
This helped boost the number of births last year to 791,000 – up 33,000 on 2007 .
For the first time in a decade , the excess of births over deaths played a bigger role than immigration itself in driving population growth , which is now twice as fast as in the 1990s .
The figures from the Office for National Statistics show that net immigration – the balance of those arriving over those leaving – fell by 44 per cent between 2007 and 2008 as economic turmoil triggered an exodus of foreign workers .
Immigration Minister Phil Woolas seized on those figures as proof that Britain ’s borders were ‘ stronger than ever ’ and migration was ‘ under control ’ .
He insisted that previous projections showing the UK population rising to 70 million within 30 years were now ‘ not true ’ .
Ignoring the baby boom , Mr Woolas said : ‘ Of course it ’s the net migration increase that has been worrying people , including me . ’
Opposition critics and immigration campaigners reacted with incredulity , pointing out that immigration remains at near - record levels and it is foreign - born mothers who are pushing up the birth rate .
Last month Home Secretary Alan Johnson ruled out any cap on immigration and told MPs he did not ‘ lie awake at night worrying about a population of 70 million . ’
Last month Home Secretary Alan Johnson ruled out any cap on immigration and told MPs he did not ‘ lie awake at night worrying about a population of 70 million . ’
Shadow Immigration Minister Damian Green said last night : ‘ Alan Johnson says he does n’t lose sleep over population growth .
Perhaps he should , instead of sleeping on the job .
‘ These figures show our population is still rising fast , even when the recession is driving hundreds of thousands to leave .
‘ This puts added pressure on housing and transport , and shows that there is still no proper control over immigration . ’
The ONS figures showed 61,383,000 people living in the UK in mid-2008 .
The figure has leapt by two million – equivalent to a city twice the size of Birmingham – in just seven years .
The increase of 408,000 in the 12 months from mid-2007 was the steepest since the baby boom years of the early 1960s .
It represented an annual increase of 0.7 per cent – more than twice as fast as in the 1990s and three times the rate of the 1980s .
Birth rates have been rising over the past decade , with the ONS measure of fertility now standing at 1.96 children per woman , up from 1.63 in 2001 and the highest in almost 40 years .
ONS statisticians said the rising birth rate was partly due to women born in the UK having more children .
While there was ‘ no single explanation ’ for this , possible causes included women in their 20s choosing to have babies slightly earlier and changes in government policies on maternity leave and tax credits .
However mass immigration has had a greater impact on birth rates , as hundreds of thousands of women of childbearing age have arrived in the UK .
They have boosted the number of potential mothers by two per cent since 2001 .
Foreign - born women also have a higher birth rate – 2.51 children compared with 1.86 for UK - born women .
ONS statistician Roma Chappell said 56 per cent of the 33,000 increase in births between 2007 and 2008 was accounted for by the babies of mothers born outside the UK .
Some of these , however , will be of British descent .
Across Britain around one baby in four is now born to a mother from overseas .
In London , the figure rises to 55 per cent , with the highest proportions last year in the boroughs of Newham ( 75 per cent ) and Brent ( 73 per cent ) .
Slight falls in the death rate over recent years mean that ‘ natural ’ population growth – the excess of births over deaths – reached 220,000 in 2007 /08 .
Net immigration added 186,000 – down from 198,000 the year before .
Earlier this week , separate health figures showed maternity services under severe pressure .
Some 4,000 women were forced to give birth outside maternity wards last year due to a lack of midwives and beds .
While the births figure is rising , numbers at the other end of the age scale are also growing .
There are now 1.3 million people aged 85 or over – more than two per cent of the population .
The ONS immigration statistics for the year to December 2008 showed 512,000 arrivals , down only slightly on the 527,000 figure of the previous year .
But there was a sharp rise in the number of foreign workers leaving the UK .
A total of 395,000 people emigrated , up 24 per cent on the year before .
They included 237,000 non-Britons , many of them Poles and other Eastern Europeans .
Sir Andrew Green , chairman of the MigrationWatch think - tank said last night :
‘ It is the usual Government spin to claim these numbers as a success for immigration policy when foreign immigration is virtually unchanged at about half a million a year .
‘ What has really happened is that EU citizens have voted with their feet .
The number leaving has doubled in the face of the deep recession in Britain .
But EU migration is something over which the Government have no control whatever .
‘ The bottom line is that the population of the UK will exceed 70 million within 25 years even at these levels of immigration . ’
East European exodus
The number of Eastern European workers returning home is now nearly as large as the numbers arriving .
Figures show that last year the total number of ‘ A8 ’ citizens coming to Britain from the former Eastern Bloc states slumped by more than a quarter from 109,000 to 79,000 .
At the same time the number returning to their homelands more than doubled , from 25,000 to 66,000 .
The trend helped drive down net immigration to 118,000 , a drop of 44 per cent and the lowest since the expansion of the EU five years ago .
Karen Dunnell , the Government ’s chief statistician , said the figures were likely to be due to the economic downturn .
She said : ‘ You have to say that probably unemployment and the economic situation , given that quite a lot from the A8 countries are coming to work , is probably having an impact . ’
An estimated one million people have flocked to the UK since Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic , Latvia , Lithuania , Estonia , Slovakia and Slovenia joined the EU in 2004 .
The Government faced fierce criticism at the time for opting to give all new EU citizens free access to UK labour markets , while other major economies imposed strict curbs .

FACTA ON A PLATE
Facts on a plate : our population is at least 77 million
Independent on Sunday , The , Oct 28 , 2007 by city eye
It is the statistic that dare not speak its name , though eventually it must .
It has huge ramifications for the civil and political life of this country , the health of the equity markets and , most immediately , the residential property market .
So do n’t forget you read it here first : the population of the UK is presently somewhere between 77 and 80 million .
The 2001 census , already hopelessly out of date and easy to avoid for those who find filling in forms a trifle inelegant , numbered us at a little under 59 million .
But as statistics go , that one ’s most definitely a damned lie .
My sources for the above statement are good , but scared of admitting the truth for fear of incurring the wrath of Whitehall .
It ’s like the best way of monitoring illegal drug consumption : forget the pious statements from ministers – the foolproof method is to sample our water and the effluent in it .
That ’s easily the best way of monitoring what the nation has been consuming .
Consumption – that ’s the thing .
Based on what we eat , one big supermarket chain reckons there are 80 million people living in the UK .
The demand for food is a reliable indicator ; as Sir Richard Branson says , you can have all the money in the world but you can only eat onelunch and one dinner .
The supermarket in question was privately lobbying the Competition Commission to let it grow its market share .
The argu- ment , reasonably enough , was that the market was far bigger than the regulator realised , so expanding the network was fair .
I have a second , respectable , source .
A major , non-commercial agricultural institution reckons there are 77 million of us in the UK .
Again , its reckoning is based on what we eat .
That faint background noise you ’re hearing as you read this is the sound of everyone slithering off the record .
Why ?
In political terms , standing behind these figures would be to toss a hand grenade into a vat of gasoline .
People would be hounded out of a job for scaremongering .
The Office for National Statistics ’ figures , published last week , predict a population of 75 million by 2051 .
It ’s an honest estimate but horribly wide of the mark because number counting does n’t work effectively .
If you want to know how many there are of us , ask a food firm .
If the true numbers were revealed , the Little Englanders and xenophobes would come out in force about the evils of immigration .
But that ’s what made America great in the 19th century , and it ’s a driving force of our economy right now .
It ’s also anti- inflationary .
David Buik , a money manager with broker BGC Partners , was talking of “ one million Eastern Europeans unaccounted for in London ” on television last week .
I suspect he ’s right if somewhat conservative in his estimate .
How many do you see working in the construction industry and waiting at tables ?
And when I say “ anti-inflationary ” , I mean they are getting rotten wages .
Dignified by the term “ cheap labour ” , the hidden hordes will do well for the services sector , among others .
People are assets – to maintain and to be maintained – so we are wealthier as a nation .
All of which is reflected in strong economic demand and markets see - sawing between optimism over what we all see on the streets ( that 77 million figure feels right to me ) and the possibility of something nasty if the Bank of England credit - crunch prognosis is correct ( to echo last week , I think next spring will be unpleasant ) .
As for housing , property magnates and chief executives of housing associations alike say the expanding population means serious demand for the foreseeable future , credit crunch or no .
Next week , I ’ll look at the detail of this argument .

Implications for the UK
12 . Five countries account for about half the visa applications to the UK .
In 2006 / 7 China , India , Nigeria , Pakistan and the Russian Federation were the source of 1.22 million applications of the 2.8 million received world wide .
In 2005 their combined population was 2890 million .
By mid-century it is projected to total 3728 million , an increase of 29 % .
13 . Meanwhile , the top ten source countries for asylum seekers are currently Iraq , Iran , Afghanistan , Eritrea , Zimbabwe , China , Somalia , Pakistan , North Korea , and Sri Lanka .
This list changes over time as conditions in those and other countries change .
However , by way of illustration , the population of these countries now comes to 1662 million .
By mid century it is projected to reach 2090 million , an increase of 26 % .

The Points Based System : Dispelling the Myths
The Points Based System ( PBS ) is not designed to limit the number of people settling in the UK .
Therefore it is completely unlike the Australian system .
According to Government figures , the PBS would have cut net immigration in 2007 by 8 % , when a reduction of 75 % is required to stop the UKs population hitting 70 million in 2028 .
1. Introduction
The Home Affairs Committee issued its report on the Points based system for work permits on Friday 31 July .
This note sets out the background .
2 . The PBS will not prevent the UKs population hitting 70 million
The Governments own calculation is that , if the PBS had been in operation last year , it would have reduced immigration by 20,000 or 8 % of net immigration of 237,000 in 2007 ( the latest available year ) [ 1 ] .
We need a reduction of 75 % to hold the population of the UK below 70 million and a 100 % reduction to hold it below 65 million compared to the present 61 million , as illustrated in the following diagram :
http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/briefingPaper/document/162
3 . The PBS is completely unlike the Australian system .
The system is quite different from the Australian system as it has no limits and is not intended to have any .
This scheme does not limit work - related migration in any way , and is not intended to .
The Australian system which it is said to resemble is , in fact , entirely different ; it starts with a limit and selects within that total .
By contrast , Tier One is entirely open ended .
For Tier
Two , employers are supposed to make sure that there is no satisfactory candidate within the European Union but this test is notoriously difficult to police .
Nor does it apply if an occupation has been declared a “ shortage occupation ” , nor if the migrant arrives as an intra company transfer .
4 . There is no evidence of the economic benefits of large scale immigration .
As unemployment climbs towards three million , the whole justification for a massive system for economic migration comes into question .
With a workforce of 30 million , the only long - term answer is to train and retrain British workers .
The CBI themselves acknowledged this in their evidence to the House of Lords [ 2 ] .
Furthermore , the whole concept of skills shortages is dubious , particularly over the medium term .
Professor Metcalf , Chair of the government ’s own Migration Advisory Committee told the House of Lords Economic Committee that “ the whole notion of shortages was a bit of a slippery concept ” ( Q557 ) , since , over time , wage increases should deal with the shortages .
This scheme assumes that there is significant economic benefit to the host country from large - scale immigration .
However , House of Lords report in April 2007 came to the opposite conclusion [ 3 ] .
5 . It does not help make British workers more competitive .
The main effect of the scheme will be to open the skilled section of our labour market to competition from overseas , thus reducing the incentive for employers to train British staff .
For example , Tier One will be open to any foreign student who has a obtained a Bachelor degree in the UK , is under 28 , has stayed on under the International Graduates Scheme and is earning 23,000 a year .
As the average starting salary for a graduate in the UK is about 21,000 , this is not a high hurdle .
These international graduates will be in direct competition with British graduates who will have run up substantial debts acquiring their degrees .
It is noteworthy that all the private sector jobs of working age created since 1997 have gone to foreign born workers .
6 . It does not fill gaps in the labour force .
This Government claims to this effect have been completely contradicted by the facts .
Since 1997 the number of foreign born workers has doubled to nearly four million , yet the number of vacancies hardly changed from 667,000 between mid 2001 to mid 2008 .
This is because immigrants fill some jobs but also create new demand which means new jobs .
( It has since fallen to 465,000 in Jan 2009 as the recession has developed ) .
7. Scope for abuse .
At the application stage , the incentive to forge the necessary documents will be huge .
At stake is a “ meal ticket for life ” both for the successful fraudster and his family .
The Government claim that “ intelligence led ” detection methods will be effective but with applications approaching 200,000 a year , that must be dubious .
Furthermore , after arrival , there is no guarantee that those granted work permits under Tier Two will actually do ( or continue to do ) the jobs that they were recruited for .
Under Tier
One there is not even a requirement that they should do skilled work .
8. Absence of embarkation controls .
This scheme is being brought into effect before border checks on individuals are fully in place .
The Home Office are , therefore , in no position to know whether someone granted a work permit has left at the end of it .
9. Difficulties of removal .
Quite apart from the extensive legal and practical difficulties of removing people against their will , the Government has almost no capacity to remove people who are neither foreign prisoners at the end of their sentence nor failed asylum seekers .
The Government claim to be removing an immigration offender every 8 minutes is deeply misleading .
This number includes those turned away at the border .
The number actually being removed after entry is about 1,000 a month or 12,000 a year ( excluding foreign national prisoners ) .
Meanwhile , the number of visas issued has risen rapidly in recent years to over 2 million a year .
The Government ’s removal capacity is less than 1 % of this number .
Therefore , unless over 99 % of those granted visas leave when they are supposed to , despite the absence of any checks , the number of illegals in Britain will climb every year .
10 . Complexity .
This will be a huge and complex scheme .
There are potentially 26,000 job titles and over 5,000 sponsors .
Given that students are included in Tier 4 , there could well be half a million applications a year .
On past form , the Home Office are most unlikely to have the staff and resources necessary to check on the authenticity of the applicants and their sponsors .
The pressure from industry and academia will be to reduce waiting times and backlogs .
It could well be only a matter of time before they are simply going through the motions for the sake of appearances , as we have seen so often in the past .

It 's the watch that bothers me .
Everything else is presidential – the pressed shirt and sharp tie ; the aides tiptoeing in with overflowing bowls of cherries and mulberries , and the huge , book - lined interview room done out in soft woods inside a new , Reichstag - inspired presidential palace .
But amid all this pomp , Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili is wearing a chunky blue plastic watch that appears to depict frolicking rabbits .
In a region where presidents tend to prefer hugely expensive Swiss timepieces to quirky novelty numbers , it 's odd to say the least .
But then Saakashvili never was much like any of the other presidents in the region – former party officials turned kleptocrats presiding over systemically corrupt dictatorships .
When Saakashvili came to power in the Rose Revolution of 2003 , he promised a fundamentally new form of government for the region .
The post -Soviet legacy of corruption , privilege and autocracy would be swept aside to make way for a bright new era of democracy , meritocracy and economic development .
That was then , of course , and this is now .
The heady days of George W Bush dancing in the streets of Tbilisi , Saakashvili's Georgia being hailed as a " beacon of freedom " , and a steady stream of Western correspondents leaving interviews dazzled by his democratic credentials and general all - round charm , are long gone .
In the interim came a crackdown on peaceful protesters , an increasingly belligerent opposition movement demanding his resignation , which in recent months has taken to blocking off central Tbilisi roads with pretend prison cells , and the small matter of a devastating war with Russia .
When I last met him , a little more than a year ago , he said that one of his major ambitions was for Georgia to become so stable and prosperous that ruling it would be a " boring task " .
It has n't quite worked out that way .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But Saakashvili – or , as everybody calls him , Misha – does n't allow us to begin with negative talk .
No sooner have I shaken his hand than he is bounding across the room like an excited child to show me photos of five - star hotels and other architectural developments planned for the Georgian Black Sea resort of Batumi .
" The first investments were made almost as a charity case , but now it 's taking off , and we expect tourist numbers to rise 10 - fold in the next three years , " he says , speaking at a hundred miles an hour in the fluent , lightly accented English that he honed while studying at Columbia University in New York .
His mop of black hair is greying slightly at the sideburns , but otherwise he does n't look like a man tired and burnt out after the last year .
Picture after picture of impressive palatial developments , combined with his effervescent commentary , and I 'm almost convinced that Batumi can be the new Barcelona , and Georgia can be the Singapore of the Caucasus .
There 's one problem , of course – Russia .
With all links cut with Georgia 's former major trading partner , the country 's exports have dropped dramatically , and with Saakashvili the Kremlin 's bête noire , many worry that Russia may pop back into Georgia to finish the job it started last year .
With a new incumbent in Washington , this could be more likely .
Outside the American South , few tears were shed when Bush left the White House .
But while the world was breathing a collective sigh of relief , Georgians were petrified .
Bush had seen Georgia as an important – perhaps the only – neocon success project .
Saakashvili enthusiastically packed off soldiers to fight in Iraq , and even named a street in Tbilisi after the Texan president , who treated Misha like a prodigal son .
With Barack Obama coming into office , priorities in Washington shifted .
Talk began about a new era of relations with Russia , sticky issues such as Georgia were to be forgotten , and Hillary Clinton even presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov with a " reset button " to symbolise a new start for bilateral relations .
In Tbilisi the uneasy joke was that the button was also a detonator , destroying hopes of Georgian independence .
President Obama travels to Moscow tomorrow for his first official visit , a much - hyped trip with hopes on both sides for revived engagement .
The worry in Tbilisi will be that Georgia will be sold out to the Russians for bigger geopolitical issues .
With tensions again rising in the region , Russia conducting huge military exercises on Georgia 's border , and a feeling in some sections of the Russian elite that the job was n't finished properly last summer , Saakashvili says he is hoping that the US president will choose his words carefully in Moscow .

" If Obama says something that looks like some kind of permission for something , then they will go for it .
That 's why every word counts .
You are dealing with Byzantine traditions and doublespeak with Russia , which is hard for the West to understand . "
Still , says Saakashvili , his government has received positive signals from the new administration .
" I 've spoken to Obama several times , and we have a very good working relationship with this administration at every level .
They are fresh and focused . "
In Moscow , meanwhile , the name Saakashvili has taken on the air of a swear word .
Top Russian officials recoil at the mention of the Georgian president 's name .
President Dmitry Medvedev has referred to him as a " political corpse " , and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has said he wants to see Saakashvili " hung by the balls " .
Both sides react with fury and disbelief when it 's suggested that they were responsible for last August 's war .
Putin claims that hostilities started when Saakashvili recklessly sent tanks into South Ossetia and the Russians had no choice but to respond .
Saakashvili insists that the Russian invasion was unprovoked and part of a long - term plan of Putin's to occupy Georgian territory .
The truth may be that both sides bear their share of responsibility , though Saakashvili denies this furiously , calling those who wish to believe that he started the war " willingly uninformed " .
Putin , says Saakashvili , told him shortly after the recognition of Kosovo by the United States and many European countries , a move that Russia vehemently opposed , that there would be consequences in the Caucasus .
" He said : ' You have to pay for your allies .
Your allies just recognised Kosovo , and we have to do something .
But it wo n't be very painful for you , do n't worry . '
It was like somebody standing with an axe at your head and saying ' Do n't worry , everything 's OK , just close your eyes and relax . ' "
Medvedev , who is widely regarded as less of a hawk and less powerful than Putin , has joined in the rhetoric condemning the Georgian president .
But , claims Saakashvili , Medvedev as good as warned him that the war was coming a few weeks before the fateful day in August , at an informal dinner hosted by Kazakhstan 's President Nursultan Nazarbayev in the Kazakh capital , Astana .
" At our first meeting in Moscow , Medvedev had offered to meet in Sochi in June .
So I 'd been chasing him since then and asking to meet , and he was always avoiding my calls .
" I cornered him at this dinner in Astana and said : ' Come on , let 's meet ...'
He said : ' Now is not the time for meeting , it could end in disappointment . '
I said : ' Well , come on , how could our relations be any worse than they are now ? '
He turned to me and said : ' Here you are mistaken .
Very soon it can get much much much worse . '
He did n't like that it was coming but could n't do anything about it . "
The Russians , never keen on a man who promised to bring his country out of Moscow 's orbit and lead it into Nato and the European Union , have since last summer 's war embarked on a fevered propaganda campaign to show that Saakashvili is so unstable that he 's in need of medical help .
Kremlin - funded English - language channel Russia Today regularly refers to him as " nuts " , while Russian television has devoted prime - time slots to chat shows involving psychiatrists analysing Saakashvili 's behaviour as classic psychopath material .
He certainly lost the plot at times during the war .
One incident , where TV cameras caught him chewing on his tie while waiting to start an interview , has been replayed ad nauseam on Russian television .
A joint press conference with Condoleezza Rice held in the hazy heat on the rooftop of his presidential palace was almost painful to watch , as the Georgian president appeared on the verge of tears and ranted semi-coherently about the Russian " barbarians " .
But Saakashvili is n't nuts .
Indeed , he is without a doubt the most intellectual and charismatic politician in the region .
" I was certainly in a shaky mood , and it was visible , " he admits , shovelling a handful of mulberries into his mouth .
" But I think we pulled ourselves together , put the economy back on track , and found the force to continue the reforms . "
Listening to him speak , I can't help being reminded of another politician who , while operating in a very different context , shares a remarkably similar political trajectory to Saakashvili .
Coming to power at a time of general disillusionment with politics and the political system , Saakashvili was a man with a very different and engaging vision of the future ; a man of eloquence and intellect who captured the imagination of huge swaths of the population and enacted real and sweeping changes ; a man whose modernising vision for his country was eventually damaged by the neocon project and involvement in an unwinnable war .
Switch Tony Blair 's quiet , dogged Christianity with the occasionally fiery exuberance of the Caucasus male , then the two men seem like political twins .
Both of them are obsessed with legacies , both of them care so deeply about politics that the passion seeps out of every pore , both of them were accused by their increasing number of political enemies of dictatorial impulses and an over - reliance on spin .
And ultimately , both of them speak with such passion and belief , that even when you disagree with what they 're saying , it 's hard not to be impressed .
At the end of the interview , I ask him what is going on with the rabbit watch .
" Yeah , it 's a bunny watch , so what ? " he asks jokily , giving a high - pitched cackle .
During their recent protests calling for his resignation , the opposition had unveiled a banner outside the presidential palace saying that Saakashvili was like a scared rabbit , and had thrown carrots – and at one point a live rabbit – over the railings .
" They had this banner in English , saying ' Saakashvili is a rabbit ' – presumably for a foreign audience .
I do n't know what 's so bad about this .
Unless you keep rabbits at your apartment , they are pretty nice , " he says , with a grin .
The watch , which he's had for several years , is perhaps his way of showing that he can take the opposition 's insults with good humour .
The protesters blockaded the main street with makeshift cells , and picketed his office so that he had to work from another building across town for two months .
But the mood in Tbilisi seems to have changed , with many ordinary Georgians bored of the fractured opposition , and unwilling to play into Russia 's hands by helping to oust the president .
When Saakashvili was the toast of the West , touted as the model democrat and post - Soviet saviour , it was hard not to be struck by his obvious flaws .
Now that he 's regularly described as a volatile madman , it 's striking to remember that despite all those flaws , and for all that he may well bear some responsibility for the war last year , he still offers an energetic , exciting vision for his country that is rare in the region .
" I will leave behind me a country that has modern democratic functioning institutions and modern infrastructure , " he says .
" It 's like a five - year plan for the Soviet Union but for all the reverse reasons – to change everything that the Soviet Union spoiled here .
People should get used to living in a merit - based , non-corrupt , democratic society . "
That the opposition can so aggressively demand his resignation suggests that the country has already come a long way down this road .
And despite everything , looking around the rest of his region , that 's not a bad achievement .
Whether he will ultimately be remembered for this , however , or instead for the disastrous war and subsequent loss of Georgian territory , remains to be seen .

Earlier this morning , I got a chance to catch up with Dr. Sanjay Jha , co-CEO of Motorola ( s MOT ) , soon after his company reported earnings ( they met Wall Street ’s modest expectations ) to talk about everything from the state of the mobile market to prospects for Motorola .
I will write all that up in a longer post , but there was one part of the conversation that stuck with me as it was very telling about the momentum around Google ’s Android and the detrimental impact it ’s having on Microsoft ’s Windows Mobile .
As part of our conversation , Dr. Jha stressed that handset makers need to pick a single smartphone OS and devote resources to it in order to win .
He pointed to Nokia and Symbian , Apple and its iPhone OS and RIM ’s BlackBerry OS .
He used that logic to justify why his company was betting the farm on Google ’s Android .
Why ?
Because it ’s the best option for the company right now .
“ I did n’t have any other compelling option , ” he said .
“ The other OS got pushed . ” I asked him if he was talking about Microsoft ’s Windows Mobile or the LiMo operating systems , but Dr. Jha proved to be too polite to name names and reveal more details .
Microsoft ’s Windows Mobile 6.5 had been scheduled to make it out of the chutes by May , but wo n’t hit the market till October .
From what we ’ve heard , there are n’t any Windows Mobile - based devices in Motorola ’s line - up for 2010 , so it ’s reasonable to say that Windows Mobile has lost favor at Motorola .
Back in February , The Wall Street Journal reported that Motorola was going to cut its ties with Windows Mobile .
At the time , the handset maker denied any such moves .
A month earlier , however , I hinted at Motorola backing away from Microsoft - based handsets .
Like upstart HTC , a long - time Windows Mobile loyalist , Motorola is focusing its development resources behind Google ’s Android OS .
Both HTC and Motorola are developing their own user interfaces for Android , which indicates their seriousness about Google ’s mobile platform .
I wonder if this is going to be a trend that ’s going to spread .
From what I ’ve heard , everyone from Lenovo and Huawei to Dell to Samsung are betting on Android .
These companies would have been partners of Microsoft in the past .
I feel Microsoft wasted away many years while it held the top position in the mobile handset business .
Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer recently told analysts that , “ It was a tough year on succeeding with phones , mostly our own issues , frankly . ” ( via The Washington Post ) .
Robbie Bach , president of Microsoft ’s entertainment and devices business , was more candid , and admitted to problems with Microsoft ’s mobile strategy in a meeting with financial analysts and investors .
Bach reported that Microsoft ’s share of the mobile phone operating system market had declined despite the fact that volumes were up a tad .
Microsoft claimed that 20 million Window Mobile phones were sold in 2008 .
“ To date , we have n’t done as good a job as I would like building relationships and getting the right integration with our hardware partners …
You ’re going to see dramatic improvement in integration . ”
“ It is our view that one model , one phone is not going to build volume , ” he said .
“ People are going to want different configurations on their phones .
We need to work very closely with Samsung , Sony Ericsson and others to build a broad selection of phones that provide a choice of different pricepoints and different capabilities . ”
Funny there was n’t any mention of Motorola !
I wonder if it will be too late for the company to make a comeback , similar to Zune struggling to play catch - up with the iPod .
So while there is a lot of focus on Apple vs.
Google , the real battle is actually between Microsoft Windows Mobile and Google Android .
It looks like Google has drawn its first blood .
( Dr. Jha will deliver a keynote speech and discuss Motorola ’s bet on Mobile Internet in our mobile Internet - focused conference , Mobilize 09 , that will be held in San Francisco on Sept. 10 . )
The latest Digg Dialogg stars none other than Brüno , the über - famous Austrian model and host of the Funkyzeit fashion and celebrity show .
To make sure that Brüno 's interview is well - seeded at all times , Digg has teamed up with Mininova .
With a theater release scheduled for less than two weeks time , Bruno is doing several interviews promoting his upcoming mockumentary .
One of the most anticipated Q and A sessions is the Dialogg with the Digg.com community that was released earlier today – on Digg as well as Mininova .
Our traffic sponsor Digg is no stranger to BitTorrent .
Before the MediaDefender debacle Digg ’s weekly video podcast Diggnation was published on Revision3 ’s very own BitTorrent tracker , but times have changed .
However , with their latest Dialogg video Digg has again decided to embrace the Internet ’s most powerful distribution method .
They ’ve teamed up with Mininova , the largest BitTorrent indexer , to make the file available to millions of Bittorrent users .
“ We see BitTorrent as a smart way to legitimately distribute content amongst millions , ” Matt Van Horn , Business Development Manager for Digg told TorrentFreak .
“ That ’s why we ’re excited to share Digg Dialogg via torrents as one of the ways in which people can enjoy Digg ’s interview with Bruno , ” Matt added .
In addition to a regular torrent , Mininova is also testing a BitTorrent - powered video stream using Bitlet ’s services .
By clicking on the “ stream this video ” link users can directly watch the stream in their browser , fully powered by BitTorrent .
Mininova co-founder Erik Dubbelboer told us that they are delighted to be working with Digg .
“ We have always liked Digg so when they asked us to work together we jumped on it immediately .
This was also a nice opportunity to test the new video streaming from Bitlet which we had just implemented into our Content Distribution service , ” he said .
With its Content Distribution service Mininova is seeding the file on its servers which guarantees a high speed download .
The advantage for the Digg team is that they save some bandwidth and do n’t have to seed Bruno themselves .
The Dialogg with Bruno can be both downloaded and streamed using on Mininova .
Geil !

What Are Designer Drugs ?

It has been days since Empress Sarah Palin quit Alaska , forever .
And no one yet knows why !
Her " explanation " lacked , uh , actual coherent reasons .
But there are theories .
Mickey Kaus offered 14 theories for Palin 's resignation , many of which are now kinda redundant and a bit stale .
They can be whittled down to six .
Crime !
This is the " theory " that Sarah Palin will sue us for mentioning , so we 'll just say that there is no evidence at all that she embezzled anything , from anyone .
Or , at least , there is no evidence that she is under federal investigation for embezzlement .
So maybe not this one !
But ...
Some other terrible political thing Like maybe some new and more exciting ethics issue is coming down the pipeline ?
Maybe something is rotten with the Alaska state finances ?
But why would one more small - potatoes scandal end her heroic governing adventure ?
Sex !
Maybe Todd let Greta Van Susteren " handle " him , at the WHCD ?
Maybe Bristol got knocked up by A - Rod ? Maybe Sarah slept with Greta Van Susteren ?
There are , as far as we know , no new rumors along these lines .
Just idle fantasies .
Money
Now we enter the realm of " likely but boring . "
Sarah Palin can make a lot more money writing books and giving speeches and maybe even hosting a TV show of some kind ( can you imagine ? ) as a private citizen than she can as the Governor of Alaska .
She did mention legal bills in her rambly speech , though the woman raises a million bucks from crazies every time she stutters , so how bad could things be ?
She Just Hates Governing Yeah , has she ever demonstrated any aptitude for the actual business of governing ?
We realize that 's a lot to ask of any leading light of the Republican party these days , but still .
Alaska 's running out of money , the legislature hates her , and none of that shit is as much fun as appearing on TV to complain about how everyone on TV is unfair to you all the time .
She Is Crazy Maybe the incoherent reasons she gave for quitting — to win the game , for the team — represent her actual thought process ?
Maybe she decided not to run for reelection , in order to position herself for 2012 , and then she was like " you know what , if not running for reelection is how I get ready to be President , quitting altogether right now will have to make me even more ready . "
Special bonus non-reason :
She Is Quitting Politics to Focus On Being a Private Citizen and Raising Her Children in Peace Yeah this one is the K - Lo fantasy , in which she 's not a relentless ambitious career pol who uses her kids as props when that 's convenient and decries their exploitation when anyone else mentions them .

None has generated more controversy than the film “ Rachel ” , a film by Jewish - Israeli filmmaker Simone Bitton about the death of Rachel Corrie , the young woman killed by an Israeli- military bulldozer as she was protecting homes in the Rafah , Gaza .
At the request of the filmmaker , they have invited Cindy Corrie , Rachel ’s mother to speak .
Big time controversy and condemnation by a weekly Jewish magazine and even from the local Israel Consul General .
The San Francisco Jewish Film Festival , the largest Jewish Film festival in the world , will screen many films this year , many with discussion with filmmakers and others featured in the film .
Some of these films will be controversial , there will be all sorts of issues explored .
Israel Consul General protests the presence of Cindy Corrie :
“ The San Francisco Jewish Film Festival made a serious error in judgment in inviting Mrs. Corrie to the festival , ” Israel Consul General Akiva Tor said via e-mail .
“ She is a propagandist who is immune from responsibility for the causes she supports because it was her daughter , Rachel , who was accidentally killed .
“ So her staged presence becomes a kind of emotional grandstanding , rather than pursuit of a deeper insight . ”
Propagandist ?
The Consul General has been busy supporting policies of expanding settlements in the West Bank , supporting the war on Gaza , supporting a brutal blockade , and now will be supporting a policy of muzzling Palestinians , and Jewish Israelis , who dare to commemorate the Nakba of 1948 .
The Foreign Minister , his boss , is seen by many ( even Israeli diplomats ) as extreme as fascist Haider of Austria … and this man is calling Cindy Corrie a “ propagandist ” ?
Cindy Corrie who wants justice , freedom , security and economic viability for both Israelis and Palestinians ?
I think its a way of saying there is a point of view that the Consul General finds might disturb the status quo .
Change might happen .
Scary .
Also a way to challenge the official narrative .
“ accidental ” he says ?
That ’s the official line .
Not so fast .
Maybe not an accident .
as perhaps the deaths of hundreds of civilians in the war on Gaza of December / January is perhaps not an accident , or the continuing blockade that brings hunger to the people of Gaza is not an accident .
Perhaps the latter atrocity is nothing more than a joke among its designers .
Jewish Voice for Peace , a national group based in the Bay Area , is one of the groups co-sponsoring this film , and they are to be commended for their courage , as well as the festival organizers .
Compare this to the sometimes successful effort to not allow the staging of the play : “ My Name is Rachel Corrie ” at several theaters around the country ( which helped tremendously , no doubt , with publicity and its success where it was produced ) .
Here is how Cecilie Surasky of Jewish Voice for Peace responds to J Weekly ’s editorial opposing the presence of Cindy Corrie .
There ’s something so deeply , deeply depressing about the attack against Cindy Corrie by J Weekly , the Bay Area ’s Jewish newspaper .
True , it ’s just one of countless examples of the moral malaise that plagues the institutional Jewish world when it comes to Palestinians , but on this day , this day when I am fresh back from Gaza , from Hebron , from Silwan , it has gotten to me .
I ’m not sure which is worse - the possibility that the J’s editorial writer actually believes the morally groundless drivel he or she is writing ?
Or the possibility that they know full well that the moral outrage that is the Israeli treatment of Gazans is an affront to all Jews and feeling people , but that they care more about keeping advertisers happy .
Change is happening , both in the Jewish Community and the wider community , and the keepers of the status quo can not shut it down .
that ’s not to say they are not trying .
This should be seen in the wider context .
In Israel , beyond the attempt to erase “ Nakba ” from the history books , ( see assaf ’s diary ) there is also the arrest and detention of Jewish groups who desire a different future for Israel , not based on militarism and oppression .
The government must resort to repression not just of Palestinians , which is widely - accepted Israeli tradition , but now even Jewish dissidents .
It is the criminalization of dissent , by any means necessary .
It wo n’t work .
Arrests will not work .
Personal attacks will not work .
Like the ones that will accumulate below , more likely than not , some based purely on the idea that most of my diaries deal with oppression of Palestinian rights … what if i were focusing on the Health Care debate … would there be this wild accusations without basis if i was consistently unfriendly to insurance company policies ?
Is there some mathematical formula to determine one ’s “ acceptable ” criticism of Israel ?
It really is nothing less than a lame attempt to avoid dealing with substance , and diverting people ’s attention .
This movement to demand justice in the Middle East is already too large , too diverse for that to work .
They will call Rachel and her mother “ terrorist sympathizers ” who have no business going to Gaza .
Like they say that Ezra Nawi has no business protect homes in the West Bank .
Like others said that Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner had no business going to Mississippi to support the movement for justice there .
Or like others said that Ita Ford , Maura Clarke , Dorothy Kazel and Jean Donovan had no business in El Salvador .
It is our business to share in the struggle for human rights and peace .
Rachel will be shown on Saturday , July 25th , 1:30 pm at the beautiful Castro Theater in San Francisco .
Cindy Corrie
Will be there .
Here is the Statement from the organisors of the San Francisco Film Festival ….on why they are screening Rachel
He said only two or three tigers were collared at any one time .
" If only two or three tigers out of 35 are radio - collared , how can the collaring be responsible for poaching ? " he said .
He had recently collared three tigers at Sariska reserve and said all three remained alive and at large in the park .
The number of bankruptcies rose by a staggering 51.6 per cent in June compared to the year before , as more Canadian consumers and businesses were unable to pay their debt .
The report from the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy of Canada , released yesterday , shows there were 11,338 filings in June , up from 7,478 for June , 2008 .
That 's also up 9.1 per cent from the 10,364 bankruptcy filings in May , 2009 .
The overwhelming majority of those filings came from consumers .
The number of proposals , a last ditch effort to pay creditors a portion of what they are owed , also jumped by 49.5 per cent , up to 3,080 from 2,060 in June , 2008 .
The figures paint a picture of a growing number of Canadians who are becoming swamped by their debt at a time when unemployment is also rising because of the recession .
Equifax Canada said in its latest report last week that the average national credit card delinquency rate rose 1.56 at the end of June , a jump of 24 per cent over the same period last year .
Toronto is also cited as having the highest delinquency rate of 2.03 per cent .
Businesses accounted for 515 of the total bankruptcies across the country in June .
That 's up 11 per cent from the 464 companies that filed the month before .
It 's also an increase of 10.8 per cent from June , 2008 .
Two - thirds of those filings came from Ontario and Quebec , where the recession in Canada and the U.S. , as well as the higher Canadian dollar has put a strain on manufacturing companies , partly those in the automotive sector .
The report shows that companies in retail , manufacturing , and construction accounted for most of the bankruptcies .
In total , there were 33,167 bankruptcies from April to June of this year , up 38.1 per cent when compared with the same period for 2008 .
President Obama set out for a weeklong family vacation Sunday facing the first stiff headwind of his presidency , with public polls showing his popularity has dipped as he has attempted an overhaul of the nation ’s ailing health care system .
A series of national surveys has confirmed what was becoming clear as large groups of protesters rallied outside the speeches and town - hall events the president hosted last week in Western states .
The Rasmussen Reports daily tracking poll released Sunday showed that 41 percent of voters strongly disapprove of Mr. Obama ’s performance as president , compared with 27 percent who strongly approved .
Rasmussen said those numbers are the worst ever for Mr. Obama .
The 14 - point gap between the two numbers is more than double the six - point difference in the Rasmussen poll as recently as Thursday .
The total of “ disapproval ” responses , of whatever strength , topped the approval numbers by 51 percent to 48 percent .
Using unusually strong language to describe the developments , borne out in a host of polls over the past week , political analyst Charlie Cook said in an e-mail to his subscribers that “ the situation this summer has slipped completely out of control for President Obama and congressional Democrats . ”
“ We believe it would be a mistake to underestimate the impact that this mood will have on members of Congress of both parties when they return to Washington in September , if it persists through the end of the congressional recess , ” Mr. Cook wrote .
Joseph Pounder , a Republican campaign consultant who recently left the staff of the House Republican leadership to work for a gubernatorial candidate in Texas , said the turn of events has been both surprising and rejuvenating for Mr. Obama ’s political opponents .
“ It ’s been a real bad summer for a White House that was supposed to rock everyone ’s world , ” Mr. Pounder said .
August polls have been unkind to Mr. Obama since 2007 .
Doubts beset his primary campaign in August 2007 , Mr. Obama said , recalling a period when he trailed his Democratic rival by 30 points .
Last August , Sarah Palin took the nation ’s political main stage .
“ The media was obsessed with it , and cable was 24 hours a day [ saying ]
‘ Obama ’s lost his mojo , ’ ” the president told a group of supporters .
“ You remember all that ? ”
Democratic activists said that Mr. Obama ’s election last fall provides ample proof that he is capable of overcoming gaffes and bad poll numbers .
Whether he will do that this fall , though , remains clouded by a health care debate that is staggering in its complexity .
Deputy press secretary Bill Burton said the administration has long recognized that it could see dents in the widespread support the president garnered when he first took office if it undertook an initiative as potentially divisive as health care reform .
“ If getting health care reform done were a matter of making easy decisions and doing politically popular things , it probably would have gotten done a long time ago , ” Mr. Burton said .
Those dents were clear in recent polling conducted jointly by The Washington Post and ABC News .
That poll said that 49 percent of Americans now express confidence that Obama will make the right decisions for the country , down from 60 percent at the 100 - day mark in his presidency .
Forty - nine percent say they think he will be able to spearhead significant improvements in the health care system , down nearly 20 percentage points from before he took office , the poll reported .
Some congressional Democrats have conceded in recent days that they are worried about the toll the health care battle is taking .
Their own numbers have dropped alongside the president ’s , and there remains no clear coalition forged to get health care done by the president ’s fall deadline .
Gallup reported that its polling has found public approval of Congress at its lowest reading since February .
Gallup ’s Aug. 6 - 9 survey found 31 percent of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing while 62 percent disapprove .
Still , not everyone is convinced that Democrats should be sounding alarms .
Rep. Chris Van Hollen , Maryland Democrat , said his party ’s leaders have recognized for months what they are facing - the historical track record suggests the party in power almost always loses seats during its first midterm test .
But he said Republicans in Congress are miscalculating by aligning themselves with what he called “ the pitchfork crowd , ” parading with posters of Mr. Obama ’s face smeared with an Adolf Hitler mustache .
Those tactics “ are going to boomerang ” before the health care debate has ended , Mr. Van Hollen said .
“ If Obama has shown anything , it ’s that he ’s Mister October - that ’s when he makes his comebacks after a rough patch , ” said Phil Singer , a Democratic consultant who runs Marathon Strategies .
Mr. Singer , who served as a combative top press aide to the Clinton campaign against Mr. Obama in 2007 and 2008 , said it would be a “ huge mistake ” to bet against the president .
He predicted that White House aides - nearly all of whom worked for Mr. Obama during the election - would kick into campaign mode when the American people emerge from summer vacations and re-engage with politics and policy .
Mr. Singer also dismissed the troubling early polls for congressional Democrats , such as a Cook Report survey released Friday suggesting the party could lose more than 20 seats in 2010 .
“ Two years ago , polls showed Hillary Clinton was going to be president , ” he said , laughing .

The PSLV - C11 ( Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle ) , Chandrayaan - 1 sits on the second launch pad of Satish Dhawan space centre at Sriharikota , about 100 km ( 62 miles ) north of the southern Indian city of Chennai , in this October 11 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Babu / Files
BANGALORE ( Reuters ) - India has lost all contact with an unmanned spacecraft conducting its first moon mission , the national space agency said on Saturday .
Communications with the Chandrayaan - 1 craft broke down early on Saturday .
“ It is a serious problem .
If we do not re-establish contact we will lose the spacecraft , ” said S. Satish , spokesman for the Indian Space Research Organisation ( ISRO ) .
The $ 79 - million mission was launched amid national euphoria last October , putting India in the Asian space race alongside rival China , reinforcing its claim to be considered a global power .
A probe vehicle landed on the moon a month later and sent back images of the lunar surface .
But a critical sensor in the main craft , orbiting the moon , malfunctioned in July , raising fears that the two - year mission may have to be curtailed .
One of the mission ’s main aims was to look for Helium 3 , an isotope which is very rare on earth but could be an energy source in the future in nuclear fusion .
ISRO has plans to send a manned mission to space in four years ’ time and eventually on to Mars .
Bioforge
It ’s time for some history .
There was always a unique game that would make a small revolution and start the whole new category of video - games , the one that is the very first of the kind .
As soon as that kind of game is released , you can tell that in no time there will be hundreds of " clones " and " look - alikes " .
And usually there will be another game that will make that category even more popular .
So there were Wolfenstein 3D and Doom , Dune 2 and C&C , and so there was Alone in the Dark , the game that started this new category - 3D action - adventure .
Alone in the Dark , naturally had a lot of stuff that could be improved .
One of them ( and perhaps the most important since the story and atmosphere were great ) was the movement of the character .
It was much more like a robot than like the man .
So , it was just a question of time before some game ’d make a serious improvement in this area .
The first one was the famous Ecstatica , where the design of the characters was based on ellipsoid and very realistic movement .
The next step was the same effect but with realistic design .
The next step was Bioforge .
Everything about this game seemed incredible when it was released : graphics , gameplay and especially the atmosphere .
Naturally , when you play it a little you will see that it is not perfect , but there was no major fault that could bring down the entire impression .
Enough of this general praise , let 's go one by one .
A ship docks on a strange planet and two armoured men carry some guy who can't even walk inside .
You can also see a face with an evil smile starting some sort of an operation .
Next thing you know is that you woke up in a cell of some kind not knowing where you are and even more not knowing what you are .
Although this kind of a start was used so many times in games , movies and stories , it does n’t seem to fail in making an interesting start .
And when talking about Bioforge , what a start it is .
You will immediately realize that the fact that you 're awake does n't mean that you survived yet .
Conversations with other characters are either automatic or in the cut -scenes .
But you will find most of the information reading computer logs and personal notebooks .
Here and there you 'll find someone 's notebook where you will find info about what happened from different aspects and sometimes you 'll find important codes .
Slowly you 'll get a picture of what is going on while trying to discover your identity , what happened to you and perhaps the way of escaping .
You do n't have to read everything carefully if you do n't want to bother .
Instead you can just quickly move through logs or notebooks and then read the important information in your own log .
There will be very few friends and a lot of danger of various sorts .
The game manages to remain an adventure while you constantly deal with new troubles .
The storyline is much deeper than it seems at the start and after a lot of action and slow progress in the story , things will turn around later .
Well , there will still be a lot of action .
The combat button will switch the combat mode on / off .
While in combat mode , you can combine hand and leg buttons with numpad buttons to perform a variety of attacks and dodges .
Hand - to - hand combat is done very well , you will try to make hit after hit without giving your foe the time to fight back .
If he does , you must perform the block unless he is too fast and manages to make hit after hit .
So there is no easy fight really .
This is also where biggest fault in the game comes to light : sometimes the camera position wo n't offer a good view of you and your foe .
That may get irritating sometimes when you simply miss your enemy because you can't determine the right direction and he remains free to attack however he pleases .
When in combat mode , if you do n't do anything you will automatically orient towards the enemy , but sometimes you will want to run toward him and hit him right away .
Automatic orientation is a good thing but still some cameras will give you headaches .
This is not an easy game and this especially goes for action parts , because it may often happen that you start a duel very well , but one mistake can give your foe enough advantage to defeat you .
It is interesting to see the damage on your body .
The less health you have , the more wounds will appear on you .
Health can be restored using the battery inside of you .
You actually have a battery that provides energy for your body and can be used for health recovery .
This is important as there are not many new batteries to be found .
Energy will be very important later , but you will have to discover it yourself .
You will find only a few sorts of weapons but it is really not a fault .
Every blaster can also be used as the club .
At the end it seems that you will have more fights with hitting than shooting .
You will be mostly shooting at robots of various kinds .
Lasers are reflecting off glass and certain walls so you can shoot while still covered .
This is sometimes the only way to defeat some enemies .
And sometimes it is best to simply be fast .
This review could go on and on but it 's better not to say it all .
So , everything about this game is great indeed .
It ’s an action - packed adventure with a deep and interesting story and a lot of troubles and puzzles to take care .
This game is highly recommended to all video - game lovers , not only adventure and action fans .
Surely one of the best games of it's kind .
Unfortunately , you need DOSBox to play it in XP and you will need a lot of skills to make it run smooth .
The full enjoyment is reserved for those with Win98 ( or older ) only or perhaps for better emulation .
Make sure that sound settings in DosBox match the settings in the game ( IRQ , DMA ) .
Mount the directory where the Bioforge is as C : in DosBox .
Example : if your Bioforge directory is in C:\ \ Games \ \Bioforge , then : mount c : c:\\games

XABI ALONSO has told Rafa Benitez he wants to quit Anfield and sign for Real Madrid – but Liverpool will not grant his wish unless the Spanish giants come up with a fee in the region of £ 35 m .
Alonso has stopped short of putting in an official written transfer request but he has made it clear to Benitez that his future lies in La Liga rather than the Premier League .
The 27 - year - old is due to join up with his Liverpool team mates on Sunday after being given extended leave following his involvement in the Confederations Cup in South Africa but Alonso and his agent Inaki Ibanez are hopeful that a deal can be thrashed out with Real before then .
But with Real reluctant to spend more than £ 27 m for the Spanish international and Benitez adamant that he will not allow Alonso to leave for that kind of figure , a compromise is some way off .
Alonso could try to force the issue by handing in an official transfer request but the midfielder believes that he deserves to be able to have his future sorted out without taking such formal measures after giving five years of service to the Reds .
Real ’s public pursuit of Alonso is now becoming incessant with recently appointed manager Manuel Pellegrini becoming the latest leading Bernabeu official to speak of his club ’s desire to snap up the Liverpool man .
Pellegrini said : “ He ’s an important player as he has shown with the Spanish team .
“ It ’s no mystery that Real Madrid are interested in his services , but it will not be easy . ”
Benitez is fully aware that Alonso ’s desire to leave Liverpool will make it increasingly difficult to hold on to the former Real Sociedad man despite the fact that he still has three years of his Anfield contract remaining .
But the Reds boss is adamant that he will not let Alonso go on the cheap , no matter how much pressure Real put Liverpool under .
Benitez knows there are precious few midfielders around of Alonso ’s quality and he is likely to have to re-shape his side if the Spanish international leaves - and that would inevitably be an expensive process .
So unless Real come up with the kind of money which would enable Benitez to go on a mini spending spree of his own , then the Liverpool manager will not budge .
Meanwhile , Nabil El Zhar has signed a new contract which will see him remain at Anfield until 2012 .
The 22 - year - old , who made 19 appearances for the Reds ' first - team last season , follows Steven Gerrard , Fernando Torres , Dirk Kuyt , Yossi Benayoun and Daniel Agger in committing his long - term future to the club .
The Moroccan international joined Liverpool from French club Saint Etienne in 2006 .
" I took a job at Initrode Software to help build the bridge to C#/.NET from their current , VB6 codebase , " Chris G. writes .
" It did n't take me too long to realize that the original programmers of this software — the only product that Initrode sold — had very little real - world experience . "
" Recently , " Chris continued , " I was fixing some of the code that was used to highlight a portion of the screen when I found this . "

Activision has told Eurogamer that DJ Hero , which costs over 100 of the Queen 's pounds , actually represents " tremendous value " .
" We do n't comment on our product pricing strategies , " said the publisher , ominously .
" However , we believe that DJ Hero will provide tremendous value for our consumers by delivering an all - new interactive music experience with over 100 individual songs that are highlighted in over 80 unique mixes , a wide variety of music from some of the biggest artists including Jay - Z , Eminem , Benny Benassi , Gwen Stefani and Black Eyed Peas among others . "
Retailers outed the suggested GBP 107.99 retail price for DJ Hero earlier this week .
It 's a steep game - plus - instrument mark - up for the Hero series , which has traditionally asked for around GBP 70 for each Guitar Hero game and peripheral .
ShopTo claims DJ Hero will be released on 13th November for PS3 , Wii and Xbox 360 .
The date , we 're told , also comes from Activision .
He can always look in the mirror for reference ...
According to FoxSports reporter Ken Rosenthal , the Toronto Blue Jays are listening to offers for ace Roy Halladay .
Of course , every team will listen to offers if it was good enough , but this sounds like a headline .
The Phillies need a quality starting pitcher , and the Blue Jays are looking to unload some of their salary cap .
It seems like a perfect match made in heaven , but there are a couple of potential problems .
To make this trade happen , both teams will have to get multiple teams involved .
That might end up being in the Phils best interest , but it might make the trade go south .
The Phillies would have to give up some of their best prospects to acquire Halladay .
While Halladay might be worth giving up Kyle Drabek and maybe Jason Donald , I do not think the Phils would be willing to give up Drabek .
While the Phillies would encourage more teams to get in on the action , just getting the Jays to complete the trade would be a hike in itself .
The Phillies need a reliever almost as bad as a starter .
Fans and the front office need to realize that the bullpen that we have is getting old , and at the rate that they are going will be too overworked to pitch well in the post - season .
Cla Meredith of the San Diego Padres would be a good option for the Phils .
Meredith is a quality young arm who would inject some life into the staggering Phils bullpen .
So , getting back to Halladay , here is what would be the after effects of the trade .
The Phillies starting rotation would consist of Halladay as the ace , Cole Hamels , Joe Blanton , Jamie Moyer , and J.A. Happ .
Then , in the bullpen would be , Chad Durbin , Chan Ho Park , Tyler Walker , J.C. Romero , Scott Eyre , Clay Condrey , Cla Meredith , Ryan Madson , and Brad Lidge .
Getting Halladay and another reliever would be the best possible scenario for the Phillies , but here is what needs to happen for the deal to go down .
First , the Phillies scouting staff needs to be disgusted at the quality that Dominican pitcher Pedro Martinez is pitching .
Second , the Blue Jays need to fail at trading away Alex Rios , Vernon Wells , or Scott Rolen .
That would leave the Jays with no other option than to feel like they have to trade Halladay to create some cap space .
On top of that , the Blue Jays need to keep falling further and further out of play - off contention by the All - Star break .
If the Jays keep hanging around , then the Toronto staff has no reason to trade Halladay , and will pull Halladay off the block quicker than a Joel Zumaya fastball .
To top it all off , the Phillies need to agree to trade some of their top prospects to get the deal to go through .
Here is what I would trade for Halladay if I were general manager , and what teams I would involve .
Carlos Carrasco , Kyle Kendrick , and Jack Taschner to the Blue Jays , Clay Condrey and Eric Bruntlett to the San Diego Padres , and Roy Halladay and Cla Meredith to the Phillies .
I would try to get another team in the mix if I could , but I would have to wait and see who would be interested .
So there is the trade , and what would happen to the team if it were to be approved by the league .
Kendrick needs a change of scenery , and Carrasco has been overshadowed and under appreciated since the arrival of Antonio Bastardo and Happ .
With Bastardo , Drabek , and Happ , that gives the Phillies some room to deal some pitchers away to acquire players who can help the team win now .
The Phils have a stacked farm system , and with the arrival of Halladay , could be a championship contender for years to come .
They could facilitate some of the young guys into the pen such as Bastardo , and not have to worry about using their bullpen heavily if they have guys in there that can go a couple more innings than expected .
Of course , it would not matter because Halladay eats up innings by the game , and rarely gets dismissed before the 5th or 6th inning .
All seems well in the city of brotherly love .

The world of archeology is rocked by evidence of King David 's palace unearthed in Jerusalem .
How Jewish is Jerusalem ?
You might think that 's a silly question , but in the world of academia , revisionist history and even biblical archaeology , scholars have cast the shadow of doubt over Judaism 's intrinsic connection to Jerusalem .
The Moslem Waqf , the religious authority that administers the Temple Mount -- the site of Judaism 's First and Second Temples -- has been claiming for years that there was never a temple there .
But the idea that Israel is the historic homeland of the Jewish people and Jerusalem its holy capital has been under attack from far more reputable sources in recent decades as well .
For a growing number of academics and intellectuals , King David and his united kingdom of Judah and Israel , which has served for 3,000 years as an integral symbol of the Jewish nation , is simply a piece of fiction .
The biblical account of history has been dismissed as unreliable by a cadre of scholars , some of whom have an overtly political agenda , arguing that the traditional account was resurrected by the Zionists to justify dispossessing Palestinian Arabs .
The most outspoken of these is Keith Whitelam of the Copenhagen School which promotes an agenda of " biblical minimalism , " whose best - known work is The Invention of Ancient Israel : The Silencing of Palestinian History .
Finkelstein claims that the myth of King David was the creation of a cult of priests trying to create for themselves a glorious history .
Even in Israel , this new school has found its voice .
Israel Finkelstein , chairman of Tel Aviv University 's Department of Archaeology , began championing a theory several years ago that the biblical accounts of Jerusalem as the seat of a powerful , unified monarchy under the rule of David and Solomon are essentially false .
The scientific methods for his assumptions , called a " lower dating " which essentially pushes archaeological evidence into a later century and thus erases all evidence of a Davidic monarchy , were laughed off by traditional archaeologists .
But his book , The Bible Unearthed , wound up on the New York Times ' best - seller list and he became the darling of a sympathetic media .
He concluded that David and Solomon , if they existed at all , were merely " hill - country chieftains " and Jerusalem a poor , small tribal village .
He claims that the myth of King David was the creation of a cult of priests trying to create for themselves a glorious history .
Looking in the Wrong Place
But the debunkers of Jewish biblical history got some bad news recently , when a spunky , dedicated archaeologist began her latest dig .
Dr. Eilat Mazar , world authority on Jerusalem 's past , has taken King David out of the pages of the Bible and put him back into living history .
Mazar 's latest excavation in the City of David , in the southern shadow of the Temple Mount , has shaken up the archaeological world .
For lying undisturbed for over 3,000 years is a massive building which Mazar believes is King David 's palace .
For Mazar , 48 , one of the world 's leading authorities on the archaeology of ancient Jerusalem and head archaeologist of the Shalem Center Institute of Archaeology , the discovery was the culmination of years of effort and solid speculation .
From the time she was a teenager , she had her nose in archaeology literature , and worked closely with her grandfather , renowned archaeologist Benjamin Mazar , who conducted the southern wall excavations next to the Western Wall .
She holds a doctorate in archaeology from Hebrew University , is author of The Complete Guide to the Temple Mount Excavations , and in the 1970s and ' 80s worked on the digs supervised by Yigal Shilo in the City of David .
The significant discoveries made then , including a huge wall called the " stepped - stone structure " -- which Shilo believed was a retaining wall for David 's royal palace or part of the Jebusite fortress he conquered -- ignited Mazar to continue to look for the prize : David 's palace itself .
Some biblical scholars gave up looking for the palace because , according to Mazar , they were looking in the wrong place .
Scholars searched for remains of the palace within the walls of the ancient Jebusite city that David conquered and called Ir David ( City of David ) .
This city , while heavily fortified with both natural and man-made boundaries , was also very small , just nine acres in size .
When no evidence of such a majestic palace as the Bible describes was found there , the next step was to claim that David 's monarchy never really existed .
But Mazar always suspected that the palace was outside the original city , and cites the Bible to prove it .
When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed , they went on the attack to apprehend him .
This occurred after he conquered the Fortress of Zion , which was the actual nucleus of the city , and built his palace .
The Bible says that David heard about it and " descended to the fortress , " ( 2 - Samuel 5:17 ) , implying that he went down from his palace , which was higher up on the mountain than the citadel / city .
Mazar told Aish.com : " I always asked myself : Down from where ?
It must have been from his palace on top of the hill , outside the original Jebusite city . "
Mazar says she was confident in her assessment of where the palace would be .
What she discovered was a section of massive wall running about 100 feet from west to east along the length of the excavation ( underneath what until this summer was the Ir David Visitors Center ) , and ending with a right - angle corner that turns south and implies a very large building .
Scientist , Not Philosopher
Within the dirt fill between the stones were found pottery shards dating to the 11th century BCE , the time when David established his monarchy .
Based on biblical text and historic evidence , Mazar assumed that David would have built his palace outside the walls of the fortified but cramped Jebusite city which existed up to 2,000 years before ; and in fact , the structure is built on the summit of the mountain , directly on bedrock along the city 's northern edge , with no archaeological layers beneath it -- a sign that the structure constituted a new , northward expansion of the city 's northern limit .
" I was shocked at how easy it was to uncover it , and how well - preserved it was , as if it were just waiting 3,000 years for us to find it . "
What most amazed Mazar was how close the building is to the surface -- just one to two meters underground .
" The cynics kept saying , ' there will be so many layers , so many remnants of other cultures , it 's not worth digging , it 's too far down . '
I was shocked at how easy it was to uncover it , and how well - preserved it was , as if it were just waiting 3,000 years for us to find it , " Mazar said .
Mazar snickers at the idea that she is some sort of divine emissary revealing the eternity of David 's kingdom .
" I am a scientist , not a philosopher .
My focus is on how magnificent and enduring these complex structures are , that they were preserved and protected for so many generations .
In truth , when I began to excavate , I had to be prepared for any result .
I even had to be prepared to accept Finkelstein 's hypothesis if that 's what the facts indicated .
Still , I am a Jew and an Israeli , and I feel great joy when the details on the ground match the descriptions in the Bible .
Today it 's become fashionable to say there was no David , no Solomon , no Temple , no prophets .
But suddenly the facts on the ground are speaking , and those outspoken voices are stammering . "
Biblical References
The City of David is essentially the ancient nucleus of Jerusalem , located just south of the mountain on which the Holy Temples stood .
From here the rest of the city as we know it grew and developed over the course of history .
According to tradition , the first significant event that occurred there was the meeting between Abraham and Malki - tzedek , King of Shalem .
King David , divinely directed , chose this city as the capital of his united kingdom .
And the more archaeologists uncover and identify , the easier it is becoming to form a complete picture of the people who lived there -- with the pivotal Jewish history of the First Temple period , described in the Prophets , played out in its structures and installations .
The Bible says that King David brought God 's Tabernacle to its final home in this original Jerusalem , expanded the city , and made it the spiritual and economic capital of the world at that time .
According to Jewish tradition , he fulfilled God 's master plan for a spiritual monarchy that would endure until the final Redemption .
" The construction that we found was a complicated and intricate engineering operation that must have required immense resources , and the dating matches , " says Mazar .
" This is the kind of step one would expect of a new ruler who wants to turn the city he conquered into his permanent residence , and who has an exceptional vision of the future development of the city . "
According to the Bible , David 's palace was constructed by Hiram , King of Tyre , the contemporary Phoenician ruler and his ally against the Philistines .
Mazar , an expert in Phoenician construction from her excavations at Achziv on Israel 's northern coast , attests that this building bears the mark of Phoenician construction , not likely to be found otherwise in the Judean hills .
In fact , quite a bit about David 's palace is known from the Bible itself .
It was a " house of cedars " built by Phoenician builders ( 2 - Samuel 5:11 and 1 - Chronicles 14:1 ) who used the cedars of Lebanon and developed a distinct style of stone masonry .
Remains of pillars and decorative stone capitals in this particular style were discovered at the site years before , which was one clue Mazar used to look for the palace .
THE CLAY DISC
Mazar believes that the palace was used for Jewish monarchs until the destruction of the First Temple 450 years later .
To indicate this , she speaks excitedly about a tiny clay item she found at the site ( found on the 17th of Tammuz , the fast day commemorating the siege of Jerusalem before its destruction ) .
It is called a " bulla , " a clay disc , inscribed in ancient Hebrew script with the name of the sender as a " return address , " used to seal papyrus scroll " mail . "
The bulla bears the name of Yehuchal Ben Shelemiah , * who is mentioned in Chapters 37 and 38 of the Book of Jeremiah .
Yehuchal was one of two emissaries dispatched by King Tzidkiyahu to Jeremiah , asking him to pray for the people during the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar , King of Babylon .
In an about - face , Chapter 38 tells that Yehuchal was one of four ministers who asked the king to kill Jeremiah , claiming that he was demoralizing the besieged nation with his prophecies of doom and destruction .
The bulla found on the site of the palace indicates that the building was used by the king , or at least by his ministers , until the destruction of Jerusalem soon afterwards .
( In fact , a nearby cistern uncovered in what might have been a king 's courtyard is speculated to perhaps be the pit Jeremiah was lowered into , as recorded in Jeremiah 38:6 ) .
" For me , finding the bulla was tremendous , " says Mazar .
" Yehuchal was no longer just some name in a biblical account that I might not even have been sure was true .
He was a real person .
We now have his business card .
The account is a real account .
It is very rare to find such precise evidence for a narrative in the Bible . "
Mazar is heady , not with personal glory or the fame , but with what she considers validation of the Bible she so loves and respects .
Mazar took the bulla home to examine and decipher .
With the help of a needle and magnifying glass , she cleaned off the grains of dust until the ancient inscription was revealed .
Together with her boys , aged 14 , 13 , and 11 , they managed to decipher the ancient Hebrew script .
Mazar 's late husband , also an archaeologist , had published material on bullas , and the boys made use of their father 's articles which explained how to properly examine and decipher the clay .
Mazar is heady , not with personal glory or the fame that has followed her since the discovery , but with what she considers validation of the Bible she so loves and respects .
" Today the scholarly approach to Tanach [ the Bible ] is that it 's not true unless you can prove it true .
Maybe we should do a little reverse .
Why do n't we say it 's true unless we can prove otherwise ? "
Too Biblical ?
More than ten years ago , Mazar proposed a solid thesis as to the location of the palace , and argued her position in a piece published in Biblical Archaeological Review .
After years of digging in the City of David under her professional mentor Yigal Shilo before he passed away , and based on finds several decades ago by British archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon , she knew she was in the right place .
David 's palace was the topic of her last conversation with her famous grandfather , biblical archaeology Professor Binyamin Mazar , before he died ten years ago .
He told her , " Kenyon found the protoaeolic capitals ( of the decorative Phoenician stone - work ) , so go and find where she found them , and start there . "
Despite her sound hypothesis and impeccable credentials , she could n't find any financial backers , as if no one in the academic world really wanted to find David 's palace .
It would just be too politically complicated .
It 's no wonder , when even mainstream archaeologists are inclined to play down finds which might be considered too highly charged with biblical or historical accuracy .
An example is Adam Zertal , who in 1983 discovered an enormous sacrificial altar on Mount Eval , on the very mountain where Joshua was described in the Bible as having built an altar after the Jews crossed the Jordan River .
The altar he found contained tools dating to the 12th century BCE , the time the Jewish people entered the Land , and its construction matched the descriptions of Joshua 's altar in both biblical and rabbinic texts .
But instead of the expected excitement accompanying such a monumental find , Zertal 's academic colleagues ignored him and his discovery .
The more vocal accused Zertal , a secular Jew raised on a kibbutz , of being politically motivated to support Jewish settlements in the area around Shechem ( Nablus ) , where Mount Eval is located .
Despite the seeming indifference from the academic world , Mazar 's proposal finally found a sponsor in the Shalem Center , an academic center in Jerusalem that recently established an institute for archaeological studies , and was funded by Roger Hertog , an American Jewish investment banker who told the New York Times that he fronted the dig because he wants to encourage scientific support for the Bible as a reflection of Jewish history .
David Hazony , editor - in - chief of Azure , a journal published by the Center , is excited about Mazar 's results .
" We do n't want to see this shunted to the side like Zertal 's discovery , " he told Aish.com .
" The message he got from his colleagues was , ' It 's bad for business to find things from the Bible these days .
It makes us look like unsophisticated messianic fanatics . '
Unfortunately , academia has done much to undermine the Jews ' capacity to say where they come from and what their past is all about .
We want to create an environment where serious scholars can pursue their research without feeling intimidated . "
Bulldozer on the Mount
But as fast as new Jewish artifacts are being unearthed , Mazar is concerned that a great number are being destroyed .
As spokesperson for the Committee Against the Desecration of Antiquities on the Temple Mount , Mazar has for the past six years tried to alert the world to the vandalism being perpetrated by the Muslim Waqf , who have their own agenda of destroying remnants of proof of Jewish sovereignty in Jerusalem , and who consistently deny that there ever was a First or Second Temple .
According to agreements made between the Israeli government and the Waqf , to whom the Israelis handed control of the Temple Mount in 1967 , the Arabs are not permitted to carry out independent works on the Mount without permission from the Israel Antiquities Authority .
Over the years , however , there have been indications of the Waqf breaking this status quo , such as when they sealed up the ancient Hulda Gates entrance to the Temple Mount on the southern wall and buried the adjoining steps and ancient tiling , and the sealing of an underground water cistern that some rabbis thought would lead to the Temple foundations .
The greatest breech was discovered in 1999 , when the Waqf bulldozed and then paved over close to 6,000 square meters of the ancient Temple Mount surface .
Temple Mount artifacts were ripped from the Mount and secretly dumped in several places throughout Jerusalem , mostly in the Kidron Valley east of the Old City and also in the city dump .
Over 100 truckloads of Temple Mount rubble , soil and artifacts were clandestinely removed .
Tzachi Zweig , then an archaeology master 's student at Bar Ilan University , blew the whistle on the Waqf when he discovered Temple artifacts in junk heaps around Jerusalem , and then presented some of the artifacts he unearthed at an archaeology conference at the university .
Under the supervision of his mentor , Professor Gabriel Barkay , dozens of truckloads of the " garbage " were moved to a special site near Mount Scopus , where until today teams of archaeologists and volunteers continue to find massive amounts of valuable , significant artifacts from the First and Second Temple periods .
Is this absolute proof ?
No .
But it is enough to shift the burden of proof .
Antiquities in Israel has long been a politically contentious topic , with all its religious and nationalistic overtones .
The jury is still out on where all this activity will lead .
But one thing is certain : Mazar 's discovery has rocked the archeological world .
As Hazony wrote in Azure : " Is this absolute proof ?
No .
But it is enough to shift the burden of proof ...
The normally reserved Amihai Mazar of Hebrew University , one of the most esteemed scholars in the field of biblical archaeology and author of the standard textbook , Archaeology of the Land of the Bible , 10,000 - 586 BCE , has described the discovery as ' something of a miracle ' . "
" In the end , " says Mazar , " the integrity of the land and its history will prevail .
And I 'm grateful to have a small part in it . "
