This glass “ no - key ” keyboard , designed by Kong Fanwen , could be a nice alternative to the waterproof keyboard that we featured last month .
The plan is to use a tiny camera with motion capture technology that will track your fingers as you type .
Unfortunately , at this time , glass keyboard is just a concept .
Helicopters teach themselves to do aerial maneuvers
Ben Tse Professor Andrew Ng , center , and his graduate students Pieter Abbeel , left , and Adam Coates have developed an artificial intelligence system that enables “ autonomous ” helicopters to teach themselves to fly by watching the maneuvers of a radio - control helicopter flown by a human pilot .
Stanford computer scientists have developed an artificial intelligence system that enables robotic helicopters to teach themselves to fly difficult stunts by watching other helicopters perform the same maneuvers .
The result is an autonomous helicopter than can perform a complete airshow of complex tricks on its own .
The stunts are " by far the most difficult aerobatic maneuvers flown by any computer controlled helicopter , " said Andrew Ng , the professor directing the research of graduate students Pieter Abbeel , Adam Coates , Timothy Hunter and Morgan Quigley .
The dazzling airshow is an important demonstration of " apprenticeship learning , " in which robots learn by observing an expert , rather than by having software engineers peck away at their keyboards in an attempt to write instructions from scratch .
Stanford 's artificial intelligence system learned how to fly by " watching " the four - foot - long helicopters flown by expert radio control pilot Garett Oku .
" Garett can pick up any helicopter , even ones he 's never seen , and go fly amazing aerobatics .
So the question for us is always , why can't computers do things like this ? "
Coates said .
Computers can , it turns out .
On a recent morning in an empty field at the edge of campus , Abbeel and Coates sent up one of their helicopters to demonstrate autonomous flight .
The aircraft , brightly painted Stanford red , is an off - the - shelf radio control helicopter , with instrumentation added by the researchers .
For five minutes , the chopper , on its own , ran through a dizzying series of stunts beyond the capabilities of a full - scale piloted helicopter and other autonomous remote control helicopters .
The artificial - intelligence helicopter performed a smorgasbord of difficult maneuvers : traveling flips , rolls , loops with pirouettes , stall - turns with pirouettes , a knife - edge , an Immelmann , a slapper , an inverted tail slide and a hurricane , described as a " fast backward funnel . "
The pièce de résistance may have been the " tic toc , " in which the helicopter , while pointed straight up , hovers with a side - to - side motion as if it were the pendulum of an upside down clock .
" I think the range of maneuvers they can do is by far the largest " in the autonomous helicopter field , said Eric Feron , a Georgia Tech aeronautics and astronautics professor who worked on autonomous helicopters while at MIT .
" But what 's more impressive is the technology that underlies this work .
In a way , the machine teaches itself how to do this by watching an expert pilot fly .
This is amazing . "
Writing software for robotic helicopters is a daunting task , in part because the craft itself , unlike an airplane , is inherently unstable .
" The helicopter does n't want to fly .
It always wants to just tip over and crash , " said Oku , the pilot .
To scientists , a helicopter in flight is an " unstable system " that comes unglued without constant input .
Abbeel compares flying a helicopter to balancing a long pole in the palm of your hand : " If you do n't provide feedback , it will crash . "
Early on in their research , Abbeel and Coates attempted to write computer code that would specify the commands for the desired trajectory of a helicopter flying a specific maneuver .
While this hand - coded approach succeeded with novice - level flips and rolls , it flopped with the complex tic-toc . "
It might seem that an autonomous helicopter could fly stunts by simply replaying the exact finger movements of an expert pilot using the joy sticks on the helicopter 's remote controller .
That approach , however , is doomed to failure because of uncontrollable variables such as gusting winds .
When the Stanford researchers decided their autonomous helicopter should be capable of flying airshow stunts , they realized that even defining their goal was difficult .
What 's the formal specification for " flying well ? "
The answer , it turned out , was that " flying well " is whatever an expert radio control pilot does at an airshow .
So the researchers had Oku and other pilots fly entire airshow routines while every movement of the helicopter was recorded .
As Oku repeated a maneuver several times , the trajectory of the helicopter inevitably varied slightly with each flight .
But the learning algorithms created by Ng 's team were able to discern the ideal trajectory the pilot was seeking .
Thus the autonomous helicopter learned to fly the routine better — and more consistently — than Oku himself .
During a flight , some of the necessary instrumentation is mounted on the helicopter , some on the ground .
Together , they continuously monitor the position , direction , orientation , velocity , acceleration and spin of the helicopter in several dimensions .
A ground - based computer crunches the data , makes quick calculations and beams new flight directions to the helicopter via radio 20 times per second .
The helicopter carries accelerometers , gyroscopes and magnetometers , the latter of which use the Earth 's magnetic field to figure out which way the helicopter is pointed .
The exact location of the craft is tracked either by a GPS receiver on the helicopter or by cameras on the ground .
( With a larger helicopter , the entire navigation package could be airborne . )
There is interest in using autonomous helicopters to search for land mines in war - torn areas or to map out the hot spots of California wildfires in real time , allowing firefighters to quickly move toward or away from them .
Firefighters now must often act on information that is several hours old , Abbeel said .
" In order for us to trust helicopters in these sort of mission - critical applications , it 's important that we have very robust , very reliable helicopter controllers that can fly maybe as well as the best human pilots in the world can , " Ng said .
Stanford 's autonomous helicopters have taken a large step in that direction , he said .
As if " shift lights " were n't annoying enough ...
Nissan 's new " ECO pedal " has been engineered to encourage good fuel economy with a servo-actuated gas pedal that will push back on the driver 's lead foot when on - board computers detect wasteful acceleration .
According to Nissan , vehicles equipped with the ECO pedal , and real - time fuel consumption gauges in the instrument panel , have returned a 5 - 10 percent increase in fuel efficiency .
The Japanese automaker says it has plans to begin installing the ECO pedal in models next year , although there is no word on what models , or markets , will get the system .
We 're betting it 's an option unlikely to show up on the GT - R anytime in the near future .

Cocaine found hidden in Providence , RI , police car
Police in Providence , R.I. , say an unmarked car that officers had been driving for several years came with a surprise - a half - pound of cocaine hidden behind the radio .
Deputy Police Chief Paul Kennedy says the Ford Taurus was confiscated from a drug dealer in 2000 .
Kennedy says police do search for contraband in confiscated vehicles but sometimes they " miss stuff . "
Three packages of cocaine were found behind the dashboard about three weeks ago by a repairman who was cannibalizing the car for spare parts .
Police estimated the stash would be worth almost $ 7,000 on the street .
Kennedy said it 's unlikely anyone will face charges over the concealed coke .
Anorexia is an eating disorder where people starve themselves .
Anorexia usually begins in young people around the onset of puberty .
Individuals suffering from anorexia have extreme weight loss .
Weight loss is usually 15 % below the person 's normal body weight .
People suffering from anorexia are very skinny but are convinced that they are overweight .
Weight loss is obtained by many ways .
Some of the common techniques used are excessive exercise , intake of laxatives and not eating .
Anorexics have an intense fear of becoming fat .
Their dieting habits develop from this fear .
Anorexia mainly affects adolescent girls .
People with anorexia continue to think they are overweight even after they become extremely thin , are very ill or near death .
Often they will develop strange eating habits such as refusing to eat in front of other people .
Sometimes the individuals will prepare big meals for others while refusing to eat any of it .
But anorexia can be cured !
I will recommend an anorexia book that will help you cure anorexia at home .
The anorexia book has amazing reviews .

One of the great banking laws in this country is the mandatory APR for loans .
That ’s a calculation that allows consumers to easily compare loans that have different fees , terms , and rates , making it all apples to apples .
We need the same type of law for home buying .
The formula should show the total cost of the home including energy use , water , and maintenance , under some standard set of assumptions .
That sort of number would be a big help to consumers .
But more important , it would give home builders an incentive to exceed minimum energy efficiency standards , and make maintenance cheap .
At the moment , energy efficiency is somewhat invisible to the buyer .
Buyers are n’t willing to pay more for a vague concept .
But they might pay more for a home that costs them less in the long run , if they trusted the calculation .
That 's my world - saving idea for today .
If that does n't save the world , I will come up with something else tomorrow .
I ’m not crazy , doctor .
There really is a cat in my wall .
A Brooklyn man found himself locked up in a loony bin for four days after he smashed down walls in three apartments trying to rescue a fugitive feline .
The bizarre tale began when a mischievous kitty named Rumi decided to explore a hole in the wall of a condo undergoing renovation in Carroll Gardens .
Unfortunately for Rumi , the hole opened on a 30 - foot shaft and he fell to the bottom .
The contractor , Chris Muth , had been watching Rumi for a friend and panicked when he went missing .
He could n’t reach the cat from that apartment – even after enlarging the hole .
So the super , Doug Steiner , got him permission to make a small hole in the wall of another unit .
But , Steiner said , “ He opened up all the walls .
I said , ‘ What the hell are you doing ?
The owner ’s going to flip out . ’ ”
Muth could n’t catch Rumi from that hole either , so he broke into a third apartment , and again started smashing walls .
Steiner had as much success coaxing Muth out as Muth did with Rumi .
So the super called cops – who shipped Muth to a local psych ward .
Rumi remained in the catacombs of the condo – a former church .
And the shrinks decided Muth was suffering from bats in his belfry .
The hospital records say he had a “ bizarre delusion [ he ] was trying to save a cat of his friend , ” The Brooklyn Paper reported .
But it all ended happily .
Muth finally convinced the doctors that he was n’t a wacko .
And Rumi , tired of his 15 days in solitary , let himself be caught by professional cat rescuers using a fishing - pole - like device .
“ After 60 hours stuck down there , I thought the cat was going to die , ” Muth told The Brooklyn Paper .
“ Otherwise I would n’t have panicked like I did .
“ I can fix holes , but I ca n’t bring a cat back to life . ”

In Tbilisi , Georgia
The American military has been training and equipping the Georgian army since the spring of 2002 .
Having trained three battalions of Georgian soldiers , US military instructors were due to leave in March .
Georgia 's new president - elect has set the removal of Russian troops still based in the country as a major priority for his government .
On Saturday the US ambassador to Georgia said they had decided to continue training the Georgian army in a full - time programme .
US ' security guarantee '
During the Soviet era , Krtsanisi military base outside Tbilisi was home to the Red Army .
The programme forms part of the US war on terror
In 2002 the Bush administration set up an 18 - month , $ 65 m programme aimed at training and equipping Georgia 's impoverished army .
The programme was part of America 's war on terror and it started after the US confirmed Russian allegations about the presence of Chechen and al - Qaeda fighters in Georgia 's Pankisi Gorge , on the border with Chechnya .
Details are still to be announced of the new permanent programme , but analysts say that any sort of US military presence is good news for the Georgian Government , which sees the US engagement as a security guarantee against Georgia 's northern neighbour - Russia .
Russia tensions
For Moscow , the Caucasus is a geopolitical backyard , rich in energy resources and crucial to the conflict in Chechnya .
Moscow 's refusal to remove its military bases from Georgia has long fuelled tensions between the two countries .
Georgia 's President - elect , Mikhail Saakashvili , says the removal of the Russian troops will be high on his government 's priority list .
The US , whose own stakes in the Caucasus include a multi-billion dollar Caspian oil pipeline , backs this demand .
Last week , the Bush administration also called for Russia to remove its military and said it was even prepared to take up some of the costs needed for the relocation of Russian troops .

Buffon 's Needle Problem
Buffon 's needle problem asks to find the probability that a needle of length will land on a line , given a floor with equally spaced parallel lines a distance apart .
The problem was first posed by the French naturalist Buffon in 1733 ( Buffon 1733 , pp. 43-45 ) , and reproduced with solution by Buffon in 1777 ( Buffon 1777 , pp. 100-104 ) .
Define the size parameter by
(1)
For a short needle ( i.e. , one shorter than the distance between two lines , so that ) , the probability that the needle falls on a line is
( 2) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 )
For , this therefore becomes
(6 )
( OEIS A060294 ) .
For a long needle ( i.e. , one longer than the distance between two lines so that ) , the probability that it intersects at least one line is the slightly more complicated expression
(7 )
where ( Uspensky 1937 , pp. 252 and 258 ; Kunkel ) .
Writing
(8)
then gives the plot illustrated above .
The above can be derived by noting that
(9 )
where
( 10 ) ( 11 )
are the probability functions for the distance of the needle 's midpoint from the nearest line and the angle formed by the needle and the lines , intersection takes place when , and can be restricted to by symmetry .
Let be the number of line crossings by tosses of a short needle with size parameter .
Then has a binomial distribution with parameters and .
A point estimator for is given by
( 12 )
which is both a uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator and a maximum likelihood estimator ( Perlman and Wishura 1975 ) with variance
( 13 )
which , in the case , gives
( 14 )
The estimator for is known as Buffon 's estimator and is an asymptotically unbiased estimator given by
( 15 )
where , is the number of throws , and is the number of line crossings .
It has asymptotic variance
( 16 )
which , for the case , becomes
( 17 ) ( 18 )
( OEIS A114598 ; Mantel 1953 ; Solomon 1978 , p. 7 ) .
The above figure shows the result of 500 tosses of a needle of length parameter , where needles crossing a line are shown in red and those missing are shown in green .
107 of the tosses cross a line , giving .
Several attempts have been made to experimentally determine by needle - tossing .
calculated from five independent series of tosses of a ( short ) needle are illustrated above for one million tosses in each trial .
For a discussion of the relevant statistics and a critical analysis of one of the more accurate ( and least believable ) needle - tossings , see Badger ( 1994 ) .
Uspensky ( 1937 , pp. 112-113 ) discusses experiments conducted with 2520 , 3204 , and 5000 trials .
The problem can be extended to a " needle " in the shape of a convex polygon with generalized diameter less than .
The probability that the boundary of the polygon will intersect one of the lines is given by
( 19 )
where is the perimeter of the polygon ( Uspensky 1937 , p. 253 ; Solomon 1978 , p. 18 ) .
A further generalization obtained by throwing a needle on a board ruled with two sets of perpendicular lines is called the Buffon - Laplace needle problem .
By Bob Mionske
Nineteen - year - old Autumn Grohowski was on her cell phone with her dad , just letting him know she would be home soon .
It was June , a summer night in Lebanon , Pennsylvania , and Autumn was approaching the trail she would take home .
She was on her bike , and mindful of her safety , so she kept the call short — she told her dad “ I do n’t want to be killed by a car , so I do n’t want to talk on the phone on the way home . ”
Those were her last words .
As she headed south on Fourth Street , Autumn , an award - winning student with plans to become a visual artist , approached the junction with the trail , which ran near a railroad track .
She noticed that the railroad warning lights were flashing , and the safety arms were swinging down , indicating that a train was coming .
No problem , her turn was just before the railroad crossing anyway , so she began to make her left turn , riding across the centerline , into the oncoming traffic lane , before turning onto the trail .
She never finished her turn .
Gregory Moyer was driving north on Fourth Street .
As he approached the railroad tracks , the warning lights were flashing , and the safety arms were swinging down , indicating that a train was coming .
But Moyer was drunk , with a blood alcohol content of .14 , nearly twice the legal limit , so when he saw the warning lights flashing , and the safety arms coming down , he gunned it , blowing through the railroad crossing .
Or maybe he always blew through the crossing , drunk or not .
Only Moyer knows .
Regardless , Moyer was lucky this night — he was n’t hit by the approaching train .
Autumn was n’t as lucky .
As she was approaching her left turn , Moyer blew through the railroad warning lights , and plowed into Autumn .
The impact crushed Autumn ’s skull , broke her neck , arms , legs , and ribs , and collapsed her lungs .
Without a thought in the world for the human being he had just run down , Gregory Moyer fled the scene .
A short distance away , however , horrified witnesses forced Moyer to a screeching halt .
Trapped by his captors , and forced to return to the scene , the drunken Moyer called 911 and reported that he had “ just hit a little girl on a bike . ”
As the 911 operator took his report , Moyer repeatedly exclaimed “ Oh , my God , Oh , my God . ”
Miraculously , Autumn was n’t dead .
She was rushed to the hospital , and with her father Kris at her side , she clung to life .
“ When I got there , it looked like she was already dead , ” he said , “ but they were saying to me she could still hear me . ”
Kris stayed there by Autumn ’s side , as she stubbornly struggled to live , until , 30 hours later , the doctors removed her from life support .
Her father held her in his arms as her life ebbed away .
Recalling the moment , Kris said “ I held her neck .
And her heart stopped in my hands , you know .
So it was very tough . ”
Thus began Kris Grohowski ’s long search for justice .
In late October of 2007 , four months after taking Autumn Grohowski ’s life , Gregory Moyer had not yet been brought to justice .
In fact , the D.A. had n’t even filed charges in the case .
Kris Grohwoski spoke out in frustration : “ He should be charged with speeding .
He should be charged with running the red light .
He should be charged with homicide by vehicle for killing my daughter .
I just want justice for my daughter , and that ’s all .
I just want justice . ”
Lebanon County District Attorney David Arnold responded with his assurances that charges would be filed .
And a week later , charges were filed … although they were < i > not < /i > the charges Kris Grohowski would have expected for the man who took his daughter ’s life .
Gregory Moyer was charged with DUI , hit and run with death , careless driving , and not yielding to railroad warning signals .
He was not charged with homicide by vehicle , because District Attorney Arnold felt “ there ’s blame on both sides . ”
As the District Attorney explained , “ In this instance , Autumn Grohowski ’s actions also played a role in causing this accident and a pretty significant role in that .
She was , by eyewitness accounts , traveling in the middle of Mr. Moyer ’s lane . ”
And that determination — that Autumn was partly to blame for the crash that took her life — was at the root of the District Attorney ’s decision not to file vehicular homicide charges .
District Attorney Arnold explained that the homicide by vehicle statute requires the prosecution to prove that the drunk driver caused the death of another person as a result of driving under the influence of an intoxicant .
Although Moyer was clearly intoxicated , the District Attorney explained that the evidence and interviews did not prove that Gregory Moyer caused Autumn ’s death as a result of driving under the influence , because , as witnesses reported , Autumn was in the opposing lane of traffic when Moyer slammed into her — reportedly , attempting to elude a driver who was following her in an attempt to get her phone number , by beginning her turn early — and therefore , the District Attorney reasoned , Autumn ’s death was caused as much by her presence in that lane as it was by Gregory Moyer drunkenly blowing through a set of railroad safety arms .
Thus , Autumn ’s killer escaped homicide charges .
Still , Kris Grohowski felt some satisfaction that the man who took his daughter ’s life had been charged with something , that he was n’t going to escape justice , just as he had tried to escape the scene of the crime : “ I ’m finally relieved that there ’s been charges filed .
As far that goes , I know they ’re not heavy charges .
But they ’re charges .
It ’s a beginning as far as that goes . ”
It says something , I think , about the state of criminal justice when the family of a drunk driving victim have to plead for charges to be filed , and express their relief when charges are filed , even though the driver is not charged with homicide .
Still , Grohowski looked forward to at least some measure of justice for his daughter , and to moving forward with his own life , noting “ [ I ’ve got to ]
Try to pull my life back together so I can start over again because that ’s what I have to do . ”
Six month ’s later , Grohowski ’s relief that his daughter would have justice turned to disbelief when the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the hit and run charge .
Moyer hung his head and cried as the verdict was read .
The jury had been convinced by Moyer ’s defense that the distance he had traveled — 100 feet — after hitting Autumn and being forced to a halt , was too short a distance to be evidence beyond a reasonable doubt of hit and run .
There may have been more to the verdict than a good defense , though — there may also have been more than a touch of “ there but for the grace of God go I ” sympathy for Moyer .
One anonymous person , while commenting on the news in an online forum , and claiming to be one of the jurors who heard the case , explained “ Yes Moyer should have stopped at the train tracks , but people try to beat the train ; we live in a fast - paced world .
We run yellow / red lights , we run stop signs .
It ’s a sad story that should n’t have happened , but it did . ”
That comment was not the only show of support in the community for Moyer ; many of Moyer ’s partisans chimed in with their own support for Moyer , with one commenter observing “ it was just a terrible , horrible accident that he has to live with – but is not his fault . ”
Yes , Moyer ’s partisans reasoned , he was driving drunk , yes he blew through a railroad crossing as the warning lights were flashing and the safety arms were coming down , and yes , by doing so he killed a young woman — but her death was “ not his fault . ”
It was , the same Moyer partisan explained , “ purely an accident . ”
The judge was decidedly more sober in his assessment of Moyer ’s actions that June night .
Because the hit and run charge carries a penalty in excess of one year , Moyer was entitled to a jury trial on that charge .
However , the other charges carry lesser penalties , so Moyer was not entitled to a jury verdict on those charges .
Accordingly , once the jury cleared Moyer of the most serious charge , the Judge declared Moyer guilty on the remaining charges of DUI , careless driving , and not yielding to railroad warning signals .
Despite the convictions on the lesser charges , this was not the justice for Autumn that Kris Grohowski had so desperately wanted and anxiously waited for .
Exiting the courtroom , Grohowski said “ this is terrible , ” calling the jury ’s decision “ a load of malarkey . ”
Grohowski’s only hope for bringing to justice the man who had ended his daughter ’s life now lay in the civil lawsuit he had by that time filed against Moyer .
After delivering his verdict , Judge John C. Tylwalk set a July sentencing date ; Moyer faced a sentence of 72 hours to 6 months imprisonment on the DUI charge .
Under Pennsylvania law , Moyer may also face a separate hearing , at which the Department of Transportation may seek to suspend his license for a 12 - month period .
But for killing Autumn Grohowski , Moyer would not do one minute of time .
On July 16 , Judge Tylwalk sentenced Moyer to 2 to 6 months in County Prison .
Moyer was also ordered to pay a $ 1,000 fine for drunken driving , and a $ 525 fine for careless driving and driving with an open container of alcohol in his vehicle .
In addition to the fines , Moyer was also ordered to pay restitution of $ 1,375 ; Judge Tylwalk also prohibited Moyer from driving for the next six months .
Noting that the sentence could have been as light as 72 hours in jail , prosecutor Bob McAteer said that Judge Tylwalk “ really put the hammer down ” on Moyer .
The Grohowski family saw things a little differently .
“ It ’s so unfair , ” Autumn ’s mother , Karen Gregorio , said .
“ He gets two months and she could have had 50 to 60 years .
He got away with murder . ”
Autumn ’s brother , Pennsylvania National Guard Staff Sergeant Kevin Grohowski , who told the Judge “ I loved my sister ; it ’s been devastating to me , ” described the sentence as “ a slap on the wrist . ”
Noting that her son had just completed one tour of duty in Iraq , and was scheduled to return to Iraq in February to begin a second tour , Karen Gregorio bitterly observed that “ my son goes overseas to protect this guy ’s right to drink . ”
Moyer will serve his sentence , and then his life will go on .
He will be prohibited from driving for the term of his sentence , and then , in its wisdom , the State of Pennsylvania will once more allow him to operate a motor vehicle .
Moyer ’s life will go on .
Autumn ’s life will not .
Nor will her father ’s .
On May 29 , three weeks after Gregory Moyer ’s trial , despairing at having failed to obtain justice for Autumn , and unable to endure his continuing grief , Kris Grohowski ended his own life with a gunshot .

Deliberate attempts by the Russian government to exaggerate the number of people killed in the South Ossetia conflict are provoking revenge attacks on Georgian villagers in the breakaway republic , a respected human rights group claimed today .
Anna Neistat of Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) , who is leading a team investigating the humanitarian damage in South Ossetia , told the Guardian that Russian estimates of 2,000 dead in the conflict were " suspicious " .
" The figure of 2,000 people killed is very doubtful , " she said .
" Our findings so far do not in any way confirm the Russian statistics .
On the contrary , they suggest the numbers are exaggerated . "
Neistat said that HRW investigators had , today and yesterday , recorded cases of Ossetian fighters burning and looting Georgian villages north of the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali .
" The torching of houses in these villages is in some ways a result of the massive Russia propaganda machine which constantly repeats claims of genocide and exaggerates the scale of casualties , " she said .
" That is then used to justify retribution . "
Neistat said that doctors at Tskhinvali hospital had provided figures that 273 wounded people had been treated there during the conflict and a total of 44 dead people had been brought to the city morgue .
Russian and South Ossetian officials have claimed that 1,400 people were killed in the first day of fighting , mostly in Tskhinvali .
There have been reports of Ossetians burying relatives in their allotments and there are no lists of the casualties .
Neistat stressed that HRW 's investigation was not complete but she added : " By day five of a conflict one normally expects that there is some kind of list of the dead and injured , or at least an indication of their age and gender .
But here there is no information .
Absolutely nothing . "

Obama called him " one of the finest U.S. senators that we have , " but he gave no indication that he was nearing a vice presidential decision .
Bayh was to spend the day with his neighboring senator in a usually Republican state that is viewed as a battleground this year .
Bayh , a former two - term governor and son of former Sen.
Birch Bayh , has been widely viewed a top - tier running mate prospect .
He is a former supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton , has executive experience and is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Furthermore , Democrats view Indiana - which has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1964 - as competitive .
That led to considerable speculation , especially here , that if Obama had settled on Bayh , he would use this visit to announce the decision .
But it was not to be .
Bayh said Obama would bring " a breath of fresh air " to the nation 's capital .
He said Republican John McCain " is not a bad man , " but that McCain had some bad policies .
Bayh opened his introduction of Obama by saying he had some " good news " to depart .
" In five short months , the Bush administration will be done , " Bayh said .
A McCain victory , he said , would mean " four more years of what we 've had . "
Obama campaigned in Indiana as his campaign released a new television ad that seeks to link McCain to President Bush and questions whether McCain is the political maverick he claims to be .
It shows McCain acknowledging that he agrees with Bush on most issues .
The ad also criticizes McCain on three economic issues of concern to middle - class voters : tax breaks for the wealthy , money for oil companies , and tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas .
The ad ends with a smiling McCain and Bush side by side .
McCain 's campaign turned out an ad Tuesday in the other direction , suggesting that McCain differs from Bush and the GOP on important issues - without mentioning Bush by name .

In a speech marking the two - year anniversary of the Second Lebanon War , Hizbullah Secretary - General Hassan Nasrallah mocked Israel 's political and military leadership .
The Connection War in Georgia : The Israeli connection Arie Egozi
For past seven years , Israeli companies have been helping Gerogian army to preparer for war against Russia through arms deals , training of infantry units and security advice War in Georgia : The Israeli connection
" The entire front line of the army 's brass stepped down because of the war .
Gal Hirsch , who was defeated in Lebanon , went to Georgia and they too lost because of him , " laughed Nasrallah .
Hirsch , a brigadier - general in the reserves , served as commander of the IDF 's Galilee Division during the war and resigned in its wake .
In recent years he consulted the Georgian army on the establishment of elite units and rearmament , and gave various courses in the fields of combat intelligence and fighting in built - up areas .
" Relying on Israeli experts and weapons , Georgia learned why the Israeli generals failed , " proclaimed Nasrallah , " what happened in Georgia is a message to all those the Americans are seeking to entangle in dangerous adventures . "
' Israel plotting to kill Hizbullah leaders '
Nasrallah accused Israel of seeking to assassinate Hizbullah commanders .
" I tell the Zionists : We do n't fear you .
Say whatever you want and do whatever you want .
We know that you are planning new assassinations of resistance leaders .
But this will not make us retreat , " he said .
Nasralla said that keeping the group 's arsenal a " secret " is part of its battle against Israel , and made a point of not disclosing whether his guerrillas now have anti-aircraft missile systems .
" There has been an Israeli uproar about the reinforcement of Hizbullah 's strength .
There has been talk of sophisticated arms and an air defense system and threats if Hizbullah uses this kind of system , " Nasrallah said .
" No one can expect me to stand up and say ( whether ) we possess new weapons or we do n't , " he added .
" Keeping ( weapons ) secret is part of ... ( Hizbullah's ) strength .
This is part of directing the battle of liberation and resistance against this enemy . "
' Barak ran from Lebanon in 2000 '
Nasrallah asserted that " the results of the Second Lebanon War are evident even today , in both the military and political fields in Israel . "
He said Israel is facing the worst leadership crisis in its history .
The Hizbullah chief also addressed recent comments by Defense Minister Ehud Barak regarding the importance of having an experienced leadership .
" Ehud Barak admits that the reason for losing the war
was a lack of military experience .
So who is there left in Israel with military experience if not all those failed generals ?
Those who stand against us today are the same failures who have already suffered blows from us before . "
He also ridiculed Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi , quoting an Israel newspaper as saying Olmert " died two years ago in Lebanon and will be brought to political burial in two months . "
" Is it Barak or Ashkenazi who failed against the resistance as head of the Northern Command ? . "
" This September we will see the end of Israeli Prime Minister Olmert 's rule .
I remember Barak 's speeches back when he was the enemy 's prime minister in 2000 .
Need I remind him that he set the date of the withdrawal ( from Lebanon ) in July and we forced him to pull out in May ? "
He opened his statements with words of condolence to the families of those killed in Tripoli and went on to welcome the establishment of a new government in Beirut this week , in which Hizbullah is a prominent partner .
The Hizbullah chief also hailed the visit to Syria , which backs his movement , by Lebanon 's President Michel Suleiman , calling it " a new stage " in relations between Beirut and Damascus .

Surely I ’m not alone amongst Soul Calibur fans in being dissatisfied with SC 3 .
The environments were boring , character creation was half - baked , and loading times were criminal .
It did n’t help that Mitsurugi ’s move set took a step backward and you could n’t make characters shout at each other during the load screen .
I ’ll never understand why it was only released on PS2 , and perhaps if it had come out on XBOX I might feel different .
Regardless , what SC 3 did for me was reaffirm the preeminence of Soul Calibur 2 as a finely tuned , well - balanced fighter that - until the fourth installment got announced – I was content to accept as the only 3D fighter I ’d ever have or need .
I had high hopes that Namco would do something truly special with my favorite fighter series in Soul Calibur 4 .
Part three was n’t well - received and maybe the developer would retcon it out of existence and we ’d all be the happier .
Sure they ’d no doubt keep the new characters imposed upon us , but who cares ?
Mitsurugi ’s in it , Astaroth ’s in it , and I get to play online .
What could possibly go wrong ?
Up until I actually played the game , I could n’t find a thing to complain about .
All the chicks have huge floppy breasts ?
Cool !
Yoda ’s in the version everyone that counts will buy ?
He looks like a fast , cheap fighter !
A new Soul Gauge system to punish turtling players ?
Awesome , I do n’t block much anyway !
New characters designed by anime artists ?
Fine , let the Jap players have them .
It wo n’t stop me !
Well , the fairy tale did end .
I learned two incontrovertible facts on release day , right along with everyone else .
Ranked matchmaking is inconvenient to the point of being offensive .
The online experience has been covered extensively elsewhere , and the lag that plagued the first day or two after release seems to have tapered off for me , so all I ’ll ask is how , with a shining example of efficient matchmaking in Call of Duty 4 , could Namco have fucked it up so much ?
The other change was subtle , but is the reason I ’m even writing this review .
The characters seem to have all been weighed down to the point that attacks do n’t string together with the immediacy of SC 2 .
I found myself forced to develop a new rhythm with Mitsurugi and the impression formed that what I liked so much about him had been removed .
Perhaps Namco did this to compensate for lag they anticipated online– I ’ll never know for sure .
Regardless , for me SC 4 has become a different game .
It remains beautiful , deep , and competitive when you can find a ranked match , but I ’m now faced with a dilemma : I ’m not as young as I used to be , and I lack the time and patience to relearn a fighting system .
I went into SC 4 figuring that since I was good at part two , I ’d be good at this one too , and this assumption has not borne out .
With this in mind , what do I play Soul Calibur for ?
Is a game truly good when it wants not for iteration , or is our love for a fighting game solidified by a developer ’s willingness to tweak and sometimes twist the engine we are all asked to master ?
I think back to Street Fighter II ’s evolution , and how allowing two of the same character to fight each other , or air block , made a dramatic , identifiable change in the entire game experience for every player .
You either embraced the changes or were left in the dust .
Soul Calibur 4 to me has n’t changed anything so fundamentally , but the weight issue is pervasive enough to make me wonder if for some games we just should n’t demand change at all .
On a lighter note , people seem to be making much use of the character creation system .
Unfortunately many players are taking their designs a little too seriously .
I ’ve seen ninjas and Saracen knights and far too many schoolgirls and stewardesses .
For me , a custom character needs to entertain or beguile .
Hence , I bring you two formidable additions to the great custom character pantheon :
First , meet Fagosign ...
You want a sexy time ?
... And the indefatigable AfroHo
I 'll cut you , bitch .
The search for what causes a debilitating shell disease affecting lobsters from Long Island Sound to Maine has led one Marine Biological Laboratory ( MBL ) visiting scientist to suspect environmental alkyphenols , formed primarily by the breakdown of hard transparent plastics .
Preliminary evidence from the lab of Hans Laufer suggests that certain concentrations of alkyphenols may be interfering with the ability of lobsters to develop tough shells .
Instead , the shells are weakened , leaving affected lobsters susceptible to the microbial invasions characteristic of the illness .
" Lobsters ' know ' when their shell is damaged , and that 's probably the reason when they have shell disease , why they molt more quickly , " says Laufer , a visiting investigator at the MBL for over 20 years and professor emeritus of molecular and cell biology at the University of Connecticut .
" But ultimately , they still come down with the disease .
And we think the presence of alkyphenols contributes to that . "
Like any crustacean , lobsters shed their shells multiple times in one lifetime .
After molting , the outer skin of the soft and exposed lobster will begin to harden .
It is here that Laufer thinks the alkyphenols are doing their damage .
At this point , a derivative of the amino acid tyrosine , whose function is to harden the developing shell , is incorporated .
It is known that alkyphenols and tyrosine are similarly shaped and Laufer suspects that the toxin may be blocking tyrosine from its normal functions .
He is at MBL this summer to measure the amount of competition between the two molecules .
Alkyphenols are also known to act as endocrine disruptors .
Laufer discovered the presence of alkyphenols in lobsters serendipitously while investigating a tremendous lobster die off at Long Island Sound in 1999 , when shell disease , first observed in the mid-1990s , was noted to be on the rise .
Although an unusually hot summer , it was also the first time New York City sprayed mosquito populations to prevent the spread of West Nile virus .
Laufer , who began his career as an insect endocrinologist , suspected the toxins from the sprayings may have contributed to the lobster die off .
In 2001 , while searching for the mosquito toxins in lobsters , he instead found alkyphenols .
" It 's a real problem , " Laufer says .
" Plastics last a long time , but breakdown products last even longer .
Perhaps shell disease is only the tip of the iceberg of a more basic problem of endocrine disrupting chemicals in marine environments . "
Below is a poster comparison between the Watchmen posters released at 2008 San Diego Comic Con and the same character posters released by Dave Gibbons ( DC Comics ) back in 1986 .
Are there any differences between the Watchmen character posters ?
It really is amazing the degree to which the Comedy Central lawyers do n’t get how the Internet put their network on the map , especially Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert .
Honestly , I stopped mentioning and posting Stewart ’s skits , even the ones on Comedy Central ’s own site , after their wonderful lawyers got my YouTube account deleted .
And now their lawyers want all of your IP addresses , and apparently the court is giving it to them .
I get that Viacom has an interest in its video .
But putting aside the fact that they have no clue the degree to which the Internet made them , Viacom has no right to invade my privacy just because it has a gripe with YouTube .
Enlarge By Joel Page , AP Paul Reed works with a log splitter at Reed 's Firewood in Durham , Maine .
Demand is growing as homeowners load up on firewood to try and head off high winter heating - oil bills .
DURHAM , Maine 
On a recent scorching - hot summer day , workers at Reed 's Firewood used heavy equipment to cut and split logs into firewood until it was too dark to see .
Despite its relentless pace , the family - run business is failing to keep up with demand as homeowners shellshocked by the price of heating oil look to firewood as a way to lower their bills this winter .
The cost of seasoned firewood in Maine has jumped about 50 % from a year ago , but it remains a relative bargain compared with heating oil , which is nearly $ 2 a gallon more than it was last year .
Many customers are doubling their usual orders , and some firewood dealers are turning away customers .
" We 've really never seen anything like this before , " said Lloyd Irland , who teaches forestry economics at Yale University .
While most heating oil customers are n't abandoning the fuel altogether , they 're using less by upgrading furnaces , turning down thermostats , insulating their homes and turning to alternative fuels .
A survey by the Maine Forest Service found most dealers out of seasoned firewood and some short of green wood , which does n't burn as well because it is n't as dry .
Paul Reed , the owner of Reed 's , tells customers he has plenty of firewood , if they 're willing to wait until December and accept possible price increases .
For the first time in his 23 years in the business , volatility in the market has forced Reed to abandon fixed pricing that customers count on .
His price for a cord — a tight stack 4 feet high , 4 feet wide and 8 feet long — rose from $ 190 early last winter to $ 255 for green and $ 300 for seasoned wood .
Firewood remains a deal for those who do n't mind the hassle of lugging it around and periodically feeding their wood stoves or fireplaces .
A cord of firewood has the same heating potential as 155 gallons of heating oil , said Peter Lammert of the Maine Forest Service .
Thus , a cord of seasoned firewood costing $ 300 is a bargain compared with 155 gallons of heating oil costing $ 685.10 , based on $ 4.42 a gallon , the statewide average .
It 's a stark contrast to the mid-1990s , when heating oil sold for 79 or 80 cents a gallon and a cord of seasoned firewood was about $ 125 .
Oil was so cheap then , trading at less than $ 20 a barrel vs. $ 115 today , that Reed resorted to calling longtime customers in the spring to drum up orders .
Today , Maine 's firewood producers are heavily competing for the same hardwood logs used by paper mills to produce pulp .
Both are paying more because loggers have to pay so much more for diesel fuel , paper industry officials say .
The rush to buy more firewood is having an impact on heating oil dealers .
Last year , heating oil consumption fell 13 % nationwide , in part because of homeowners ' fuel - efficiency efforts , said John Huber , president of the National Oilheat Research Alliance .
Huber expects consumption to drop again this winter , but not by as much .
The run on firewood started last winter , when heating oil surpassed $ 3 a gallon and kept on climbing .
This summer , some customers were close to panic as heating oil approached $ 5 a gallon before dropping over the last couple of weeks .
Heating oil is the dominant home - heating fuel in New England , ranging from 75 % of homes in Maine to about 40 % in Massachusetts .
David Rooker feels lucky that he was able to get the two cords piled in his driveway in South Portland : " With the price of heating oil , we 'll have fires every night . "
He estimates he saved $ 1,000 on oil the first year he installed a wood stove .
Reed 's , Maine 's largest firewood dealer , has a pile of logs stacked 20 feet high and stretching more than a football field long .
The company expects to deliver nearly 4,000 cords , a record .
But other dealers are struggling to get raw logs .
Southern Maine Firewood , a large dealer in Gorham , had only 100 cords recently but orders for 1,000 .
" It 's just a nightmare right now , " owner Jake Dyer said .
" You 'd think in a state like this that you could get wood . "

GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE , Cuba ( CNN ) --
A jury of six military officers Thursday sentenced Osama bin Laden 's former driver to 5 ½ years in prison after his conviction on charges of providing material support to al Qaeda .
Osama bin Laden 's ex-driver , Salim Hamdan , in an undated photo , could go to prison for 30 years or more .
After Salim Hamdan serves his sentence , he could still be kept as an enemy combatant at Guantanamo Bay .
He has been imprisoned at the U.S. military detention center since 2002 and has been credited with 61 months served .
That means that he has five months left to serve .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said after the verdict Wednesday that Hamdan was now a " convicted war criminal " and that he was " no longer considered an enemy combatant . "
But on Thursday , Whitman said Hamdan 's status would revert to " enemy combatant " when his sentence is completed .
As an enemy combatant , Hamdan can be held indefinitely by the United States , although he would be eligible to appeal to an administrative review board to determine whether his status as an enemy combatant should continue .
Prosecutors recommended a sentence of 30 years to life in prison , while defense attorneys sought a sentence of 45 months or less .
The jury cleared Hamdan of terrorism conspiracy charges , including that he conspired with others to carry out the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks .
Hamdan testified that he was " shocked " when he found out about the September 11 attacks , and expressed sorrow as he pleaded for leniency at a sentencing hearing in Guantanamo Bay .
" It was impossible in my mind that Osama bin Laden would be behind it , " said Hamdan who was working for him at the time of the attacks .
" My view and my thinking had changed completely .
It was big shock for me when someone had treated you with respect and regard , and then you realize what they were up to , " he said .
" It was a sorry or sad thing to see innocent people killed .
I do n't know what could be given or presented to these innocent people who were killed in the U.S. , " Hamdan said , speaking through an Arab - language translator .
" I personally present my apologies to them , if anything what I did have caused them pain , " he said .
In making his case , Hamdan pointed out that Australian David Hicks , who pleaded guilty last year to supporting terrorism , was sentenced to nine months instead of the seven years recommended by a jury .
The judge allowed Hicks , who had been at Guantanamo for more than five years , to serve his time in Australia .
Hicks admitted training with al Qaeda in Afghanistan , where he was captured in December 2001 , one month after Hamdan was taken into custody .
" He is free with his family right now , with his children , " Hamdan said .
He told the court that he had only an employee - employer relationship -- a relationship of respect -- with the al Qaeda leader .
Watch how Hamdan described bin Laden »
Hamdan tried to make the case to jurors that he was only a driver , and described his relationship with bin Laden as " normal . "
He said he treated bin Laden as an employee would treat a boss and , in turn , bin Laden treated him in a way that took into account his position .
" I respected him , and he respected me , " Hamdan said .
" I regarded him , and he regarded me . "
Hamdan was cool and calm as he addressed the court , wearing a light - colored jacket , a white shirt and traditional white headdress .
He was taken into custody in southern Afghanistan in November 2001 .
Though the car he was driving contained missiles , he said from the beginning the car was borrowed and the missiles were n't his .
He repeated his assertions Thursday .
He made some of his comments in a closed session , which the government said was necessary in case classified information was raised .
Hamdan testified he had wanted to settle in his native country , Yemen , but after the attack in 2000 by an explosives - laden motorboat on the USS Cole in Yemen 's Gulf of Aden , which killed 17 American sailors , he and his wife left the country .
According to Hamdan , Yemeni media were blaming the attack on the Israeli Mossad , and he did n't know until later that al Qaeda was behind it .
When the U.S. - led war began in Afghanistan after 9/11 , Hamdan said , he took his family to Pakistan for their safety , and he left them to return the car he had borrowed .
During the trial , prosecutors argued Hamdan became a member of al Qaeda in 1996 and conspired with the group on terrorist attacks .
They alleged that Hamdan overheard conversations about 9/11 and claimed to have other information showing he was part of bin Laden 's inner circle .
The defense contended that Hamdan was a low - level driver who knew little about the workings of bin Laden 's al Qaeda network .
They said he worked for wages , not to wage war against America .
The trial began July 22 , and deliberations started Monday .
CNN 's Jamie McIntyre and Mike Mount contributed to this report .

Are you tired of the daily grind at work and seeing nothing but a dead end career ?
If you have been in the workforce for a while , it ’s not easy to change your line of work .
And changing job may help for a while , but you ’ll still be doing the same dreadful thing .
If you are in this position , becoming a part - time entrepreneur might be just the thing for you .
A new self - started enterprise could rejuvenate you and give you an eventual opportunity to leave your job with minimal risks .

Advantages Of Part - Time Entrepreneurship
By not leaving your job right away and start your side business on a part - time basis , you ’ll be able enjoy several advantages :
Steady Income And Benefits
Perhaps the most attractive part of a regular job is the steady income and the benefits — i.e. , insurances , vacation days , 401k ( and / or pension ) , tuition reimbursement , professional training , etc .
You do not have to give up any of these as a part - time entrepreneur .
More Room To Make Mistakes Or Take More Risks
Since you are not solely dependent on your business income .
You can afford to make a few mistakes without worrying about your cash flow too much .
You could try different things , or push your ideas to the limit , knowing that your regular income will be there in case things do n’t work out according to plan .
Go At Your Own Pace
Again , having a steady income from your job allows you to go as fast or as slowly as you want .
You do not have the pressure of “ I ’ve got to make it ” on your shoulders .
Disadvantages Of Part - Time Entrepreneurship
Not Getting Its Fair Share Of Attention
Because the pressure is not there , your new enterprise may never get the attention it deserved .
Part - time businesses often fall victim to other priorities , such as the job that pays the bills , and family matters .
Negatively Impact Your Job And Family Life
Even the simplest endeavor takes a lot of time and resources .
You could be stretched even thinner than you already are , and other aspects of you life may suffer .
Never Grow Out Of The Part - Time Status
Your part - time business could turn into a nice source of extra income , but never fully replace your job .
This could leave you with an unsatisfactory career and a side business that never takes off .
How To Become A Part - Time Entrepreneur
Start with ideas related to things that you enjoy doing .
After all you want to get away from the stuff that you do not like .
And you ’ll be spending a lot of time getting your business going so you might as well do something you like .
Create proper business plan .
Even if you have a very simple business , you want to do your research and start with a good plan .
Small Business Administration ( SBA ) has some of the best resources on the web to get you started .
At the least , you want to make sure your business is viable .
Implement and execute .
The best plan and idea do n’t mean a thing unless you can turn it into reality .
This is the part where it takes some courage and a lot of willpower to make things happen .
Learn and improve .
Even if your business fails , it ’s a success if you can learn something from it .
Very few people are successful on their first attempt , so do n’t give up .
Your task is to learn from past failures and turn that cumulative experience into an eventual success .

Uh , well , uh , that was pretty cool , but why did that trailer feel a lot like I was watching a trailer for Rainbow Six Vegas 2 ?
I just get this weird vibe off the trailer .
Maybe it 's the music , or the movement of the camera , but it just has that feel to it .
And I 'll state right now , I like RSV2 .
It 's fun .
But yeah , I still feel weird about the directing on this trailer .
It 's like I 've seen it before .
( CNN ) --
" I think that in 20 years chocolate will be like caviar , " says John Mason , executive director and founder of the Ghana - based Nature Conservation Research Council ( NCRC ) .
Could you survive a future without chocolate ?
Communities and the environment are also at stake .
" It will become so rare and so expensive that the average Joe just wo n't be able to afford it . "
The prospect of a future without a ready supply of chocolate is not a pleasant thought for anyone with a sweet tooth , but it's an even more terrifying prospect for producer countries that depend on cocoa beans for a huge portion of their GDP .
Yields are declining all across the cocoa plantations of West Africa , where two thirds of the world 's supply is grown , as soils are degraded and the area able to support the crop retreats , according to Mason .
" The way we farm is just not sustainable , " he says .
" I 'm afraid by the time we wake up to that fact it will be too late .
I 've worked in Ghana for 25 years and I can show you huge areas that can no longer support a crop . "
The problem is that cocoa is naturally a rainforest plant that grows in shady conditions surrounded by a high biodiversity , but recently hybrid varieties have been grown on cleared land as mono - cultures and in full sun .
While this will give higher short term yields , the soil quickly becomes degraded and the lifespan of plants can be cut from 75 or 100 years , to 30 or less .
When the trees die and the land is exhausted the farmers must move on and clear more rainforest to plant cocoa .
But the looming decline of West African cocoa is not only a problem for farmers and chocolate producers - Cadbury sources 100 percent of the beans they use for UK chocolate production from Ghana - environmentalists are increasingly concerned about the destruction of the rainforest for short - term gain .
Finding strength in a common cause
The forest is not only an important habitat in its own right , but its removal is also affecting the microclimate and changing rainfall patterns , compounding the negative effects of global warning , according to the NCRC .
But a new project seems to show that farmers , environmentalists and multinationals can find strength in their common cause .
" They were worried about the future , and we were worried about biodiversity , " says Dave Hillyard , Director of Program Operations for the international environmental charity Earthwatch .
" We were coming together at the same point from different directions . "
In response to these concerns Earthwatch formed " Earthshare " in partnership with Cadbury and the NCRC .
Earthshare is a scientific research project that aims to explore ways of creating sustainable cocoa farming .
Currently it works with 60 farms but negotiations are underway to scale up the initiative .
" We want to understand the effect of different farming systems on the environment , " says Hillyard .
Intensively farmed landscapes need a lot of inputs -- such as water and chemical fertilizers - and their fertility tends to degrade rapidly .
Whereas a mixed farming landscape , where other flora can shade the cocoa trees and provide habitats for the birds , mammals , reptiles and invertebrates that both eat pests on the cocoa and help pollinate the crop , not only increases biodiversity , it reduces the need for inputs and retains its fertility .
A healthy environment seems to mean healthier cocoa .
For Cadbury , Earthshare also helps address another problem : the declining number of people wanting to be cocoa farmers .
" They 're coming at sustainable supply from two angles , " says Mark Harper , Program Manager for Earthwatch .
" It 's not just about increasing yields ; it 's also about decreasing the number of farmers leaving the business .
" They are focused on making it a more attractive crop by improving the livelihoods of cocoa farmers , whether that 's by providing better sanitation , improved access to markets to get a better price for their crop , or helping establish new revenue streams , such as eco tourism . "
Changing lives at home and abroad
For Earthwatch , engaging with companies provides resources to continue their scientific research and an opportunity to affect corporate behavior .
" I see our involvement with Cadbury as a journey , " says Hillyard .
" We have a strong desire to engage with companies who show a commitment to improving their environmental performance .
" This gives us the opportunity to get our research done , and the chance to influence their behavior ...
If we did n't feel like we were working towards the same goals then it would become difficult for us . "
Cadbury employees also benefit from Earthshare through the opportunity to spend time in Ghana .
" It 's all about linking staff into their employers Corporate Social Responsibility programs , and helping them understand the way the product they produce impacts on the environment , " says Hillyard .
The responses of staff would seem to indicate this was working .
" It was an amazing experience , " says Catherine Webber , one of Cadbury laboratory managers in the UK .
" People talk about ' life changing ' trips , but it really was .
To go somewhere like that and see the way of life of the farmers ... it really put my own life in perspective and made me much more environmentally aware and less materialistic . "
" It was one of the best business experiences I 've had , " says David Fleisher , a Cadburys employee in the USA .
" That 's saying something from almost a 30 - year career . "
Earthshare is also involving young Ghanaian scientists , engaging them in the work and adding to the skills they have learned at university .
Earthwatch run similar projects with Starbucks in Costa Rica , looking at smallholder coffee production , and the agri-business Syngenta , studying how creating larger field margins and increasing biodiversity can in turn increase the number of insect pollinators and , ultimately , bring larger yields .
But whether or not schemes such as this can halt the decline of cocoa in West Africa remains to be seen .
" We can not rely on governments to sort this out , " says the NCRC's John Mason .
" Companies must engage with the problem .
Good on Cadbury for supporting research that is not always bringing in good news . "
But while the scale of the problem is huge , Mason remains positive that if the right steps are taken soon , a permanent collapse of the cocoa crop is avoidable .
" The funny thing is we can reverse this , " he says .
" It will cost , certainly , but we can do it .
The carbon trading market may be one way of making it more affordable , paying farmers for retaining biodiversity as a carbon off - set .
We need to make these links .
" Sometimes I feel like a lonely voice , and more people need to engage with these problems , soon .
Otherwise , I fear my grandchildren may only ever know the taste of artificial chocolate . "
In an interview with the latest issue of Games Master the director of Sonic Unleashed , Yoshihisa Hashimoto , proved to the world that he has a bit of a clue .
A glowing preview of the upcoming Jekyll - and - Hyde game from the magazine includes such questions to the Sonic Team lead as ‘ is Sonic Unleashed going to continue the trend ( of making Sonic ’s world more ‘ realistic ’ ) ? ’
Hashimoto ’s response was the news we had all been waiting for :
No , I do n’t think Sonic should be something that ’s merely realistic …
That would n’t be Sonic .
Our goal is to make it like Disney World .
Disney World is ‘ real ’ , but it ’s a colourful toon - ish world .
Just strolling around it makes you excited .
I want to make Sonic ’s world like this … with the textures as realistic as possible yet ( in ) forms that are deformed .
So , like a twisted form of realistic locations inspired by the world around us ?
Sounds like Sonic 1 to Adventure to me .
It ’s about time they realised all this nonsensical parp about Maria / Gerald Robotnik / Shadow ’s morality was a pointless affair .
Sonic fans , here ’s a guy in Sonic Team who finally knows what he ’s talking about .
In a land without Naka , Yasuhara and Oshima , such people have been rare to come by in the last ten years .
Yoshihisa Hashimoto is our new pin-up of the month .
Prisoners are having to sleep in toilets because of overcrowding at one English jail , the chief inspector of prisons revealed today .
Inspectors uncovered the practice during an unannounced visit in February to Doncaster prison once dubbed " Doncatraz " .
The chief inspector of prisons , Anne Owers , said the practice must stop .
" We were disappointed to find that two - person cells had been turned into three - person cells by placing a bed in the shared toilet .
This was unacceptable , " she said .
Inspectors also found " worrying " deterioration in healthcare and poor access to GPs , which they said must be urgently addressed .
Incidents of violence and self - harm have also increased .
The inspection report was published on the day the House of Commons justice committee said hasty legislation had been a " significant contributor " to prison overcrowding .
Prison numbers hit a record high of 83,000 at the end of June and Doncaster is 200 inmates over capacity .
The jail was the third prison to be privatised in the UK and is run by the Serco group .
Its prisoners include young offenders aged 18 - 21 , and adults .
Two years ago the inspectorate criticised it for " institutional meanness " after finding there were no pillows for many prisoners , or even toilet seats .
Owers then branded conditions " squalid " .
But the jail was praised for its resettlement work in today 's report .
" Resettlement provision had continued to improve and , in the context of a busy prison with a transient local population , was among the best we have seen , " Owers added .
At the “ make - or - break ” stage of talks with the U.S. on the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq , Prime Minister Nouri Maliki has swept aside his negotiating team and replaced it with three of his closest aides , a reshuffle that some Iraqi officials warn risks sabotaging the agreement .
The decision on the team negotiating the pact , which the Americans have described as the basis of a long - term strategic alliance between the United States and Iraq , remains so sensitive that it has not been announced .
In disclosing the switch to the Los Angeles Times this weekend , a senior Iraqi official close to Maliki also suggested that the two sides remained deadlocked on key issues .
The shake - up comes just four months before the expiration of the United Nations mandate that authorizes the U.S. troop presence in Iraq .
When Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited the country recently , expectations rose that an agreement was imminent .
But Iraq and the United States remain far apart on the matter of immunity for U.S. forces in Iraqi courts , the official said .
“ People gave the impression we were close when Rice was here , but it ’s not over .
We would have a serious problem if we took it to the parliament right now , ” said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was n’t authorized to discuss the issue .

The official insisted that if U.S. troops remained exempt from Iraqi rule of law , the pact would never get passed by the lawmakers .
The sides also are still negotiating a withdrawal date , the official said .
The latest version of the agreement , which was read to The Times by the Maliki confidant , says all U.S. forces will leave Iraq by the end of 2011 , unless Iraq requests otherwise .
It also says the Americans will withdraw from cities in June 2009 , unless the Iraqis ask them to stay .
The new wording is a departure from the White House ’s insistence on a conditions - based timeline for a pullout .
Under the new language , Iraq , not the U.S. military , decides when the troops will leave .
U.S. officials have gone back to Washington to consult on the language , the Maliki confidant said .

Some Iraqi lawmakers have reacted angrily to the dismissal of the original negotiating team .
“ These are diversionary tactics to avoid a decision .
It ’s not a question of negotiating teams .
It ’s a matter of , do you want it or do n’t you ? ” said an Iraqi familiar with the talks .
“ They are avoiding the issue .
They do n’t want a status of forces agreement .
They do n’t want a security agreement . ”
Maliki ’s confidant defended the shake - up , saying the prime minister needs those closest to him to lead the talks because they have the authority to make decisions that the original team did not possess .
Iraqi and Western officials monitoring the talks have said Maliki is afraid of accepting terms that could brand him as an American puppet .
Iran , which is fiercely opposed to an agreement , has also exerted intense pressure .

Shiite Muslim lawmakers have also said some members in the prime minister ’s Islamic Dawa Party believe that Iraq can survive without the Americans if the White House does n’t meet Maliki ’s demands .
In the reshuffle last week , Maliki dismissed the delegation headed by the Foreign Ministry and picked his national security advisor , Mowaffak Rubaie ; his chief of staff , Tariq Najim ; and political advisor Sadiq Rikabi to conduct the negotiations ’ final stage , the Maliki confidant said .
“ The talks have reached a critical point now .
They need a political decision , not a technical one , ” the official said .
“ The discussions have reached the make - or - break stage . ”
Rikabi , Rubaie and Najim report directly to the prime minister ; Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammed Haj Hamoud , who led the original negotiations , has been removed , the official said .
Western diplomats previously have criticized the prime minister for governing through his inner circle and shutting out other factions .

“ Hamoud had to deal with too many people and then comes to a meeting with the prime minister , ” the official said .
“ It was a big process . ”
Iraq ’s politics are often turbulent , with the country ’s Sunni , Shiite and Kurdish politicians regularly plotting against one another .
Until he took on the Mahdi Army , a Shiite militia , in the southern city of Basra in March , Maliki was considered politically weak and had been accused by Sunni Arab and Kurdish officials of hoarding power and executing a sectarian agenda .
U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Ziadeh declined to comment on the shake - up , saying the Iraqi government had the right to choose the negotiators that it wanted .
A State Department spokesman in Washington told reporters last week that the United States hoped to finish an agreement by December .
The sides had aimed to complete it by July .
The Iraqi official close to Maliki said Iraq could always request an extension from the U.N. if they did not reach a deal before the end of the year .

Some Western and Iraqi officials blame the Americans for sending a team in the spring that demanded more than 50 long - term bases , the ability to launch operations without permission from the Iraqi government and immunity for security contractors and U.S. troops .
Their opening stance played into the hands of Shiite lawmakers in Maliki ’s coalition , who want the Americans to leave , officials said .
Mithal Alusi , an independent Sunni lawmaker who has advised Maliki in the past , accused the prime minister of trying to wreck the talks .
“ Why does he have to change the leaders of the negotiating team , and now ?
Why ?
We had reached the last part .
Why does he have to change it ? ”
Alusi asked .
“ He does n’t want it . ”

Evil usually hides its face , because the sight of it repulses all but the depraved .
However , in the case of Benny Morris , writing in Friday ’s New York Times , we see something new : a proud evil , glorying in pure malevolence .
His piece is a cold , calculated attempt to simultaneously shock and intimidate , one that succeeds at the former but fails miserably at the latter .
Here ’s the shocker , really a double jolt : " Israel , " he avers , " will almost surely attack Iran ’s nuclear sites in the next four to seven months . "
Either that , he writes , or else Israel will eventually have to launch " a preemptive nuclear strike . "
His message to the West : take out Iran , or we ’ll nuke ’em !
The Israelis have been threatening to strike for the past six months , so nothing new there , except for the tone of certainty .
Morris is no fringe nut - job flailing away on his obscure blog ; he ’s a prominent Israeli historian writing on the most noted opinion page of them all , a veritable bulletin board for governing elites worldwide .
As such , he is almost certainly speaking with some insight into Israeli government plans .
It is , in any case , almost inconceivable that he wrote his piece without the foreknowledge and consent of Israeli government officials .
As to whether he  and they  are bluffing , well , I would n’t count on it .
With all this talk of Iran ’s alleged attempt to build nuclear weapons  which our own intelligence services say was abandoned years ago 
Israel is the one country in the region we know is armed to the gills with nukes .
Given their history , the increasing extremism of their leadership and polity , and their fanatical devotion to the doctrine of preemption  indeed , they invented it , while George W. Bush merely adopted it  the Israelis are far more likely than any other member of the nuclear club to actually use nukes , as Morris makes all too clear .
In what has to be the most widely circulated blackmail note ever written , Morris announces , " It is in the interest of neither Iran nor the United States ( nor , for that matter , the rest of the world ) that Iran be savaged by a nuclear strike "  so take out the Iranians , or we will .
To be fair , he also says it wo n’t be a good thing if " both Israel and Iran suffer such a fate , " but since Iran has no nuclear weapons and has given up all attempts to make them , this is just window - dressing for a genocidal agenda .
Morris ’s rationale for mass murder is oddly hollow and formulaic :
Well , you see , " Every intelligence agency in the world believes the Iranian program is geared toward making weapons , not to the peaceful applications of nuclear power . "
To begin with , this has got to be a misprint .
Surely what Morris meant to say was that every Israeli intelligence agency thinks Iran is on the verge of acquiring nukes .
Why else are the Israelis slated to make a series of trips to the U.S. to convince their American counterparts that they are right , and the Americans ’ National Intelligence Estimate on Iran is wrong ?
Aside from that , there is a dispute as to where to draw the " red line , " the point - of - no - return , the passage of which acts as a tripwire provoking military intervention .
The Israelis have a far tighter timeline , as you might imagine , and their forecast  " one to four years "  is wildly improbable .
It is based on the development of the ability to weaponize nuclear processes in a purely theoretical sense , quite aside from the problems posed by construction , possible detection , and delivery .
Reading the Morris screed , one wonders how he came to write such an unimaginative apologia for what would rank among the worst crimes in human history : " everybody knows " the Iranians are trying to build nukes ( where have we heard that before ? ) , the sanctions are n’t working , the Russians and the Chinese wo n’t cooperate , oh , and " the American public has little enthusiasm for wars in the Islamic lands . "
As anyone with the least amount of historical or common sense could easily figure out , even if Iran did develop a nuclear weapons arsenal , it would create a nuclear stalemate analogous to the Cold War standoff between the U.S. and the Soviet Union .
Morris claims this example does n’t apply , due to " the fundamentalist , self - sacrificial mindset of the mullahs who run Iran . "
Aside from the ruling by Iranian Shi’ite religious authority Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  the real leader of Iran  that forbids the development , stockpiling , and use of nuclear weapons , what about his own genocidal mindset , which glories in the prospect of ethnic cleansing ?
No Iranian personage of any prominence has called for the nuclear extermination of Israel in quite the same terms as Morris , not even Iranian President Ahmadinejad , whose vague remark about Israel " disappearing from the page of history " has been interpreted as a threat to use nukes .
Morris neither knows nor cares about Iran ’s alleged nukes .
Lurking behind his mundane laundry list of complaints is , I fear , a darker motive : sheer bloodlust .
Morris simply wants to kill as many Muslims as possible , so why does n’t he just come out and say it ?
After all , it is n’t like he has n’t said it before :
“ There are circumstances in history that justify ethnic cleansing .
I know that this term is completely negative in the discourse of the 21st century , but when the choice is between ethnic cleansing and genocide  the annihilation of your people  I prefer ethnic cleansing . ”
It is n’t very often that we get to see pure , unmitigated evil , in all its Satanic darkness , expressed openly on the printed page .
Morris and the Times have given us one of the rare modern examples of the genre .
One might compare it to Hitler ’s maleficent vision in Mein Kampf , but that would be giving Morris too much credit .
Unlike the Nazis , who blamed their victims for the horrors visited upon them , Morris also blames Israel ’s friends and allies  the West , and specifically the antiwar American public , which " curtails the White House ’s ability to begin yet another major military campaign in pursuit of a goal that is not seen as a vital national interest by many Americans . "
We must forget our national interests and go to war for Israel ’s sake , or else the Israelis will unleash their illegal and unaccounted - for nukes , killing tens of thousands , poisoning the atmosphere , and forever scarring human history with the mark of their heinous crime .
This is like one of those hostage dramas in which a mad gunman grabs someone and uses them as a human shield , braying his demands to horrified onlookers .
Americans must reject this attempt at moral blackmail with the contempt it deserves  and perhaps begin to reexamine the " special relationship " that enables Israel to even contemplate such crimes against humanity .
As for Morris , he should be shunned by every decent human being , although perhaps that description does n’t apply to the editors of the New York Times .
Haskell API documentation is very lacking for newbies .
For instance , I want to understand how to create and use regexes .
If you start at Text .
Regex .
Posix documentation , it tells you that =~ and =~ ~ are the high level API , and the hyperlinks for those functions go to Text .
Regex .
Posix .
Wrap , where the main functions are not actually documented at all !
So we look at the type signatures — here is the first :
( =~ ) :: ( RegexMaker Regex CompOption ExecOption source , RegexContext Regex source1 target ) => source1 -> source -> target
So , that leads me to the class declarations for these things .
But trying to understand them is rather intimidating :
class RegexOptions regex compOpt execOpt | regex -> compOpt execOpt , compOpt -> regex execOpt , execOpt -> regex compOpt where
Or how about this ?
class RegexOptions regex compOpt execOpt => RegexMaker regex compOpt execOpt source | regex -> compOpt execOpt , compOpt -> regex execOpt , execOpt -> regex compOpt where
They are using multi-parameter type classes and functional dependencies .
Having read bits of Haskell for a while , I happen to know what they are ( vaguely ) , but I do n’t really understand them , nor does the above really give me any clue to how to actually use this API .
Google to the rescue .
( This is bad : I should n’t have to google for documentation when I ’m already looking at the obvious place for something to be documented ) .
The first result for “ haskell regex ” is a completely useless and hopeless out of date page , but there is a Haskell regex tutorial on a blog that shows us how to do it , and it is astonishingly simple :
> " bar " =~ " ( foo|bar ) " :: String " bar "
So what is going on ?
It looks like the library has been designed extremely cleverly so that in the simple case ( regex with default options etc ) , you can use it very easily , but you do n’t need to use different functions if you want to add regex options .
Furthermore , it is polymorphic in its return type , so we can also do this :
> " bar " =~ " ( foo|bar ) " :: Bool True
In fact you can get lists of matches , or lists of match offsets etc — almost anything you can think , just by specifying ( directly or using type inference ) the type of the result you want .
This is beautifully elegant and clever and I ’m sure it gave the designer a warm fuzzy feeling inside ( well , it gives me one , and I ’m just looking at it ) .
The downside is that if you try to use =~ at a GHCi prompt without a type annotation , you just get a ridiculously unhelpful error .
The problem here is that making the library so clever has also made it utterly impenetrable to the beginner .
The main functions are not even documented , and there is no explanation of the crazy type signature .
You might say that it is simply a documentation problem , but it is actually a combination of the two — if the type signature had been something simple , it would have been easy to deduce how to use it .
It seems to me that the documentation of a library has got to be proportional to the cleverness of its type signatures , or people are going to be absolutely lost .
Since Haskell libraries are almost always implemented by Haskell gurus , and they implement them with themselves in mind ( I have no objection to this , they are enthusiasts working for free ) , they use lots of clever code and advanced Haskell techniques .
But this means that if you want people to actually use these libraries ( and by consequence Haskell itself ) , the documentation for Haskell libraries has to be about an order of magnitude better than anything you ’d find anywhere else .
I suspect it is at least an order of magnitude worse than for something like .
NET APIs , which means that relatively speaking the documentation of Haskell is currently in an absolutely dire state .
Sorry , I ’m just saying it like it is .
These libraries are great when you can get them to work , and I ’m really grateful to the authors for their fantastic work , and the effort that has gone into packaging and distributing them ( so that installation is literally one short command - line away ) , but the hurdles are still currently far too great compared to any other language for Haskell to become popular .
Moving forward , I guess one problem is contributing to a library ’s documentation .
There is nothing on the API doc pages that shows you how to do this .
I suspect you need to check out the source with darcs ( not something I do normally , I just use cabal ) and then start email patches or something .
Even then , I do n’t know if I would contribute any documentation — ‘ howto ’ style documentation seems out of place on the API pages , but it is desperately needed .

We interrupt our programming for a brief editorial …
Am I the only one who dreads waking up each day to see what silly new banter , war cry , or promise has been put forward in the neverending saga of Yahoo ’s downward spiral ?
The latest news today , in case you ’re the one person who has n’t heard it , is that Yahoo and Carl Icahn have “ settled ” their ongoing battle — agreeing to leave most of Yahoo ’s existing board on the ballot for re-election , create one new additional board spot for Icahn , and create another two new additional board spots for people from Icahn ’s suggested list .
While one might hope this will mean we wo n’t have to hear anything more about this nonsense for a while , it probably does n’t .
There ’ll be plenty more maneuvers as Icahn now dukes it out with Yang and the other Yahoos from the inside , instead of from his previous position as simple shareholder .
Will Microsoft or wo n’t they ?
Are talks back on or are n’t they ?
Will the company split up its assets ?
Will Brenda ever get back together with Dylan ?
Ah , the endless questions …
So here ’s my proposal :
No more public PR battles , no more using the media as puppets to spread carefully crafted messages ( think about every piddly little letter each side has sent back and forth — is it anything more ? ) .
For the love of all things sacred , sell the friggin ’ company and shut up already .
Granted , today ’s announcement was one of the more significant in the big picture of everything we ’ve heard over the past months — but following the sea of insignificant noise coming from all sides of this story , I for one am oversaturated and simply can’t sop up any more of the Yahoo water .
It would be surprisingly refreshing if we could go without hearing another single yelp about Yahoo until there ’s actually an acquisition .
I think I can safely say , at the very least , that you wo n’t see much more about the soap opera drama on this site until there is a legitimate development — such as a sale .
Consider the puppet strings cut .
Now , back to your regularly scheduled programming …

TRANSCRIPT : Jake Tapper Interviews Barack Obama
Presumptive Democratic Nominee on Gay Marriage , Education & the General Election
The following is a transcript of an interview conducted by ABC News ' Jake Tapper with Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , for " World News with Charles Gibson " on June 16 , 2008 , in Flint , Michigan .
TAPPER : You talked about the need to change the status quo in education today .
OBAMA : Right .
TAPPER : But one of the ways that proponents of school choice say that the best way to change the status quo is to give parents , inner-city parents a choice .
Why not ?
OBAMA : Well , the problem is , is that , you know , although it might benefit some kids at the top , what you 're going to do is leave a lot of kids at the bottom .
We do n't have enough slots for every child to go into a parochial school or a private school .
And what you would see is a huge drain of resources out of the public schools .
So what I 've said is let 's foster competition within the public school system .
Let 's make sure that charter schools are up and running .
Let 's make sure that kids who are in failing schools , in local school districts , have an option to go to schools that are doing well .
But what I do n't want to do is to see a diminished commitment to the public schools to the point where all we have are the hardest - to - teach kids with the least involved parents with the most disabilities in the public schools .
That 's going to make things worse , and we 're going to lose the commitment to public schools that I think have been so important to building this country .
TAPPER : So it would help some kids , but overall it would be bad for the system ?
OBAMA : I think it would be overall bad for most kids .
TAPPER : It 's a Democratic year .
And the president 's numbers , poll numbers are horrible .
OBAMA : Right .
TAPPER : The right track - wrong track numbers indicate a record number of Americans think we 're on the wrong track .
The heads of the Republican House and Senate committees anticipate they 're going to lose lots of seats .
OBAMA : Right .
TAPPER : And yet you and Senator McCain right now are pretty much tied .
OBAMA : Yes .
TAPPER : Why are n't you doing better ?
Why did n't you get a bounce ?
OBAMA : Oh , well , you know , my understanding is the current polls show me up , despite the fact that we went through an extraordinary primary .
I mean , we went through a long , long contest .
And Senator Clinton was a formidable and terrific candidate .
And so while we were doing that , John McCain basically was getting a pass , both from the media , from you guys , as well as from other opponents .
And so I think that that explains it .
But , look , the truth is , is that a presidential contest is always going to be closer than a congressional contest .
People are always going to be taking measure .
We have n't seen any blowout elections any time over the last several years , even when Congress has shifted significantly , as it did during Bill Clinton 's midterm , as it did during George Bush 's midterm .
So we 've seen these kinds of trends before .
What I 'm confident about is that when people get to know my track record and contrast it with John McCain's , when they know that I 'm giving a middle - class tax cut to working families , and he 's giving a tax cut , a quarter of which goes to people making more than $ 2.8 million , when people see that I 'm offering universal health care , and John McCain is not , those are going to be decisive issues during a year when families , like those here in Flint , are really feeling left behind .
TAPPER : John McCain is aggressively going after women 's vote , especially former supporters of Senator Hillary Clinton .
He said he 'll be a better president for them .
Your response ?
OBAMA : Well , I 'm glad that John McCain is going after women .
I think that everybody should go after every voter .
I think John McCain is going to have trouble making the case , when on almost every single issue that 's important to women , he 's been on the wrong side .
You know , he is in favor of judges who would overturn Roe v. Wade .
He has opposed equal pay .
He has opposed the CHIP program , that would make children insured .
He has opposed efforts to protect women against some of the discrimination that they experience in the workplace .
You know , that 's not going to be a track record that I think is going to be very appealing to women .
TAPPER : Speaking of the Supreme Court , you applauded the decision that the Supreme Court made last week .
The Bush administration says , no matter what people think about other programs , other policies they 've initiated , there has not been a terrorist attack within the U.S. since 9/11 .
And they say the reason that is , is because of the domestic programs , many of which you opposed , the NSA surveillance program , Guantanamo Bay , and other programs .
How do you know that they 're wrong ?
It 's not possible that they 're right ?
OBAMA : Well , keep in mind I have n't opposed , for example , the national security surveillance program , the NSA program .
What I 've said that we can do it within the constraints of our civil liberties and our Constitution .
TAPPER : They disagree , though .
OBAMA : Well , but the fact that they disagree does not mean that they 're right on this .
What it means is , is that they have been willing to skirt basic protections that are in our Constitution , that our founders put in place .
And it is my firm belief that we can track terrorists , we can crack down on threats against the United States , but we can do so within the constraints of our Constitution .
And there has been no evidence on their part that we can't .
And , you know , let 's take the example of Guantanamo .
What we know is that , in previous terrorist attacks -- for example , the first attack against the World Trade Center , we were able to arrest those responsible , put them on trial .
They are currently in U.S. prisons , incapacitated .
And the fact that the administration has not tried to do that has created a situation where not only have we never actually put many of these folks on trial , but we have destroyed our credibility when it comes to rule of law all around the world , and given a huge boost to terrorist recruitment in countries that say , " Look , this is how the United States treats Muslims . "
So that , I think , is an example of something that was unnecessary .
We could have done the exact same thing , but done it in a way that was consistent with our laws .
TAPPER : You and Senator John McCain are both talking about the need to reach across the partisan divide .
OBAMA : Right .
TAPPER : It 's not difficult to look at Senator McCain 's record and see examples of times when he reached across the partisan divide at great political risk to himself : immigration reform , Gang of 14 , campaign finance reform .
I know that you have worked across the aisle .
OBAMA : Absolutely .
TAPPER : But have you ever worked across the aisle in such a way that entailed a political risk for yourself ?
OBAMA : Well , look , when I was doing ethics reform legislation , for example , that was n't popular with Democrats or Republicans .
So any time that you actually try to get something done in Washington , it entails some political risks .
But I think the basic principle which you pointed out is that I have consistently said , when it comes to solving problems , like nuclear proliferation or reducing the influence of lobbyists in Washington , that I do n't approach this from a partisan or ideological perspective .
And the same is true when it comes to the economy .
The same is true when it comes to national security .
You know , this administration , the Bush administration , has made , for example , the war on terror into a sharply partisan issue .
But the truth is , is that I admire some of the foreign policy of George Bush 's father .
And I 've said so before .
I think that there 's a tradition of us working together to make sure that we are dealing with the threats that are out there and that we are building a consensus here in the United States .
That 's the kind of approach I intend to take when I 'm president of the United States .
TAPPER : OK , last one , and that is same - sex marriage is now going on in California .
OBAMA : Right .
TAPPER : You oppose same - sex marriage .
OBAMA : Yes .
TAPPER : Do you think that the fact that this is now going on in California , does that cause you to re-think your pledge to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act ?
OBAMA : No .
I still think that these are decisions that need to be made at a state and local level .
I 'm a strong supporter of civil unions .
And I think that , you know , we 're involved in a national conversation about this issue .
You know , I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman , but I also think that same - sex partners should be able to visit each other in hospitals , they should be able to transfer property , they should be able to get the same federal rights and benefits that are conferred onto married couples .
And so , you know , as president , my job is to make sure that the federal government is not discriminating and that we maintain the federal government 's historic role in not meddling with what states are doing when it comes to marriage law .
That 's what I 'll do as president .
TAPPER : Does it bother you , what California 's doing ?
OBAMA : No .
TAPPER : OK .
Thank you , Senator .
We really appreciate your time .
OBAMA : Appreciate your questions .
TAPPER : Good luck .
Good luck on the campaign trail .
OBAMA : Thank you very much , Jake .

A total solar eclipse will cut a swath of shadow through Greenland , the Arctic , Russia , Mongolia and China on August 1 .
And thousands of people will travel to remote locations just to stand in the dark for three minutes – and maybe perceive the vast size of the solar system .
Locations are rarely convenient , and planning a successful eclipse trip involves specialized maps , astronomical charts , statistical weather data , GPS and optical gear , backcountry camping equipment ( perhaps ) , and a good working relationship with uncertainty .
The reward , though , can be like a short trip into space .
The corona itself is a big freakish thing : a feathery halo of streaming particles along magnetic field lines , which look not like nice summer rays but kill - you - dead radiation .
It 's also so big and far away as to bend one 's sense of scale .
At least three planets are usually visible , and this August there will be four : Mercury , Venus , Saturn and Mars .
On my second eclipse the sight of the sun and grouping of planets overtook me : I knew I was looking at the Middle .
The absence of the blinding photosphere provides depth perception , with the corona serving as a reference point relative to the planets in front of and beyond the sun .
It allows you to see the big mechanical picture , like a life - sized version of the classroom model , minus a few parts .
With some mental effort , it 's possible to actually grasp a sense of the size of the solar system .
It can crack your brain a bit .
I 've seen three solar eclipses , venturing to Eastern Europe , South America and Africa .
The plan this time is to trek into the Gobi Desert from Mongolia , where transport options are restricted to Jeep and camel , to an area in the center of the shadow 's path in China .
That 's the plan , at least .
There are border and government permission issues to deal with , and plans may not survive first contact .
There 's the part about actually getting there .
In my eclipse travels I 've canoed down the Zambezi River under a cloud of migrating bees , helped push a jackknifed tractor trailer over a cliff to clear a mountain road , hitchhiked with a Catholic priest who offered to sell me diamonds , and found myself atop crests of dunes with nomadic , eclipse - chasing ravers with black circles and orange halos painted on their foreheads .
Every trip is jammed with this stuff .
Information
The place to start is the NASA eclipse page , administered by the godfather of eclipse chasing , astronomer Fred Espenak , with help from Canadian meteorologist Jay Anderson .
The repeating orbital geometries of the sun , Earth and moon , called the Saros cycles , result in total solar eclipses ( when the moon completely blocks the sun ) every year or two somewhere in the world .
This site posts maps of the umbral paths as well as a trove of other resources , including photography guides .
Shadow Time
This year 's eclipse traverses thousands of miles between Canada and China , so how do you pick a spot ?
Factor No. 1 is duration ;
You want as much time as possible .
The point of greatest eclipse , where the shadow hits the surface of the Earth most head - on and lasts the longest , is near the Russian city of Nadym , with 2 minutes , 27 seconds , of totality beginning at 3:27:07 p.m. local time .
An important note : A partial eclipse is not worth traveling to .
Even 99 percent coverage results in 100 percent disappointment .
Good Weather
Factor No. 2 , probability of clear skies , often trumps factor No. 1 . Statistical weather data indicates an average August cloud amount of 60 percent in Nadym – not a good bet .
Weather prospects are terrible for most of the path except for one area showing under 30 percent , marked on a meteorological map by a tiny beige blob between the Chinese towns of Yiwu and Nom .
It would be easiest to begin in China and travel to this area , but the rest of my trip is focused in Mongolia , which makes planning more difficult .
In any case , this brings us to the fun part : local circumstances and conditions .
Travel
Maybe your spot 's in a war zone , or an atoll in the Pacific , or some other back - of - beyond .
Can you take a train ?
A bus ?
A donkey cart ?
Keep in mind that forests and buildings obscure sightlines , and nearby mountains usually create convective clouds in otherwise - clear areas .
Also , a dramatic natural event loses a bit of charm when viewed from the shoulder of a busy highway , or overlooking a sewage - treatment plant .
Research transport and site choice details by all available means ( Lonely Planet , Rough Guides , Google Earth , embassies , friends ) , scout your location as early as possible upon arrival , and be prepared to move .
Gear
As for gear , one essential item is eclipse - viewing shades .
Aluminized Mylar or No. 14 welder 's glass works well , and disposable cardboard glasses with protective filters can be ordered online .
Even a bare cuticle of sunlight can fry your retinas when you stare at it , but the only way to experience totality is with your own eyes , and it 's even better with magnification if you 're willing to lug some gear .
Astrophotographers come equipped with big lenses and solar filters designed ( and required ) especially for this purpose .
A look through a properly equipped telescope will blow your mind with views of huge arcs of flame , called prominences , erupting off the sun 's limb , as well as sunspots and close - ups of the corona , millions of kelvins hot .
Shadow Protocol
Timing here is critical , as the second - contact phenomena , when totality is beginning , are spectacular .
Over a few short seconds the sun narrows to a sliver , and everything around you shimmers as though the air itself is polarized .
Planets and a few bright stars appear .
People begin to shout and applaud at the last hot gleam of the sun , set atop the crescent like an oozing orange - white gem – the " diamond ring effect . "
This immediately breaks apart into a fiery arc of beads , known as " Bailey 's beads , " as the profile of the mountains on the moon obscures all but a few rays shining through the valleys .
Then it 's lights out , leaving only the glow of a pearlescent , feathery halo around a black , unnatural anti-sun .
Unfamiliar constellations appear as your eyes adjust , and the corona begins to stretch outward .
The temperature drops by almost 10 degrees , and depending on where you are , crickets may begin to chirp and mosquitoes bite , as confused animals begin their evening routines .
Now 's the time to get your imagination working – and stop fooling with the photographic gear !
The continuous blast of stuff from that thing 93 million miles away – yes , you can see what 93 million miles away looks like – is what warms your face , lights up the poles with washes of color , makes plants grow , triggers vitamin - D synthesis in our bodies and drives all of our weather .
That thing all the way out there is responsible for … everything .
Wow .
Then after a period lasting anywhere from several seconds to a theoretical maximum of about 7 ½ minutes , a blast of light wipes the sky clean of space .
The temperature rises , roosters crow , and the whole thing seems like it never happened .
The World Atlas of Solar Eclipse Maps on the NASA page illustrates eclipse locations for the next 90 years .
You could find yourself anywhere from a monastery in Bhutan to a farm in the Ozarks , with a view of a sky hardly anyone gets to see .

CCTV : New York , June 10/08: A school prank gone wrong on Long Island is caught on tape .
Police said a group of students , dismissed early from Uniondale High School during the June 10th heat wave vandalized a 7 - 11 store .
They 're seen grabbing items off shelves and throwing items on the floor .
According to police , they also stole candy and beverages from the store .
Three teenagers are charged with riot and petty larceny .
On a November day in 1999 , Seattle police lost control of their city .
During a meeting of the World Trade Organization , protesters blockaded intersections , cut off delegates from the conference and rifled through local businesses , causing extensive damage .
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas to control the crowd , but it took days to restore order .
A group of Twin Cities anarchists now is making similar threats against the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul .
But they also made threats against the 2004 conventions in Boston and New York , and little ever came of them .
The question is what to make of the anarchists ?
Are they for real ?
And how seriously should the city take their threats ?
“ We ’ve learned lessons from others cities , including Boston and New York , including Seattle , ” said Tom Walsh , a spokesman for the St. Paul Police Department .
“ We do n’t simply think we can ignore the potential for a group of people to try to interrupt the convention by committing criminal acts .
We feel we have a plan in place to deal with that . ”
This month , the RNC Welcoming Committee , a group of self - styled anarchists , caused alarm when its
Web site linked to an online plan for moving delegates to and from the Xcel Energy Center .
The subsequent media coverage caused so much commotion , the Welcoming Committee ’s Web site crashed .
The group differs from the Coalition to March on the RNC and Stop the War , which is organizing the main protest march on the convention , and its aims are broader .
Rather than advocating an end to the war in Iraq , anarchists want an end to corporate globalization and , for some , a return to a more primitive lifestyle .
The anarchists say they wo n’t talk to “ corporate media , ” but one of the nation ’s best - known anarchists is John Zerzan , a Eugene , Ore. - based author and host of Anarchist Radio .
When contacted by phone , Zerzan said he regards the Seattle protest and riots as a success because they spotlighted anarchists ’ antiglobalization message .
Zerzan — a confidant of Theodore Kaczynski in the mid-1990s while the Unabomber awaited trial — said anarchists want to end corporate domination of the planet and roll back technological advances .
His new book is titled “ Twilight of the Machines . ”
Eugene - based anarchists were instrumental in the Seattle riots , and Zerzan does not back away from the methods .
While he does n’t condone violence against other individuals , he does n’t see property damage as violent —
“ Certainly not corporate property , ” Zerzan said .
Early in the 20th century , estimates of the number of anarchists in the U.S. ranged into the millions .
As a group , they largely disappeared until the 1960s , when their numbers started to grow again .
They were thrust back into the national psyche during the WTO protests .
“ 60 Minutes II ” profiled the group , featuring Zerzam prominently in its report .
Jess Sundin of the Anti-War Coalition , part of the Coalition to March on the RNC and Stop the War , said the group has had discussions with the anarchists but only to make sure they do n’t disrupt the march .
“ They ’ve made a commitment not to interfere , ” Sundin said .
Much as St. Paul is doing , police forces in Boston and New York took the groups seriously .
Boston Police Superintendent Robert Dunford said he tracked the groups through their online postings and literature ( which St. Paul is also doing ) , but their threatened disruptions never materialized .
“ A lot of it was street theater .
A couple of marches , ” Dunford said .
“ These groups , some of them are real and some of them are not , ” he added .
“ You really do n’t know . ”
New York City Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne echoed that thought .
“ We took it seriously .
Some of it was boasting , and some of it was real .
You ca n’t always tell , ” Browne said .
But New York did disrupt anarchist activities before they occurred .
“ There were attempts , but we were well aware of the attempts in advance , ” Browne said .
He added : “ In cases where violence was being planned , we had direct information about it even when it was n’t published . ”
Anarchists also held classes on less - menacing activities — how to disable a bus engine , for example .
“ We were at those classes , ” Browne said , declining to say whether the department used undercover officers or simply attended the meetings .
He also pointed out that New York hosted an anti-war march viewed as the largest in U.S. history — estimates range up to 1 million — with relatively few arrests .
But law enforcement officials say it takes only a few people to disrupt the peaceful intentions of many .
So is the Welcoming Committee real ?
Will they cause havoc at the convention ?
At this point , it ’s tough to say .
The group posted a YouTube video featuring people wearing bandanas over their faces and clad in black that walks the line between camp and menace .
It shows why determining the group ’s intentions is difficult .
At one point an anarchist lights a Molotov cocktail .
The flaming bottle is tossed over a fence and lands in a barbecue , where another anarchist waits , spatula in hand .
Another group of about 150 anarchists from the U.S. and Canada were in Wisconsin this week training for demonstrations at the Democratic and Republican conventions .
The anarchists were attending four days of workshops in Waldo in Sheboygan County .
Some of the workshops focused on strategies for the upcoming conventions .
The sessions were organized by the CrimethInc. Ex- Workers ’ Collective , an underground group that has published anarchist texts such as “ Recipes for Disaster : An Anarchist Cookbook . ”
Anarchists generally do not conceal their intentions .
What they plan to do is posted on the Internet and in literature handed out at left - leaning events .
Some say they simply hope to inspire others to commit the acts they outline , without having to do it themselves .
That ’s why media coverage — despite the RNC Welcoming Committee ’s stated aversion to mainstream media — is helpful to their cause .
“ Every time you write a story about them , you give us a hard time , ” Dunford said .
The Associated Press contributed to this report .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - NASA scientists on Tuesday said the surprise discovery of a sometimes toxic chemical on the surface of Mars does not diminish the possibility of finding microbial life on the Red Planet and asked for patience while they study soil samples further .
The space agency also cautioned that further tests were required to confirm that dirt analyzed by the Phoenix Mars Lander contains perchlorate , an oxidizing substance used in rocket fuel that on Earth can be harmful to life , and rule out contamination by the spacecraft .
NASA ’s initial announcement that Phoenix had detected perchlorate in the soil at the arctic circle of Mars had been greeted in the media and on the Internet by speculation that such a discovery would dampen the likelihood of finding microbial life there .
“ This has yet to be verified inside ( Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer ) instruments , ” Phoenix chief investigator Peter Smith said , adding that even if the discovery were confirmed “ this does not preclude life on Mars .
In fact it is a potential energy source . ”
“ I ask that the media be patient with us , ” he said .
“ Let the science team proceed at a proper pace . ”
Phoenix is the latest NASA spacecraft sent to Mars to discover whether water ever flowed on Mars and if life , even in microbial form , exists or ever existed there .
Last week NASA said Phoenix had provided definitive proof that water exists on Mars after further tests on ice found by the lander in June .

‘ WE DON ’T HAVE THE ANSWER ’
The scientists were seemingly stunned to have turned up perchlorate on Mars .
On Earth , the substance is found in such places as Atacama Desert in Chile , one of the driest places on the planet which is used by NASA as a testing ground for Mars missions .
But they noted that on Earth some plants were known to live in relatively perchlorate - rich soil .
“ How this perchlorate affects habitability on Mars is certainly a complex question that we do n’t have a final answer on , ” Smith said .
“ It really does n’t limit us in our search
for habitability in this icy soil and if we were lucky enough to see some organic signatures we would n’t be surprised .
In trying to rule out the possibility that perchlorate could have been brought to Mars by Phoenix , NASA was reviewing its prelaunch contamination control processes .

The agency last week extended the Phoenix mission by five weeks , saying its work was moving beyond the search for water to further exploring whether the planet was ever capable of sustaining life .
The extension will add about $ 2 million to the $ 420 million cost of landing Phoenix on May 25 for what was a scheduled three - month mission .
Phoenix touched down in May on an ice sheet and samples of the ice were seen melting in photographs taken by the lander ’s instruments in June .
Mission scientists said then that Martian soil was more alkaline than expected and had traces of magnesium , sodium , potassium and other elements .
They described the findings as a “ huge step forward . ”

Microsoft says there is ‘ no question ’ that the sale of downloaded games will overtake the sales of games at retail in the coming years .
According to David Gosen , Xbox Europe ’s VP of strategic marketing and Live , There ’s no question digital will overtake physical .
It happened in music and will happen to our industry . "
He was talking as part of his keynote speech at Microsoft ’s UK Gamefest developer event in central London today .
Gosen told attendees that " convergence is happening " in the industry as consumers turn to games consoles to deliver content digitally , be that games or movies .
He said that the success of premium downloadable content for games like Rock Band and Guitar Hero , plus the success of Xbox Live Arcade proved that digital will be the dominant force in future ” .
Gosen urged the rest of the industry to be ready for the digital distribution " step changes " heralded by Xbox Live .
" We have to think about how the consumer is changing and how the ways they are accessing media is changing . "
He also said that Microsoft is preparing to spend big on promoting Xbox Live in Europe as a means to attract more 360 owners and offer an active channel for those ‘ actively digital ’ consumers .
" We believe Xbox Live as the key differentiator in the business , " he said .
" But we have n’t taken advantage of Live in Europe as much as we could have – it ’s been our best kept secret . "
He revealed that Microsoft is preparing to make key announcements for new content available via the Xbox Live Marketplace as it looks to increase the investment supporting its digital distribution offer .
" Expect to see some big announcements coming from us about Live , specifically for Europe , in the coming month . "
Speaking to MCV sister magazine Develop after his talk , Gosen hinted that the announcements would be for more Xbox Live Arcade games and more Video Marketplace content .
He said : " We ’re going to focus on Live in Euope and we need to make sure that the content we offer is really strong .
So in the US the deal they announced with Netflix is a big coup ; it ’s transformational in providing a significant amount of content on the video marketplace .
" We ’ve got a good amount of content on the video Marketplace for UK , France and Germany but we ’re going to be working very closely with local studios in the European markets to bring more and more content to Live .
We ’ve already announced a deal with German studio Constantine to release films for that market – and we ’ll be doing more and more of those types of deals for that kind of content .
" And I think you will also see more activity from an Xbox Live Arcade perspective – plus , as I ’ve said , premium downloadable content . "
The comments on the rise of digital distribution over retail echo similar remarks made by SCEE CEO David Reeves at Sony ’s own developer conference two months ago .
But Gosen ’s views differ with Sony ’s on one key point – which next - gen console will rule the generation .
He said that digital distribution can help Microsoft towards its goal of doubling the Xbox 360 instal base globally .
We ’re going to invest in this region to ensure we win , ” he said , leaving attendees to look at his last presentation slide , which bullishly proclaimed ‘ We WILL outsell the PlayStation 3 ′ .

Some suggest crude could reach $ 150 a barrel by July The US and the four largest economies in Asia are to voice " serious concerns " over " unprecedented " oil prices .
Energy ministers are meeting in Japan a day after a record one - day jump in the crude oil price , to $ 139 a barrel .
Under pressure from the US , Japan , China , India and South Korea have agreed on the need to end fuel subsidies , blamed for boosting demand .
But correspondents say there are major differences over the speed and extent to which the changes should be made .
The soaring cost of oil is causing growing strain to economies around the world , with some governments facing protests and other pressures from consumers and businesses .
Both the Indian and Malaysian governments have recently raised fuel prices in order to cut the subsidies they provide .
Officials and ministers from the Group of Eight ( G8 ) key industrialised nations , as well as China , India and South Korea , are meeting for two days in the northern city of Aomori .
In a statement to be issued after the talks , the US and Asian countries are expected to say rising oil prices pose a great burden , especially on developing countries and are " against the interest of both consuming and producing countries " , news agencies reported .
It will also say that " phased and gradual " withdrawal of price subsidies - blamed by some for fuelling demand in emerging economies - is " desirable " , the French news agency AFP said .
But India insisted there was no agreement to remove the subsidies altogether , China made clear it had no time frame for moving towards lower subsidies , and Japan 's trade minister confirmed they had agreed only on the need to remove the subsidies , according to the BBC's Chris Hogg , in Tokyo .
' Economic egotism '
Friday 's spike in oil prices coincided with a dollar slump , plummeting share prices on Wall Street and US unemployment suffering its biggest rise in 20 years .
Russia is a global player .
We understand our responsibility for the fate of the world and want to participate in forming the rules of the game
Dmitry Medvedev
Russian president
Israeli minister threatens Iran Analysis : Growing talk of attack Send us your comments On Saturday , US energy secretary Samuel Bodman said the price surge was a " shock " but not a crisis , amid fears the oil price spike could help tip some of the world 's economies into recession .
He also said he did not see a need for a tightening of regulation of oil markets .
Some say market speculation , and a lack of disclosure of information over the size and nature of reserves , may be stoking the price rises , as well as concerns that demand may be growing faster than supply .
Separately , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev blamed what he termed the US's " economic egotism " for the current problems in the global economy .
He accused the US of " aggressive financial policies " and said most people in the world had become poorer .
Speaking at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum , he said Russia was a " global player " and wished to " participate in forming new rules of the game " , but not because of " imperial ambitions " .
Iran threat On Friday light crude set a record high of $ 139.12 in after - hours trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange after hitting $ 138.54 at the regular session .
Oil prices were given a boost on a report by Morgan Stanley analyst Ole Slorer , who suggested the price of oil could rocket to $ 150 as early as July .
Some analysts have suggested that prices would reach as high as $ 200 a barrel during the next 18 months .
The benchmark light , sweet crude oil is more than twice the price it was a year ago .
On Friday , the market was also responding to a statement by Israel 's transport minister that an attack on Iran was " unavoidable " after sanctions to prevent Tehran from developing its nuclear capability had failed .
Investors hedging oil against the weak dollar has also pushed up the price of oil .
Correspondents say fears that workers at Chevron Corporation in Nigeria may go on strike and subsequently disrupt production and access to oil are also adding to market jitters , as well as Israeli threats to strike Iran over its nuclear programme .
Oil prices had recorded losses earlier this week after doubts about future demand took hold of the market .

All new cars will have some degree of hybridization by 2020 , by which point battery technology will be ubiquitous and vehicles will communicate with one another and the road to make driving safer and easier .
That vision of the future is laid out in " Automotive 2020 : Clarity Beyond the Chaos , " ( .pdf ) by the IBM Institute for Business Value .
The report , based on interviews with 125 auto industry executives in 15 countries , says the industry is on the cusp of revolutionary changes that will see environmental sustainability and technological innovation become top priorities as automakers respond to consumer demands for more efficient cars that do n't sacrifice performance , comfort or reliability .
" In the next 10 years , we will experience more change than in the 50 years before , " says an executive with a European automaker who , like all of those quoted in the report , was not named .
The revolution already has begun .
There is mounting agreement among automakers , policymakers and environmentalists that the electrification of the automobile is inevitable and most of the major automakers are developing hybrid and plug - in hybrid vehicles .
Although such vehicles currently make up less than 3 percent of the market , the report finds " some degree of hybridization will be evident in all vehicles produced in 2020 and beyond . "
That may seem ambitious , but other studies say interest in gas- electric vehicles is exploding and sales could hit 2 million a year by 2013 , when there could be 89 different models on the market .
Battery technology will be ubiquitous within 12 years , the report states , and automakers and their suppliers will focus much of their R&D on the software and electronics needed to integrate them into vehicles .
" Energy storage is in the heart of the next generation of efforts for fuel economy , " the report quotes one American executive saying .
Several automakers plan to offer electric vehicles in America beginning in 2010 , and Mitsubishi will begin testing one in California later this year .
Still , battery costs – which the report estimates at 10 to 15 percent of the cost of the cars that use them – will remain a significant barrier to rapid market penetration .
Investment in biofuels will continue , although the technology " must undergo rapid evolution for global application and proliferation , " the report states , noting that ethanol from corn and other food crops is a dead end but cellulosic ethanol " has the potential to see widespread acceptance . "
Traditional fossil fuels will comprise just 65 percent of the market by 2020 , by which point average vehicle CO2 emissions will fall to 97 grams per kilometer – seven grams less than the Toyota Prius emits today .
As for hydrogen , keep waiting .
Although the report finds " hydrogen fuel cell vehicles will remain a viable alternative , " even the optimists do n't see them comprising more than a small fraction of vehicles by 2020 .
Few expect the infrastructure needed to generate , transport and distribute hydrogen to be in place anytime soon .
We 'll see just as much innovation in vehicle electronics as our cars get smarter and do more in the years to come .
We 're already seeing the dawn of the .car era as BMW , Chrysler and other automakers rush to bring internet connectivity to your dashboard and companies like Volvo develop systems to make cars virtually crash - proof .
By 2020 , the report states , cars will communicate with one another to prevent accidents , communicate with the road to respond to changing traffic conditions and use telemetrics to diagnose and repair problems .
As cars increasingly rely on batteries and advanced electronic systems , automakers will have to ally themselves with the consumer electronics , telecommunications and energy industries , the report states .
This , too , already is beginning to happen .
Several automakers are working with Microsoft to develop their own versions of Sync. Nissan and NEC , like Toyota and Panasonic , are working together on batteries .
General Motors has joined 34 utilities to prepare the nation 's electrical grid for plug - in hybrid and electric vehicles .
Such collaborations will only grow more common .
" The era when all work could be done within the industry is over , " one Japanese executive says .
" Now we need to interface with several external entities to get work done . "

This Week in HTML 5 – Episode 3
Welcome back to " This Week in HTML 5 , " where I 'll try to summarize the major activity in the ongoing standards process in the WHATWG and W3C HTML Working Group .
The biggest news this week is the birth of the event loop .
To coordinate events , user interaction , scripts , rendering , networking , and so forth , user agents must use event loops as described in this section .
...
An event loop has one or more task queues .
A task queue is an ordered list of tasks , which can be : Events Asynchronously dispatching an Event object at a particular EventTarget object is a task .
Parsing
The HTML parser tokenising a single byte , and then processing any resulting tokens , is a task .
Callbacks Calling a callback asynchronously is a task .
Using a resource
When an algorithm fetches a resource , if the fetching occurs asynchronously then the processing of the resource once some or all of the resource is available is a task .
Reacting to DOM manipulation
Some elements have tasks that trigger in response to DOM manipulation , e.g. when that element is inserted into the document .
The purpose of defining an event loop is to unify the definition of things that happen asychronously .
( I want to avoid saying " events " since that term is already overloaded . )
For example , if an image defines an onload callback function , exactly when does it get called ?
Questions like this are now answered in terms of adding tasks to a queue and processing them in an event loop .
The other major news this week is the addition of the hashchange event , which occurs when the user clicks an in - page link that goes somewhere else on the same page , or when a script programmatically sets the location .
hash property .
This is primarily useful for AJAX applications that wish to maintain a history of user actions while remaining on the same page .
As a concrete example , executing a search of your messages in GMail takes you to a list of search results , but does not change the base URL , just the hash ; clicking the Back button takes you back to the previous view within GMail ( such as your inbox ) , again without changing the base URL ( just the hash ) .
GMail employs some nasty hacks to make this work in all browsers ; the hashchange event is designed to make those hacks slightly less nasty .
Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 pioneered the hashchange event , and its definition in HTML 5 is designed to match Internet Explorer 's behavior .
Other interesting changes this week :
In last week 's episode , I mentioned revision 2063 , which allows HTML documents to contain both xml:lang and lang attributes as long as they are identical .
Revision 2091 relaxes this restriction slightly to allow the xml:lang and lang attributes to differ by case ( i.e. one could be uppercase and the other could be lowercase , and that is no longer an error ) .
Discussion : xml:lang= " " and lang= " "
documents to contain both and attributes as long as they are identical .
Revision 2091 relaxes this restriction slightly to allow the and attributes to differ by case ( i.e. one could be uppercase and the other could be lowercase , and that is no longer an error ) .
Discussion : xml:lang= " " and lang= " "
Revision 2092 defines the parsing algorithm for empty table rows .
Revision 2094 clarifies the meaning of whitespace by deferring to the Unicode definitions .
Revision 2096 forbids content sniffing for SVG images .
In order to use an SVG image in an < img src= " " > attribute , the web server must ensure that the SVG image is served with a Content - Type : image / svg+xml HTTP header .

FRESNO , California ( Reuters ) - A top adviser to Republican presidential candidate John McCain apologized on Monday after he was quoted as saying a September 11 - type attack before the November election would benefit McCain .

The campaign of Democrat Barack Obama condemned the remark by McCain political adviser Charlie Black , calling it a “ complete disgrace . ”
“ I deeply regret the comments , they were inappropriate , ” Black said in a statement after McCain said that if Black had made such a comment , “ I strenuously disagree ” with it .
“ I recognize that John McCain has devoted his entire adult life to protecting his country and placing its security before every other consideration , ” said Black , one of McCain ’s most trusted political advisers .
Fortune magazine said Black , in discussing how national security was McCain ’s strong suit , had said when asked about another terrorist attack on U.S. soil that “ certainly it would be a big advantage to him . ”
Black ’s comment to Fortune was a distraction for McCain as he seeks to catch up to Obama in the polls , where Obama leads by about 6 percentage points .
“ The fact that John McCain ’s top adviser says that a terrorist attack on American soil would be a ‘ big advantage ’ for their political campaign is a complete disgrace , and is exactly the kind of politics that needs to change , ” Obama spokesman Bill Burton said .
Massachusetts Democratic Sen. John Kerry , who lost to President George W. Bush in the 2004 election based largely on who would make the country safer , said Black ’s comment smacked of “ the worst of the Rove - Bush fear playbook , ” a reference to Bush ’s former political adviser , Karl Rove .
A McCain campaign official said Black did not remember making the particular comment to Fortune but did not dispute the characterization .
The official said Black was speaking in the context that any day on the campaign trail that the theme was national security , was a good day for McCain .
McCain , asked about the magazine article at a news conference , distanced himself from the comment .
“ I can not imagine why he would say it .
It ’s not true , ” McCain said , adding he had worked hard since the September 11 attack to prevent another such attack .

Police say the men stuffed stolen items into a pink rucksack
Colorado police say two suspected robbers dubbed the " thong bandits " , after they used women 's underwear to disguise themselves , have been caught .
The two men used skimpy underwear as masks , but much of their faces remained visible in a CCTV tape broadcast across the US state .
Nineteen - year - old Joaquin Rico and his 24 - year - old alleged accomplice , Joseph R Espinoza , both turned themselves in .
Police in Arvada say the men stole cash and cigarettes from a shop in May .
The two were unarmed but reportedly hit a shop assistant and injured her .
One man wore a green thong and the other wore blue .
The garments barely covered the men's features , leaving most of their faces exposed .
DIGG THIS
In late 2007 , Richard Stengel wrote a cover story for Time magazine calling for a massive national service program to be imposed on American young people .
If you ’d like to read it , knock yourself out .
Someone probably needs to smash it , but the avalanche of propaganda and nationalism you ’ll find there was too demoralizing for me to attempt it .
The very idea that helping someone in your neighborhood should be called " service to the nation " should be spooky and Orwellian enough , but for many people I guess it is n’t .
One thing I could n’t get out of my head , even though it ’s not by any means the weirdest aspect of the program , is Stengel ’s proposal for a Cabinet - level Department of National Service .
I think it was this piece of advice that struck me the most : " And do n’t appoint a gray bureaucrat to this job ; make it someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Mike Bloomberg , who would capture the imagination of the public . "
Translation : the American people , too stupid to engage in government - approved service projects without being prodded by their betters , need a crowd - pleasing Hollywood actor to rouse them to action .
Bloomberg , possibly the dullest human being in public life , would be a better choice than Schwarzenegger from my point of view : the American people would barely be able to keep awake through one of his droning appeals .
The issue has become especially important because Democratic nominee Barack Obama has embraced national service as a priority of his presidency should he win .
Obama would not directly impose forced labor on young people , but would instead withhold educational funds from them and their institutions if they fail to comply .
( Yes , they should n’t be taking these funds in the first place , but there is something sinister in Obama ’s program all the same . )
We should , he says , " set a goal for all American middle and high school students to perform 50 hours of service a year , and for all college students to perform 100 hours of service a year . "
That ’s not quite Stengel ’s proposed year to which morose and resentful young people would be sentenced to " volunteer " against their will , but it ’s a start , and federal programs do n’t exactly have a record of contracting once they get off the ground .
This is not just an Obama problem ; Republican John McCain supports " volunteerism " funded by Washington , and just about everyone believes in the federal government ’s power to conscript Americans into the armed forces .
One way or another , whether it ’s the empire ’s welfare or warfare division , they have no compunctions about making you do what they want .
Not that anyone cares , but just where in the Constitution ( that some people laughingly pretend limits Washington ’s power ) is there mention of a power to drive American citizens into involuntary service to the federal government ?
Kevin Gutzman and I ask the question in our new book , Who Killed the Constitution ?
The point of our book is not so much to wring our hands over the poor Constitution and dream about how wonderful it would be to return to it ( as much of an improvement as that would surely be ) .
The point , as in this example , is to show how government really works , in contrast to the pristine model kids learn in " social studies . "
Alleged restrictions like the Constitution pose no restraints on government at all , which merely interprets them out of existence .
This process is not only fascinating in its own right , but it also speaks volumes about the nature of government , which is why we wrote a book about it .
For example , the Thirteenth Amendment seems clear enough :
Section 1 . Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the United States , or any place subject to their jurisdiction .
Section 2 . Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation .
Very simple : there can be no involuntary servitude in the United States except in the case of those convicted of crimes .
Right ?
Let ’s see what happened when the Supreme Court finally took up the issue .
Although Chief Justice Roger Taney had written a memorandum on the subject in 1863 , dismantling the government ’s case for conscription point by point before the future Thirteenth Amendment had even been drafted , it was not until what became known as the Selective Draft Law Cases of 1917 that the Court took up the question formally .
The defendants in these cases had refused to present themselves for the draft , enacted by the Conscription Act of 1917 , when President Woodrow Wilson called on them to do so .
They asserted that the draft law was unconstitutional on various grounds , among them that the Constitution had not given Congress a draft power .
Lower courts upheld their convictions .
Chief Justice Edward
White ’s views on the subject were relatively unsurprising .
" As the mind can not conceive an army without the men to compose it , " he wrote , " on the face of the Constitution , the objection that it does not give power to provide for such men would seem to be too frivolous for further notice . "
So if government has the power to raise armies , it therefore has the power to raise them by any means whatever , including by forcing people to serve .
( I guess that falls under the " necessary and proper " clause . )
White pointed to " the almost universal legislation " allowing conscription around the world as evidence against the claim that the U.S. government lacked this power .
He provided citations to the draft laws recently in effect in Argentina , the Austro - Hungarian Empire , the Belgian Empire , Brazil , the Bulgarian monarchy , Bolivia , Colombia , Chile , the Chinese Empire , the Danish monarchy , Ecuador , the French Empire , the Greek monarchy , the German Empire , Guatemala , Honduras , the Italian monarchy , the Japanese Empire , Mexico , the Yugoslav monarchy , the Dutch Empire , Nicaragua , the Norwegian monarchy , Peru , the Portuguese monarchy , the Rumanian monarchy , the Russian Empire , the Siamese monarchy , the Spanish Empire , Switzerland , El Salvador , the Ottoman Empire , Canada , and South Africa .
In short , the examples of Asian and European imperial republics ( such as France ) and monarchies of various stripes , South Africa , Switzerland , the Windsor Dominion of Canada , and a number of Latin American banana republics were marshaled by Chief Justice White to disprove the assertion that Americans were supposed to be free .
Daniel Webster , speaking half a century before the Thirteenth Amendment was added to the Constitution , argued in a memorable speech for the unconstitutionality of the draft :
Is this the real character of our Constitution ?
No , sir , indeed it is not .
The Constitution is libeled .
The people of this country have not established for themselves such a fabric of despotism .
They have not purchased at a vast expense of their own treasure and their own blood a Magna Carta to be slaves .
Where is it written in the Constitution , in what article or section is it contained , that you may take children from their parents , and parents from their children , and compel them to fight the battles of any war in which the folly or the wickedness of government may engage it ?
Under what concealment has this power lain hidden which now for the first time comes forth , with a tremendous and baleful aspect , to trample down and destroy the dearest rights of personal liberty ?
Who will show me any Constitutional injunction which makes it the duty of the American people to surrender everything valuable in life , and even life itself , not when the safety of their country and its liberties may demand the sacrifice , but whenever the purposes of an ambitious and mischievous government may require it ?
Sir , I almost disdain to go to quotations and references to prove that such an abominable doctrine has no foundation in the Constitution of the country .
It is enough to know that that instrument was intended as the basis of a free government , and that the power contended for is incompatible with any notion of personal liberty .
That ’s not quite what the Supreme Court would say , just over a century later , in the Selective Draft Law Cases .
There , the possibility that anyone could describe forced labor in the service of the central state ’s military ambitions as involuntary servitude is indignantly dismissed without even the pretense of an argument .
That is , unless you consider this an argument : it ’s an honor to serve the government , and an honor cannot be involuntary servitude .
It is a " supreme and noble duty " to fight what Daniel Webster called " the battles of any war in which the folly or wickedness of government may engage , " so we ’ll have none of this Thirteenth Amendment nonsense !
Here are Chief Justice
White ’s exact words :
Finally , as we are unable to conceive upon what theory the exaction by government from the citizen of the performance of his supreme and noble duty of contributing to the defense of the rights and honor of the nation as the result of a war declared by the great representative body of the people can be said to be the imposition of involuntary servitude in violation of the prohibitions of the Thirteenth Amendment , we are constrained to the conclusion that the contention to that effect is refuted by its mere statement .
So Justice
White is so appalled by the comparison of conscription to involuntary servitude that he declares , without argument , that it refutes itself .
Well , that ’s all I need to hear .
The defendants must have marched out of the courtroom in shame when they heard that .
As usual , Ron Paul gets to the heart of things : " Young people are not raw material to be employed by the political class on behalf of whatever fashionable political , military , or social cause catches its fancy .
In a free society , their lives are not the playthings of government . "
No kind of conscription , whether on behalf of the welfare or the warfare sectors of the imperial capital , can be reconciled with freedom .
Nor can it be reconciled with the Constitution .
But those who govern us laugh with contempt at such arguments .
And yet Americans persist in the delusion that they have a Constitution that limits their government .
There is something deeply pathological about this .
What else can be said ?

If there 's one thing most people know about solar cells , it 's that they are too expensive .
Now , MIT researchers think they may have found a way to double the performance of solar arrays with cheap dyed glass and some tricks borrowed from fiber optics .
Their so - called solar concentrator could be placed on top of existing solar arrays .
It could capture some wavelengths of visible light and guide them to high - voltage solar cells on the edges of the array , while still allowing the infrared light that largely powers current solar systems to pass through .
" If you stick one of these on top of existing solar panels , we think we could nearly double the performance of these systems with minimal added cost , " said Marc Baldo , the lead researcher on the work .
The new research , published tomorrow in the journal Science , is another major advance in solar energy , a field that 's received renewed interest due to concerns about climate change and rising fossil fuel prices .
The new MIT technology marries the science behind two of the most promising ways of harnessing solar energy : light concentrators and thin - film solar cells .
Companies like SolFocus , which has raised $ 95 million , are using mirrors to concentrate sunlight on small amounts of photovoltaic cells .
They can generate a lot of power , but rely on expensive sun-tracking mirrors .
Another hot research area of solar research is thin - film solar , which uses dyes to print solar cells on cheap plastic .
Putting the two technologies together could be a new way of making solar power cheaper .
Current PV generation costs about 20 cents per kilowatt hour , several times more expensive than coal , wind and natural gas power generation .
If Baldo 's technology scales up and can get past the inevitable engineering hurdles , it could help drive that kilowatt hour price closer to the market price for electricity , which would undoubtedly drive uptake .
" If they can solve the engineering issues , then this would very much help with the efficiency and cost of solar cells , " said Marc Bünger , research director at Lux Research .
Baldo 's concentrators consist of a simple piece of glass coated with dye .
The glass concentrates the sun 's rays by directing light almost like a fiber optic cable does .
Sunlight enters the glass and is absorbed by the dyed molecules in the glass .
When the dye molecules reemit the energy , it enters waveguides that send the waves to the edges of the glass .
Fundamentally , Baldo said that his organic concentrators , so named because their dyes contain carbon , help solve a fundamental problem that solar arrays have had :
They have two very different functions that require different types of materials .
" Solar cells have got to absorb light and generate electricity and what we tried to do was separate those functions , " Baldo said .
" It does n't make sense to use a really beautiful electronic material like silicon in huge fields to absorb light .
Lots of things can absorb light , like paint . "
Using a cheaper material to do the light absorbing allows the most efficient energy generating materials to be used in much smaller quantities .
Beyond driving costs down , the see - through nature of his technology means that it could integrated into buildings or products .
That gets designers and architects excited but Baldo 's not so sure that 's the most effective way of deploying the concentrators .
" You could put them on plastic and roll it up .
You can tune the color to what you 'd like .
Architects get really excited about this stuff , " Baldo said .
" But as an engineer , I 'm not sure how cost effective it is to to do solar windows . "
Because the technology is simple and inexpensive , Baldo thinks it will be easy to manufacture and could be deployed in the field within three years .
Towards that end , colleagues of his at MIT have spun out a new company , Covalent Solar , to commercialize the technology .
" No nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over Europe and the events of August have shown the critical importance of diversifying our energy supply , " he said .
" With states such as Russia increasingly using their energy resources as policy tools it is apparent that the security grounds for this shift are stronger as well . "

MANILA , July 30 ( Reuters ) -
Two groups submitted formal bids at an auction for the sale of two geothermal plants on the Philippines ’ main island of Luzon , the government said on Wednesday .
The groups which submitted bids for 289 - megawatt Tiwi and 458.53 megawatt Makban geothermal facilities were AP Renewables of the Aboitiz Group and First Luzon Geothermal Energy , an investment vehicle fully owned by PNOC - Energy Development Corp EDC .
PS .
Korea Electric Power Corp ( KEPCO ) 015760.KS , which was on an earlier list of bidders , has withdrawn from the auction , said an official of PSALM , the state agency overseeing the sale of government power plants .
PSALM will announce the highest bidder later on Wednesday .
There have been no details of the auction ’s floor price .
The auction initially attracted nine investors acoording to PSALM .
One of the most frequently asked questions about Senate procedure these days is , WTF with these " holds ? "
Or more accurately , " How come Harry Reid blew off Chris Dodd 's hold on the FISA bill , but Tom Coburn gets to have 100 bills on hold and nobody bats an eyelash ? "
Well , aside from the fact that eyelashes are , in fact , now batting on the Coburn holds , it seems clear that not all holds are created equal .
Here 's my attempt to explain why .
I tried making this more formal , but it just kept getting bogged down .
So here it is , quick and dirty , pretty much the way I discussed it with a friend in e-mail .
Holds , like everything in the Senate , actually have a lot of moving parts .
When you put a hold on a bill , the Majority Leader does a private mental calculus , sometimes informed by other political intelligence , whip counts , outright threats , or what have you , and sometimes not .
It goes something like this :
A Senator tells Reid ( or tells McConnell to tell Reid ) he wants to put a hold on a bill .
Reid asks himself whether enough people give a shit about the bill for him to spend the amount of time it 's going to take either to : 1 ) figure out how many Senators give a shit , or ; 2 ) go through the process of voting on it despite the hold .
Why might Reid want to go through the process of voting on it despite the hold ?
Well , he might not want to , per se , but the job of Majority Leader in the Senate is different from that of Majority Leader in the House in that in the House , bills come to the floor backed by a decision of a majority .
That is , bills that come to the floor under a rule have already had a vote in which some majority has said they want it there .
So majorities routinely tell the minority that it 's tough luck if they do n't like it , it 's coming anyway .
In the Senate , the normal mode of bringing something to the floor is by unanimous consent .
That 's where the hold comes from .
It 's just an indication to the Majority Leader , whose job it is to keep the schedule moving , that a Senator will , if necessary , object to a unanimous consent request to bring the bill to the floor .
Now , that 's not the only way bills get to the Senate floor .
It 's just the preferred way .
Because if you have a unanimous consent agreement , you can build the equivalent of a House rule into it -- how much debate time will there be , how many amendments , which ones , and so forth .
But if you do n't have such an agreement , then everything 's under the Senate 's very open debate rules , including the possibility of a filibuster .
If the Senate agrees to a unanimous consent agreement limiting debate time before bringing a bill to the floor , it can't be filibustered after that .
Without the agreement , there 's a danger of filibuster .
So if one Senator says he 'll object to a unanimous consent agreement , it 's also an implied signal that if the Majority Leader brings the bill to the floor anyway , the objecting Senator may filibuster .
Now the Majority Leader starts calculating .
One Senator filibustering all by himself is a pain in the ass , but nobody can stay on their feet forever .
And if the filibustering Senator sits down and stops talking , the floor is open to make a motion that the Senate immediately proceed to a vote .
So the next question is , does he have allies ?
Will they also stay on their feet for hours or even days at a time if necessary ?
How many allies are there ?
Enough so that nobody will really even have to work all that hard , and can just take , say , a two hour shift and keep the debate going forever ?
Or more importantly , does he have so many allies that the Majority Leader would lose a cloture vote ?
In considering this , the calculation has to include not only how many allies the Senator has on the substantive issues , but also how many Senators would support the filibuster just to screw with the Majority Leader ?
Or because they have a hold on something too , and need the other Senator 's support for it ?
The other calculation is about time .
If the schedule is busy , and especially if there are any deadlines looming , even a failed filibuster with no allies at all can ruin your week .
If the Majority Leader can't get a unanimous consent agreement , his only other choice if he wants to move the bill is to make a motion to proceed to consider .
That 's just a motion that the Senate start debate on whatever the bill is .
The problem is that the motion to proceed is itself subject to a filibuster .
So the same calculations have to be made .
Even if the Senator is almost entirely alone , getting a bill to the floor is a pain in the ass .
Because the motion to proceed is subject to a filibuster , the Majority Leader will make the motion and then immediately file a motion for cloture on the motion to proceed .
That 's because a cloture motion must , by rule , wait two days before there can be a vote on it .
So it 's two days from making the motion to proceed before you can even have a vote on whether or not to vote on that motion to proceed .
Then , even if you trounce the objecting Senator in the cloture vote , the rules also allow up to 30 hours of post - cloture debate , if the objecting Senator (s ) choose to claim them .
So all told , it can take 78 hours of Senate time to overcome the objections of a Senator with a hold .
And that 's just to get to the start of debate on the bill , which will itself then be subject to a filibuster .
As would all amendments to the bill .
If the objecting Senator is still making a stink , you 'll want to file for cloture on the bill , too , which means waiting the same 78 hours to get that over with .
So it can take a full week of the Senate 's time to get to a vote on a bill that 's being held -- and that 's only if there are no amendments to it .
If there are amendments and you file for cloture as soon as the actual bill 's debate starts , it can have the effect of precluding debate on amendments , because once cloture is invoked on the bill , that ends debate , including debate on amendments .
And some of those amendments are going to be things you and your colleagues want to vote on .
You might even find that if you file cloture right away , some Senators who have important amendments but oppose the filibuster will vote no on cloture anyway , just so that they can get a chance to offer and debate their amendments .
So you can't file cloture right away .
Instead you have to let debate on the amendments begin .
And if the objecting Senator just wants to blow up the whole thing , he can filibuster the amendments , and then again you take three days to get to a vote on that amendment .
And so on , and so on , and so on .
Of course , someone in the position that Senator Dodd was in last December might want to filibuster the motion to proceed , and filibuster the underlying bill at the end of the process .
But he would n't want to filibuster his own amendment to strip the immunity provisions from the FISA bill .
In fact , a lot of Senators who opposed Dodd 's amendment and supported the bill probably wanted to file cloture on the whole bill right away , so that very few if any amendments could have been considered .
In the negotiations preceding consideration of the bill , then , that provided leverage for the other side in getting concessions back from Dodd .
For instance , the 60 vote requirement for passage of certain amendments might have been something that Dodd found he had to agree to , just to get the other Senators to agree not to file for cloture on the whole bill right away , thereby preserving his opportunity to offer his immunity - stripping amendment .
So the rules actually do n't allow a single Senator to simply block a bill forever just by putting a hold on it .
But the practical effect of a hold and the threat it implies -- depending on how many allies the Senator has to help him hold the floor -- is that the Senate may have to spend weeks on end dealing with this one bill and its amendments .
And if it 's a dumb - ass bill that nobody really needs to pass , even if it would be nice to have it , the Majority Leader 's mental calculus on the question of should he tell the holding Senator to go jump in the lake , is an immediate " no . "
It sucks , but it 's better just to " honor " the hold and not bother with the time they would waste pushing this bill through .
That 's the case with some of what Coburn held .
Everybody wanted to pass them , they were very popular ( i.e. , not " dumb-ass " at all ) , but ultimately nobody wanted to spend a whole week on it .
With Dodd and FISA , the situation was different .
A large majority of the Senate wanted to pass it , did n't much care if it took two weeks to do it , and felt it was a reasonable trade - off to have to do it , since the Protect America
Act was " expiring " and they 'd just have to bite the bullet and be bored for two weeks .
Once that became clear , the question was whether Reid should take the responsibility of making the motion to proceed , or whether he should refuse on principle , only to see Rockefeller make it and win it over Reid 's objections ( assuming he really was opposed to it ) .
Staying on top as Majority Leader is a delicate balance .
The Senate Democratic Caucus is relatively small , and it's filled with egos who all believe they could and should be Majority Leader instead of you .
So you want to avoid situations where sizable majorities of your own caucus side with someone else and override you because they perceive you as standing in the way of their voting on a bill that they think will save their asses from Republican attacks .
If you get between them and the magic potion they think will win them reelection , they will find themselves a Majority Leader who wo n't do that to them .
So Reid counts the votes , sees that it 's inevitable that this bill is coming to the floor in three days or less , and he can either sacrifice his leadership position on that altar , or read the writing on the wall and move it to the floor and vote against it if he does n't like it .
And that 's the story of the Senatorial hold .
But keep in mind that that whole thing is too complex for any traditional media reporter to write about .
No editor would ever give a reporter that much space to explain something that complex , when he 's supposed to be covering the actual bill .
Instead , it 's much easier to just tell people that a hold can magically keep a bill off the floor forever , since in the overwhelming number of cases , that 's what the practical effect of it looks like from the outside .
So people get used to believing that , and then are stunned when a hold they actually favor goes the other way .
And that 's why blogs were invented , and people like them better than newspapers .
The end .
One of my email update list members in Australia sent me an excellent article and I sent it on to Jeff Rense to be posted .
This is excellent information , folks , so I suggest you might want to read the article link below and my article as well , so you have the full and complete picture .
http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=9614
Where I 'm from , people would say that the US of A is getting what we call a ' Suthern - style ass - whuppin ' as to its dreams of global oil and gas hegemony .
That is where the high , mighty and arrogant get taken out behind the barn and get the galvanized crap stomped out of them to achieve an ' attitude adjustment . '
That is what 's happening right now but Americans will not hear a peep about it from Washington DC or the MSM .
The illusion must be kept alive by ignoring the harsh facts of reality , and not letting the American citizens know how bad things really are .
And they are REAL bad .
This article linked above pertains to the recent G8 meeting in Hokkaido Japan and how the US ( Bush ) tried to snub , offend and belittle new Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at those meetings .
Little Lord Bush putting the new Russian president in his place in front of the rest of the G8 members .
Medvedev proposed an excellent idea to the EU but it was not " a Bush idea " and therefore it was not acceptable to US policy .
Timed with the G8 meeting , the US sent the ' little Black Poodle " , Condoleezza Rice , out globe - trotting to piss on the feet of the Russian Bear , yapping all the way like the useless appendate she is .
They even scheduled DoD military exercises in Georgia for most of July to provide plenty of photo ops for the Bush­Rice road show and carny act .
Folks , Russia 's Gazprom is the world 's largest natural gas company and Dmitry Medvedev used to be the head of that company prior to becoming President Medvedev of Russia .
This is not a man to have his shoes peed upon ... but Bush and Condi just do n't get it .
Medvedev now controls Gazprom from the Kremlin since it is mostly " state - owned " .
Gazprom is a major Russian weapon in economic and energy terms .
At the rate they are growing , Gazprom may well be THE natural gas powerhouse supplying most of the Eastern Hemisphere in twenty years or less .
They are growing THAT fast .
Meanwhile , our idiot leaders , and those in UK , cannot complete anything .
All talk , no substance , nothing delivered but mayhem , hot air and excuses , and one useless photo op after another .
But soil Medvedev they did - both Bush at the G8 , and then Rice in the Czech Republic and Georgia .
The Gazprom juggernaut has made major gains since 9 - 11 in Europe , the Caspian Basin , North Africa , and other areas of Africa - while BushCo keeps scheduling one useless press conference after another and announcing nothing ... because it has nothing to announce !
Almost 8 years , our ' leaders ' remain stuck on STUPID while foundering in rampant arrogance and incompetence .
Thatis the Bush Administration and the legacy he will leave behind for America when he goes ' off his watch ' .
Whether we get Obama or McCain next , there will be no change , just more stuck on stupid , while the rest of the world marches forward .
Whichever one of these turkeys does ' win ' the November election , he is going to wish he had n't .
The next president of the United States will get 4 or 8 years of dealing mountains of Bush / Cheney dirty diapers , and worldwide hatred and blowback due to the Bush policy of war , genocide , and supreme arrogance .
First Rice went to the Czech Republic to " seal the deal " on the totally useless Bush Missile ' Defense ' Shield .
That bogus ' defense shield ' is clearly and blatantly an OFFENSIVE threat to Russian strategic missile forces and cannot possibly stop anything from Iran , if , when and " never " Iran were to attack the EU .
Out in the real world , it is a simple fact of life that many of the EU nations get a very large percentage of their energy from Iran .
Their biggest " utility company " is Russia .
No nation is going to launch missiles at some of its biggest customers .
Another Bush lie if one digs just 1 inch deep past the hollow rhetoric .
Hint : Russia and Iran recently signed a mega - deal on oil and natural gas and no matter what Bush or the US does , Iranian natural gas and oil will still be powering the EU along with Russia even if it has to flow through Russia to get there .
That is a fact of life in the EU .
Bush and Blair have delivered absolutely nothing but hot air ... and not the kind that heats homes or power cars and industry .
Russia has already made it clear they will counter the Bush Missile Shield follymilitarily .
Make no mistake , there are many millions of very unhappy people in Europe because Bush is such a juvenile punk that he would be so offensive and confrontational with Russia since he can't get his way in Iraq or Afghanistan or the Caspian Basin , nor can he attack Iran as he and Israel long to do .
The Russians have already cut the Czech Republic oil supplies by 50 % to remind them who heats their homes and powers their economy and cars .
It is not the fault of Russia or Iran that George W Bush is a colossall failure .
W is the sole reason for his failures and needs no help from anyone in creating them .
He is ' The Decider ' - always decisive ... and always wrong .
Wake up to reality , America .
These people in DC are nothing less than criminally psychotic and stupid .
And they are certifiably insane if they think they are the true leaders of this world .
The world laughs and mocks our leaders and has no intentions of kneeling to them .
We were also treated to our utterly useless Secretary of State jetting over to Georgia to assure the world that the US is 100 % behind Georgia and its membership bid in NATO .
During her little tour was when Iran launched those test missiles ... which , of course , caused the little Black Poodle to schedule another press conference to reiterate to the world that the US was 100 % behind Israel , too .
Since the " world 's only purported Superpower " has proven itself impotent and has accomplished exactly nothing since 9 - 11 , most of the world knows that the words of Bush , Cheney and Rice are not worth the price of a cup of coffee .
Folks , ugly is getting uglier by the day for America and its Grand Chessboardfor its Global ' War on Terror= ' ... for its Oil , Gas and Pipeline Follies which have now reached the point of being far beneath even the worst theater .
Their grand scheme is a complete and total failure .
Bush does not want to admit it ; Bush and Congress do not want Americans to wake up to the realities or the gravity of the situation .
It would be comical if the long - term implications were not such that the United States of America is soon going to find itself mired in nothing but " stupid debt " - wasted and plundered for the fraudulent Global War on Terror .
To add insult to injury , now they intend to lead the bailout of the Zionist banksters on home mortgage fraud , derivatives and stupid bets , sucking the US economy into Second or Third World Status like a Black Hole due to the myopia and sheer incompetence , arrogance , fraud , and stupidity our leaders .
The party is over and it is time to pay the tab .
The only problem is the macho revelers are all broke .
I remember back in the third grade being forced to learn all of the US states , capitals , rivers , mountain ranges , and where they were on the map , etc .
I always had this nagging question in back of my mind ­ " Why do I need to know this ?
For trivia pop quizzes in the future ? "
Over time one learns that maps are a ' good thing ' and if you cannot read them you certainly cannot win a war .
Especially a contrived war launched right square into a landlocked area and the Grand Chessboard plan is trapped , doomed from inception .
Only a complete idiot can lose a chess game in three moves ( 9 - 11 / Afghanistan , Iraq , bogus Global War on Terror aimed at the religion of the people you are trying to rob , chess game is over ) .
The pace of the news , including bad news for America , has picked up considerably this year .
It is either like the difference between gentle waves on the beach versus a mile high tsunami inbound , or the difference between a gentle breeze and an F5 tornado right square in the face of every American .
The tempo is way up and the bad news is spreading faster than a California wildfire .
I have been watching and most US news sources are predictably silent on some major things , less they spook the American Sheeple into a stampede .
Why is the US so behind Georgia , and so desirous of making Georgia the next member of NATO ?
Even with a cursory look at a map one can learn that it is on the east end of the Black Sea as far away from the North Atlantic and Europe as it can be .
But it is of " national strategic significance " to the US ?
I submit it is actually only significanct to save George Bush 's butt before he leaves office .
Big Oil has many billions on the line and already invested in the Caspian Basin and thus far , the Great Decider has delivered nothing but nightmares and bad news for America .
And mass death in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The fact that Barack Obama is raising much more money than John McCain suggests to me that many of these big major corporations are already backing up from the abyss , preparing to take massive hits , and at the same time demanding Bush get off his arrogant ass and fix his mess .
This idiot in the Oval Office is like a bad dream that just will not go away .
When I see Bush on TV , the only words that come to mind any more are ' pathetic ' and ' despicable . '
Study this map of the REAL Caspian Basin region for a moment and then pick up again below the map .
If you did memorize that map and are unemployed , apply to either DIA , DoD , CIA or the White House for a job because they apparently have no one there who can read that map .
First off , the Caspian Sea is bordered by only five ( 5 ) nations ; Azerbaijan , Iran , Turkmenistan , Kazakhstan and Russia ; the only ally of that bunch being Azerbaijan .
Little Georgia is primarily bordered by The Great Bear of Russia on the north and little Christian Armenia and Islamic Azerbaijan to the south .
That is why our little poodle Secretary of State had to rush over to Georgia and piss on the feet of the Bear and yap like the good little doglet she is .
That was after going to the Czech Republic , too .
regarding that obvious strategic threat to Russia and yet another photo op .
Meanwhile , as I mentioned previously , Bush could not resist insulting the new Russian president at the G8 meetings .
Trust me .
this was all timed just for the G8 meetings .
Now that you have memorized that map of how things are really situated around the Caspian Sea / Caspian Basin " mother lode " of oil and natural gas , remember what I have written about recently .
The US plans to cross the Caspian Sea from Kazakhstan or Turkmenistan , through Azerbaijan , through Georgia to get a pipeline through to the Black Sea so they can finally declare " Mission Accomplished " on something , other than idle photo op rhetoric - thus far confined pretty much to the essence of nothingness .
They tried in March 2008 to manipulate the Armenia elections so they could route the pipeline through Azerbaijan , Armenia and Turkey to get to the Black Sea ( and the Mediterranean ) but failed to achieve the " CIA objective " .
When the CIA brats threw a ' mission specific tantrum ' and tried to stir up an Orange Revolution ( because they failed ) it was immediately put down and Armenia is still aligned with Russia and Iran , not the US .
So , Georgia is on the ' hot seat ' for a Bush Co pipeline , since the US planners managed to " hem themselves in " and cannot get a pipeline from Turkmenistan , through Afghanistan and Pakistan to the ocean .
Georgia is their only other way out , unless , and I emphasize " unless " they change policies and route it south across IRAN to the ocean .
Most of us saw the recent news that the US intends to open a ' diplomatic mission ' in Tehran .
Had our Great Decider taken that step in 2001 instead of waiting until the end of his pathetic 8 years in office , there would have not been a need to do September 11 , 2001 .
Since this Diplomatic Mission reverses almost 30 years of hostile US policy towards Iran , it shows how desperate the Bush Administration truly is at this time .
Since the US has managed to stir up a hornet 's nest in both Afghanistan and Pakistan ( ruling out the pipeline from Turkmenistan to the ocean ) and since the US cannot seem to resist offending Russia , Iran might be its only way out of the mess BushCo has made of things .
Russia could crush tiny Georgia in about 24 hours if they so wished .
Putting a pipeline through there is not strategically safe if they persist in angering and insulting Russia over and over again .
Most Bears are pretty patient , until they are provoked into action .
And then things get ugly , fast .
Almost 7 years and trillions of dollars wasted and the BushCo war /s have accomplished nothing other thank mayhem , mass death , maiming and human suffering and destruction on an enormous scale .
On top of that , the US has destabilized the entire world because a weak US dollar equals very high oil prices .
The more debt they keep piling upon debt , the weaker the dollar gets .
It is bad enough what they have already done in wasted money ( trillions of unnecessary war debt ) and have destroyed the value of the dollar and the overall integrity of the United States .
Once they bail out Wall Street , the banks , the mortgage companies - and leave the rest of America flapping in the breeze - the dollar will get weaker ( due to debt on debt on trillions of debt ) and drive up oil prices more .
I am not sure what you know about economics , but basically we are financing our own demise through needless debt and financial greed and imbecility .
High oil prices are fueling the growth of others entities , and gutting America like being skinned with a dull deer antler .
What is really sad are so many lost opportunities , and that someone in the US thought pulling off September 11 , 2001 was a good way to get what they wanted .
There are days I swear the USA must have Forrest Gump in charge of strategic planning for the CIA , DoD and the White House .
As Gump said , ' stupid is as stupid does . '
Of course , all of this poodle peeing , posturing and yapping is going on because , to this day , the US does not have a pipeline across Afghanistan , which is why they attacked Afghanistan in the first place , and blamed it on 9 - 11 .
The US still does not have a pipeline across Georgia .
They are still stuck in the mud and have no one to blame for that mess but themselves .
If you do not know what I am referring to , read the last article on Rense.com on that matter , and the first article in this recent series .
http://www.rense.com/general82/wounds.htm
http://www.rense.com/general82/decider.htm
They US has run into a problem that is potentially even more serious than Georgia and the incessant friction between US lies and the fake Global War on Terror , and Russia out - performing Bush with its eyes closed .
The Caspian Sea is a major source of food for that entire region and all of the nations , including US - controlled Azerbaijan ' object ' to the US running that pipeline across the Caspian Sea just to bail Bush 's imperial ass out of the fire he created .
This is a landlocked sea and a major oil spill would be a huge environmental catastrophe to the area and to the food supply of all the peoples in the area .
This would not be a small pipeline , it would be a large pipeline - and more than one since both oil and natural gas have to be transported to the ports for shipment .
If the US thugs can't get a pipeline across the Caspian Sea and through Georgia to the Black Sea , or get the pipeline from Turkmenistan through Afghanistan and Pakistan to the ocean , folks , everything in the Caspian Basin for the past 10 years will have been in total vain .
You may soon be reading about US and UK Big Oil having " liquidation sales " and talking huge multi-billion losses and write downs on their entire Grand Chessboard escapade if the US manages to screw up a deal with Iran like they have everything else in that region of the world .
Since they based the entire escapade on lies , deceit , the totally fraudulent Global War on Terror , I personally think we are about to get a bath in 'red ink ' that is well deserved , or there will be huge shifts in US policy coming that are long overdue .
I can hear the Likudists and Neocon Zionists screaming at the top of their lungs from thousands of miles away .
Some of them are about to go apoplectic that BushCo is going to have to cut a deal with Iran , whether any of them like it or not .
I sent out a map in an email update that is the current Bridas Corporation map ... that Argentina company just keeps marching right along .
The reason I used the simpler map in " The Pyrrhic Victory of The Great Decider " is so Americans could get the simple logistics issues of this " Pipeline War " clear in their heads .
Folks , we are not just losing this pipeline and energy war , the US is being routed .
It is like one of those football games when # 1 shows up to play an unknown and is humiliated in a 35 - 0 defeat .
That happens when # 1 arrogantly walks in thinking it is ' a walk in the park ' and the underdog shows up and crams a game plan and preparation down their throats .
That is what is happening to America right now .
This map tells a simple story .
We , the USA , are getting our asses kicked in the entire Caspian Basin area by a company from Argentina which is apparently getting along fine with everyone in the entire region .
http://www.bridascorp.com/
Bridas Corporation is now the main pipeline player in the entire Caspian Basin and Bush has yet to complete even 1 foot of a pipeline related to the Caspian Basin fiasco .
Meanwhile , Russia , Bridas and Iran have completed thousands of miles of pipelines and are rocking right along .
It has occurred to me many times that Bush should call Bridas if he wants to get a pipeline done .
But he cannot do that because then it would come out that they had Afghanistan under contract and Bush breached their contract with military force .
Bush cannot turn to Bridas without indicting himself for murder and treason , and war crimes .
The US did get one pipeline done from Azerbaijan through Turkey to the Mediterranean but that is ' Bush League ' compared to the Major League oil and gas reserves on the other side of the Caspian Sea .
On both the " current Bridas Corporation map " and in the GlobalResearch .ca article , it is also announced that Gazprom and Libya have just entered into a contract to run a pipeline across the Mediterranean to supply additional natural gas to the EU .
( Commercial contracts and pens decking the world 's purported ' only Superpower ' again and again . )
It is even worse than that .
Once it gets to the EU , if the US can ever get any oil or gas to the EU , the US will have lost that battle as well .
Said another way , the US " major market share " is now gone ... and in instead being supplied by Russia , Iran , Libya , Algeria , etc .
Ever since 9 - 11 , the US and UK have been the key proponents of the Nabucco pipeline into and across Europe .
Bush and Blair were promising a mother lode of oil and gas from the Caspian Basin , but ... they failed .
That is the ' red ' pipeline on the map below .
It is dead .
They have delivered nothing , not the financing , the oil and natural gas to put through it or even effectively assembled the team and right of way .
Too busy out lying about their fraudulent Global War on Terror and scurrying around to cover themselves on what are now their glaringly apparent lies , genocide and war crimes .
Hungary recently pulled out of Nabucco and joined the Russian pipeline consortium - the ' blue ' pipeline known as South Stream .
Austria is in the process of doing the same since their national energy company OMV was to be the terminal end of yet another failed Bush and Blair pipe dream .
Just to show you how presumptively and prematurely stupid our government truly is , note the red " Y " on the east end of proposed US " red " pipeline .
That upper part of the " Y " is Armenia as if they already had that in the bag , and do not .
These losers and morons make such erroneous assumptions because the US offered Armenia an arms deal ( declined ) and the CIA was over there to throw the election in the direction the US wanted it to be ( failed ) .
Meanwhile , the Blue Team Pipeline ( aka : Russia South Stream ) is moving forward without delay and , of course , has virtually unlimited oil and natural gas to deliver .
When the EU and Bush tried to put Kosovo independence in the way recently , Russia just walked around it and kept right on making progress .
Due to my business , I have to watch a lot more than just the US .
In fact , where I am and what I do ( nanotechnology , 8 nations ) necessitates that I watch just about everything but the US .
The only thing I watch regarding the US is what stupid thing are they going to do next in the Eastern Hemisphere and exacerbate an already screwed up game plan from the outset .
However , I am uniquely positioned to see how these plans have failed - and why .
It does not bode well for America and in hindsight , basing this entire fiasco on lies , schemes , etc has now proven to be profoundly incompetent .
When you add in that they triggered 9 - 11 so they could launch this stupidity , it is also murderous and treasonous in the extreme .
The policies of America are wrong - headed .
The leadership of America is far too pathetic to ever straighten out the mess they alone have created .
America is at that proverbial " Y " in the road and I am convinced the government will go the wrong way , it always does .
Either American citizens are going to have to fix it or they will bear the bitter , grueling consequences for many decades .
Karl
Charles and I were at a party recently when an acquaintance of his , Steve , started talking about a woman he'd slept with on a first date and described her as " a bit of a slut " .
I went nuclear .
While I do n't agree with calling anyone names , by his own logic he'd been a " slut " as well .
" Men are programmed to spread their seed , " he said , " but women should be monogamous because they can only produce one egg at a time . "
He mentioned a study that apparently revealed " evolution has not adapted women to having casual sex " because some women reported feeling " used " afterwards .
I think women would feel less remorse if there were fewer idiots like Steve out there .
Even Darwin knew females were n't monogamous .
Professor Tim Birkhead wrote in his book Promiscuity : An Evolutionary History of Sperm Competition and Sexual Conflict that Darwin was aware of instances in which females received sperm from more than one male .
But Darwin , being a Victorian , preferred writing about promiscuity among plants than human females .
Sleeping around may benefit women because of sperm competition – even if that involves sex with several different men in quick succession .
Men do flirt with me more when I 'm in a new relationship .
I thought that was a reaction to my exuding confidence and happiness .
But maybe there 's something more primal going on .
Biologist Olivia Judson writes that men shown explicit pictures of a woman with two men ( potential rivals ) produce a higher proportion of swimming sperm than men shown explicit pictures of three women .
I unintentionally had a chance to test the love - rival theory when I met Charles in town for a late lunch , which ended with us polishing off two bottles of wine and slipping back to his flat to eat dessert off each other .
With no time to shower , I emerged , legs still shaking , en route to my next meeting .
I met my TV producer friend for coffee , and he was very flirtatious , and asked if I 'd changed perfumes .
That afternoon , five men gave me their phone numbers .
I binned them .
I 'm choosing to be in a committed relationship .
Love is more than an evolutionary arms race .
But being monogamous is a choice for both sexes , because at the end of the day we all have animal instincts .
Maybe fear of being judged is also part of evolution .
I read recently researchers found that female chimps wanted sex with as many males as possible without other females finding out .
Hmm .
The row with Steve hotted up when he used the word " whore " .
I " accidentally " dumped a glass of red wine all over the crotch of his very expensive suit .
I felt horrible afterwards .
The bottle cost £ 23 .

For all the USA TODAY crossword addicts who were wondering , yes , the marriage proposal embedded in last week 's word puzzle was the real thing .
And she said yes .
The puzzle 's creator , Alex Fay , popped the question to his girlfriend , Lisa Stern , in clue 58 Across of the April 10 puzzle .
The clue : " Question that pops up . "
The life - changing solution : " WILLYOUMARRYME . "
COMMUNITY : Visit puzzles forum where readers made the find Fay , who does the crossword puzzle with his sweetheart every day , had been plotting the wordplay for four or five months before working up the nerve for his proposal .
" When I was trying to think of something that was personal and kind of fun , it just leapt into my mind , " Fay says .
" This is something we share , so I enjoyed being creative . "
He created the puzzle , his first ever , and sent it to Timothy Parker , who edits the daily feature for the newspaper .
Parker went along with the idea to set up the special moment for Fay , 26 , and Stern , 24 , of Atlanta .
Though the couple usually do the crossword puzzle at night , Fay could n't wait the entire day — not with the stakes so high .
He brought the puzzle and a vanilla latte — his future wife 's favorite — to her last Thursday morning .

As the couple worked their way through the puzzle , Stern says , she started to get a feeling something was up .
She had noticed a marriage theme in the clues , and she had the feeling something big was about to happen .
" He had this funny little smile on his face , " Stern says .
After about 20 minutes , Stern got to 58 Across .
There were just a few letters there , but she was able to complete the phrase .
And that 's when Fay got down to one knee and pulled out a ring .
" I was shocked , " Stern says .
" I knew he'd do something creative .
I did not think he would do something this big . "
Knowing his girlfriend does n't like the spotlight , Fay wanted to do something big but still be subtle .
" It was still our private moment , " Stern says .
" But it was nice it could be shared with other people , and it was nice because it was at my apartment . "
The proposal generated a lot of attention on the USA TODAY website over the weekend as crossword enthusiasts tried to find out if the proposal was the real thing .
Fay , who owns a tutoring service , and Stern , a high school guidance counselor , plan to be married next summer .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Al Qaeda ’s growing north Africa network plans to attack U.S. interests seeking control of the region ’s energy riches , its Algerian - based leader said in remarks published on Tuesday .

The network of militants from Mauritania to Libya sees U.S. interests as legitimate targets because Washington backed the region ’s “ criminal ” governments and stole Algerian oil , the New York Times quoted Abdelmalek Droukdel as saying .
“ We found America building military bases in the south of our country and conducting military exercises , and plundering our oil and planning to get our gas , ” Droukdel , also known as Abou Mossab Abdelouadoud , was quoted as saying .
“ Therefore , it became our right and our duty to ... declare clearly the American interests are legitimate targets . ”
OPEC member Algeria , Africa ’s second largest country , denies it has foreign military bases on its soil .
Asked whether his group planned attacks on U.S. soil , Droukdel replied , referring to the U.S. administration : “ Everyone must know that we will not hesitate in targeting it whenever we can and wherever it is on this planet . ”
He said Algeria ’s banking of its energy export receipts in U.S. and European financial institutions showed that the Algiers government served western interests .
He added that French , Spanish and “ Jewish ” interests were also targets .
The newspaper said Droukdel , believed to based in mountains east of Algiers , had given recorded audio replies to a list of questions submitted by the Times .
His voice had been verified as genuine by a private voice expert who works for federal agencies , the newspaper said .
Droukdel ’s group has links with like - minded militants in the region and is the most effective armed rebel organization in the OPEC member country of 33 million , which has been fighting an Islamist insurgency since 1992 .
He said his group had witnessed an awakening of jihad around the Maghreb , adding without elaborating that this included militants in sub-Saharan oil power Nigeria .
Attacks on U.S. interests have been rare in Algeria .
The most recent was the bombing of a bus carrying foreign oil workers near Algiers in December 2006 which killed an Algerian and a Lebanese and wounded four Britons and an American .
An explosives expert , Droukdel was appointed leader of an Islamist rebel group called the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat in 20094 , six years after it was founded with the aim of toppling the government and establishing purist Islamic state .
In October 2003 , the group offered its support to the al Qaeda network and in January 2007 the group changed its name to Al Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb .
Since then it has set off a string of deadly car bombings in and around Algiers , including bombings of United Nations and government buildings in Algiers that killed at least 41 people .
Droukdel said increasing numbers of young men around the region were joining the group out of persistent poverty and anger at what he called the West ’s war on Islam .
“ The large proportion of our mujahedeen ( holy war fighters ) comes from Algeria .
And there is a considerable number of Mauritanians , Libyans , Moroccans , Tunisians , Malians and Nigerians , ” he said , adding his group ’s efforts were linked to an attack on the Israeli embassy in Mauritania in February .
He played down reports that his men included significant numbers of north African jihadists who had returned to the region from helping fight U.S. troops in Iraq .
Instead , many of the recruits were people released from prison by the Algerian government since 2006 under a national reconciliation program , he said .
We ’re still open and operational as normal , obviously with strong measures to protect the health of both staff and customers .

Electric Star Wars Landspeeder is DIY Nerd - Dream
Not only is it electric , but it ’s a DIY Landspeeder !
Does it get any better than that ?
Daniel Deutsch used to work for Lucasfilm has been a long - time model - making enthusiast , and now he ’s spending his time putting together perfect R2D2 replicas and building electric Landspeeders .
With a top speed of 25 mph it ’s definitely no weekday commuter , but it ’s perfect for driving around town with the top down and confusing the neighbors .
I wish we had more information about the electric drive system , but according to Daniel it can go several miles on a single battery charge .
Because the frame is made of aluminum and the body fiber glass , we can safely assume it ’s fairly light , so it ’s possible that it could be operated using a beefy golf cart set up or something to that effect .
The fact that this is an electric vehicle is not only sweet , but goes well with those fond memories of Luke and Obi-Wan Kenobi buzzing across the sand on Tatooine .
Either way , I think nothing says it better than the “ White and Nerdy ” music overlay in the video on his homepage .

But some executives have arranged for the next best thing : huge corporate payouts to their heirs if they die in office .
Take Eugene Isenberg , the 78 - year - old chief executive of Nabors Industries Ltd. If Mr. Isenberg died tomorrow , Nabors would owe his estate a " severance " payment of at least $ 263.6 million , company filings show .
That 's more than the first - quarter earnings at the Houston oil - service company .

Last year Kevin Colvin lost his job as an intern at the Anglo Irish Bank in Boston after he emailed his manager saying he needed time off to go to New York because of a " family emergency " .
But his boss discovered photos on Facebook that showed Mr Colvin at a Halloween party drunk and dressed as a fairy .
In an email reply his boss attached the photo and wrote : " Thanks for letting us know - hope everything is OK in New York . ( cool wand ) " .
The visual cortex is attentive to sudden changes in the environment , both when something new appears and when something disappears , Dr. Martinez - Conde said .
A sudden disappearance causes what neuroscientists call an after - discharge : a ghostly image of the object lingers for a moment .
This illusion is behind a spectacular trick by the Great Tomsoni .
The magician has an assistant appear on stage in a white dress and tells the audience he will magically change the color of her dress to red .
He first does this by shining a red light on her , an obvious ploy that he turns into a joke .
Then the red light flicks off , the house lights go on and the now the woman is unmistakably dressed in red .
The secret :
In the split - second after the red light goes off , the red image lingers in the audience ’s brains for about 100 milliseconds , covering the image of the woman .
It ’s just enough time for the woman ’s white dress to be stripped away , revealing a red one underneath .
In a conference last summer , hosted by Dr. Martinez and Dr. Macknik , a Las Vegas pickpocket performer and co-author named Apollo Robbins took advantage of a similar effect on the sensory nerves on the wrist .
He had a man in the audience come up on stage and , while bantering with him , swiped the man ’s wallet , watch and several other things .
Just before slipping off the timepiece , Mr. Robbins clutched the man ’s wrist while doing a coin trick  thereby lowering the sensory threshold on the wrist .
The paper , with links to video of Mr. Robbins ’ performance , is at http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nrn2473.html.
“ That was really neat , and new to me , ” said Dr. Bach , who was in the audience .
The grasp , he said , left “ a sort of somatosensory afterimage , so that the loss of the watch stays subthreshold ” in the victim .
The visual cortex resolves clearly only what is at the center of vision ; the periphery is blurred , and this is likely one reason that the eyes are always in motion , to gather snapshots to construct a wider , coherent picture .
A similar process holds for cognition .
The brain focuses conscious attention on one thing at a time , at the expense of others , regardless of where the eyes are pointing .
In imaging studies , neuroscientists have found evidence that the brain suppresses activity in surrounding visual areas when concentrating on a specific task .
Thus preoccupied , the brain may not consciously register actions witnessed by the eyes .
Magicians exploit this property in a variety of ways .
Jokes , stagecraft and drama can hold and direct thoughts and attention away from sleights of hand and other moves , performers say .
But small , apparently trivial movements can also mask maneuvers that produce breathtaking effects .
In a telephone interview , Teller explained how a magician might get rid of a card palmed in his right hand , by quickly searching his pockets for a pencil .
“ I pat both pockets , find a pencil , reach out and hand it to someone , and the whole act becomes incidental ; if the audience is made to read intention  getting the pencil , in this case  then that action disappears , and no one remembers you put your hand in your pocket , ” the magician said .
“ You do n’t really see it , because it ’s not a figure anymore , it has become part of the background . ”

In general , I ’m not one for picking favourites , but ever since I was first introduced to Terry Pratchett ’s books at age 11 - ish , I have bought and loved every single one of his books .
I even have two copies of some of them !
In my student days , while I still lived in the UK , I queued for hours at book signings so I could spend a few seconds with the man himself , and he was unfailingly nice every time .
Since I made my sea turtle in March , I had a feeling it reminded me of something …
Then it came to me : most of Terry ’s books are set on the Discworld : a flat world carried through space on the backs of four elephants who themselves stand on the shell of the giant star turtle , Great A’tuin …
( Google image search if you do n’t know what I ’m talking about 🙂 )
The idea to make a crocheted Discworld has been running around inside my head ever since .
I thought it would make a wonderful art piece , so I ’ve been slowly designing and assembling the pieces to create my Discworld model .
I made sure the size for my small elephant design would fit on the turtle ’s back …
I spent hours studying , sketching , simplifying and photoshopping the Discworld Mapp so I could recreate it in cotton yarn ( and my process for that would take up a whole post by itself ) …
And , finally , today it has all come together with the finishing touches to the fourth elephant .
Drumroll please …
In honour of the genius of Terry Pratchett and his books ( and totally unauthorized , so I hope he wo n’t take offence ) , allow me to present the Amigurumi Discworld :
Small print : Discworld is © Terry Pratchett .
I have made my homage only for fun , not profit .
I do n’t have the rights to create a crochet pattern based on the Discworld , so please do n’t ask me to do so 🙂
Please leave me a comment if you like my work – your words mean a lot to me !
UPDATED 5 Sep 08 : I have just posted a Discworld update .
Terry himself has seen the pics and commented !
And I have added some details on how I made the Disc .
The liberal blogosphere wants to know :
Why have conservatives lined up to say kind things about the late Jesse Helms ?
Partially because nobody wants to speak ill of the dead , but largely because Helms was an sometimes - effective , always - steadfast champion of conservative causes for decades , and there 's a sense on the right that the liberal case against Helms - the - awful - bigot is really just the latest manifestation of the long - running liberal attempt to argue that ( as William Voegeli puts it in a fine essay on race and the Right in the latest CRB ) " the essence of conservatism is and always has been Dixiecrat - ism ... [ and ] that everything that conservatism has accomplished and stood for since 1965 — Reagan , the tax revolt , law - and - order , deregulation , the fight against affirmative action , the critique of the welfare state ... everything — is the poisoned fruit of the poisoned tree . "
Regular readers will know that I sometimes have sympathy for these sentiments , and that I tend to be sensitive to the way that liberals cry " racism ! " in an effort to disarm conservative arguments on issues ranging from crime to affirmative action to Jeremiah Wright .
And in that vein , I should note that I 'm not convinced that Helms ' famous " white hands " ad merits the sort of outraged denunciations that Andrew and Max Boot have offered up today - since if it does , the implication would seem to be that any hard - hitting attack on racial preferences is ipso facto racist .
But a specific ad is one thing ;
Helms himself is another .
He simply was an awful bigot , and worse he was an awful bigot who never expressed a shred of remorse , so far as I know , for his toxic approach to issues ranging from civil rights to HIV to foreign affairs .
Far from being the sort of politicians who conservatives ought to defend , out of a sense of issue - by - issue solidarity , he 's the sort of politician conservatives ought to carefully distance themselves from , because his political style brought ( and continues to bring ) intellectual disrepute to almost every cause with which he was associated .
Inherent to conservatism is the responsibility to stand up and say to bien - pensant opinion :
Just because a bigot opposes something does n't mean it 's a good idea .
But the necessity ( and difficulty ) of making that case , whether the issue is affirmative action or " comprehensive " immigration reform or the NEA and Piss Christ , is all the more reason for conservatives to keep their distance from actual bigots , even ( or especially ) when they 're representing the great state of North Carolina in the U.S. Senate .
Jonathan Rauch had it right in 2002 : If Ronald Reagan and Helms had similar positions on countless issues , that does n't prove that Helms was good for conservatism ; it only suggests that conservatives should look for more Reagans , and fewer Jesse Helms .
I 'm happy to defend Helms ' views on a variety of issues , but the man himself has no business in the right - wing pantheon , and the conservatives who have used his death as an occasion to argue that he does are doing their movement a grave disservice .

( CNN ) -- The U.S. Marine Corps has disciplined two Marines over a videotape that showed a Marine throwing a puppy over a cliff , the military said Wednesday .
YouTube.com removed the video for violating the Web site 's terms of use .
Officials did not specify the role that each man played in the incident , which received international attention after a video of it appeared on YouTube.com March 3 .
Lance Cpl. David Motari is being processed for removal for his role , the Marine Corps said , and Sgt. Crismarvin Banez Encarnacion also has been punished .
The video shows someone throwing a black - and - white puppy off a rocky cliff .
The dog makes a yelping sound as it flies through the air .
" That 's mean .
That was mean , " someone off - camera is heard saying .
YouTube removed the video about a day after it was posted , " due to terms of use violation , " the site said .
The Marines were quick to condemn the video when it surfaced , calling it " shocking and deplorable . "
Marine officials said the disciplinary action followed a thorough investigation , according to a statement that the Marine Corps Base Hawaii released Wednesday .
" The actions seen in the Internet video are contrary to the high standards we expect of every Marine and will not be tolerated , " the statement said .

On Friday , Stephen Price , a reporter for the Tallahassee Democrat newspaper was kicked out of a media area at a rally for McCain .
Price is black .
All of the other reporters in the area were white .
He was the only reporter asked to leave .
All of his security and media credentials were in order .
When another reporter asked why Price was removed , she was also removed .
Jonathan Block , a McCain campaign worker , said “ I can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that race had nothing to do with it . ”
So why was Price kicked out ?
Well , when you do n’t have a good excuse , I guess you make something up .
Block said “ At the end of the day , your reporter was in the wrong place . ”
Price works for a state newspaper , and he was in an area restricted to members of the traveling national press corps that accompanies McCain on his campaign travels .
The only problem with that excuse is that it is a lie .
There were several other reporters from the local press in the same area , and none of them were asked to leave .
Only Price , the black reporter , and then another reporter who asked why Price was removed .
When asked about this , Block could only say “ I do not know why the other reporters were not moved .
The rest of the local press should have been moved as well . ”
I have a better excuse for the McCain campaign .
Price was removed because he works for the Tallahassee Democrat .
This would not be the first time McCain kicked a Democrat out of one of his campaign rallies .
Texas economy credited for cities ' population boom NEW HEAD COUNT BY THE CENSUS
Texas cities on top in population growth
As the Lone Star State 's economy keeps growing , four metropolitan areas , including Houston , see a boom of their own
If it seems like more houses are being built in your neighborhood , your hunch is right .

The Houston metropolitan area ranked fourth in the nation for overall population growth between 2006 and 2007 , according to new census data — an increase demographers attributed largely to the region 's economy .
The Houston - Sugar Land - Baytown area attracted slightly more than 120,500 new residents from July 2006 through July 2007 , according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates released today for geographic regions known as metropolitan statistical areas .
The Dallas - Fort Worth - Arlington area ranked No. 1 in the nation in terms of raw population growth , and Austin - Round Rock and San Antonio also made the top 10 .
Karl Eschbach , director of the Texas State Data Center in San Antonio , said the job market and economy are driving the state 's population growth .
" It 's the combination of international and domestic migration that 's pushing Texas cities to the top , " Eschbach said .
New Orleans showed the first signs of recovery in the population estimates , though Eschbach warned that does not necessarily herald a " rapid recovery . "
After reporting record - setting population losses after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , the New Orleans metropolitan area had an estimated population increase of about 39,885 from summer 2006 through 2007 , making it the eighth - fastest - growing in the nation .
" The most important thing about the data for the New Orleans area is how modest the population gains have been , given the magnitude of the losses there , " Eschbach said .
" It 's not cause for excitement . "
Barton Smith , a University of Houston economist , said about two - thirds of Houston growth is from migration , surpassing additions from the birth rate .
" That only happens when the economy is doing substantially better than other places , " Smith said .
" Houston 's economy is going to continue to outperform the national economy in a significant way , so when unemployment starts to creep up in other parts of the country , many people are going to leave Michigan and Ohio and Florida and look for jobs in Texas . "
The Dallas - Fort Worth region increased by 162,250 , followed by the Atlanta ( 151,063 ) and Phoenix ( 132,513 ) areas .
Austin - Round Rock was the nation 's fifth - fastest - growing metro area , at 4.3 percent , as well as the eighth - largest overall population gainer , at 65,880 , according to the census .
The government tabulates the estimates to provide consistent federal data of geographic areas .

There have been protests in Europe against Italy 's measures
The Italian government has lashed out at an influential Catholic magazine which suggested fascism might be resurfacing within the government .
An editorial in the Famiglia Cristiana weekly is critical of government policy towards the Roma community .
Two cabinet ministers said the tone of the article was " irresponsible " .
The Vatican has also distanced itself from the publication with a papal spokesman saying it " does not reflect the views of the Holy See " .
In an article due to appear in the magazine next week , editorialist Beppe Del Colle writes : " Let 's hope their fears are unfounded that another form of fascism is looming here " .
' Bludgeoning tone '
The article is accompanied by a famous image of a Jewish child being searched in the Warsaw ghetto .
The magazine has repeatedly denounced tough new measures introduced by Silvio Berlusconi 's rightwing government targeting the Roma , or Gypsy , communities whom officials blame for much of the country 's violent and petty crime .
One junior minister , Carlo Giovanardi , attacked the magazine saying : " You are fascists , with your bludgeoning tone " .
The head of Mr Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party in the upper house of parliament , Maurizio Gasparri , said he would sue the magazine 's editor over comments he made in a newspaper interview .
Correspondents say the government 's left - wing opponents often label it fascist , but the allegation is more damaging when it comes from a publication linked to the Catholic Church , to which many centre - right politicians and their supporters swear allegiance .
Papal spokesman Federico Lombardi said the article did not express the views of the Italian bishops .
In response , the magazine emphasised its editorial independence .
Director Antonio Sciortino , a Catholic priest , said " we have never dreamt of being the official organ of the Holy See " .

Eyewitness News
Note : instructions for an even - more - ultimate laser show are coming soon , in the meantime check out a sneak peek of it in action .
This is probably the coolest thing I ’ve ever made .
It ’s quite a step up from the Five Dollar Laser Show I posted a bit back .
The only logical step after building that was to drastically increase the power and number of beams .
I loved the effect that it generated , but it was n’t bright enough , and only covered a small portion of the wall .
This my first attempt at solving those two issues , I think it worked out pretty well .
Here ’s the new version in action on the ceiling of my living room .
It ’s quite an effect , and rather hypnotizing – it ’s quite easy to zone out and become completely absorbed in the music .
The multiple vibrating beams coming out of the unit also look amazing when fog or smoke is in the room .
Even the most ADHD - addled individual , myself included , tends to go “ whoa ” .
You can also do cool things like hooking it up to a microphone and watching the patterns your voice makes .
A disco ball or mirrors stuck to the ceiling help spread the effect around even more .
So how does one go about making one of these things ?
Well , I made every effort to make construction as simple as possible for two reasons .
One , electrical engineering is far from my speciality and I did n’t want to kill myself / ruin a laser I could only afford one of .
Two , I always hated seeing incredibly awesome projects on the internet that I never had any hope of building due to funds and bizarre parts .
That ’s not to say you do n’t need some basic soldering and construction skills , as well as a healthy respect for the power of laser light , but it ’s definitely doable if you put your mind to it .
The full details are in the links below , but what you basically need are a heatsinked lab style laser ( so it can run for a few hours , high power laser pointers will get too hot ) , a diffraction grating , a pair of old headphones , and a few electrical parts to tie it all together .
So if you ’re the type who enjoys projects , I strongly recommend giving this a shout – it ’s proof positive that you can obtain amazing results without the backing of a large electronics company .
If you do end up building one , please send me a link to the results so I can see how it turns out !
Instructions
Academia is a self - certified guild that is funded mainly by tax money .
Each year , something in the range of $ 350 billion goes into higher education in the United States .
This figure keeps rising .
So , the stakes are high .
As with any guild , it must limit entry in order to preserve above - market salaries .
It does so primarily by academic licensing .
The primary licensing restriction is university accreditation , which is a system run by half a dozen regional agencies .
To get degree - granting status , a college or university must be certified by one of these agencies .
They certify very few .
The next screening device is the Ph.D. degree .
This system was imposed on academia nationally by John D. Rockefeller ’s General Education Board , beginning in 1903 , when Congress chartered it .
He gave money to colleges , but only if they put people with Ph.D. degrees on their faculties .
Next comes faculty tenure .
After about six or seven years of teaching mainly lower division classes that senior professors refuse to teach , an assistant professor comes up for tenure .
If he gets it , he can never be fired except for moral infractions far worse than adultery committed with female students .
Very few assistant professors are granted tenure .
The Ph.D. glut then consigns the losers to part - time work in community colleges for wages in the range of what apprentice plumbers receive .
I have written about this glut elsewhere .
ACADEMIC JOURNALS
To get tenure at a major research university , you must publish in the main academic journals in the field .
This is limited to about a dozen journals in each field .
They publish quarterly .
They run perhaps eight articles per issue .
Most of these are written by well - known men in the field who are already tenured .
The average Ph.D. holder publishes one article , which summarizes his Ph.D. dissertation .
This article is unlikely to make it into one of the top dozen journals .
Almost no one ever wins a Nobel Prize who is not on the faculty of one of these universities .
He must also have published repeatedly in the dozen top academic journals .
His articles must be cited widely by other authors in these journals .
If an article is not widely cited within five years of publication , it is doomed .
In short , journal editors control access into the top rank of academia , who in turn assign manuscripts to be screened by teams of unnamed faculty members .
Almost no one knows who these people are .
Robert Nisbet once told me that he had given up reading any professional journal in sociology decades before .
A decade before George Stigler won the Nobel Prize in economics , I heard him say in front of a group of academic libertarians and conservatives that he had a question .
“ I would like to know why there is only one journal article a year worth reading in my field . ”
The answer is clear : the system is funded by the state and ruled by faceless committees .
At schools other than the top three - dozen , tenure is granted for publishing in a lesser - known journal .
Also relevant is a book published by a major university press .
These are presses that are subsidized indirectly by the government .
Their books sell for very high prices , and are then bought mainly by university libraries .
If you do not publish in the top dozen journals , then you do not get tenure at a major university .
Very few Ph.D. - holding academics get offered a tenure - track position in these schools .
The old - boy network rules .
A major professor at Harvard , Princeton , Yale , Stanford , Berkeley , or Chicago calls a buddy at one of the other top schools and recommends his top two or three Ph.D. graduates .
A few of these get hired .
Of these , maybe 20 % ever get tenure .
The losers here wind up at second - tier or third - tier universities .
If a person reaches age 35 and has not published in an academic journal , he is relegated to the limbo of academia .
He may get tenure at a community college or a third - tier university that grants only the B.A. and a few M.A. students .
If by age 40 he has not published several articles and multiple book reviews in one of the top dozen journals , he will never become a major figure in the profession .
THE OLD - BOY NETWORK
If you did not get into one of these schools ’
Ph.D. programs , you do not get recommended to teach at a major university .
If you are granted a Ph.D. by any lower - tier school , then you probably will not get a career job in academia , but if you do , it will be in a community college teaching for low wages , probably part - time .
You may get a tenure - track job at a college no one has heard of except its alumni , who do not have much money to donate to the endowment .
If a Ph.D. holder is granted tenure at one of these schools , he has lifetime employment in safety but obscurity .
No one ever hears about him or her again .
The prospective Ph.D. student is told about none of this .
The faculty is paid more for Ph.D. - level students .
Faculty members have no incentive to cut the supply of lemmings .
They keep these pour souls in the dark .
These people work for minimum wages teaching sessions of lower - division students .
Or they do the grunt work researching topics that their advisors will use to write articles and books , mentioning these students in a footnote or the Acknowledgments page of a book .
TEXTBOOKS
Then there is the textbook system .
There is a lot of money to be made in textbooks for lower - division classes .
A textbook may sell for $ 100 to $ 150 .
The market is huge : over half of the 15 million college students enrolled in America ’s 4,000 community colleges and 4 - year colleges .
Only a few textbooks make the cut : about a dozen .
Textbooks shape the minds of the general academic public .
They also set the criteria for those students moving into upper division as majors in a department .
The textbook must conform to certain standards .
Those ideas within the guild that are considered representative touchstones of the guild ’s positions must not be violated .
These ideas are used to screen textbooks .
In economics , the universal screening rule is affirmation of central banking in general and the Federal Reserve System in particular .
The editors pay close attention to this chapter .
The following rules must not be violated .
1 . Only a brief mention of central banking as a government - licensed monopoly — no detailed discussion of the central bank in terms of the textbook ’s chapter on monopoly .
2 . No mention of its structure as a member bank - owned cartel of commercial banks — no discussion at all of the central bank in terms of the textbook ’s chapter on cartels .
3 . No mention of the fact that , under the auspices of the Federal Reserve System , the dollar has depreciated by 95 % since 1914 , according to the Inflation Calculator on the Website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
4 . No mention of the well - organized , decades - long plans to create the Federal Reserve , except to dismiss all such accusations ( accurate ) as “ a conspiracy theory . ”
( This dismisses as a crank theory Part 2 of Murray Rothbard ’s book A History of Money and Banking in the United States . )
5 . No mention of fractional reserve banking as inherently inflationary and also immoral : a cartel - enforced wealth transfer , the position of Rothbard ’s book , The Mystery of Banking .
6 . No mention of the Great Depression without invoking Milton Friedman ’s assertion that the Great Depression was the failure of the Federal Reserve System in not inflating more .
No mention of Murray Rothbard ’s book , America ’s Great Depression ( 1963 ) .
Instead , it cites Friedman ’s book , A Monetary History of the United States ( 1963 ) .
This chapter serves the economics guild in much the same way that the local altar to the emperor ’s genius served Rome .
Every adult resident of the empire had to publicly worship the State by placing a pinch of incense on this altar .
To refuse was to risk a death sentence .
Similarly , any economics textbook author who does not toss a pinch of incense on the altar of the Federal Reserve System assures himself of publication death .
His manuscript will be rejected .
In the New Testament ’s terminology , you either make peace with the Beast , or else you are consigned to outer darkness by the guild .
This is why there has never been an Austrian School economics textbook .
Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard rejected all central banking as an illegitimate government intrusion into the economy .
No other school of economic opinion takes this hard - line view of all central banking .
A prospective textbook author must implicitly announce his rejection of Austrian economics by means of the chapter on banking .
A professor gets no tenure points for a textbook , but he can become a multimillionaire if his textbook sells well .
Very few textbooks make it into classes of the top three - dozen universities .
He may get an obscure book publisher to publish his textbook , but the book is marketed to academic limbo .
It is highly unlikely that it will break through into the big leagues .
It will not be assigned to students at the top three - dozen Ph.D. - granting universities or the two - dozen top four - year schools , such as Swarthmore , Pomona , Carleton , and Occidental .
It will not be assigned at the 150 second - tier schools .
The textbook may make the author some retirement money , but it will not shape the thinking of the future major players in the profession .
TO DE - FUND THE SYSTEM
Take away government funding , and the system dies .
Barring this , allow another dozen accredited schools like the University of Phoenix to market programs , as Phoenix does , to 300,000 students a year , and the system will not die , but it will be drastically modified .
The middle - tier and lower - tier private schools will go under : hundreds of them .
These lower - tier colleges ( “ universities ” ) sell to students who were not good enough to get into the major universities and state universities .
This system cannot be modified until the funding is cut off by the state .
Short of an economic disaster , this is unlikely .
Parents are rarely in a position to tell their children to fund their own educations .
There is too much peer pressure on the parents .
So , the parents pony up their retirement money and send their children off to schools that are designed to undermine the students ’ faith in what their parents had taught them , unless their parents never changed from their own last years in college .
It is a self - policing , tax - funded system of indoctrination .
It has worked for seventy years .
This is unlikely to change in our time .
HOPE FOR A FEW
There are alternatives in terms of books .
The books on the Mises.org ’s free Literature section offer an alternative .
So do the Website and catalogue of the Liberty Fund .
But these books are aimed at independent thinkers .
Not one institution of higher education certifies them .
On the contrary , the academic establishment is opposed to the outlook of these books and materials .
Because of the Web , it is easier to get these materials into the hands of bright graduate students who see what is being dished out to them in their classrooms .
But this remnant is small .
Until the tax funding is removed from higher education , the remnant will remain small .

“ The West ’s motive is to achieve as much leverage as possible and maintain its hegemony around the world .
It share ’s nothing with anyone and maintains its wealth by suppressing the 80 percent of the global population living in poverty . ”
Ali Bulac / WorldMeets.us | August 22 , 2008
The United States is installing a missile defense system in Poland .
The agreement was signed on August 20 .
A radar system for the system has already been installed in the Czech Republic .
At the signing ceremony in Poland , U.S. Secretary of State Rice made an interesting statement of justification .
“ This is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone , ” she said , adding , “ This is an agreement … that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century … from countries like Iran or from North Korea . ”
This explanation is neither smart nor convincing .
Who is “ us ” ?
The U.S. or the NATO countries ?
The new defense system is targeted at the east and north .
For the time being , there is no threat to Eastern Europe or the Balkans .
Obviously , the targets are Iran and Russia .
Which of the two takes precedence as a target is a matter of ambiguity .
It may be Iran or it may just as well be Russia .
Iran is one of the countries included in the axis of evil declared by George W. Bush .
The others were Syria and North Korea .
For now , North Korea has been taken off the list of countries that require immediate attention .
Before the crisis broke out in the Caucasus , Syria was about to conclude a deal with Israel – with Turkey acting as mediator .
Given recent events , now Syria may be rearranging its position .
That Russia has been hosting Syrian President Bashar al - Assad at a time when the crisis is in full bloom , is of course no coincidence .
Russia has also has extended a renewed helping hand to Arab countries it has long neglected .
The end of the Cold War has changed many things .
In its wake , the Arab world felt defenseless and desperate and the United States , Great Britain and Israel felt free to implement their policies .
The Soviet Union is primarily responsible for the current situation in Afghanistan ; but if the Soviet Union still existed , the United States and NATO would n’t have been able to enter the country so easily .
What happened in Iraq needs no explanation .
For no good reason , the occupation took the lives of 1 million Muslims .
Millions of people were forced to migrate to foreign countries or become refugees in their own land .
While all of this was taking place , Russia did nothing .
Indeed , after September 11 it declared its support for the United States in its war on terror .
The reason for this stance was n’t to buy time until it regained its strength .
The reason of course was the Kremlin ’s eagerness to test whether it was possible to maintain hegemony over the region while cooperating with the U.S. Russia soon realized that it was n’t .
The West ’s motive is to achieve as much leverage as possible and maintain its hegemony around the world .
It share ’s nothing with anyone and maintains its wealth by suppressing the 80 percent of the global population living in poverty .
With experience , Russia realized this reality .
It suddenly noticed that while Iran was set as the target , Russia was trapped .
Radar systems , missile defense installations and the admission of former Soviet satellite states into NATO were all taken by Russia as initiatives to contain it by the West .
With engagements and interests everywhere , Georgia suddenly exposed Israel .
Tel Aviv extends military aid to an intolerant and fundamentalist Christian like Mikhail Saakashvili and it trains the Georgian army .
There ’s no to ponder the connection , since we can observe who Georgia ’s neighbors are : Iran and Russia .
The crisis that has erupted in the Caucasus shows that the new order , set up after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 , was quite fragile .
Remember that papa Bush [ George H.W. Bush ] said back then that the United States had acted to create a new world order that would last 100 years .

WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
The advert is set on a desert island where Esperanto is spoken Littlewoods Direct says it 's using a language constructed in the 19th Century , Esperanto , to launch a new clothing range .
Who still learns this language , and why ?
" Behold my fantastic invention to bring us more beautiful clothes . "
Perhaps not a phrase language students will have much use for , but this forms the dialogue in Littlewoods Direct 's latest advert featuring the queen of a desert island speaking - according to the clothing firm - Esperanto .
" We believe it is a language that not only sounds beautiful , but exists to create harmony in the world , making this the perfect choice , " says a Littlewoods spokesman .
THE ANSWER
To speak to others in a " neutral " second language
To improve language skills
When it was created , Esperanto was intended to become everyone 's second language , to bring equality to international communications .
There are estimated to be more than 2,000 Esperanto speakers in the UK and anything between 500,000 and two million worldwide .
But why learn it ?
" If you want to travel the world and speak to people on equal terms then learning Esperanto is the way to do it , " says David Kelso , 63 , from Lanarkshire , who has been speaking it for more than 45 years .
" You 'll never achieve that through English . "
People who learn it tend to be idealistic - there 's a vast number of poets in Esperanto and there 's a lot of vegetarians
David Kelso
As a 14 - year - old he taught himself with the help of a correspondence course and it was two years before he met another Esperanto speaker .
But his linguistic skills have since earned him hundreds of friendships around the world .
He gets in touch with Esperanto speakers in any country he plans to visit , and writes daily e-mails in Esperanto to international friends .
" People who learn it tend to be idealistic .
There 's a vast number of poets in Esperanto and there 's a lot of vegetarians , a high ratio of pacifists and Quakers . "
Politically , he says , they tend to be left - of - centre .
Easier than French
The language itself sounds rather like Italian or Spanish and its grammar is very simple so it 's easy to learn , with no irregular verbs .

Lazar Zamenhof created the language in 1887 , in response to the ethnic divisions in his native Bialystok in Poland .
He believed that language barriers fostered conflict and therefore set about promoting a " neutral " second language that had no political baggage .
In the 1920s there were attempts at the League of Nations to make it the language of international relations , but the French were among those to resist .
And Esperanto speakers were persecuted in Nazi Germany , where Hitler viewed the language with deep suspicion .
Since then , William Shatner helped raise the language 's profile by starring in an Esperanto - speaking film called Incubus .
And one of the lead characters in BBC Two 's Red Dwarf , Arnold Rimmer , tried to speak it - indeed , Esperanto was a recurring theme on the show .
Esperanto was the name of a spaceship in Red Dwarf
The advent of the internet has helped to harness interest and make it easier for people to teach themselves .
But it has also made the community more invisible - the number of active Esperanto clubs in the UK has declined from about 80 to 10 in recent years .
Next week a worldwide Esperanto congress meets in Rotterdam .
Four UK primary schools teach Esperanto , under a pilot scheme called Springboard organised by the Esperanto Association of Britain .
" It 's a language awareness course that uses Esperanto as a tool to create interest in language and confidence in language learning , " says teacher Stephen Thompson .
" This gives them a better start in their language learning in general .
Too much French or Spanish or German or anything can provide continuity problems . "
Esperanto gives children confidence and the sense " I can do this " , he says .
" Most people find problems of gender and irregular verbs and strange spelling just too much when learning a foreign language . "
Language and culture
But the Department for Children , Schools and Families has yet to be convinced of the merits of Esperanto and does not class it as a foreign language that meets the needs of the national curriculum .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular feature in the BBC News Magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines " Esperanto does not allow pupils to develop an interest in the culture of other nations or to communicate with native speakers as it does not have an associated culture or homeland , " says a spokesman .
" There are no recognised qualifications in Esperanto so schools could not teach it at Key Stage 4 [ age 14 - 16 ] , where the requirement is to teach pupils a language leading to a recognised qualification . "
Thompson believes the language has encountered two enemies , ignorance and prejudice .
And he says Esperanto - which means " one who hopes " - has its own heritage , including a long tradition of literature .
Add your comments on this story , using the form below .
I was taught Esperanto at a comprehensive school in the 1970s .
It was a total waste of valuable time in education and I would have found French or German more beneficial .
It is a minority thing and should never have been allowed to be taught in schools in the first place .
But then again , looking back , education then was more about trends .
Lorraine McKeown , Stockport " If you want to travel the world and speak to people on equal terms then learning Esperanto is the way to do it , " says David Kelso .
Nonsense .
All you are doing is using a hodgepodge of European languages rather than one of them .
I struggle to see how an indigenous tribesperson would see this as any less culturally imperialist ( unless , of course , the " world " only includes western Europe and the places where the local languages were replaced by European languages long ago ) .
Andrew , London , UK
As an international language , Esperanto's main drawback is its similarity to European languages .
It 's simply not true that you can speak to people " on equal terms " in a language that is so much more like yours than theirs ( if they happen to speak , say , Japanese or Arabic ) .
Chris , Cambridge
In a world where international and cultural divisions still cause so much hardship , maybe it 's actually time that we gave Esperanto a real shot .
As a newcomer , I 'm certainly intrigued .
Matthew , Bristol
My great uncle was a leading expert in Esperanto , and there 's been some speculation in my family that this is where I get my own fascination for languages .
I have a degree in Russian , speak German , studied Latin , and have now added French since marrying a Quebecker and moving from Gloucestershire to Canada .
However my great uncle would have been disappointed , since I just can't see the appeal of a cultureless , simple language .
The beauty of a language is its irregularities - where 's the pride in mastering a regular language , the fun in making connections between the straightforward , and the discovery of a culture that nobody lives ?

What are these ?
While this guide to important environmental issues is not comprehensive , if you ’re new to green or simply want a refresher overview , this list neatly summarizes some of our most pressing environmental concerns … some of which cannot be solved simply via creative upcycling or small - space living .
1. Climate Change
Global warming has been concerning scientists for decades , but Al Gore legitimized the crisis with his controversial film An Inconvenient Truth .
From the melting polar ice caps to catastrophic weather and threatened ecosystems , not only is climate change real , scientists agree that humans are influencing climate change with our production of greenhouse gases ( mainly stemming from carbon dioxide and methane ) .
What can you do ?
How bad is it ?
Why do so many people still think climate change is n’t real ?
Is it real ?
These are just some of the issues worth exploring .
The good news is that despite the urgency of the crisis , there are exciting technological developments as well as meaningful lifestyle changes you can make to help .
2. Energy
Clean energy vs. dirty energy .
Renewable energy .
Energy independence .
Petroleum .
Biofuels .
Coal .
ANWR and offshore drilling .
Even Paris Hilton has something to say about energy .
Energy is second only to climate change in significance , but the picture is n't as clear as one might think .
China is heavily criticized , but did you know the state of California is worse ?
Look for plenty of myth - busting and interesting news to come , as well as practical tips to reduce your own energy dependence .
Though no single energy source is going to be the solution , positive developments toward a cleaner future are happening every single day .
3. Waste
With the immediate looming problems of climate change and energy , focus has shifted away from landfill waste , but this is a serious problem .
The world has largely gotten accustomed to a throwaway lifestyle , but that ’s neither healthy nor sustainable .
Waterways are choked with trash and modernized nations ship their undesirable leftovers to the developing world .
Fashion fashion , fast food , packaging and cheap electronics are just some of the problems .
The amount of waste the industrialized world generates is shocking .
Water bottles are the defining symbol of this critical issue .
Fortunately , people are becoming aware of the consequences of " fast consumption " and there are many simple changes you can make in your own life to help significantly reduce landfill waste .
4. Water
Pure Water is in short supply .
Our global reserves of drinkable water are a fraction of 1 % and 1 in 5 humans does not have access to potable ( safe ) water .
Many people do not realize that strife has already broken out in some stressed regions .
There are many potential solutions , some promising , others challenging .
Desalinization is an energy - inefficient , expensive option .
But there are many things you can do .
( Hint : it starts with turning off the faucet when you brush . )
5. Food
Biofuels have turned into a global controversy – the idea that people may causing the starvation of millions in order to fuel their SUVs is sickening .
And yet that ’s not the whole picture .
For example , eating hamburgers has as much or more impact on the global food picture as the use of biofuels .
And then there ’s the whole issue of “ food miles ” – at first , local seemed logical , but the situation is more complex than that .
It ’s all about resources and efficiency .
There are big questions : can we support the world without turning to vegetarianism ?
We know that the planet ca n’t afford the Western way of eating .
It would take 5 earths to support that lifestyle !
What about hunting – is that good for the environment ?
Look for more articles soon exploring the complicated world of food .
Fortunately , there are a multitude of tasty diets that incorporate greener values , so it 's not necessary to adhere to veganism , for example .
6. Consumption
This is directly tied to waste .
It is well - known that the industrialized world simply consumes in a way that is not sustainable .
And the developing world is rapidly imitating the model .
Sustainability in the most compelling sense is about long - term solvency .
The way we live now is borrowing against the future .
Reducing consumption , and smart consumption , are both necessary – and there are many ways to go about doing this .
Some methods are pure geek , some are high tech , and some are just common sense .
And once you start exploring , you 'll see that it 's actually fun .
7. Land Management
From desertification to polar ice melting to erosion and deforestation , existing land management choices are not serving the planet or its inhabitants very well .
The 1990s saw some headway with forest management but the Bush administration ’s various initiatives ( most notoriously , “ Healthy Forests ” ) have set back progress by decades .
There is very little land left that is undeveloped , either with structures or roads .
And there is virtually no land left that is not subject to light or noise pollution .
The modern green movement believes that in order to create a sustainable future , people will need to return to the conservation spirit Americans were once famous for .
That 's a value system that includes meaning , adventure , and self - sufficiency – no wonder so many people are getting inspired .
8. Ecosystems and Endangered Species
The good news is that some species have made a comeback .
The bad news is that many more species are now under threat , including indicator species and evolutionarily unique species .
( When an indicator species becomes threatened , endangered , or worse , extinct , this means an entire ecosystem faces collapse . )
The consequences can have global impact .
From the most unusual endangered animals to a complete list of indicator species for key ecosystems and how you can help , you ’ll find plenty of fascinating information soon .
( Be sure to bookmark this post and check back for updates and links . )
9 . The Science of Public Health Issues
Our tomatoes have fish DNA ?
Killer bugs are on the loose ?
Superweeds are taking over corn fields ?
Wild animals are sprouting extra limbs ?
Autism is on the rise ?
WTF !
What on earth ( literally ) is going on ?
From genetic manipulation and cloning to public health issues and food and drug contamination , get to know the new , strange , important and most interesting green issues related to genetic science , agribusiness , public health and more .
What ’s this about electromagnetic fields ?
Is all that exhaust on my commute killing me ?
Do cell phones really cause cancer ?
Will soy milk give me man boobs ?
How much of our groundwater is contaminated ?
Is smog getting worse or better ?
How much acid rain is there ?
Why ca n’t I drink out of streams ?
These are just some of the fascinating questions you can read about here in future posts .
You can look forward to sane analysis that debunks myth and takes fear - mongering to task .
Did you guess the tenth issue ?
There are more issues , but those are the most critical green challenges .
It will take a combination of technological developments and lifestyle changes to address these challenges successfully – and that begins with learning , which is perhaps the most important environmental challenge of all , rounding out the list at 10 .
Stay tuned for more !

[ This essay , which exposes the big - government policies of the Hoover administration , was first published in the Saturday Evening Post , June 25 , 1932 .
It appears for the first time in a book by the Garrett of the same title , available through Mises.org ]
In the minutes of the Chicago City Council , May 12th last , is the perfect example of how commonly we regard public credit .
From bad taxation , reckless borrowing and reckless spending , the city of Chicago had so far prejudiced its own credit that for months it had been unable to meet its municipal payrolls either out of revenues or by discounting its notes at the bank .
Therefore , it knew what could happen to the public credit of a city .
But with the public credit of a nation it was different .
On that day the City Council adopted two resolutions :
One called upon Congress to reduce the federal government 's expenditures one - fifth ; the other called upon Congress to vote a Government bond issue for as many billions as might be necessary and spend the money " to make possible the American citizen 's inalienable right to earn an honest living for himself and his family . "
As if the taxpayer were willing , for the sake of some immediate relief , to increase the load of those who come next .
And of course he is .
Hence the passion for public borrowing .
Not only are all these ideas of refuge and solution in public credit to some degree plausible ; very often they are of good and wistful intention .
This is notably so in the present .
There is a crisis in the economics of human welfare .
The intention is to overcome it .
If truly it could be overcome by the use of public credit , no objection on the ground of precedent or political theory would long prevail .
Public credit belongs to the people as a whole and they may do anything with it they like .
Therefore , as to these ideas — any and all of them — there are only two questions :
First , will they work ?
Nobody can answer that .
Nobody knows what lies in the future .
Sometime the tide , of itself , will rise again .
We take that for granted .
Therefore these unprecedented uses of the public credit now being made , and proposed to be made , are to meet a crisis that must soon pass .
President Hoover says :
I have no taste for any such emergency powers in the Government .
But we are fighting the economic consequences of overliquidation and unjustified fear as to the future of the United States .
The battle to set our economic machine in motion in this emergency takes new forms and requires new tactics from time to time .
We used such emergency powers to win the war ; we can use them to fight the depression .
But the risk is real .
If the natural level of economic recovery were long delayed , then all these measures would very soon fail in the total ruin of public credit .
Yet suppose differently .
Suppose they did work , the tide rising to save and redeem them , and that we should be able to perform the terrific gymnastic feat of getting back our equilibrium .
What then ?
Well , in that case we should have established certain things in the way anything is established — by the fact of its having once been done before , such as these :
That when the industrial rhythm breaks and there is an crisis in employment , it becomes a function of government to provide people with work ; thus responsibility for unemployment comes at rest not upon industry , where we had thought it belonged , but upon government — the state — and must be charged to the public credit .
That when from bad banking , wild speculation , senseless credit inflation , or no matter from what cause , the private banking structure seems about to fall , it becomes a function of government to support it with public credit , not particularly to save the banks , but to save depositors .
Thus responsibility for the solvency of banking as a whole passes to the government .
That when railroads , in a crisis , are unable to meet their interest charges , it becomes a function of government to save them with loans of public credit , as through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , not for the sake of any railroad as such , but because if the railroads go bankrupt the savings banks , the insurance companies and many thousands of investors who hold railroad bonds will be hurt .
That when liquidation of commodities and securities has gone too far it becomes the business of government to stop it , using public credit by such means as it may think fit .
That when prices are too low — prices taken all together — it becomes a function of government to manipulate them back to where they belong .
This it will do by inflating money and credit .
And it follows by necessity that certain functions of government are assumed , as , for example , the wisdom to know when a crisis is such a crisis , to know when liquidation has gone far enough , when prices are too low , when they are high enough again , how many bank failures constitute a crisis in banking , how many railroad failures constitute a crisis in railroad credit , and so on .
Whether this would be all for the best , or otherwise , is not yet the point .
There cannot even be a discussion of it until we see clearly where we are going .
It may be that industry cannot accept responsibility for unemployment ; if so , perhaps the government must .
It may be that in a crisis finance cannot any longer be responsible for its own solvency , nor business for its own continuity .
It may be that we are done with the anarchy of prices which we have so long justified by supposing a law of supply and demand .
But if these things are true , and if now in any crisis such responsibilities must pass to the government , we have gone far unawares toward an experimental state we know nothing of by experience , almost nothing of by theory .
That is to say , we have not consciously intended it .
We have not considered what kind of state that would be , much less to decide if we want it .
It is clear , however , that in passing these responsibilities to government we should be exchanging freedom for something else as yet unnamed .
Hilaire Belloc , in his book The Servile State , defined that something else as economic status .
Security according to the economic status of persons , classes and groups , in place of freedom .
And we shall have done another thing .
If only such ideas as these now current do prevail , and if they work , we shall have enormously increased the power of self - extension which is already inherent in government .
There are many aspects of government .
The one least considered is what may be called the biological aspect , in which government is like an organism with such an instinct for growth and self - expression that if let alone it is bound to destroy human freedom — not that it might wish to do so but that it could not in nature do less .
No government ever wants less government — that is , less of itself .
No government ever surrenders power , even its emergency powers — not really .
It may mean to surrender them , but on the first new occasion it will take them all back .
One of the American Government 's wartime powers was the War Finance Corporation .
The present Reconstruction Finance Corporation is a revival of that power in time of peace .
And so it goes .
Observe that in time of prosperity government is bound to extend itself because revenues are plenty and there is always a purblind demand for special benefits to be conferred by public credit .
If now it is established that in time of depression government must extend itself even faster , prodigiously , in order to meet the responsibilities which we are so willing to pass to it by default , then the growth of government will be uninterruptible , without time or season , and the last problem of all is how people shall defend themselves against it .
Already the cost of government is absorbing , roughly , one - quarter of the total national income .
One day 's work in every four belongs to government .
We speak here of all government — national , state , city and local — from Washington above down to the counties , townships , boroughs and districts , all exercising the tax power .
As the total national income falls , the proportion of it absorbed by government will rise .
It must rise because government is the one thing that cannot be liquidated or deflated in time of economic depression .
To the contrary , as we have seen , it must extend itself to meet new responsibilities .
Therefore , taxes must be increased , first in order to provide as much public revenue as before , and then further increased to provide more revenue than before .
Thus , in bad times like these , the proportion of the total national income absorbed by government will rise in a special manner .
Nevertheless , the rise , irrespective of the state of the times , is continuous .
The cost of government rises faster than the national income when the national income is rising .
It rises even faster when the national income is falling .
The increase in the past few years has been such that if it should continue at the same rate , the cost of government fifty years hence would absorb the whole national income .
Then we should all be working for government , either directly as state employees or indirectly to support the employees of the state .
Already of those above ten years of age gainfully employed in the whole country , male and female , about one in ten is directly employed in government service .
The per capita cost of all government has increased as follows :
In 1880 it was $ 13.56 In 1903 it was $ 19.39
In 1913 it was $ 30.24 In 1923 it was $ 88.94
In 1929 it was $ 107.37
In 1932 it will be , approximately $ 124.00
The first thought will be that the war did it — the war itself and the after costs of the war in such things as veterans ' relief , pensions and national defense .
But these are Federal expenditures , and they have much less to do with the rise in the cost of all government than you would suppose .
By the figures of the National Industrial Conference Board , the per-capita costs of government separately stated , are :
1913 1929 Federal $ 7.17 $ 32.36 State $ 3.97 $ 16.38 Local $ 19.10 $ 58.64
Half the total cost of all government is the cost of city and local government , and that per-capita cost in 1929 was three times what it was in 1913 .
Taxes have risen to a point at which they begin to devour people 's possessions , and the taxpayer is wild for relief .
What relief does the taxpayer imagine ?
This — that the cost of government shall be reduced .
How shall the cost of government be reduced ?
By economy , by the elimination of graft and needless waste , by a consolidation of government 's competitive parts , by a reform of its structure to limit the number of local and civic units because duplication is costly .
In brief , government shall find ways to do what it does for less money .
Not less government , you see ; the same amount of government for less money .
And all this intelligent uproar is in a sense superficial and probably delusive .
It is superficial wherein it aims only to abate a very acute pain in the taxpayer 's pocket , and if anyone supposes that reducing the cost of government by economy and greater efficiency will limit government itself , it is elusive at the crucial point .
More than that , reducing the cost of government by measure tends to serve the most potent forces now acting to extend government .
Why ?
The explanation is simple .
The more efficient government is , the less it costs per measure , all the faster it may be extended without producing that very acute pain in the taxpayer 's pocket .
This pain is the terror of government because it arrests its growth .
And now you will see a selective struggle taking place within government itself .
The impulse is to select the more extensible forms .
The structure of government is by strata , beginning with innumerable small local units , such as boroughs , townships , school districts , improvement districts , and so on , each one exercising the tax power ; rising thence to counties , cities and states .
At the top is the federal government .
In the whole country there are approximately 500,000 separate units of government .
This is the estimate of the tax commissioner of the state of New York , writing an essay in Community Service magazine on the preposterous duplication of parts , offices and powers in government .
" Take the case of New York , " he says .
That state has sixty - two counties and sixty cities …
In addition there are 932 towns , 507 villages , and , at the last count , 9,600 school districts …
Just try to render efficient service … amid the diffused identities and inevitable jealousies of , roughly , 11,000 independent administrative officers or boards !
This extreme of home rule is not good for government .
The tax power , in so many hands , is much less effective than it might be .
So now there is a movement — a movement within government , independent of the taxpayer — to rationalize the structure from the bottom up , each next higher stratum with an impulse to absorb the powers of the one below , or , where they cannot be absorbed , to divide them reasonably .
And at the top the federal government , with no authority over the sovereign states , would very much like to come to an understanding about taxation , because more and more Federal and state taxes collide at the same source , as with the income tax , which now some states are using in competition with the federal government .
Such competition is embarrassing and unscientific from the common point of view of government seeking revenue .
It is well known that a cow milked by a few expert hands in a regular manner will give more milk than the same cow milked in a haphazard manner by the neighborhood .
Certainly if the structure of government were rationalized , we could easily have as much government as before for less money .
But there is the specious point again .
Not less government ; only as much government as before for less money .
The cost of government by measure is one thing ; the quantity of government , at any cost , is another .
Tax rates have been rising by necessity because the national income has been shrinking .
It takes a higher rate of taxation to produce a given amount of revenue .
At the same time , new taxes have been invented .
There is yet everywhere a deficit in the public revenue because the shrinkage in everything taxable was so sudden and violent .
Now suppose that under stress of abnormal public revenue the structure of government is somewhat rationalized and that by such means as economy and efficiency the cost of government by measure is much reduced .
Suppose it .
Then what will happen when the national income rises to normal again ?
There will be an enormous increase of public revenue , as there was after the war from the carry - over of the wartime taxes .
All the public treasuries will be rich .
And there is bound to be , again as it was after the war , a terrific extension of government .
The rise in the cost of government is not from increase of graft and corruption , for these evils in a relative sense are diminishing ; nor is it from an increase of waste , for of this the ratio has probably been fairly constant .
What it means is extension of government — not bad government only but good and bad together .
Let it be asked :
What are the political and social forces now acting to absorb the national income for purposes of government — acting , that is , to increase taxation ?
First by habit one thinks of those for which we have traditional images :
The machine , the boss , the pork barrel , the spoils system , the politician everywhere in his popular character , acquiring merit and power by spending public money ; doing things for his people with the money of other people , taking care at the same time to do enough for himself with everybody 's money .
The spender of public money will never want followers .
" Of course , " said the Secretary of the Treasury 2 recently , in a speech before the New York City Bar Association ,
the people are in a large measure themselves to blame .
They have not only tolerated but given encouragement to an ever - expanding cost of government .
The spenders were the ones elected to office and bond issues voted with cheerful alacrity .
One who remembers a Southern senator shouting out loud that he would steal for his people a hog every time a Yankee got a ham may be indignant , but the feeling is not personal .
The senator was only human .
These predatory , parasitic , more or less shameless forces are inseparable from government .
They do increase the cost of popular government .
Nevertheless , they are limited .
That is to say , corrupt government tends to limit and defeat itself .
Moreover , these forces are thoughtless .
They have no theory among them .
They do not want to redistribute wealth ; they want only to prey upon it .
Now , much more potent are the forces acting upon a definite political doctrine .
Such are the extreme liberals , the Socialists , the radicals , themselves perfectly honest , all haters of graft and corruption in government , yet who are for increasing popular taxes on any pretense of public benefit because that is one way of redistributing wealth downward , according to their doctrine .
What are popular taxes ?
The Secretary of the Treasury , in the speech just referred to , tells what they are : " the income and inheritance taxes , because they are so levied as to reach comparatively few people . "
The income tax is popular because fewer than 2 percent of the people pay income taxes .
Why should not everyone pay an income tax ?
The principal reason , from the point of view of government , is that a universal income tax would be a powerful restraint upon the expansion of government .
And now observe how it is that on one side , the government — even a conservative government — and on the other side , all the forces moving to effect a redistribution of wealth downward by political theory , are bound for different reasons to favor popular taxes .
The government favors them naturally — " the most feathers for the least squawk . "
And those radical forces , who may have nothing else in common with this government , favor them on the ground of doctrine .
Observe another strange bedfellowship .
When the railroads throw themselves on the hands of the government and demand public credit to save them from bankruptcy , these radical forces do not protest , or , if they do , it is in an academic sense only ; and the reason for this is that they believe in the public ownership of railroads , and see , perhaps more clearly than the others , that such use of public credit tends to bring the experiment of state ownership to pass .
For the same reason they protest lightly or not at all against the use of public credit to save the private banking structure , for that will tend to bring about state control of credit .
They are for anything that tends directly or indirectly to get the government into business , for that leads to state ownership of the means of production .
If taxation meanwhile has to be heavily increased , so much the better , so long as the increase is , as it certainly will be , in the field of popular taxes , for thereby wealth is redistributed downward and capitalist society , in which they disbelieve , is on its way to trouble .
A third formation of forces moving in a parallel manner to absorb the national income by extension of government is made up of practical reformers , idealists , good - government people , with or without any political theory .
What they have in common is a certain reaction to the sight of human misery , squalor , discomfort , disadvantage or what they believe to be curable wretchedness .
They preach a gospel of the responsibility of the state to administer happiness , not because the state should , not because they themselves would prefer the kind of state that does , but simply that the state can .
Thus , government responsibility for old - age security , child life , tonsils , widows , backward mentalities , employment insurance , better maternity , public nursing , recreation , adult play , plumbing , housing , right nurture , infant feeding , vocational guidance , the use of leisure , everything of the good life for everybody , as a responsibility of the state , to procure it , provide it , superintend it .
Everyone knows that impulse .
How many times , on looking at slum dwellings or some other distasteful human spectacle , have you yourself said , " There ought to be a law , " and so forth ?
Well , but " a law " means in every case to interfere by power of government , backed by the public credit .
Demands upon the public credit for social service are most difficult to resist .
There is the emotional appeal , and to this is added the practical suggestion that , after all , it will pay , or that it will be cheaper in the end .
Two children in every nine are so far handicapped physically or mentally as to need special treatment and training .
Who so mean that he will not himself be taxed , who so mindful of wealth that he will not favor increasing the popular taxes , in aid of these defective children ?
Moreover , as the report of the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection said ,
It is unquestionably better policy to spend more money today in helping the handicapped child to help himself than it is to spend many times as much tomorrow in supporting him at public expense .
At the recent national conference of the American Association for Old Age Security , Representative Connery , 4 who is moving an old - age pension bill in Congress , said ,
Evidence was introduced before the House Committee to show that the cost of old - age pensions would be much less to the states and municipalities than is the present cost of the workhouse institutions .
It is my hope that the Congress , which has seen fit to provide $ 2 billion to protect the banking interests of the United States , will see the necessity of passing this legislation to protect the old people .
Fourteen states now have old - age pension laws , and 100 other old - age security measures are pending in forty state legislatures .
The Assistant Commissioner of the Department of Social Welfare reported on the first year of old - age pensions in the state of New York , saying the protest against them came mainly from people in the rural districts where the pensioners were visible to those who were struggling to pay the taxes out of which old - age pensions are provided ; and the delegate representing the corresponding work in California complained that the operation of the old - age pension law in that state was hampered by the two conditions that to be eligible one must be a citizen and of good character .
The very acute pain in the taxpayer 's pocket is the terror of government because it arrests its growth .
Whether old - age pensions would be cheaper than poorhouses is a question which , even if it is permissible , cannot be determined as a matter of fact .
The same spirit that moves old - age pensions has been improving the poorhouses .
Trenton , for example , has made the word taboo .
Its poorhouse is a municipal colony , governed by the idea , says the magazine of the New Jersey League of Municipalities , that as a refuge for the unfortunate it differs from people 's homes " only in its larger facilities and the greater number of its inhabitants .
Every resource to soften its institutional features has been used , including motion - picture shows , concerts , an extensive library , pool tables , newspapers , magazines . "
It is really a better place to live than many of the private homes taxed to support it .
The cost of social service , exclusive of education , now is representing one - fifth or more of the total expense of cities .
In enlightened states it runs even higher .
For Massachusetts the cost of it is nearly two - fifths of all state outlay .
The effects and works of social service are very flattering to our sense of benignity ; we are doing well by the less fortunate .
Yet this unction is by most of us undeserved ; it comes after the fact , with some sourness in it .
Very little social service is really spontaneous , straight from the taxpayer 's heart .
The promotion of it for many is an avocation , for increasing numbers it is a profession , and for a very great number of more or less trained men and women it is employment and livelihood .
" But where do many of these governmental elaborations come from ? " asks the secretary of the Des Moines Bureau of Municipal Research .
Many originate with educational , recreational and sociological enthusiasts …
These enthusiasts usually start by stating that such and such neighboring city has a certain public service or improvement ; therefore , we ought to have it .
And so these ideas spread like wildfire from community to community .
But when one expresses a timid doubt regarding the necessity for such and such a project because of the expense , these boosters argue , " The public demands it , " when , as a matter of fact , they themselves originated the scheme …
Further tax - boosting influences emanate from the " per capita " or " model " standards .
Certain national groups , particularly in the field of education , recreation , health or sociology , have set up per-capita targets toward which they assert every city in a certain population range should aim .
Then these enthusiasts return home from their national gatherings , and if they find that their city spends less for such service , they make it their business to see that it soon attains such a standard .
There is another reason why the taxpayer himself is not entitled to that unctuous feeling in the presence of social service .
Now the oldest object of his animosity — namely , the political boss — has annexed the idea .
Formerly the benefactions of the boss were intimate and personal , but to these he now adds the more diffuse benefactions of social service , and his base is wider .
Such a boss as this now commands the support , first , of all the beneficiaries of social service ; secondly , of all who promote and live by social service ; thirdly , of those whose doctrine is to take and give ; and he has still his machine as it was before .
He is fairly secure .
" Cities have assumed new obligations , " writes Lent Upson , director of the Detroit Bureau of Governmental Research .
" Increased wealth , with its higher standard of living , creates a demand for public services not known a generation ago . "
In twenty years , 135 new activities were added to the responsibilities of government in Detroit , such as high - school evening classes , children 's clinic , child - welfare nurses , transportation of the crippled , classes for mental defectives , training library personnel , testing gas , testing materials , health - education nurses , camps for tubercular children , public - health education , medical college , college evening classes , college summer classes , employment bureau , symphony concerts , cancer clinic , cancer nurses , human antiserum nurses , cooperative high school and the use of radio in schools .
The radicals are for anything that tends directly or indirectly to get the government into business , for that leads to state ownership of the means of production .
Results , typical :
Taxes in the same twenty years have increased from $ 14 to $ 53 per capita ; public debt has increased from $ 15 to $ 175 per capita .
A great deal of that admirable work was not paid for ; the people could not afford to pay for it .
They borrowed the money , and now the problem of Detroit is what to do about its debt .
Bankers are loath to lend it any more money because investors are reluctant to buy any more of its bonds .
Creditors are hard , yes ; only , suppose there had been no creditors to borrow from .
Out of the city 's own resources , unaided by creditors , the people of Detroit could not have enjoyed these benefits of social service .
What should or should not be is a question that belongs to argument .
Here is the intent only to show how unlike and differently motivated forces , economic , social and political , are tending together not only to swallow up the national income in government but also to produce a result which some intend and some do not .
The loss of public credit , the complete ruin of it , would be the least of the consequences .
In a recent report on the " new poor , " made by the Welfare Council of New York City , there is a reference to " the mental infection of dependency . "
This was upon the investigation of unemployment relief .
But taking refuge in public credit will cause that same infection to attack business , banking , industry , agriculture , the entire body of private enterprise .
Increasingly , as it may seem , irresistibly , we are using public credit to create an indigent caste , indigence becoming more and more comfortable until for many it may seem a goal ; then a very great dependent caste referred to as people in the " lower income ranges , " who , without being indigent at all , are yet dependent upon public credit for security , for modern housing , for care in illness , protection in health , economic insurance , amusement and guidance ; then a social - service caste to mind the indigent and oversee the dependent .
In all of these ways we are exchanging freedom for something else — for security , for status , for refuge from the terrors of individual responsibility .
The last may go very deep .
Émile Faguet , a Frenchman , in a book entitled The Dread of Responsibility , wrote ,
We like to surrender ourselves to the state while allowing it to impose even heavy tasks upon us .
The basis of this paradoxical inclination is the lack of personal will , and this lack of personal will itself comes from the horror of responsibility …
We imagine today that everything is done by the aggregate without the will to act of any of the individuals composing the aggregate .
He was writing about French people , and he supposed this weakness in them was from having lived so long under a crown that did everything for them .
But what of American individualism ?
Was it a myth ?
That you will be hearing .
Has the modern circumstance overwhelmed it ?
The city , of course , is an important factor .
The modern city is a new form of life , really , and one that we have no science for ; in that form individual helplessness is a rising social liability .
Whatever else may go by conjecture , this will be evident in itself — namely , that a rise in the cost of government , suddenly in one generation , from a traditional basis to a point at which it begins to absorb one - quarter of the total national income , is a political and social omen of great significance .
It will be evident in the same way that taxation has reached a point where it represents an active redistribution of wealth by hand and power of government .
No particular kind of state is sacred , nor is any particular doctrine of wealth , but it is all the more dangerous to be going this road with no theory of either the kind of state it leads to or what shall be the status of private wealth within it .
Until about 1910 , excepting only the period of the Civil War , the cost of the federal government was met almost entirely by customs duties and the tobacco and liquor taxes ; and until about 1910 the cost of state and local government was met by the property tax , supplemented somewhat by corporation taxes , license fees and death duties .
Since 1910 , " says the Secretary of the Treasury , " the picture has materially changed … The Federal Government adopted a full - fledged income tax in 1913 , and estate tax in 1916 … Beginning with Wisconsin , in 1911 , state after state adopted an income tax , though at very moderate rates , until today there are twenty - two with this form of taxation .
The states have also invaded the field of consumption taxes formerly used almost exclusively by the Federal Government .
Today every state imposes a gasoline tax , and thirteen make use of taxes on tobacco or cigarettes …
And he cites , for example , one state where the state income tax , which has just been doubled , plus the new and higher Federal income tax , will amount to more than one - fifth of a personal income above $ 12,000 a year , rising to more than three - fifths of a personal income above $ 100,000 a year .
In the same state the levy upon corporation income , state and federal taxes together , will be one - fifth or more .
This is the income tax alone !
And thus the national income is absorbed .
Obviously we cannot continue in this direction without consequences either disastrous in fact or revolutionary in principle .
A total ruin of the public credit would be a disaster in fact .
We might then wipe the slate and begin all over .
Any alternative would be revolutionary in principle , such , for example , as for the state to appropriate all wealth and administer it directly .
With a national income of not more than $ 60 billion this year , we are obliged to buy more government than we bought with a national income of nearly $ 90 billion in 1929 ; moreover , in this depression we are obliged to buy a good deal of it on the deferred - payment plan .
That is what it means to sell bonds .
All of it has sometime to be paid out of taxes ; and even those who may not pay these future taxes directly will pay them indirectly in the cost of the houses they rent , the food they eat , the clothes they wear , the gas they burn in their motor cars — in every item of the cost of getting born , growing up , growing old , even dying .
It is imperative to reduce the cost of government by measure — that is , to make the tax dollar buy more than before .
But that will be only like pruning the tree , for lustier growth hereafter , unless we settle what public credit is for in principle and limit in a drastic manner the ferocious growth of government .

“ More than 3,500 insurgents have been ‘ taken off the streets of Baghdad ’ by the elite British force in a series of audacious ‘ Black Ops ’ over the past two years , ” reports Sean Rayment for the London Telegraph .
“ It is understood that while the majority of the terrorists were captured , several hundred , who were mainly members of the organization known as ‘ al - Qa’eda in Iraq ’ have been killed by the SAS . ”
Recall the Washington Post , the CIA ’s favorite newspaper , admitting that the putative leader of " al - Qaeda in Iraq , " the criminal retard Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , was little more than a Pentagon PSYOP .
The assassination program in Iraq is a collaborative effort between the British SAS and the American Delta Force .
It is called “ Task Force Black . ”
General Petraeus was so impressed with the assassination effort he remarked : “ They have exceptional initiative , exceptional skill , exceptional courage and , I think , exceptional savvy .
I ca n’t say enough about how impressive they are in thinking on their feet . ”
Let ’s rewind .
Recall the Washington Post , the CIA ’s favorite newspaper , admitting that the putative leader of “ al - Qaeda in Iraq , ” the criminal retard Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , was little more than a Pentagon PSYOP .
“ The U.S. military is conducting a propaganda campaign to magnify the role of the leader of al - Qaeda in Iraq , according to internal military documents and officers familiar with the program .
The effort has raised his profile in a way that some military intelligence officials believe may have overstated his importance and helped the Bush administration tie the war to the organization responsible for the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , ” wrote Thomas E. Ricks in a front page story for the newspaper on April 10 , 2006 .
“ For the past two years , U.S. military leaders have been using Iraqi media and other outlets in Baghdad to publicize Zarqawi ’s role in the insurgency .
The documents explicitly list the ‘ U.S. Home Audience ’ as one of the targets of a broader propaganda campaign . ”
As Michel Chossudovsky notes , much of this fairy tale propaganda is delivered to the corporate media by “ top feeders ” at the Pentagon .
“ Disinformation and war propaganda are an integral part of military planning .
What the Washington Post fails to mention , however , is its own role in sustaining the Zarqawi legend , along with network TV , most of the printed press , and of course CNN and Fox News , not to mention a significant portion of the alternative media , ” writes Chossudovsky .
As we know , the Washington Post was long ago compromised by the CIA ’s Operation Mockingbird , so this role is now reflexive .
US military - intelligence has created it own terrorist organizations .
In turn , it has developed a cohesive multibillion dollar counterterrorism program “ to go after ” these terrorist organizations .
To reach its foreign policy objectives , the images of terrorism in the Iraqi war theater must remain vivid in the minds of the citizens , who are constantly reminded of the terrorist threat .
The Iraqi resistance movement is described as terrorists led by Zarqawi .
In other words , “ al - Qaeda in Iraq ” is a fabrication designed to discredit the Iraqi resistance .
Two SAS operatives captured in Iraq after attempting to stage a false flag terrorist attack .
Sean Rayment and the London Telegraph would have us believe the British SAS is only killing “ al - Qaeda in Iraq ” members .
In fact , it appears they are targeting the leadership of the Iraqi resistance while capturing and imprisoning street level “ terrorists , ” that is to say fighters resisting occupation .
The SAS is a natural for this sort of work .
It was formed during WW11 by David Stirling with the intention to operate behind enemy lines and to perform acts of sabotage and assassination .
The SAS also worked against indigenous groups under the rubric of “ counter insurgency ” in Malaya , Oman , Borneo , and elsewhere .
“ By 1969 , the SAS had been sent to Northern Ireland to perform covert operations against the IRA — which included assassination , ” writes David Guyatt .
“ Perhaps the best known incident that involved the SAS in a ‘ wet operation ’ was the assassination of an IRA unit in Gibraltar . ”
In fact , British intelligence created much of the terrorism attributed to the IRA .
Kevin Fulton ( a pseudonym ) , the British agent who was assigned to infiltrate the IRA , writes in his book , Unsung Hero , that the he met FBI and MI5 agents and was given money to buy an infra-red device to be used to set off IRA bombs .
“ In New York he attended a meeting with FBI agents and British intelligence officers .
There he agreed to expose IRA operatives in America to the FBI .
However , the same terrorists , who were arrested months later , were first allowed to procure and send the infrared technology to the IRA .
Fulton claims this technology was used in the Troubles and forms the basis for insurgent bombs in Iraq , ” Enda Leahy wrote for the Sunday Times on March 19 , 2006 .
For more on the dirty tricks of British intelligence and the SAS in particular , see my British “ Pseudo - Gang ” Terrorists Exposed in Basra , Global Research , September 24 , 2005 .
As for British involvement in creating terrorism in Iraq , recall the two SAS agents captured by the Iraqis attempting to stage terror attacks .
“ Iraqi security officials on [ September 19 , 2005 ] variously accused the two Britons they detained of shooting at Iraqi forces or trying to plant explosives , ” the Washington Post reported .
As I wrote at the time ( see link above ) , “ the next time you read or hear about crazed ‘ al - Qaeda in Iraq ’ terrorists blowing up children or desperate job applicants , keep in mind , according to the Iraqi Interior Ministry , the perpetrators may very well be British SAS goons who cut their teeth killing Irish citizens . ”
The CIA ran likewise operations in Vietnam .
As former CIA employee Ralph McGehee notes , the “ U.S. and Saigon intel services maintained an active list of VC cadre marked for assassination ” in the late 1960s .
Dubbed Operation Phoenix , the assassination program “ called for ‘ neutralizing ’ 1800 [ alleged Viet Cong ] a month . ”
Approximately one third of the Viet Cong targeted for arrest were summarily killed by so - called “ security committees ” in provincial interrogation centers outside of judicial control and funded by the CIA .
More than 40,000 Vietnamese were killed under Operation Phoenix at an estimated cost of nearly $ 2 billion ( see Ralph McGehee , CIA and Operation Phoenix in Vietnam ) .
The collaborative effort between the British SAS and America ’s Delta Force is obviously designed to take out the leadership of the Iraqi resistance , led by a disparate and not necessarily connected combination of former Ba’athists , nationalists , Sunni and Shi ’a militias .
It is intended to decimate the leadership — referred to as “ al - Qaeda in Iraq ” terrorists in the corporate media — as the United States prepares to downsize its presence in Iraq and shift emphasis under a new administration to Afghanistan .

July 28 , 2008 -- Diabetes is on the rise in the U.S , and three new studies shed more light on how diet affects your odds of developing type 2 diabetes .
Each study covers a different aspect of diet .
Together , the studies show that diabetes risk may rise if you drink too many sodas and sweetened fruit drinks , fall if you eat more fruits and vegetables , and may not be affected by how much fat you eat .
But there 's another key theme that runs through the studies :
There 's no getting around calories .
Blow your calorie budget and you 'll gain weight , which makes type 2 diabetes more likely .
" Until we have more information , we have to assume that calories trump everything else , and that our No. 1 goal for the reduction of new cases of type 2 diabetes should be to reduce the intake of high - energy , low - benefit foods , " especially in young people at high risk of diabetes , write Mark Feinglos , MD , CM , and Susan Totten , RD , from Duke University Medical Center .
Here 's a quick look at each of the studies , published with Feinglos and Totten 's commentary in the Archives of Internal Medicine .
A revolutionary dissolvable scaffold for growing new areas of skin could provide a safer , more effective way of treating burns , diabetic ulcers and similar injuries .
This ultra - fine , 3 - dimensional scaffold , which is made from specially developed polymers , looks similar to tissue paper but has fibres 100 times finer .
Before it is placed over a wound , the patient ’s skin cells ( obtained via a biopsy ) are introduced and attach themselves to the scaffold , multiplying until they eventually grow over it .
When placed over the wound , the scaffold dissolves harmlessly over 6 to 8 weeks , leaving the patient ’s skin cells behind .
This new approach to skin reconstruction has been developed by a team of chemists , materials scientists and tissue engineers at the University of Sheffield , with funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council .
It is designed primarily for cases involving extensive burns where surgeons are unable to take enough skin grafts from elsewhere on the body to cover the damaged areas .
Currently , bovine collagen or skin from human donors is used in these cases , but these approaches have potential health and rejection risks .
“ Simplicity is the key , ” says Professor Tony Ryan , who is leading the team .
“ Previous attempts to find better ways of encouraging skin cell growth have used chemical additives and other elaborate techniques to produce scaffolds , but their success has been limited .
We ’ve found that skin cells are actually very ‘ smart ’ – it ’s in their DNA to sort themselves into the right arrangement .
They just need a comparatively uncomplicated scaffold ( and each other ) to help them grow in a safe , natural way . ”
The polymers used in the scaffold are biodegradable materials already approved for medical applications .
Because the team has recognised that skin cells are ‘ smart ’ and the scaffold can therefore be ‘ dumb ’ ( i.e. not overly sophisticated ) , simple polymers can be used .
The process for making the scaffolds is based on the well - known technique of electrospinning .
However , the team has made a key advance by developing a new method of making , from the same biodegradable polymers , aligned - fibre ‘ mats ’ of potential use in promoting nerve or tendon growth .
This method is currently being patented .
The next step in the research is to develop the skin reconstruction technology for clinical use , hopefully in the next few years .
The technology also offers possibilities for testing the toxicity of cosmetic and similar products , using materials grown in the laboratory that closely resemble natural skin .
“ Ultimately , we can envisage treatment of burns victims and the undertaking of reconstructive surgery using the scaffold and the patient ’s own skin to produce bespoke skin for that patient , ” says Professor Ryan .
“ As an accident - prone mountain biker , I find that prospect very attractive ! ”
There is a horrible sense of meaninglessness and chaos that comes from the extreme loneliness of being cut off .
Trauma , whether sustained in the family , or in the military during combat , renders millions feeling unsafe , insecure , mistrustful , and in the end isolated , lonely and desperate .
Judith Lewis Herman , who wrote the definitive book on trauma and recovery , stated that all so - called mental illness and suffering could be seen as a person 's misguided attempt to survive trauma .
Fear separates , love unites .
We all wish to grow to freedom , to belong , to participate .
Hatred is like gangrene , shame is deadly .
Forgiveness is but a faint hope .
Sandoz began to market LSD in 1947 as a psychiatric panacea , the cure for everything from schizophrenia to criminal behaviour , sexual perversions , alcoholism , and other addictions .
During a 15 - year period beginning in 1950 , research on LSD and other hallucinogens generated over 1,000 scientific papers , several dozen books and six international conferences , and LSD was prescribed as an adjunct of psychotherapy to over 40,000 patients .
The current research using psychedelics heralds a reawakening to the magnificent healing possibilities of these now prohibited substances .
After over 40 years of repression or oppression , Rick Doblin of Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies ( Maps ) , and others are spearheading a more enlightened , less hysterical and terrified approach to the use of these substances .
I am participating in what hopefully will be Canada 's first government approved clinical trials in 40 years , sponsored and organised by Maps , evaluating MDMA - assisted psychotherapy for subjects with treatment - resistant post - traumatic stress disorder .
There are many other applications of psychedelic psychotherapy , such as ibogaine , or ayahuasca for the treatment of substance abuse .
Large numbers of people could benefit from the use of psychedelics as entheogens , introducing people to spiritual experiences , reducing pain and suffering due to isolation , by the irresistible realisation that each of us is a small part of something much greater than any of us , that separateness is an illusion , there is nothing to fear , and love is accessible , shame can be left permanently behind .
Rites of passage , responsibly organised , could benefit everyone .
Despite prohibition , people have often asked me to attend their own psychedelic experiments , to keep them safe , to guide them towards liberation , the end of automatic habit patterns , kneejerk reactions , towards heartfelt responses , love , acceptance and forgiveness .
After one session with MDMA , people were able to sustain insights gained , without further assistance from the drug .
Psychotherapy proceeded faster and deeper than before : the debilitating effects of shame have been annulled , heavily defended hearts opened , and stayed open , and people acquired the ability to enjoy the sacrament of every living moment without distraction by past regrets or future worries .
No small gains !
After three LSD sessions , a patient emerged from what was labelled chronic psychotic depression ( she had attempted suicide three times , had been hospitalised , and given several courses of ECT , major antipsychotics and antidepressants ) , and was able to hold a job , derive pleasure from her days , and look forward to cultivating a varied garden of delights .
She moved from cursing me for not letting her die to blessing me for the surprising freedom that opened up for her as a result of her LSD experiences .
Psychotherapy , without LSD , would not have been enough , I 'm afraid .
I can only hope that if new research with psychedelics proceeds in a responsible , careful and creative manner , the powers that be can begin to support and foster further research into this fascinating realm .
I was 27 when I first tasted this incredible substance called LSD .
Now I am 68 and for the last two years have been persona non grata in the US , because a border guard Googled my name , and found an article I wrote many years ago on entheogen - assisted psychotherapy .
I hope I will be invited into the US before I die to teach professionals how to use psychedelics for the benefit of all .
Engineers are putting hybrid drivetrains into everything from SUVs to locomotives these days , and General Electric wants to take the technology to sea in a tugboat that could burn 35 percent less fuel and emit 80 percent less pollution than anything else on the water .
The idea makes more sense than might first appear .
The shipping industry generates twice as much C02 as aviation and has been criticized as slow to clean up its act .
The feds are tightening emissions regulations on marine engines and California Sen .
Dianne Feinstein has introduced legislation requiring vessels to burn cleaner fuels in port .
So anything that makes the shipping business greener is sure to sell .
GE and the Texas maritime engineering and management firm C - MAR are starting with diesel - electric tugboats , but John Manison , GE 's head of maritime stationary power division , says the technology could have " far - reaching applications for other sectors of the maritime industry . "
" We believe there is strong demand for a hybrid technology to improve fuel efficiency and to help customers comply with increasingly stringent emissions regulations , " he says .
GE says it could have the boat on the water within two years .
But why start with tugboats ?
There are about 4,000 tugboats in America , according to the American Waterways Operators , and Tom Kelly of C - Mar says they 're well - suited to diesel - electric drivetrains .
Tugs spend a lot of time idling on standby , then require a short burst of high power to escort freighters and tankers .
Batteries would allow them to do both without burning loads of fuel or emitting lots of pollution .
GE and C - MAR are developing a series hybrid system that would use an electric motor to drive the prop and a diesel engine to drive a generator that would keep the batteries charged .
It 's a design similar in concept , if not scale , to the system General Motors is developing for the Chevrolet Volt .
" We are expecting significant savings in terms of increased fuel economy and a major reduction in emissions , " Kelly says .
" Our early estimates indicate fuel savings of up to 35 percent and a reduction in emissions of up to 80 percent . "
GE says " significant savings are expected , " but it 's too early to offer specific figures for technology still under development .
Under the partnership , GE will provide the engine , electric motor and batteries while C - MAR will design the vessel , provide the " Green Power Module " that will integrate them and manage the project .
The tug will use a GE V228 or V250 diesel engine like those used in the Clear Point Point Clear ( pictured ) that produces more than 1,400 horsepower .
There 's no word on the electric motor or batteries , but earlier this year GE Financial Services invested more than $ 20 million in lithium ion battery maker A123Systems .
You do n't have to be tugboat skipper to go green on the water , though .
Earlier this year , Austrian boat maker Frauscher Bootswerft unveiled the first diesel - electric recreational boat .
The vessel uses electric power up to 5 knots , then switches to diesel power .

This false - color image shows a soil sample after being delivered to a gap between partially opened doors on the lander 's Thermal and Evolved - Gas Analyzer .
Image credit : NASA / JPL - Caltech / University of Arizona / Texas A&M University
( PhysOrg.com ) -- NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander has continued studies of its landing site by widening a trench , making overnight measurements of conductivity in the Martian soil and depositing a sample of surface soil into a gap between partially opened doors to an analytical oven on the lander .
Phoenix 's robotic arm delivered soil Thursday from a trench informally named " Rosy Red " through a narrow opening to a screen above the No. 5 oven on the lander 's Thermal and Evolved - Gas Analyzer ( TEGA ) .
A few particles of the sample passed through the screen on Thursday , but not enough to fill the oven and allow analysis of the sample to begin .
The Phoenix team sent commands for TEGA to vibrate the screen again on Friday , and more material reached the oven , though still not enough to proceed with analysis .
" There appear to be clumps blocking the opening , " said Doug Ming of NASA Johnson Space Center , Houston , the Phoenix team 's science lead on Friday .
" However , we have seen in the past that when this soil sits for a while , it disperses .
We intend to fill an oven with this material , either by additional vibration of the same screen or by opening doors to one of the other TEGA cells . "
The conductivity measurements completed Wednesday ran from the afternoon of Phoenix 's 70th Martian day , or sol , to the morning of Sol 71 .
A fork - like probe inserted into the soil checks how well heat and electricity move through the soil from one prong to another .
Friday 's activities by the spacecraft included extending the width of an exploratory trench informally named " Neverland , " which extends between two rocks on the surface of the ground .
Update :
Vibration of the screen above a laboratory oven on NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander on Saturday succeeded in getting enough soil into the oven to begin analysis .
Commands were sent for the lander 's Thermal and Evolved - Gas Analyzer to begin analysis Sunday of the soil sample from a trench called " Rosy Red . "

Übersetzung eines Briefs der American Civil Liberties Union an den Vorsitzenden des Ausschusses des Europäischen Parlaments für bürgerliche Freiheiten , Justiz und Inneres vom 09.08.2008 :
Sehr geehrter Herr de Capitani ,
ich schreibe den Mitgliedern des LIBE Ausschusses , wie zuvor bereits den Europäischen Datenschutzbeauftragten , in einer dringenden Angelegenheit , die Ihrer Aufmerksamkeit bedarf .
Die derzeitigen Verhandlungen zwischen US - Sicherheitsbehörden und ihren europäischen Gegenübern über die transatlantische Übermittlung personenbezogener Daten stellen nur die neueste Anstrengung dar , ein Problem zu lösen , dass beständig die Versuche der Bush - Regierung gestört hat , die persönlichen Daten eines immer größeren Teils der Weltbevölkerung zu sammeln .
Das Problem liegt in dem völligen Fehlen wirklicher und durchsetzbarer Gesetze zum Schutz der Privatsphäre in den Vereinigten Staaten .
Die Möglichkeiten von Beamte einer amerikanischen Sicherheitsbehörde , dieses Problem zu lösen , sind begrenzt – selbst von Beamte einer Verwaltung , der mehr an dem Schutz der Privatsphäre läge als der derzeitigen .
Von der Europäischen Union , die starke Gesetze zum Schutz der Privatsphäre ihrer Bürger beschlossen hat , kann nicht verlangt werden , ihre Gesetzgebung gegenstandslos zu machen , indem sie die Übermittlung von Daten ihrer Bürger an einen Staat erlaubt , der im Hinblick auf den Schutz der Privatsphäre nahezu gesetzlos ist .
Obwohl es zweifellos Sicherheitsbeamte in Europa gibt , die nur darauf warten , ihre eigenen Gesetze zu verraten und einen Deal auszuhandeln , können Verwaltungsmaßnahmen und undurchsetzbare Verwaltungszusicherungen den Mangel an effektiven Gesetzen zum Schutz der Privatsphäre in den USA nicht ausgleichen .
Die Vereinigten Staaten sollten keinen Druck auf Europa ausüben , Ihren Schutz der Privatsphäre zu schwächen , sondern wir sollten unseren eigenen Schutz der Privatsphäre stärken .
Falls Europa einem Datenaustausch mit den USA unter Geltung des gegenwärtigen „ open records “ - Gesetzes der USA zustimmt , werden Europäer einen weitaus geringeren Schutz ihrer Daten in den USA genießen als US - Bürger in Europa .
Die US - Datenschutzgesetze sind schwach ; sie bieten den eigenen Staatsbürgern wenig Schutz und Nichtamerikanern praktisch überhaupt keinen .
Das „ open records “ - Gesetz der USA , der Freedom of Information Act , eröffnet allen Menschen , auch Ausländern , ein Recht auf Zugang zu ihren Daten .
Das Durchsetzungsverfahren ist jedoch mühsam , und das US - amerikanische Recht sieht kein Verfahren vor , um falsche Daten berichtigen zu lassen .
Diese Probleme werden von den Erfahrungen Ihres eigenen Mitglieds Sophie in’t Veld bestätigt , die gezwungen war , eine Klage einzureichen , um Zugang zu den Daten zu erhalten , die US - Regierungsbehörden in den Bereichen Heimatschutz , Justiz und Inneres über sie speichern .
Frau in’t Veld reichte im Oktober einen Informationsfreiheitsantrag auf Zugang zu ihren Daten ein .
Das Innenministerium hat nicht geantwortet , das FBI ( unter dem Justizministerium ) , die US - Grenz - und Einwanderungsbehörde , der Zoll - und Grenzschutz und der Einwanderungs - und Zollvollzug ( alle Heimatschutz ) haben sämtlich behauptet , keine Daten über Frau in’t Veld zu speichern .
Dies erscheint kaum wahrscheinlich , da Frau in’t Veld häufig in die USA reist und an der Grenze oft für eine vertiefte „ zweite Überprüfung “ ausgesondert wurde .
Wie Sie wissen , werden die USA im November einen neuen Präsidenten wählen .
Unabhängig davon , wer die Wahl gewinnt , hoffen wir , dass der neue Präsident einem echten Dialog mit unseren Verbündeten offener gegenüber stehen und insbesondere unsere unterschiedliche Herangehensweise beim Schutz der Privatsphäre anerkennen wird .
Wir hoffen , dass sich die USA den robusten europäischen Datenschutzgesetzen annähern werden .
Wir raten Ihnen dringend , die Versuche der Bush - Regierung zurückzuweisen , ein Abkommen mit Europa durchzupeitschen .
Es ist nicht erforderlich , Kompromisse mit einer auslaufenden Regierung einzugehen , da der nächste Präsident schon im Januar sein Amt antreten wird .
Mit freundlichen Grüßen ,

METRO TRANSIT ALTERCATION .
When you ride the subway every day , there are a few experiential milestones you inevitably pass , and never forget .
The first time the doors close while your bag is stuck between them .
The first time a crazy person holds your entire train car captive during a morning commute -- for me it was the time a woman recited the book of Revelations in its entirety , in a loud , monotone voice : " And thine flesh shall be consumed by worms of fire . "
The first time a shirtless guy enters the train and sits down , perfectly relaxed , as if riding the subway shirtless were n't the most insane and filthy thing in the whole world .
( This particular milestone is exclusive to outer - boroughs travel and often signals that summer has arrived ; like seeing your first robin redbreast of the season . )
The first time you play keep - away with an empty bottle of Snapple as it rolls around on the subway floor .
And the first time you witness a fight .
I had to ride the subway almost thirteen years before I witnessed my first real - live in - train altercation , but it was worth it the wait .
Because it was weird .
It was a crowded rush hour train so I 'm not sure exactly how the fight started but here 's what I was able to piece together from the back - and - forth .
As we were all entering the train , trying to squeeze in , there was some jostling and squeezing and , in one instance , a hard , aggressive shove .
Most would agree that this slightly over - the - line rude behavior , so the person who was received the shove responded in kind , by suggesting the shover have rough sex with himself .
Normally , swearing would be sufficient to defuse the situation but not this time , because apparently the guy who was doing the shoving decided he did not appreciate being told to fuck himself .
Maybe he was thinking , " You try to push a guy to ground to gain faster entry into a crowded subway car , and this is the thanks you get ? "
So after a few seconds of stewing , he made his way back through the car to give this toilet mouth a piece of his mind .
And that was not even the weird part .
Not by a long stretch .
See , the guy with the toilet mouth -- the one who had merely defended his dignity by cursing -- was a pretty beefy young gentleman .
Leather jacket .
Goatee .
Not the kind of person you would instinctively bully .
And the guy who had done all of the shoving and was now getting right up in this big young guy 's face to defend his natural right to knock strangers around according to his whims , looked almost exactly like Ed Harrisâ ¦if Ed Harris had been stranded on a desert island without food for six weeksâ ¦and then a FedEx box washed up on the Island one day , containing some clothing from the LL Bean Holiday Catalog .
He was very bald and tan , wearing a sweater vest and hush puppies and I would say he weighed about as much as a box of animal crackers .
If I had to guess what he did for a living , I would say , " heir to the Reddenbacher fortune . "
What I 'm trying to say is , he cut a very physically unimposing figure .
However , someone must have forgotten to mention that glaringly obvious fact to the future popcorn magnate because he was laying on the intimidation act all thick - like .
And he was doing it in a very strange , old - fashioned way , with finger pokes and threats such as , " Wanna tango ?
Well , pick a dance partner : ( Raising his fists ) Fred Astaire or Eleanor Powell ? "
At one point , in a somewhat needless attempt to defend himself , the young guy said , " hey man , I do n't want any trouble but you do n't go around shoving people .
That 's fucking rude , " and suddenly Ed Harris with AIDs makes this big show of pretend - shock , addressing the entire train , and shouts , " Well , well , well .
I guess you think New York is a real Gentleman 's Tea Partyâ we 're all soooo polite hereâ well , let me tell you something .
This is a man 's town and you 're just a tourist so why do n't you take this train back to Hackensack if you can't make hay of the hustle - and - bustle of Gotham City . "
( For the record , up until this moment , I had never heard the expression , " gentleman 's tea party , " and can neither confirm nor deny its pre-existence . )
If a fight had broken out at this point , it surely would have been Marquess of Queensbury rules , but it was not to happen .
Instead , the young guy became so spooked he jumped off the train at the very next stop , and in the aftermath of this craziness all that was left was a lot of nervous smiling and repressed titters .
And that 's where all of this unpleasantness should have ended , but do n't worry -- it did n't .
Because as soon as the train doors closed again , this Junior Varsity Bernard Goetz decided to pick another fight -- with the biggest and blackest guy on the train .
I guess he reasoned , " Hmmâ ¦which passenger on this train is most capable of killing me with one punch ?
I think I shall provoke him . "
So without hesitation he got right in this guy 's face , too .
" You want to tell me what 's so funny , or are you a coward ?
Say , how would you like to get your dance card punched by Savion Glover and Alfonso Ribeiro ?
Let 's bring in the noise as well as the funk , except with punches and kicks to the face and kidneys . "
The black guy remained pretty calm , and instead of escalating the situation he just stood up as if to say , " Are you sure about this , dude ? "
This gesture should have been enough to stop an international war , because when he stood it was like one of those cartoons where a guy gets out of a tiny car and he 's actually a giant .
He was enormous .
His shoulders were scraping the roof of the train .
His arms were sticking out of the windows , and his shadow cast the entire car in darkness .
This had absolutely no effect on our tightly - wound subway vigilante , and all I could think was , either this guy is the most confident part - time research librarian I 've ever seen , or he has a shoe knife -- some kind of element of surprise he 's packing away , to which none of us are privy .
Finally , just when I thought the black guy was going to punch Ed Harris Starring In Angels In America so hard it would cause him to explode into forty smaller guys running around , the train arrived at its next stop and our hero makes his exit but not before threatening , " You 're lucky this was my stop .
YOU'RE ALL LUCKY . "
Then , with a loud harrumph and a few more nasty shoves , he was gone .
Now the train was still packed , and the tension was palpable .
And while I 'm usually a very reserved person , I felt the words spilling out of my mouth faster than my conscience could stop them , and I found myself loudly announcing to the train , " Does anyone need to talk about what just happened here ? "

The date is etched in blood in Utah and Mormon church history and , on a more intimate level , the family trees of people like Karen Maxwell , a mother of eight and choir teacher from Salt Lake City .
On Sept. 11 , 1857 , Mormon militiamen led the slaughter of 120 men , women and children on a wagon train bound for California in an incident known as the Mountain Meadows Massacre .
Chief among the instigators was Isaac Haight , a local militia and church leader .
Several generations later , Karen Maxwell would come to know of him as her grandfather 's grandfather .
For years , Mormon church officials downplayed the role Mormons played in the mass killing , first blaming Indians and then finding a scapegoat in church member John D. Lee , the only man executed for his role .
Now , a new book drawing on existing material and documents previously unavailable to scholars lays the blame largely on southern Utah church and militia leaders .
They were otherwise good people , the authors say , who were caught up in the frenzy of the times and took up guns to try to cover up terrible mistakes .
The long - awaited release of " Massacre at Mountain Meadows " forces a reexamination of a dark episode for a faith community that puts families first .
Mormons believe the family unit lasts for eternity , dutifully practice genealogy and cherish their pioneer past .
So for descendants of massacre perpetrators , the book 's gritty detail and naming of names can bring a painful reckoning .
Some are learning for the first time about their ancestors ' culpability .
Others , like Karen Maxwell , are learning new details .
She knew of Haight 's role but did n't know his wife took in 17 young emigrant children who were spared .
She also discovered that another ancestor refused to take part .
" It 's important to know you had an ancestor who was out there , " Maxwell said .
" It personalizes it and brings it home and makes you ask yourself some of the important questions .
What would I have done ?
If my ancestors did that , am I capable of doing this ?
We need to realize how something like this can come about . "
The new volume is the work not of Mormon critics but former or current employees of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , or Mormon church .
Among them is assistant church historian Richard Turley , who said church leaders fully endorsed the " no - holds - barred , let - the - chips - fall as they may " approach .
" Our feeling was we just had to face it head on , let people deal with the truth and not with mythology , " Turley said .
" I know it 's very uncomfortable , and I 've gotten a lot of hate mail .
People have said , ' Why peel off the scab ? '
It 's because the wound is not healing .
It needs major surgery . "
Turley and co-authors Ronald Walker and Glen Leonard relied on hundreds of researchers rifling through archives nationwide , a specialist in 19th century shorthand and newly available accounts from massacre participants from the archives of the First Presidency , the church 's highest governing body .
The book tells the story in narrative form : Utah was a tinderbox in September 1857 .
Concerned about the Mormon practice of polygamy ( disavowed by the church in 1890 ) and a blooming theocracy out West , President James Buchanan dispatched federal troops to Utah Territory to put down a perceived rebellion .
Mormons already driven from other states feared exile or death .
Mormon leaders girding for war ordered that no guns or grain be sold to emigrants , heightening tensions with California - bound settlers .
Against that backdrop entered the Fancher - Baker wagon train , a group of mostly young families from Arkansas but also a few provocateurs who allegedly taunted the Mormons .
Judging the emigrants a threat , southern Utah Mormon leaders engineered what they hoped would appear to be an Indian attack on the wagon train at Mountain Meadows , a grazing spot .
A siege ensued .
Amid some confusion and discord , a plan was hatched to lure the emigrants under a false flag of truce and kill all but those too young to " tell tales . "
The goal was to prevent news of Mormon complicity in the initial raid from reaching California and causing more hardship for the Mormons .
The militiamen led the attack , directing Paiute Indian allies in a plan " premeditated , evil and cunning . "
" The massacre was not inevitable , " the book concludes .
" No easy absolution for the perpetrators is possible ...
The best that could be argued was that during a time of uncertainty and possible war , some of the Mormons , like other men and women throughout history , did not match their behavior with their ideals . "
The book also delves into the psychology of group violence , concluding that all the ingredients were there , from an atmosphere of authority and obedience to stripping perceived enemies of their humanity .
" From the church 's point of view , ( the book ) does n't try to justify the motives of the people who did the killing , " said Mormon historian Richard Bushman .
" It 's always been the tendency in the past to say it was a drastic action , but consider all they 've been through .
This book does n't do that .
There is nothing this party did or did n't do to justify the treatment they received .
In that sense , it 's an advance . "
The book refutes claims that church president Brigham Young ordered the massacre .
While Young 's war rhetoric contributed to the volatile climate , finger - pointing to fix blame among local leaders afterward undermines the theory , the authors argue .
An appendix implicates 68 militiamen .
" Most of the characters have been known , " said co-author Walker , a retired Brigham Young University history professor .
" Whether families have fessed up to it is unknown . "
Eric Wadsworth was 17 when his great - grandmother explained that her grandfather was a good man " who happened to be involved in something that went wrong " and was unjustly executed .
That man was John D. Lee , an energetic if quarrelsome Mormon convert who claimed heavenly visions and helped settle southern Utah at Young 's request .
Lee led the Indians on the initial attack and confessed to killing five or six emigrants .
Wadsworth , a 37 - year - old software engineer , welcomed the new scrutiny of Lee , who had 19 wives and can claim tens of thousands of descendants .
Lee was executed 20 years after the massacre .
" People should be mature enough not to get angry over history like this , especially when it is being presented in a non-biased way , " Wadsworth said .
" If this is used as a weapon , it'd be different . "
Yet Wadsworth also considers his ancestor a scapegoat and calls President Buchanan the " real perpetrator of the massacre " for ordering troops to Utah .
" These were good men in a hard , hard situation , " Wadsworth said .
" I wish they would have been more Christ - like and had a little more faith in the Lord .
But they did chose what they did and the Lord will be the judge .
It 's our place to forgive . "
Robert Briggs , a Fullerton , Calif. , attorney and descendant of massacre participant Samuel Knight , said younger generations are better suited to process what happened .
" Now that 150 years have gone by , we ought to be able to look at this and simply accept it , " Briggs said .
" I look at it and I 'm horrified by it .
But I do n't perceive it as some sort of stain on me or my family . "
" If they made a mistake , fine , they 'll pay for it one way or another , " said another descendant of massacre participants , 65 - year - old Keith Seegmiller of Cedar City , Utah , where the massacre plan was hatched .
" We cannot comprehend the situations they were in , the pressures they were under .
I do feel sorry for the ones who were killed .
But there is nothing we can do about it now .
We ought to let the whole thing rest . "
Walker said he understands why the massacre remains difficult for some descendants .
" We so prize the sterling character and great pioneering heritage we have , and I do n't want to muckrake that , " he said .
" On the other hand , as we become a more mature religious and cultural community , we 've got to understand that Grandma and Grandpa were just like us .
" We go along and do our best .
Sometimes we make it , sometimes we do n't . "

Scientists have developed a revolutionary vaccine that could protect billions of people against the world 's deadliest disease : malaria .
The team - whose results were published in the journal Nature Medicine last week - have created a vaccine that provided complete protection when tested on animals .
Now the group , which includes British , Irish , French and US researchers , is preparing to launch human vaccine trials .
' The crucial point about the technology we have developed to create this vaccine is that it could be used not just to take on malaria but to fight other diseases for which we still have no vaccine , for example HIV , ' said project leader Simon Draper of Oxford University .
Malaria infects more than 500 million people every year and kills two to three million , most of them young children living in sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia .
The disease is a key cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development .
People become infected when bitten by a mosquito carrying the malaria parasite .
The parasite migrates to the liver , then erupts to spread through the bloodstream , destroying red blood corpuscles which carry oxygen from lungs to muscles .
Symptoms include respiratory problems , anaemia and brain damage .
If untreated , patients often slip into a coma and die .
Anti-malarial drugs are effective , but too expensive for poor countries .
So to develop a one - off vaccine scientists have concentrated on two approaches .
The first uses deactivated - or attenuated - parasites in order to trigger immune responses .
The second involves isolating just one piece of the parasite 's protein coat .
This can then be grown in genetically modified bacteria and injected into individuals .
To date , however , neither approach - although effective with the majority of diseases - has worked with malaria .
So Draper and his team - funded by Britain 's Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust - took a completely different approach .
' We used a virus - the adenovirus that causes the common cold - which we genetically engineered so it contained a piece of the malaria parasite 's coat , ' Draper said .
' If you inject this modified virus into the bloodstream , it triggers the manufacture of antibodies - a special form of immune defence - that will attack malaria parasites .
' This is the first time that modified viruses have been used to trigger antibodies , which are the best form of immune defence for blocking malarial parasites .
We have made it work in animals , and now we are building vaccine stocks so we can carry out trials in humans in a few months , first to show the technique is safe , and later to demonstrate that it is as effective as it is in animals at protecting against malaria . '
By now , it 's no secret that GM is dumping the Hummer division .
And now Chrysler is considering following suit ... by selling the Dodge Viper ( Reuters ) :
" We have been approached by third parties who are interested in exploring future possibilities for Viper , " [ Chrysler Chief Executive Bob ] Nardelli said in the memo obtained by Reuters .
" As the company evaluates strategic options to maximize core operations and leverage its assets , we have agreed to listen to these parties . "
Many Americans were thrilled when they heard Hummer was being sold .
But this V - 10 sports car is a different story .
The Hummer symbolizes American excess .
The Viper symbolizes the American spirit .
But do n't expect an outpouring of protest if the buyer is foreign , as with Anheuser - Busch 's ( BUD ) sale to InBev .
From 1998 - 2007 , Chrysler was part of German - owned DaimlerChrysler ( now Daimler AG ) .
Daimler still owns a 19.9 % stake in Chrysler , while American private equity group Cerberus Capital now owns the other 80.1 % .
And , ironically , the Chrysler building in Manhattan just sold to the Abu Dhabi Investment Council for $ 800 million , with little uproar .

Meditation as meme weeding
New Ch’an Forum , No 26 , Summer 2002 , 22 - 26
In September 2001 I led a weekend retreat on memes and meditation for the Bristol Ch’an Group .
Afterwards John asked me to write about the ideas behind the retreat .
My intention then , as now , is not to dwell on the science and controversies involved in memetics , but to explain briefly the idea of memes , and explore how this can help us in our practice .
Why do we think all the time ?
Why , when we sit down and keep still , does our mind not go quiet ?
Why do all those thoughts come rushing up , along with reactions , emotions , replies , arguments and yet more thoughts to add to the starters ?
Why can’t I just sit down , say to myself ‘ now I will sit without thinking ’ and do it ?
The answer lies in the memes .
Memes are ideas , habits , skills , stories , or any kind of information that is copied from person to person .
The term was invented by Oxford biologist Richard Dawkins , and its origin is important for understanding why memes are so powerful , and how they do the things they do .
In his best - selling book , The Selfish Gene , Dawkins explained the importance and power of replicators .
Replicators are information that is copied with variation and selection .
That is : lots of slightly different copies of something are made , most are killed off , and the few that survive pass on whatever it was that helped them survive to their offspring – and then it happens again – and again .
This was the amazing , and scary , idea that Darwin called “ evolution by natural selection ” .
In The Origin of Species he showed how all the creatures on this planet could have been designed by natural selection , and that the process needs neither a plan , nor a designer .
More recently American philosopher Daniel Dennett has described the process as the ‘ evolutionary algorithm ’ – a simple mindless process that once the requisites are in place must happen .
If you have heredity , variation and selection then you must get evolution or “ Design out of Chaos without the aid of Mind ” ( ref ) .
It ’s as simple as that .
What Dawkins explained , in The Selfish Gene , was that this process is not confined to our most familiar replicator , the gene , but must apply to any information that is copied with variation and selection .
All around us , he said , still drifting clumsily about in its primeval soup of culture , is another replicator .
Ideas , habits , skills , stories , technologies , and artistic creations are all copied by a process that may loosely be called imitation .
Copying is not perfect , so there is plenty of variation and recombination , and far more copies are made than can possibly survive .
So we have a new replicator , a cultural replicator .
Taking it from the Greek for ‘ that which is imitated ’ and abbreviating it to a word that would sound something like ‘ gene ’
Dawkins called them ‘ memes ’ .
Understanding memes as replicators gives us an entirely new vision of what it means to be human and what is going on in our lives .
Think of it this way .
As soon as our early ancestors first became capable of imitation , a new replicator was let loose and started evolving .
As humans gradually got better at imitation , more and more memes could find homes in human brains and be passed on again ; in actions , tunes , traditions and ultimately in language .
Once language evolved there were even more possibilities for more memes .
People could start telling stories , singing songs , and passing on their knowledge by speech .
Then more memes could appear .
This is a never - ending process as long as the conditions are in place .
If the selfish memes can get copied they will , and so our world fills up with more and more of them .
And our modern world is very full of them indeed .
Note that when I say the memes are ‘ selfish ’ I do not mean that they are little magical entities sitting around in our heads thinking ‘ now I must get myself copied ’ .
Not at all .
Just like genes , memes are only information , but they can be selfish in this sense and this sense alone .
If they can get copied they will .
And they do not care ( because they are only bits of information and cannot care ) what are the consequences for us , for our genes , or for our planet .
They just go blindly on using us to get themselves copied , and along the way create our complex modern world .
And what is that world like ?
Look around you now and you will see countless successful memes .
Perhaps you can see pictures and images , windows and carpets , books and newspapers .
These are all memes because they have been copied again and again .
And these are the successful ones because they have beaten the competition to get where they are .
Think of all the memes you have come across today – all the memes that have , in their own various ways , shrieked at you ‘ copy me ’ ‘ copy me ’ .
Most of them are words – words on the cereal packet , words on the radio , words in the morning paper , words on the posters in the street , and then all the words that people have spoken to you , on the phone , in your email , and in person .
How many of these will you remember and pass on .
Not many , but those few will live on to jump into another brain and have another chance to get copied and so shape our world .
This is the meme ’s eye vision .
Now the important question becomes – which memes will succeed and why ?
The general principle is that memes will get copied whenever and wherever they can .
Some succeed because they are good or true or useful or beautiful .
In other words we copy them because they are valuable to us .
Others succeed in spite of the fact that they are not .
They may use tricks to get themselves into our heads and get passed on again .
They are rather like viruses that take over the copying ability of their host and put it to work for their own propagation .
There are many kinds of meme virus .
A good example is an email virus .
A typical one shouts “ Warning , Warning , news just in from IBM ( or Bill Gates or … ) terrible virus , warn all your friends immediately that if they open a mail called “ bla bla ” their hard disk will be wiped clean ” .
This little collection of words can be called a memeplex – shortened from ‘ co - adapted meme complex ’ ; in other words , a group of memes that succeeds by hanging out together and getting passed on together .
This little memeplex has a very simple structure .
I call it C - TaP .
It is basically a ‘ copy me ’ instruction backed up by Threats and Promises .
In this case you are told to pass on the message .
If you do you will help your friends ( the altruism trick ) , if you do n’t they will get their hard disk wiped ( using fear to threaten ) .
The memeplex also uses urgency , status ( e.g. IBM ) , and exploits the fact that passing on an email message to lots of people is quick and easy .
And so it is that this stupid little bit of text has been copied around and around the world , infecting millions of computers and still going strong after 5 or 6 years .
If you doubt the power of memes to change the world then reflect on this silly little memeplex .
It has frightened countless people and clogged up whole email systems .
A few mindless words have had obvious and serious effects on the physical world .
They have even found their way onto this page .
This is the power of the memes .
Buddhism is a meme .
I began deliberately with a very simple virus but there are far more powerful ones that use exactly the same structure .
Dawkins calls them ‘ viruses of the mind ’ ; he means religions .
Dawkins used the example of Roman Catholicism ; a collection of basic teachings that are passed on in church , by learning the catechism , and through prayer , singing hymns and saying grace .
Beautiful cathedrals tempt worshippers inside and lift their hearts , making them want to spread the memes again .
Beautiful music and songs carry the words of God and Jesus to more ears and minds .
Good Catholics pass on all these ‘ truths ’ to their children and are encouraged to have lots of children who must , in turn , marry ( or convert ) a Catholic and bring up their children in the faith .
The reward is everlasting life and the punishment – well it ’s even worse than having your hard disk wiped .
In addition the threats and promises are untestable .
God can see all you do but you can not see him .
Heaven and hell are only to be seen when you die and cannot come back to let on that it was all a hoax .
No wonder such religions and their doctrines fill our world and have survived for thousands of years .
Buddhism might have been an even more interesting example to make his point .
In some versions it uses the same tricks , but it has the added feature that the lineage is often preserved .
Just as with biological lineages , we can often trace the entire copying history of the central insight from teacher to teacher to teacher , through more than two millennia .
Note that the way to think about these religions is not to imagine someone making up a religion with all these meme - tricks in place , but rather to imagine lots and lots of little cults starting up all over the place at different times , with different tricks .
Most would die out , just as most organisms die out without leaving any offspring , but the very few that happen to have the best tricks will win through , persuade people to copy them , and so shape our minds and our cultures .
Being infected with a religion at an early age is no trivial matter .
It shapes your mind , affects which memes you will subsequently accept or reject , and affects everyone you come into contact with .
Very few people choose their religion , even though most think their religion is the best .
Most are infected in childhood and never throw the infection off .
We are seeing some of the consequences of these religious memes in the world situation we face today .
It is interesting here to compare Zen with Islam or Christianity .
At base the memes of Zen are not very sticky or infectious .
There is the idea of no-self , the tough practice of meditation , the encouragement to let go , living without clinging or desire and giving up the idea that anything really matters .
These are not immediately attractive ideas .
No wonder that all too easily Buddhism either fizzles out or becomes a religion like any other – with bells and incense and music and beautiful buildings and pictures and statues and promises of gaining merit or being reborn in a better life ( a daft idea in view of the insight that the self is not a persisting thing ) .
Memetics helps us understand all this .
True Zen treats all these things as so much ephemeral form .
Yet as memes they are more likely to get picked up and passed on .
Letting them go is not easy .
Now we can come back to the question I asked at the start .
Why do we think so much ?
There are two good reasons for asking this , perhaps slightly odd , question .
First there is all the trouble we have in meditation , and second there is the evolutionary cost .
Thinking is expensive in energy terms .
Our brains use up a disproportionate amount of our body ’s energy and we could surely save a lot of valuable resources by just not thinking when we do n’t absolutely have to .
The traditional answer , from evolutionary psychology , is that we must be thinking useful thoughts – perhaps preparing or planning useful actions – but given what tends to come up in meditation , I am not convinced .
In any case here is an alternative explanation .
Our minds , at rest – alert and open – are like a beautifully weeded garden , bare brown earth where anything might grow .
And just as the weed seeds are ready to jump into all that bare brown earth , so the memes are ready to jump into our open minds .
If weed seeds find a space to grow , off they go , and soon all that open space is a mass of dandelions , speedwells and rosebay willow herb .
It is the same with thoughts .
Think about what kinds of thoughts are the most troublesome .
I do n’t believe many people are plagued in meditation by the sounds in the room , or by images of scenery once observed , or images of walking or jumping , or even flying .
In other words , it is not our immediate perceptions , nor the things we have learned by ourselves that are troublesome ; it is the ones we pick up from other people .
It is all words and stories that cause the trouble ; all memes .
You take a simple sound in the room and turn it into words and arguments and likes and dislikes .
You fret over what you said to x , agonise about what to do about y , turn over and over those images of destruction and death from the television , and rehearse what you will say or do when z happens .
Word , words , and combinations of words .
And words are memes .
The reason is simple enough .
If a meme can get into your head and get itself passed on it will .
Memes that manage this trick do well , get passed on from person to person and keep going .
Those that can not die out .
In this way the world becomes filled up with catchy memes ; worrying memes and emotional memes ; memes you ca n’t resist telling others about , and memes that just have whatever it takes to get you turning them over and over in your mind .
These are the survivors in the meme pool .
These are the memes we all come across .
These are the memes that are ready to jump into the gardens of our minds .
Meditation is the hoe .
Meditation is also , of course , a meme .
You would never have invented the techniques of Ch’an meditation for yourself .
They have been part - invented and part - selected over thousands of years , passing down from person to person in a long evolutionary path .
But all of them have this in common – they are ways of defusing the power of other memes .
John ’s wonderfully simple instruction “ Let it come ; Let it be ; Let it go ” is a meme - weeding meme .
Any other meme that pops up is met with the same response .
Its power to stir up your mind is interfered with .
Its features designed to get you to store it and pass it on , no longer work so well .
“ Let it go ” gets in its way and the cycle of meme - repetition is broken .
In a similar way the silence and mindfulness we cultivated during the retreat have the same meme - weeding effect .
You only have to make eye contact with another human being , or smile in mutual recognition , for a multitude of memes to leap into action , ready for their chance to get spoken or acted out , and hence passed on .
There is no need to think of the memes themselves as having intentions or desires ( obviously they are only little bits of information and cannot have intentions and desires ) .
Instead think of them this way .
Stored in your head are countless ideas , stories , jokes , ways of saying things , words , and ways of putting words together into sentences .
Over the long history of the evolution of the English language , and the norms of friendly behaviour in our culture , certain of these have done better at getting copied and most of us have been infected with them .
Whenever there is a chance for them to get passed on they will have a go – that is all they do .
Look someone in the face and the words “ Hi , how are you ? ” spring ready for action .
See someone looking at an empty plate at lunch and the words “ Would you like some more bread ? ” just jump out of your mouth .
That is why I suggested we not speak at all during this weekend – not at all – not one word .
This is why I suggested we not even look at each other or communicate in any other way ( apart from during the discussion periods ) .
There is no need .
And when we do n’t – well the memes have much less chance to jump into our lovely freshly weeded minds .
They have to wait their turn , and our minds stay clear and open .
I first got infected by the meme meme about five years ago .
What made the ideas so exciting was that memetics can provide new answers to difficult questions , such as why we humans have such big brains , where language came from , and why we can be so altruistic .
But gradually I found that the ideas spawned a new attitude in my practice .
In meditation I would see these fearsome inner conversations starting up and think ‘ oh there comes that meme again ’ .
By seeing them as memes , out only for their own selfish replication , I could much more easily let them go .
Indeed I could laugh happily at all these little bits of selfish information zooming around , hopping from brain to brain , brain to book , book to computer , and computer to phone .
How can you take them so seriously when they are all just memes ?
I hope this understanding may help you in letting go too .
And who is doing that letting go ?
That question , too , yields to a memetic answer .
Perhaps one day we might have another weekend and take the idea of memes a little further in exploring the nature of self and consciousness .
I would like to thank everyone who came on the memes weekend for making my first ever experience of leading a retreat so rewarding .

ESRI , a leading GIS software provider , has released a public version of its ArcGIS JavaScript API that allows developers to integrate GIS functionality with web applications .
The API works with RESTful services from ESRI 's recently released ArcGIS Server 9.3 and there are also Javascript extensions for use with Google Maps and Microsoft Virtual Earth .
According to ESRI :
You can use the ArcGIS JavaScript API to bring maps and tasks from ArcGIS Server into your web applications .
For example , you can : Display an interactive map of your own data
Execute a GIS model on the server and display the results
Display your data on an ArcGIS Online base map
Search for features or attributes in your GIS data and display the results
Search for addresses and display the results
Our API directory now includes an ArcGIS JavaScript API profile with additional details .
You can also familiarize yourself with the API through ESRI 's API Reference pages as well as Samples and a set of " community " pages .
Developers familiar with the Dojo JavaScript Toolkit will be keen to know that the ArcGIS JavaScript API is built on the Dojo toolkit , thereby providing access to the various Dojo tools including dijits ( widgets ) .
The JavaScript extensions provide a great option for developers looking to tap into the best of both worlds .
Google Maps Mania and Mapperz have both covered the Google Maps extension , and additional information on the Virtual Earth extension is available from Virtual Earth , an Evangelist 's Blog .
With the release of this API , ESRI has ventured forth to make the integration of GIS web services much more accessible to the general public .
There is one catch , however .
Unless you or your organization have implemented ArcGIS Server 9.3 , you will need to rely on other implementations of ArcGIS Server that have been exposed as RESTful web services .
This means that to truly integrate GIS functionality customized for your own needs , you will need to have access to your own ArcGIS Server instance .
ESRI does provide some sample servers that can be used as testbeds for learning the API , and the ArcGIS Online services ( a suite of different geospatial web services ) can also be consumed via the API .
The release of this API has been long awaited by developers in the GIS community , and it's a good first step towards leveraging the robust and sophisticated GIS capabilities of ArcGIS Server for use in web applications .
The JavaScript extensions are a welcome addition to the ever - growing JavaScript tool set for map mashup developers , and it will be interesting to see how map mashups evolve as the ability to integrate this type of GIS functionality increases .
Mapping APIs continue to be popular , and this new API is a welcome addition to the 60 + mapping APIs already listed in our directory .
Crisis in the Caucasus .
What Were They Smoking in the White House ?
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis
DIGG THIS
The Bush administration appears to have pulled off its latest military fiasco in the Caucasus .
What was supposed to have been a swift and painless takeover of rebellious South Ossetia by America ’s favorite new ally , Georgia , has turned into a disaster that left Georgia battered , Russia enraged , and NATO badly demoralized .
Not bad for two days work .
Equally important , Russia ’s Vladimir Putin swiftly and decisively checkmated the Bush administration ’s clumsy attempt last week to expand US influence into the Caucasus , and made the Americans and their Georgian satraps look like fools .
We are not facing a return to the Cold War — yet .
But the current US - Russian crisis over Georgia , a tiny nation of only 4.6 million , and its linkage to a US anti-ballistic missile system in Eastern Europe , is deeply worrying and increasingly dangerous .
On 7 August , Georgia ’s president , Mikheil Saakashvili , ordered his US and Israeli - advised and equipped army to invade the breakaway region of South Ossetia , which has been struggling for independence from Georgia since 1992 .
Most of its people were Russian citizens who wanted union with Russian North Ossetia .
If not directly behind Georgia ’s invasion of South Ossetia , Washington had to have been at least fully aware of Saakashvili ’s plans .
The Georgian Army was trained and equipped by US and Israeli military advisors stationed with its troops down to battalion level .
CIA and Israel ’s Mossad operated important intelligence stations in Tbilisi and coordinated plans with Saakashvili , whose political opponents have long accused him of being very close to CIA and the Pentagon .
Georgia ’s attack on South Ossetia was launched while the world was absorbed by the Beijing Olympics , and Prime Minister Putin was in the Chinese capital .
The attack was clearly planned to be a lightening strike that would occupy all of South Ossetia and then Abkhazia before Moscow could react , presenting the Kremlin with a fait accompli .
Who in Bush ’s or Cheney ’s office approved this stupid adventure ?
Why did the very smart Israelis get sucked into this imbroglio ?
Saakashvili ’s stealth " coup de main " quickly turned into a disaster .
Russia ’s 58th Army responded by routing Georgian forces and delivering a humiliating strategic and psychological blow to the Bush administration .
Saakashvili fell right into Moscow ’s trap .
Georgia and Russia have been feuding since 1992 over two Georgian ethnic enclaves , South Ossetia and Abkhazia , whose people differ in ethnicity and language from Georgians and who wanted to rejoin Russia .
The young , US - educated Saakashvili became Georgia ’s president in 2003 after an uprising , believed organized by CIA and financed by US money , overthrew the former leader , Eduard Shevardnadze .
I came to know and respect Shevardnadze in Moscow when he was Mikhail Gorbachev ’s principal ally and architect of Soviet reform .
Had the able , clever Shevardnadze still been in power , this misadventure would never have happened .
Saakashvili quickly became the golden boy of US rightwing neoconservatives and their Israeli allies , who held him a model of how to turn former Russian - dominated states into " democratic " US allies .
Georgian critics claim Saakashvili kept power by intimidation , bribery , and vote rigging .
The youthful Georgian leader , his head swelled by promises of US support and NATO membership , launched a war of words against Moscow .
Amazingly , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , a supposed Russian expert , even publicly assured Saakashvili that the US would " fight " for Georgia .
Washington ’s latest fiasco falls squarely into her lap .
US money , military trainers , advisers , and intelligence agents poured into the former Soviet Republic of Georgia .
Israeli arms dealers , businessmen and intelligence agents quickly followed , reportedly selling some $ 200 million or more of military equipment to the Georgian government .
By expanding its influence into Georgia , the Bush administration brazenly flouted agreements with Moscow made by president George H.W. Bush not to expand NATO into the former USSR .
President Bill Clinton and George W. Bush both violated this pact .
Under the feeble Yeltsin regime , bankrupt Russia could do nothing .
But under Putin , newly wealthy Russia finally pushed back after a long series of provocations fromWashington .
Russia ’s tough deputy prime minister , Sergei Ivanov , sneeringly observed that Georgia had become a " US satellite . "
He was absolutely right .
And Ivanov , a former KGB colleague of Vlad Putin , knows a satellite when he sees one .
Georgia provided the US oil and gas pipeline routes from Azerbaijan , Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan that bypassed Russian territory .
Russia was furious its Caspian Basin energy export monopoly had been broken , vowing revenge .
Now that the Russians have checkmated the US and client Georgia , South Ossetia and Abkhazia will likely move into Russia ’s orbit .
The west rightly backed independence of Kosovo from Serbia .
The peoples of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , who are ethnically and linguistically different from Georgians , should have as much right to secede from Georgia .
Besides thwarting Bush ’s clumsy attempt to further advance US influence into Russia ’s Caucasian underbelly , Putin delivered a stark warning to Ukraine and the Central Asian states : do n’t get too close to Washington .
Putin put the US on the strategic defensive and showed that NATO ’s new eastern reaches — the Baltic , Bulgaria , Romania , and the Caucasus — are largely indefensible .
It ’s a good thing Georgia was not admitted to NATO , as the White House had reportedly promised Saakashvili .
Had Georgia been admitted before this crisis , the US and its NATO allies would have been in a state of war with Russia .
Disturbingly , Germany ’s conservative prime minister , Angelika Merkel , rushed to Tbilisi to assure Saakashvili that her nation still backed NATO membership for Georgia .
Is the west really ready to be dragged into a potential nuclear war for the sake of South Ossetia ?
Are American and German troops ready to fight in the Caucasus ?
Georgia is a bridge too far for NATO .
President George Bush , VP Dick Cheney and Sen. John McCain all resorted to table pounding and Cold War rhetoric against Russia .
McCain , whose senior foreign policy advisor is a neoconservative and was a registered lobbyist for Georgia , demanded that the US and NATO " punish " Russia and put it into diplomatic isolation .
Unfortunately , the indignant John McCain ’s could not even properly pronounce " Abkhazia . "
America ’s neocon amen chorus demanded a confrontation with Russia , chanting their usual mantras about Munich , appeasement and the myths of World War II .
One certainly wondered if the Caucasian fracas was not staged by the Republicans to provide Sen.
McCain with the " three a.m. phone call " he has been longing for and a chance to sound tough .
This he did , even though his rhetoric was empty and his solutions vapid .
Barack Obama ducked the issue or issued a few tepid bromides about halting " Russian aggression . "
Meanwhile , hypocrisy flew thicker than shellfire .
Bush , who ordered the invasion of Afghanistan , Iraq and Somalia , and is threatening war against Iran , accused Russia of " bullying " and " aggression . "
Putin , who crushed the life out of Chechnya ’s independence movement , piously claimed his army was saving Ossetians from Georgian ethnic cleansing and protecting their quest for independence .
Bush and McCain demand Russia be punished and isolated .
The humiliated Bush is sending some US troops to Georgia to deliver " humanitarian " aid .
Equally worrisome , the US rushed to sign a pact with Warsaw to station anti-missile missiles and anti-aircraft batteries , manned by US troops , in Poland .
This response is dangerous , highly provocative , and immature .
The next president will have to deal with the Bush administrations reckless and foolish acts in the Mideast , Eastern Europe , Afghanistan and now , the Caucasus
The west must accept Russia has vital national interests in the Caucasus and the former USSR .
Russia is a great power and must be afforded respect .
The days of treating Russia like a banana republic are over .
Have we learned nothing from World War I or II , both of which began with flare - ups in obscure Sarajevo and the Danzig Corridor ?
The US ’s most important foreign policy concern is keeping correct relations with Russia , which has thousands of nuclear warheads pointed at North America .
Georgia is a petty sideshow .
US missiles in Poland and radars in the Czech Republic are a dangerous , unnecessary provocation that is sowing dragon ’s teeth for future confrontation .

Many hedge funds set up subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands and other low - tax locales so their investors can pay lower taxes on a certain amount of their activity .
Hedge funds lobbying with stealth
Sometimes in Washington , stealth is more important than strength .
In recent years , hedge fund managers , who oversee those secretive and lightly regulated pools of billions of dollars of investment capital , have gotten increasingly worried about whether Washington will change tax rules for offshore investors .

Many hedge funds set up subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands and other low - tax locales so their investors can pay lower taxes on a certain amount of their activity .
If Congress were to make a grab for that money by changing the tax rules governing the hedge funds , it could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new taxes at the hedge funds ’ expense .
Adding to their anxiety is the prospect of an unfriendly Barack Obama administration taking office in January and working in league with its Democratic allies on Capitol Hill .
Lobbyists working for hedge funds feel a sense of increasing urgency to make progress now , while more sympathetic Republicans control the White House .
But how to argue their point in Washington ?
Typically , lobbyists would mount a large public relations campaign and aggressively push their message on the Hill .
But it could be a tough political sell for often unpopular billionaire hedge fund executives to mount a high - visibility campaign to keep tax breaks in the Cayman Islands .
So instead , the Managed Fund Association , which represents hedge funds , is taking a different tack .
It ’s quietly pushing for a tax ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department that many feel could lay an important behind - the - scenes precedent in the offshore tax fight .
The ruling itself would affect the ability of offshore funds to buy distressed debt in the United States .
Another reason hedge fund lobbyists are so eagerly anticipating the ruling : “ This is a canary in the coal mine , ” said one lobbyist who represents hedge funds .
“ They figure they can get a better answer this year , as opposed to next year with either an Obama or a [ John ] McCain administration , ” he added .
For now , their focus is on the short - term objective .
In April , the MFA sent a letter to the IRS and the Treasury Department asking for written guidance on whether offshore hedge funds can negotiate with U.S. debtors without having to pay U.S. taxes at the corporate rate .
Generally , offshore entities are allowed to buy and sell U.S. securities without becoming a “ U.S. trade or business ” under the tax code and thus becoming subject to U.S. taxes at the corporate rate .
That ’s a well - established principle .
But a new gray area has emerged as offshore investors become more interested in purchasing distressed debt such as subprime mortgages , credit card debt and car loans from the current holders , such as mortgage lenders , credit card companies and auto lenders .
In theory , this can be a lucrative move if the debt is sold cheaply enough , and the hedge funds can negotiate profitable payment schedules from the debtors .
It could also be a good thing for the debtors , who would get a chance to restructure their payments around a reduced principal .
But would negotiating with homeowners or other debtors over revised financing terms cross the line from being a passive investor in U.S. assets to an active “ trade or business ” that must pay U.S. taxes at the corporate rate ?
The hedge fund lobby wants its members to be able to buy the debt , do the restructuring and still be considered “ passive ” investors for tax purposes .
The MFA , not surprisingly , argues that cutting such deals should n’t trigger U.S. tax liability .
And what ’s more , it argues that it ’s in the national interest for foreign investors to be allowed to buy distressed U.S. debts and negotiate with the debtors — which could provide a way out for thousands of subprime mortgage holders under reduced payment terms .
“ MFA and its members strongly believe that non-U.S. investors would be more likely to provide significant additional liquidity for distressed debt ” if the administration issues written guidance , the trade association said in its letter .
What ’s got the hedge fund representatives particularly on edge is that a decision could come at any time .
Because there ’s not likely to be a formal rule - making , only informal written guidance , there may not be any public meetings , comment periods or other activity in advance of a decision .
There ’s also no guarantee that President Bush ’s administration will take any action at all this year .
“ We ’re not going to comment on whether or not we ’re going to issue any guidance in this area , ” said Treasury spokesman Andrew DeSouza .
An IRS spokesman did not return calls for comment .
If a ruling does come , some hedge fund managers and their lobbyists plan to use it for long - term leverage into the other offshore taxation issues that will likely come up for debate again next year .
At stake for the hedge funds could be their use of certain so - called blocker entities structured to avoid U.S. taxes .
Many funds set up offshore corporations in low - tax locales such as the Cayman Islands or Bermuda in order to lure investment capital from foreign investors and tax - exempt U.S. entities such as pension funds and foundations .
If nonprofit investors invested directly in the hedge funds themselves , rather than through their offshore blockers , they would have to pay what ’s known as unrealized business tax .
By using the offshore corporation , though , they avoid paying that levy .
Keeping the blocker setup legal is vitally important to hedge fund managers , who count on the enormous pension funds and nonprofit foundations for a significant chunk of the capital they invest .
Any tax change that threatened that flow of cash could be disastrous for them .
It ’s widely expected that the blockers will come under scrutiny next year , because eliminating them could be one way to raise an enormous amount of tax revenue for the government to pay for expensive initiatives or other tax cuts proposed by the new administration .
Both the House and Senate tax - writing committees have held hearings on offshore hedge fund tax issues within the past year .
In such a public forum , the advocates of offshore blockers know that they ’re not easy to defend , and they fear that a high - profile fight over offshore tax breaks that benefit hedge fund billionaires is bound to be politically difficult .
Kaz Hirai and the boys at Sony are all about profitability .
They do n't just throw these slides together for kicks ; they mean it .
As part of the company 's accelerated " cost down efforts , " the PlayStation 3 will be getting smaller , cooler , cheaper , more efficient and generally awesomer RSX graphics chips starting this fall .

Kaz noted in his corporate strategy speech earlier today that the Cell processor has been manufactured with 65nm process technology as of " last holiday . "
Both were originally manufacture at 90nm , which was charming at first , but now seems rather vulgar .

A state trooper took road rage to a whole new level – writing up five phony traffic tickets to a Brooklyn man as payback after getting into a heated argument with him over a parking spot , authorities said yesterday .
Lester Hooper , 35 , wrote the summonses – alleging traffic violations in three Westchester towns from Jan. 28 to Feb.
6 – without ever pulling over Derrick Perry , according to the Westchester County DA ’s Office .
The sham tickets , featuring Perry ’s name and license - plate number , were issued in retribution for a parking beef in Brooklyn , officials said .
The State Police Internal Affairs Bureau gave no details of the Jan. 26 quarrel – but Hooper ’s lawyer , Pat Bonanno , would only say it involved “ offensive ” contact between Perry and Hooper ’s wife .
Perry said Hooper was mad over an incident in which Perry did n’t pull his truck out of a spot fast enough for the impatient cop waiting to park .
“ He just came out like some sort of big shot , ” Perry told the Journal News .
“ He ’s a liar .
He ’s just trying to cover up because he messed up . ”
The trooper was busted following a three - month investigation into allegations he had issued the bogus tickets to Perry .
Hooper wrote a ticket falsely alleging that Perry was going 80 mph in a 55 - mph zone in Harrison , and had failed to signal while driving on Interstate 287 in the days following the Brooklyn run-in , according to court papers .
Hooper allegedly also gave Perry tickets for speeding in Greenburgh and White Plains .
Hooper , a former FedEx worker , was arraigned yesterday in Harrison , Greenburgh and White Plains on charges of offering a false instrument for filing and issuing a false certificate , both felonies , along with three counts of official police misconduct .
Hooper was released after posting $ 2,000 bail .
He did not come to the door at his home on Brooklyn Avenue in East Flatbush last night when approached by a Post reporter .
His car – with an orange , state - issued E - ZPass tag attached to the windshield – was in the driveway .
Hooper , a three - year State Police veteran based in Tarrytown with the task of patrolling Interstates 87 , 95 and 287 , has been suspended without pay .

You ’ve got grand plans for your blog .
Naturally , it ’s going to be big – really big .
But before you hit your rhythm with insightful , savvy posts , there are practical considerations – like where to host it .
With so many web hosts to choose from , that ’s no easy decision .
That ’s why we compiled this handy guide to where the web ’s top 100 blogs ( by Technorati ranking on August 8 2008 ) are hosted .
If they ’re good enough for these guys , right … ?
Top Blogger ’s Favourite Web Hosts
This graph shows every web hosting company appearing more than once in the top 100 .
It excludes sites hosted in - house and Akamai ’s caching service .
And the Winner Is …
Media Temple and Datagram are twice as popular as any other host on the list , ignoring free blog hosting ( eg , BlogSpot ) and in - house hosting ( eg , AOL ’s blogs ) .
These two web hosting companies account for 19 of the top 100 blogs between them .
However , six of the Datagram blogs are published by one company ( Gawker Media ) .
Ignoring Gawker ’s multiple votes , one host is clearly far more popular than the rest .
Media
Temple hosts over twice as many top blogs as any other web hosting company in the list .
Surprise Entries & Omissions
DreamHost are best known for offering cheap , shared hosting , rather than for hosting high - traffic sites .
Given their customer offering – no SLA , no telephone support , no dedicated servers – it ’s a surprise to see them make the top 100 .
Likewise , we ’re surprised to learn that eight of the top 100 blogs are hosted on BlogSpot – Blogger ’s basic , free blog host – and Six Apart .
None of the top 100 blog ’s are using WordPress.com ’s hosted service , a surprise given the popularity of WordPress itself .

You probably know the importance of using your credit card within responsible limits and paying the bill on time every month .
But an important factor you may be overlooking is how often you use your credit card .
In fact , if you do n't use your credit card often enough , your account could be closed .
Though ideal credit card usage varies by issuer , it 's recommended that you use your card at least once every three to six months .
Here 's why .
Why Credit Card Usage Matters
It might seem strange that how often you use your credit card matters , but there are some general guidelines you should follow when it comes to credit card usage .
Namely , you should make sure to use it often enough that it remains active .
Using your credit card keeps your issuer from closing the account for inactivity , says J.R. Duren , a personal finance reporter for consumer product research website HighYa.com .
" If you stop using your card , it 's inevitable that after a certain amount of time , your credit card issuer is going to close your account . "
Usually , this can end up harming your credit .
But even if your card company has n't closed the account , some might stop reporting your account to the credit bureaus after several months of inactivity .
Daniel Gillaspia , an attorney and creator of UponArriving.com , a blog that covers developments in travel credit card rewards , says , " There really is no universal standard for shutting down inactive accounts .
Some banks may be more proactive and shut it down after six to 12 months of no activity , while others may allow an inactive account to stay open for a couple of years . "
It 's common for store - branded cards , for instance , to allow longer periods of inactivity since you might not shop at a particular retailer as often as you 'd use a general purpose card .
Maintaining some activity on your credit card can not only keep your account open , but you also remain a good customer .
If you apply for other cards from that same issuer , it will see that you 're an active user and perhaps view you as a more profitable customer , says Gillaspia .
In general , you should plan to use your card every six months .
However , if you want to be extra safe , aim for every three .
Some card issuers will explicitly state in the card agreement what length of time is considered to be inactive .
However , keep in mind that if you 're carrying a balance on the account , you could keep it active simply by continuing to make payments .
You do n't necessarily need to make new charges to be considered active unless you 've paid the balance in full .
What Happens When Your Credit Card Becomes Inactive
Why do credit card companies care how often you use your card ?
It comes down to how card issuers make money .
One way card companies make money is by charging merchants a small percentage of each transaction you make through them .
In addition to these processing fees , card companies charge interest on your card balance if you do n't pay it in full .
If you do n't use your card or carry a balance , there 's no way for the credit card company to collect either of these fees .
Meanwhile , you 're costing it money to maintain your account .
Credit card companies have only a limited amount of credit they can extend among all of their customers .
In the past , card issuers could charge inactivity fees to make up the cost of servicing idle accounts .
However , the Credit CARD
Act of 2009 put an end to that practice .
It 's in the issuer 's best interest to close down inactive accounts and extend credit to consumers who are more likely to use it .
Though credit card issuers are required to provide notice when making major changes to your account , such as raising the interest rate , that 's not the case when it comes to closing inactive accounts .
Usually , they can close your account without warning and will only provide notice after the fact .
In many cases , however , your card issuer will contact you with a warning and give you a chance to use your card , since it would prefer to keep an existing account in good standing than close the account and find a new customer .
There are some exceptions .
In California , for instance , credit card issuers are required to provide 30 days ' notice before closing an inactive account .
The laws surrounding this practice vary by state , so you might want to investigate the rules where you live .
How a Closed Account Affects Your Credit
Aside from the inconvenience of having your account unexpectedly shut down , there could be negative repercussions for your credit .
How impactful an account closure is depends on your credit profile .
One of the biggest consequences of having your credit card account closed is its effect on your credit utilization – the amount of credit you 're using compared with the total credit available to you – which makes up 30 percent of your credit score .
For example , say you had one credit card with a $ 1,000 limit and a $ 500 balance and a second credit card with no balance and a $ 2,000 limit .
In this case , your credit utilization would be nearly 17 percent ( $ 500 / $ 3,000 ) .
But if your $ 2,000 - limit card were closed due to inactivity , that would bring your utilization up to 50 percent ( $ 500 / $ 1,000 ) .
Generally , experts recommend keeping your utilization under 30 percent ; otherwise , it could negatively impact your credit score .
Another way your credit could be affected is by decreasing your total number of accounts .
This would likely only be a problem if you had a small number of credit accounts or short credit history .
Finally , your variety of credit could also be impacted .
Again , if you had few accounts and not many other credit cards , this situation would be more harmful to your credit than if you had a long credit history and many types of accounts to your name .
Can You Use Your Credit Card too Much ?
On the other end of the spectrum , you should watch out for overusing your credit card .
However , it 's not necessarily the frequency that can be a problem , but rather how much you charge .
" The main mistake you can make with overuse is by using the card to make purchases you can't afford or running up your balance quickly and not paying it off , " Duren says .
For instance , if you charge more purchases than you can afford to pay off at the end of the month , you 'll end up carrying a balance .
This means interest will accrue , causing your balance to grow further .
A high balance can cause your credit utilization to become too high .
However , even if you have the money to pay off your balance by the due date , running up many transactions during the billing cycle can also present a problem .
That 's because your balance is usually reported to the credit bureaus when your statement closes , not after your payment due date .
" If you do n't pay off your high balance when the credit card issuer reports your balance to the credit bureaus , it will seem like you 're maxing out your card when , in fact , you could pay it off immediately , " says Duren .
" What your credit card issuer reports ends up not being an accurate reflection of your financial situation , and your credit scores will drop . "
If you do end up using your card a lot during the month , it can be helpful to pay off some of the balance midcycle so that it never gets too high .
Consider asking your credit card issuer for a credit line increase if you often charge more than 30 percent of your limit and pay it off each month .
How to Keep Your Credit Cards Active
Rotate card usage .
If you have one main credit card that you use for everyday purchases and other cards that tend to sit in your wallet unused , it might be helpful to put them on a rotation schedule .
For example , swap your primary card with a lesser - used card every three months .
The downside to this option is if one card offers better rewards than others , you might lose out on some earnings .
Create a calendar reminder .
Another option is to set a calendar reminder to use your cards every few months .
For instance , you could set a reminder every 90 days to perform a small transaction on each of your cards , then set another reminder for a few weeks later to pay off the balances before the due date arrives .

Jennifer Van Bergen is an author , activist and educator who currently teaches English and writing at Sante Fe Community College in Gainesville , Florida .
Professionally , she 's also a journalist , legal analyst and non-practicing attorney who 's written , spoken out and debated widely on Patriot Act justice and other civil liberties issues .
Her newest book is titled " Archetypes for Writers : Using the Power of Your Subconscious . "
It analyzes the component skills writers need to learn about their " own already - existing characters " through a series of exercises in the book .
Her other vitally important recent book and subject of this review is called " The Twilight of Democracy : The Bush Plan for America " written in 2005 .
It 's a clear and powerfully relevant analysis of the threat to freedom , democracy and justice in America today under the Bush regime .
As the author puts it : " ( We live in a time when ) civil liberties have been broadly violated to an unprecedented degree .... My goal ( in the book ) is to lay bare what the government does and is doing , and why it is so profoundly anti-democractic " and a danger to everyone .
The book is in two parts .
In Book I , Van Bergen discusses constitutional law , the types of courts and standards of review established to administer it , and the dangerous path we 're now on toward a fascist state under George Bush .
Book II then reviews " The Bush Plan " for America under Patriot Act justice ; the pervasive culture of fear , extreme secrecy and illegal sweeping universal surveillance ; permanent state of war for world dominance ; and network of barbaric torture - prisons where anyone for any reason may be labeled an " unlawful enemy combatant " and unjustly consigned to the awaiting hell within them .
Book I - Deciphering the Democratic Code
Van Bergen starts off by explaining the clear and present danger of a president who disdains the law and ignores it in pursuit of whatever he wishes .
The result is " Freedom and democracy in America are in grave danger , " and all humanity is affected as well .
By his actions , Van Bergen believes the Bush administration declared war on the Republic and has gone so far astray , " there may be no going back . "
She may be right , it may already be too late , and she explains why in her opening chapter .
Down the Road to Fascism
Van Bergen cites the following signs of a nation " already more than three - quarters of the way down the road to fascism : " the stolen 2000 presidential election , Patriot Acts I and II , illegal mass surveillance , torture - prison gulag , culture of extreme secrecy and fear , contempt for the rule of law , a permanent state of war and more .
We may already be past the tipping point of its classical definition :
-- a state combining corporatism with strong elements of patriotism and nationalism ;
-- a claimed messianic Almighty - directed mission ; and
-- characterized by authoritarian rule backed by iron - fisted militarism and homeland security enforcers , mass illegal spying , and intolerance of dissent under a president who disdains the law .
Van Bergen calls these components " The Bush Plan to subvert and overthrow democratic systems " and values .
It 's not just the work of one man or a group of loyalist supporters .
It 's become part of our corporate culture that thrives on achieving imperial global dominance .
It 's being pursued by waging war on the world under a national security Patriot Act - governed police state tolerating no dissent .
Van Bergen discusses the Act briefly before getting into a more in - depth treatment in Book II .
She shows how the law dilutes constitutional standards by amending and combining three separate but parallel legal systems listed below .
They use different courts , are now merged and are exploited under Patriot Act justice :
( 1 ) criminal laws and procedures ,
( 2 ) foreign intelligence law , and
( 3 ) immigration law .
Post 9/11 , Van Bergen notes people are out of the loop believing " constitutional law is hard to understand " and strictly the realm of theoreticians .
How does the Constitution relate to " getting ahead in life , with making money , " she asks .
It 's central to it if people begin realizing it's what guarantees their rights in a free society without which nothing is guaranteed but government repression against anyone considered a threat , true or not .
The basic laws of the land are n't hard to understand .
What 's hard is getting people to know their rights under them , realize they 're now at risk and be willing to take a stand for what they can't afford to ignore .
The Law is King - If We Can Keep It
We like believing we 're a country of laws , not men .
It 's far from true , wo n't ever be unless demanded from the grassroots , and under the Bush administration it 's pure fantasy .
Its officials scorn the law at home and abroad .
Van Bergen counts the ways :
-- refusing to adhere to the four Geneva Convention treaties that are the supreme law of the land ;
-- opting out of the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) 104 other nations belong to , including virtually all Western democracies ; in addition 42 others signed the Rome Statute but have n't yet ratified it ;
-- condoning torture and allowing or ignoring other human rights abuses ; the Nazis called torture " Verscharfte Vernehmung , " or " enhanced interrogation " leaving few telltale signs of abuses committed ; George Bush secretly authorized his own version of harsh " enhanced interrogation " in a July , 2006 executive order ; it was unmentioned on October 5 when he confronted a public uproar and contemptuously stated : " This government does not torture people ; " he also ignored secret Department of Justice ( DOJ ) legal opinions confirming his administration condones " the harshest interrogation techniques ever used by the CIA ; "
-- scorning Bill of Rights laws that guarantee free expression , religion , assembly , representation by competent counsel in a criminal proceeding , fair and speedy trials by a jury of peers , protection from illegal searches and seizures and much more .
These and other rights are constitutionally guaranteed that in a nation of laws " is considered the bottom line " and inviolate .
Not so in the age of George Bush with the DOJ and courts taking great " balancing test " liberties when the administration raises issues of national security , justified or not .
Van Bergen asks " Do we want a country of laws and not of power - mongering men ? "
Getting it means earning it and that begins with understanding our rights and how legal systems work .
They 're all underpinned by the supreme law of the land in the benchmark Constitution most people know about but not what 's in it , what it means , and how , in fact , it works for good or ill .
In spite of it , governments always side with privilege and especially capital interests .
Ordinary private citizens are hard - pressed to get justice without competent and generally expensive legal counsel few can afford .
Our Individual Rights
Here Van Bergen focuses on due process , free speech and association , legal representation , and freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures .
She notes these rights are n't absolute because democratic governments try to balance the " good of the one " against " the good of the many " when it comes to issues of peace and security .
The result is individuals often lose out for the supposed greater good that may only be the workings of a repressive state .
That 's what 's happening today in America .
Due Process
Also called " procedural due process , " this term only applies when a person 's " life , liberty , or property " is at stake , and the government is constitutionally required to provide due process legal procedures so a person gets a proper defense .
Often in the past , this right was n't afforded .
Today it 's being willfully swept away under police state justice .
First Amendment Freedoms - Speech , the Press , Religion , Assembly and Association
No rights are more vital than these as without them no others are possible , but today , under George Bush , they 're being lost .
As Van Bergen puts it : " democracy cannot exist without these freedoms . "
Indeed not , and it's why earlier crumbs of them are now threatened more than ever under Patriot Act justice and other harsh laws like the Military Commissions
Act enacted after Van Bergen 's book was published .
She points out free expression , the press and right to assemble are most threatened today even though they 're constitutionally guaranteed .
That does n't deter George Bush who on July 17 , 2007 issued another of his " one-man " Executive Order ( EO ) decrees " Blocking Property of Certain Persons Who Threaten Stabilization Efforts in Iraq . "
Nothing in the Constitution implicitly or explicitly allows for EOs , but once issued , even illegally , they become the law of the land unless or until courts rule otherwise .
This one criminalizes dissent so that all anti-war protests are now illegal , and persons participating in them are subject to arrest , prosecution and loss of their property .
That 's how a police state works , and that 's the condition in America under George Bush 's contemptuous flouting of the law to crush all opposition .
Fourth Amendment Rights
This law protects people from illegal searches and seizures , it 's not absolute under the best of conditions , and it 's practically null and void today .
Later in her book , Van Bergen shows how the Patriot Act allows the government " to mix standards from different , incompatible areas of law " ( such as criminal investigations , foreign intelligence and immigration ) that amounts to a " witch 's brew .... of ingredients poisonous to a democratic government or way of life . "
The Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel
This law provides that defendants shall " have the assistance of counsel " in all criminal prosecutions during and prior to trial and to free assistance if unable to pay for it .
In addition , attorney - client confidentiality and privilege are protected under law .
Patriot
Act justice threatens these rights for immigrants , so - called " unlawful enemy combatants , " cases in which the government feels national security trumps confidentiality , and in situations where lawyers ( like Lynne Stewart ) are targeted for defending " unpopular " clients .
Van Bergen concludes this section saying 9/11 changed everything , the gloves came off , and constitutionally protected rights no longer apply at the government 's discretion .
Real democracies do n't work that way , America always fell short in the past , but the bar was lowered to bottom - scraping standards post - 9/11 .
Now the unjustifiable is justified in the name of national security because the president says so , law or no law .
That , however , openly constitutes " an exact reversal of the principles in our Constitution . "
That 's the condition today and why Van Bergen 's book is so important to explain it .
The Constitutional Code
Van Bergen calls the constitutional doctrines of separation of powers , judicial review and probable cause " code words invest ( ing ) the Constitution with meaning . "
How they 're abused , however , explains a lot about today 's frightening situation under a president who thinks and acts ( in his words ) like the Constitution is " just a goddamned piece of paper . "
1. Separation of Powers
The framers crafted a government in three parts so no one of them got too much power although it never worked out that way from the start .
Nonetheless , their idea was for the legislative branch to make laws , the executive to execute them , and the judiciary to interpret them .
The doctrine is called the " separation of powers " that 's the " core protection against tyranny " if enforced and utterly meaningless if not like today under George Bush .
Since 9/11 , Democrats and Republicans abdicated their responsibility and have marched ever since in lockstep on virtually everything the administration wants .
Rhetoric aside , almost nothing 's changed to this day in spite of six and a half years of disastrous and reckless governance outside the law .
Van Bergen sums it up saying , in the absence of checks and balances , " government power ( has ) run amok " under the Bush Plan .
2. Judicial Review
According to law professor Jethro Lieberman , judicial review is " the power of courts to declare laws and acts of government unconstitutional " although nothing in the Constitution allows this practice .
Van Bergen adds , without this check on the other two branches , there 's " no remedy for bad laws ( and in fact ) no democracy . "
It differs from the notion of " judicial supremacy " meaning the High Court is the final arbiter on all constitutional issues .
3. Court Stripping
Examples of this practice are found in extremist laws like the 1996 Anti-Terrorism Law ( AEDPA ) , Patriot Acts I and II and other recent legislation as they restrict the ability of courts to review executive actions , and that 's not how democratic states function .
4. Probable Cause
Under the Fourth Amendment , neither arrest or search warrants are allowed without evidence of " probable cause " of criminal activity .
The Bush administration , however , views all legal constraints as quaint and fanciful .
It simply sweeps them away to do as it pleases to target anyone for any reason , real or concocted , in its sham " war on terrorism . "
Weak as they always were , post - 9/11 , constitutional protections are now an illusion .
They simply no longer exist despite all the pretense they do .
Types of Courts and Standards of Review
Van Bergen lists four types today , each functioning under very different legal standards :
-- regular federal civil and criminal courts called an " Article III court ; " here , in theory , convictions depend on there being proof beyond a reasonable doubt ; in practice , justice depends on how much of it defendants can buy in the form of competent legal counsel , and too few people can buy enough or any ;
-- immigration ( or Executive branch ) courts that rule on asylum and deportation issues ; they 're also called the Executive Office of Immigration Review ( EOIR ) ; these courts administer immigration law and handle cases under it involving asylum , deportation , immigration crimes and detentions pending review ;
-- military courts and tribunals do n't come under the federal civil justice system ; they 're for trying members of the armed services under the Uniform Code of Military Justice ( UCMJ ) and are used under the oppressive Military Commissions
Act for anyone the president calls an " unlawful enemy combatant , " real or imagined ; the greatest danger these courts pose is that under a real or concocted state of emergency , the president can declare martial law , suspend the Constitution , and consign any targeted individual to justice under these courts with no trial by jury , no habeas rights , no assigned competent defense counsel , and no right of appeal ;
-- FISA courts ( or FISC made up of 11 district court justices ) rule on obtaining foreign intelligence warrants under which no Fourth Amendment protections apply ;
The Patriot Act amended FISA to allow surveillance of US citizens whenever the administration claims it relates to a foreign intelligence investigation with obvious implications what this means ; the Democrat - led Congress went even further in early August as discussed below .
The above - listed courts operate under hugely differing standards , and Van Bergen notes a stark one in the case of military tribunals where civilians may now be tried on the whim of the president .
In these courts , due process is a fantasy as they 're run by , untrained in civil law , military officers , yet they 're empowered to render final judgments , beyond appeal , up to and including death sentences .
Serious abuses are common enough in civil and criminal courts .
In immigration , FISA and military ones , the notion of due process and fair and equal justice under the law is a non-starter .
All the above examples today , in fact , add up to a shredding of notions of " guilt beyond a reasonable doubt , " due process under the law , and " probable cause of criminal activity " to justify arrests and searches in the age of George Bush .
Van Bergen notes under the Patriot Act alone , criminal constitutional procedural standards are severely undermined so that the rule of law no longer applies any time the government says so .
That 's pretty scary if you 're the target .
Book II - " The Bush Plan "
Here Van Bergen gets into the meat of her book under " The Bush Plan " that contains " the elements of fascism . "
The Demise of Democracy - Part One
Intentional or not , the Bush administration charted a post - 9/11 course straight toward a full - blown national security fascist police state .
It already has all its oppressive trappings dressed up in modern - day garb , including high - sounding , fear - engendering , doublespeak language disguising it .
Strip off the mask and here 's a look :
-- Patriot Acts I and II ,
-- the Military Commissions Act ( aka the " torture authorization act " and much more ) ,
-- a permanent state of preventive wars under the concocted doctrine of " anticipatory self - defense " using first strike nuclear weapons ;
-- a climate of fear and extreme secrecy ;
-- universal illegal surveillance for any purpose all the time ;
-- disdain for domestic and international law with George Bush unconstitutionally usurping " unitary executive " powers Chalmers Johnson calls a " bald - faced assertion of presidential supremacy .... dressed up in legalistic mumbo jumbo ; "
-- criminalizing dissent ( Jefferson called " the highest form of patriotism " ) through legislation and illegal " one-man " decree Executive Orders ;
-- stealing elections ;
-- shredding civil liberties and rendering human rights a non-starter ;
-- controlling information through the dominant mass media functioning as collective national thought police gatekeepers " filtering " in all acceptable state propaganda and suppressing all vital and relevant information and analysis ;
-- rampant corruption in a corporatocracy ;
-- a culture of out - of - control militarism , and much more under the phony " war on terrorism " making democracy in America pure fantasy .
Van Bergen reviews all of the above in detail and other elements Laurence W. Britt listed in his article titled " Fascism Anyone ? "
Her conclusion : " Using Britt 's list , it is no stretch to call the Bush government fascist .... if Britt is believed , we 're already there . "
The Patriot Act - Part Two
Van Bergen states this act gives " tremendous powers to central authorities , undermine (s ) civil liberties , and enable (s ) suppression of opposition . "
It 's the " mainstay of government oppressive power ( as it ) authorizes and codifies a near - absolute and permanent invasion of ( our ) private lives , sets vast precedents in immigration law .... dissolving .... human rights ( and erecting ) a massive law enforcement apparatus ( targeting ) immigrant (s ) and citizen ( s ) ( worldwide ) . "
Van Bergen discusses the issues below before getting into the meat of the Act that opens the way for a vast menu of other abuses .
Guantanamo , Enemy Combatants , and Abu Ghraib
The Bush Administration usurped the unconstitutional right to detain any foreign national or US citizen without evidence and deny them due process , habeas or competent counsel with the right of appeal .
It also flouts domestic and international laws it denounces as " quaint and out of date . "
It wo n't allow them or any nation , body or individual to impede its plans for unchallengeable worldwide imperial dominance .
Anyone in the way may be consigned to torture - prison hellholes like Guanatanamo that was purposefully placed on foreign soil because those locations present a " minimal ' litigation risk . ' "
Being offshore was believed to make possible the denial of due process , habeas and judicial review rights as well as to be able to hold detainees beyond the law indefinitely .
Iraq : Preemptive war and International law
Van Bergen states
" The invasion of Iraq established the doctrine of preemptive ( or preventive ) war " with the US usurping an illegal right to attack another nation it claims is a current or future threat with no justifiable evidence to prove it .
The 1945 Nuremberg Charter said doing that is the " supreme international crime against peace " that constitutes the worst of all crimes of war and against humanity .
Van Bergen asserts attacking Iraq ( and Afghanistan ) " signal (s ) an end of the rule of law and avoid ( ance ) of accountability on a global scale . "
She cites other examples of contempt for the law as well .
The Coup in Haiti
The US has a long and disturbing history of intervening in Haiti 's affairs , deposing its leaders , and replacing them with acceptable puppets .
The Bush administration continued this practice on February 29 , 2004 when US Marines abducted and forcibly removed democratically elected President Jean - Bertrand Aristide and flew him against his will to the repressive Central African Republic .
Today he remains in exile in South Africa vowing to return even though the Bush administration asserts the right to prevent him from doing it .
US administrations have deposed many foreign leaders , and the Bush administration violates international laws " left and right , " so what 's the significance of Haiti , asks Van Bergen ?
" There is no ( other ) ' third world ' country ( anywhere ) closer ( in proximity ) to the US , " it 's also the " first ( ever ) black republic , " the sole one in the Western Hemisphere , and it won its independence through armed rebellion against repressive French foreign rule .
Haiti is much like what former Mexican dictator Porfirio Diaz said about his own country : " Poor Mexico , so far from God , so close to the US . "
Proximity to America has been Haiti's curse for over 200 years , and it still is .
Withdrawal from the International Criminal Court ( ICC )
The ICC was created by the 1998 Rome Statute and established in 2002 to prosecute individuals for genocide , crimes against humanity and war .
As of mid-2007 , 146 countries signed the Statute and 104 ratified it to become members except for a big absentee - America with Van Bergen saying withdrawing from the ICC ( after the Clinton administration signed the Statute ) " frees up the United States from international accountability for war crimes . "
The Bush administration made sure over 100 nations wo n't extradite Americans to the Hague by signing Bilateral Immunity Agreements ( BIAs ) with them , and in August , 2002 , Congress passed the American Servicemembers Protection Act ( called the Hague Invasion Act ) authorizing the President " any means necessary " to secure release of any American detained by or on behalf of the Court .
Prosecutions and Proceedings
Activists are prime Bush administration targets in its effort to crush all dissent and opposition .
It 's using the Patriot Act to do it along with bending other current and obscure older laws to bring criminal indictments .
Then on July 17 , George Bush issued another Executive Order criminalizing dissent by targeting anyone opposing the administration 's Iraq war effort with threats to seize their property .
Another EO followed August 2 against anyone seen undermining Lebanon 's corrupted pro-Western government claiming " Such actions constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States . "
Van Bergen notes these type actions by individuals or groups signal the notion that " activists = terrorists " and linking them together is the administration 's way to control , suppress and remove all opposition it finds threatening .
Activists are being targeted by grand jury subpoenas .
Before them they 're required to testify about unspecified federal law violations and then later allow that testimony to be used against them to charge perjury for some slightly incorrect or inaccurate statements .

MATRIX is a data mining effort standing for the Multistate Anti-Terrorism Exchange Program that police and federal authorities are using in some states .
It 's a form of mass scrutiny over the lives and activities of innocent people to learn if targets exhibit signs of being a terrorist or other type criminal .
MATRIX creates a " terrorism quotient " or High Terrorist Factor ( HTF ) that measures the likelihood individuals in the database are terrorists .
Van Bergen noted the ACLU believes the program is " an effort to recreate the discredited Total Information Awareness ( TIA ) data mining program at the state level . "
It shows the federal authorities are deep into efforts at all levels to spy on US citizens .
MATRIX is an unprecedented effort to do it within or outside the law .
It constitutes a massive invasion of privacy and violates our rights in a free society and is one of many repressive post - 9/11 unconstitutional tools the nation 's 16 spy agencies are using against us .
The Constitution does n't specifically mention a right to privacy , but Supreme Court decisions affirmed it over the years as a fundamental human right .
As such , it 's protected under the Ninth Amendment as well as the Third prohibiting the quartering of troops in homes , the Fourth affording protection from unreasonable searches and seizures , and the Fifth protecting against self - incrimination .
MATRIX and other intrusions enhance Patriot Act powers allowing them to persist outside of congressional oversight and judicial review .
It 's another part of the overall scheme to subvert the rule of law under George Bush police state justice .
Secrecy
The Bush administration built a culture of extreme secrecy from the start .
Van Bergen call this trait the " watchword of the Bush adminstration " by quoting Judge Keith of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals saying " Democracy dies behind closed doors " where under this administration they 're locked shut and bolted .
Policy for the last six and a half years has been a " blatant power grab .... an American coup , an American military dictatorship ( and ) an American fascist empire " that 's highlighted by what 's going on at Guantanamo , Abu Ghraib and other torture - prisons free from oversight or public scrutiny .
Van Bergen sums up saying the Bush administration exhibits the " common threads found in all fascist states , " and that should scare everyone .
This government , she says , is run " by a ruling elite of ( extremist Christian ) religious fanatics " wielding " unrestrained oppressive power " violating constitutional law , including the most precious of our rights under the First Amendment .
It 's flouted the rule of law and smashed civil liberties after " sull ( ying ) the name and reputation of the United States Supreme Court " by using the Court 's authority to seize power lawlessly and keep it .
Ever since , it 's been on the march for total world dominance and now threatens all humanity by its out - of - control actions .
The Patriot Act - Mainstay of Oppressive Power
Van Bergen calls this act " the most vivid component of the Bush Plan . "
Its danger lies in placing too much unchecked power in executive branch hands that creates an " enabling structure for fascism and oligarchy " that endangers democracy .
Specifically , the act creates three main threats to civil liberties : the erosion of due process , freedom of association , and the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures , and as a consequence , the loss of privacy .
(1) The Threat to Due Process
The Patriot Act threatens due process in two ways :
-- by permitting indefinite detentions of undocumented immigrants , it represents a slippery slope as law professor David Cole explains : " ( W ) hat we do to foreign nationals today often paves the way for what will be done to American citizens tomorrow , " and it 's already happening under the concocted notion of " unlawful enemy combatants " anyone for any reason can be called and face prosecution .
-- by the act's " designation provision " that authorizes the Attorney General or Secretary of State to call a foreign organization a terrorist group even if it is n't .
Further , the administrative designation is sealed to effectively render it beyond review or challenge .
(2) The Threat to Freedom of Association
" Designation " also threatens freedom of association as aliens and US citizens may be charged and prosecuted because of their claimed association with an " undesirable group . "
Van Bergen notes that post - 9/11 , many thousands of Muslims and Arabs were illegally rounded up , detained , imprisoned , abused , tortured and / or deported solely because of their faith .
By Bush administration reasoning , Muslims = " terrorists " and " Islamofascists , " especially those not white enough .
(3) The Fourth Amendment Threat : Surveillance and Privacy
Patriot
Act privacy issues fall under FISA that just got worse as prior to its August recess Congress cravenly caved to the politics of fear and hastily passed the White House crafted Protect America Act 2007 that amends FISA with doublespeak language Orwell would love .
The new law supposedly closes so - called " communication gaps " but will allow virtual unrestricted mass data - mining , monitoring , and intercept of domestic and foreign internet , cell phones and other new technology as well as transit international phone call traffic and emails .
The Act claims to restrict surveillance to foreign nationals " reasonably believed to be outside the United States " and will sunset in six months unless renewed as Congress is about to do for at least most of its provisions for six years .
In fact , this law targets everyone , including US citizens inside the country , if the AG or DNI claim they pose a potential terrorist or national security threat , and no evidence is needed to prove it .
Further , in an election year , renewal is virtually guaranteed with even harsher provisions added .
In point of fact , the new law allows near - unrestricted warrantless spying of anyone at the discretion of the AG or DNI .
It thus renders any notion of illegal searches and privacy rights null and void .
The Act effectively legalizes illegality by Fourth Amendment standards that Patriot Act provisions pretty much swept away earlier .
This is how things work in a police state where laws render privacy issues ( and all other freedoms ) null and void , and everyone is under constant surveillance and stripped of their rights .
When FISA was enacted , it was done to collect " foreign intelligence information " between or among " foreign powers " with FISC warrants only targeting foreigners .
The Patriot Act then amended the law to effectively target anyone the government so designates as long as it relates " to an ongoing investigation ( for a ) significant foreign intelligence purpose . "
Van Bergen highlights the threat ( now even greater ) with this example : " if you speak to a friend or relative in the Middle East and that person gave money .... to an ( humanitarian aid providing ) organization .... suspected of ties to terrorism .... you are a legitimate target for wire , phone , or computer taps under FISA . "
Even worse , you can be charged with terrorism , arrested , tried in a military tribunal as an " unlawful enemy combatant " and renditioned to a torture - prison hellhole forever - for having made an innocent phone call .
Van Bergen concludes saying the Patriot Act ( even without the new Protect America Act ) is so sweeping in scope , it 's impossible relating everything about it in a short book , let alone this review .
Instead , she highlighted areas in it relating to civil rights protections affecting due process and under the First and Fourth Amendments .
This oppressive act severely weakened them and with prosecutorial finesse effectively renders them null and void that threatens everyone with police state justice in the age of George Bush .
Ashcroft's Way - A Closer Look at the Patriot Act
In the hands of a man like former Attorney General John Ashcroft ( as well as Alberto Gonzales and Michael Mukasey ) , laws like the Patriot Act become repressive police state tools that sweep aside the rule of law .
Van Bergen shows how easily this Act can be twisted and misused by citing assertions about it Ashcroft made to justify its use and under what circumstances .
Preserving Life and Liberty
Ashcroft gave four reasons to justify using the Patriot Act to , in his judgment , preserve life and liberty .
(1) It provides tools for investigating terrorism and other crime while ignoring that laws were already available to do it pre-Patriot .
DOJ claims the new law provides enhanced enforcement by strengthening its use of surveillance that was never prohibited in the past but was n't as unrestricted as now under Patriot .
Unlike before , this Act denies constitutional protections nominally in place for all type criminal investigations pre-Patriot , and therein lies its danger .
(2) The Act allows " roving ( telephone ) wiretaps " that apply to the person , not the place .
Thus , if someone uses different phones , all of them may be tapped .
DOJ claims this provision allows federal agents to " follow sophisticated terrorists trained to evade detection . "
Van Bergen explains these taps do n't require probable cause of criminal behavior and thus evade constitutional protections .
Under Patriot , federal agents are immune from Fourth Amendment restrictions against unreasonable searches and seizures that renders this protection null and void for everyone .
(3) The Act allows what 's called " sneak and peak " searches through issuance of " delayed notice " warrants .
Under it , targets are n't notified until a later time and at the government 's discretion so investigators wo n't tip off suspects in advance .
Again , this type warrant has been available for decades provided law enforcers could show a judge it was justified under special conditions .
That 's all changed now , and anything goes for any criminal investigation involving a physical or electronic search .
(4) Patriot gives federal agents court - ordered access to " third party records " of all kinds - financial , medical , educational , virtually anything requested .
For any national security claimed purpose , it allows the government to pry into any aspect of our lives , justified or not .
Information Sharing
Ashcroft claimed the " Patriot Act facilitated information sharing and cooperation among government agencies so they can better ' connect the dots . ' " Van Bergen notes separate government agencies never were impeded from working together , but Patriot tore down built - in safeguards against abuses that are now a thing of the past .
Today under the Act , our constitutionally - protected civil liberties are severely compromised and effectively off the table because of the latitude law enforcement is now allowed under this law .
In a word , the Patriot Act poses real dangers to democratic freedoms that are now on very shaky footing .
In fact , they 're practically non-existent at the whim of law enforcers who can operate ad libitum in the name of national security that 's freely interpreted to mean virtually anything .
Van Bergen asks : " ( Is it ) ever wise to leave our liberty and our country in the unaccountable hands of those who by their positions must always be ' cast in the role of adversary ' against those whose liberties they seek to invade . "
Answer : never , especially if the " adversaries " are in the Bush administration .
The Cheney Plan for Global Dominance
Van Bergen lays out the threat straightaway saying if there 's any doubt about the Bush administration 's " fascist and imperial objectives , " the " Cheney Plan for global dominance must quell it . "
Under GHW Bush , Defense Secretary Cheney and his undersecretary Paul Wolfowitz were tasked to shape America 's post - Cold War strategy .
Wolfowitz and convicted and commuted Cheney aide Lewis Libby drafted the scheme in their Defense Planning Guidance some call the Wolfowitz doctrine .
It was so extreme , it was kept under wraps until it was leaked to the New York Times .
Its exposure got it shelved until it was revived under GW Bush in 2001 as an updated scheme for world dominance .
It 's spelled out clearly in the 2002 National Security Strategy ( NSS ) that was revised in 2006 in even more extreme form .
NSS is an " imperial grand strategy " declaration of preemptive or preventive war against any country or force the administration claims threatens our national security , true or false .
Along with the 2001 Nuclear Policy Review , it gives the government the unilateral right to declare and wage future wars using first strike nuclear weapons under the doctrine of " anticipatory self - defense " that has no basis in international law or anywhere else outside Washington .
Van Bergen explains that " the Cheney Plan ( aka the Bush Plan ) .... is an exceedingly dangerous doctrine " in play in the Middle East and Central Asia that may be cataclysmic if it 's unleashed in its most extreme form .
Global Dominance in Action - Military Necessity or War Crimes ?
- Violating the Geneva and Hague Conventions
As a signatory to the Geneva and Hague Conventions , these laws are the supreme law of the land under the Constitution , but that has n't deterred the Bush administration from defying their letter and spirit .
No signatory nation is exempt from Geneva and Hague , and violating their provisions constitutes a serious and punishable breach of sacred law .
Van Bergen calls any of numerous instances she noted a war crime and " Taken together , they are an outrage against humanity and the law of nations . "
She also brings up the " Doctrine of Military Necessity " that involves lawful measures indispensable in the conduct of war .
It 's important to note this notion does n't justify violating international humanitarian law or our own Constitution .
" A real necessity , " like launching D - Day , is " obvious , " Van Bergen explains .
But mass - slaughtering innocent civilians in Fallujah can't be justified for any reason nor is waging aggressive wars against non-threatening nations , and saying it's for national security meets no acceptable international law standard .
Epilogue - Detainees and Torture
The final part of Van Bergen 's book provides still more proof of the Bush administration 's " broad assault " against long - standing , rock - solid rule of law principles .
Its scorn for the law opened the door for more extreme violations that are nonchalantly accepted as standard practice under " war on terrorism " rules that changed everything .
They do n't and wo n't ever under any conditions .
Yet , the Pentagon and DOJ " developed the breathtaking legal argument that the President , as commander - in - chief of the armed forces , was not bound by US or international laws prohibiting torture when acting to protect national security . "
Torture
Van Bergen cites
Bush 's frequent use of the death penalty and indifference to human suffering when he was Texas governor .
In fact , his flippant attitude showed up much earlier and now he flaunts it .
The Patriot Act made current practices possible by " help ( ing ) set the stage for government endorsed torture . "
Under this repressive law , the nation regressed to " barbarian times " reminiscent of the worst of the Spanish Inquisition and Nazi era .
Van Bergen stresses no society claiming to be a " liberty - protecting one " can justify " human rights abuses in response to a terrorist attack " or for any other reason .
Any country violating these sacred precepts must be held to account and made to answer for their serious crimes against humanity , and that 's what the ICC is in place to do .
On July 19 , 2007 , well after the publication of Van Bergen 's book , George Bush displayed his contempt for the law in another sweeping executive order ( EO ) .
According to AP , he " breathed new life into the CIA 's terror interrogation program ( aka no holds barred torture ) that would allow harsh questioning of suspects limited in public only by a vaguely worded ban ( signifying none whatever ) on cruel and inhuman treatment . "
The order pretends to prohibit some practices , " to quell international criticism , " describes them only vaguely , and does n't say what practices are still allowed .
The Bush administration insists its interrogation operation is one of its most important tools in the " war on terrorism . "
Bottom line - ugly business as usual will continue unchanged and unchecked , except for doublespeak language that signifies only deception from a president exposed as a serial liar .
The Detainee Decisions - by the US Supreme Court
Van Bergen notes recent detainee decisions of great " importance to the future of this country . "
In Rasul v. Bush in June , 2004 , the Court settled the jurisdictional question regarding Guantanamo detainees .
It ruled the US exercises " complete jurisdiction and control ( of the territory and ) Aliens held ( there ) , like American citizens , are entitled to invoke the federal courts ' authority " under their habeas rights .
On the same day , the Court ruled on Hamdi ( a US citizen ) v. Rumsfeld and granted his habeas right to challenge his detention as an " unlawful enemy combatant . "
Then in June , 2006 , the Court ruled on Hamdan v. Rumsfeld and held that military commissions set up to try Guantanamo detainees lack " the power to proceed because ( their ) structures and procedures violate both the Uniform Code of Military Justice ( UCMJ ) and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949 . "
Van Bergen calls habeas the " Great Writ of Liberty " that dates back to 12th century England and long considered sacrosanct and inviolable - but not to the Bush regime .
By its Inquisition era rules , habeas , probable cause , due process and half or more of the Bill of Rights amendments are null and void in the name of national security that denies it to us .
National Security Courts and Torture Warrants
The notion that ( undefined ) " terrorists " are military enemies who justify war , and not criminals , is offensive and illegal .
Van Bergen points out doing it " creates another parallel legal system ( and it ignores ) a primary condition of battle , visible combat . "
The very idea of a " war on terrorism " is doublespeak fraud .
It 's nothing more than a devious scheme for a broader agenda that needs fictitious " outside enemy " threats as justification .
That 's what made Osama bin Laden " Enemy Number One " along with Al Queda even though the CIA created them both to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s .
Making them fearsome enough and on the loose opens the door to all sorts of abuses that are passed off as justifiable self - defense under the Bush regime .
In the name of national security , it 's gotten away with aggressive wars , torture , indefinite detentions , repressive laws and an end to democracy in America that was on shaky ground pre-9/11 and now is kaput .
This happened because our judicial and core constitutional systems were separated and left " outside the protections of the Constitution and international laws . "
We keep heaping new kinds of oppression on top of old ones that deepen the problem instead of working to rectify it .
Van Bergen ends her book saying these actions recruit more enemies and make the world less safe .
Another way is needed , and it ought to start with " learn ( ing ) about the lessons of our own sometimes violent history and recall and reclaim the fundamental , lost ideals that we have forgotten " and sadly only paid lip service to for more than two centuries .

Here are the hard facts about the deficit for the last 11 presidents .
In 2007 , we paid $ 430 billion of our tax money just in interest payments on the national debt .
That ’s around $ 1.2 billion a day .
To put this in perspective , thats three times more than the annual budgets for NASA , education , and transportation put together .
And this number is increasing dramatically .
With 2008 only half over , we have already paid $ 377 billion in interest payments , $ 110 billion in the month of June alone ( $ 2.5 million in the minute it took you to read this ! ) .
And a big chunk of our debt is owned by foreign governments , including China and various oil exporting countries .
Yes , Dr. Bruce E. Ivins is now ' Suspect Number One ' for the 2001 anthrax attacks on America .
He supposedly killed himself ( with relatively slow - acting tylenol - codeine ) rather than face criminal indictment , trial and possible execution .
Among the strangeness surrounding his ' suicide ' , Ivins died even before the formal complaint was finished that was to be filed against him .
Case closed ?
Not even close .
Odds are the ' rats ' in our US government are trying to close off the trail so people will quit cornering them again and again with the truth of their obvious attempts not to investigate the anthrax attacks and bring the true guilty parties to justice .
Odds are these same US government rats were the perpetrators of that anthrax attack for a few simple reasons :
1 . The weaponized anthrax used was the type of Ames Strain that is only available at a very few places , including the Fort Detrick MD CBW weapons research lab .
2 . Once that fact is established ( and it is ) , it narrows the list down even more .
There is also a good chance that Dr. Ivins was eliminated so this story will fade away and people will stop demanding action and the truth .
Remember that the anthrax attack occurred while Bush was trying to push through Patriot Act I and begin his attack on Afghanistan .
Two possible blockades to getting Patriot Act 1 passed were Senator Tom Daschle and Senator Tom Leahy - both of whom received ' anthrax letters ' at their DC offices on Capital Hill .
Both were pushing amendments to the Patriot Act I to protect US civil liberties which were about to be trampled by Bush in his ramrod version of that grievously un-Constitutional bill .
This was all transpiring while BushCo was getting the troops and naval ships into position to attack Afghanistan on October 7 , 2001 .
There was a pipeline deal to steal , the same one that Obama and Zbig think they will get done once Barky takes the throne .
This entire fiasco regarding the Anthrax attack on the US is far from being resolved .
The FBI has apparently been told to not dig to the bottom of the barrel and solve the case once and for all .
A full , unimpeded investigation of the matter would probably indict Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld , Tony Blair , several in Tel Aviv , and a gaggle of DoD subcontractors all working in unison to make the threat of Global ' Terror ' seem real .
Real enough , that every time DC says " BOO ! " the majority of Americans either jump under their beds or freeze like deer in the headlights .
If you take the time to read this following series of articles that appeared in The Hartford Courant , Connecticut , there are some key threads and statements made that start to shed some light on what was and is really going on .
http://www.anthraxinvestigation.com/hcourant.html
BioPort , the original maker of the anthrax vaccine for the Department of Defense , keeps making the statement that its vaccine is ' safe ' and has been ' proven to be safe . '
Bush used those ' findings ' to propose that every man , woman and child in America should be forced to take the ( often debilitating , sometimes death - dealing ) shots under ' Project BioShield . '
Trust me , folks , absolutely , totally and unequivocally REFUSE to have this vaccine administered to you or anyone you know or love .
It will terminate your current status of health ... and possibly your life .
There was so much liability headed toward BioPort from wrongful death lawsuits resulting from their crappy , deadly vaccine that they made a quick offshore move to avoid liability and merged with DynPort Vaccines , LLC , a shady entity that is both biotech company and a mercenary soldier parent company .
DynCorp was later bought out by SAIC , one of the BushCo bandits in this bogus Global War on Terror .
The statements from BioPort regarding the ' proven safety ' of its defective , destrctive product are bald - faced lies .
Their vaccine was NOT proven safe in FDA clinical trials .
Tragically , the approval to inject the vaccine into US troops was expedited and rubber stamped without any clinical trial , and countless thousands of our young men and women have paid a terrible price ever since .
That is Lie Number
One and more of them just keep piling up .
Always remember , those folks in DC are LIARS .
The doctors and nurses at Landstuhl , Germany were under direct orders to falsify the medical records of the US soldiers when they found such strange side effects from this vaccine as " mystery pneumonia . "
This condition is medically and scientifically termed as eosinophilia ... where the sacs of the lungs literally ooze profusely and drown the patient .
More on that subject below .
They are also told to falsify the medical records regarding how many US soldiers are developing DVT ( deep vein thrombosis , leading to heart attack , stroke and pulmonary embolism ) and amyloidosis within months after receiving this deadly toxin of a vaccine .
The Chapter 5 of my book ' One - Way Ticket to Crawford Texas ' addressed this matter in considerable detail : < start insert , Chapter 5 > " " Conveniently left off that short list is DynPort Vaccine , LLC , formed in 1997 and a joint venture of DynCorp , a major Bush backer and owned now by Computer Sciences Corporation , also a major Bush backer , and Ipsen , a company based in the UK where they merged or backed Porton into Ipsen without any public announcement of that event .
I thought it was odd to have missed what might be the real game , the real story ; i.e. DynCorp and BioPort in bed together .
In certain circles , DynCorp is euphemistically called " The Mercenary Company " and that their name just keeps getting left off the list and named in the articles should raise your eyebrows and the hair on the back of your neck .
Some of you more informed readers will remember that former DynCorp chairman Pug Winokur was heavily involved in that colossal fraud named Enron . " "
< end insert , Chapter 5 >
This is also right out Chapter 5 and no , this matter is not solved and this matter is not going to go away until the true guilty parties are held accountable for criminal negligence and terrorist act of murder in the US and inflicted upon Our US Soldiers .
< start insert , Chapter 5 > '' There has been a book written about this wonderful insider deal anthrax vaccine [ 1 ] and the following is part of a teaser from a site selling that book : " Is the anthrax vaccine as bad as people say it is ?
No ­ it 's worse , says author Lt. Col .
Thomas S. Heemstra , author of , Anthrax : A Deadly Shot in the Dark : Unmasking the Truth Behind a Deadly Vaccine . "
This came from another source [ 2 ] and there are many highlighting these facts trying to get to the truth : " After the attacks of September 11th , President George Walker Bush placed BioPort 's North Lansing laboratory under protection , invoking the national interest .
Interestingly enough , the Italian magazine Il Manifesto reported , in its October issue , that this happened at the same time that the FBI also placed the El Hibri's at the top of their list of suspects for sending anthraxspores through the mail system .
" Did our President stall and impede another investigation ?
There is one possible reason why our President does not want anyone looking into the matter since BioPort and George Herbert Walker Bush are connected via Carlyle Group .
Nothing impresses me more than to see present and former military persons stand up for those that are currently in uniform and being treated wrong or shabbily by the current occupant of the White House after they have served this nation and remain vigilant because they know that there are some real " sleaze persons " in the DoD , our government and certain defense contractors : WILFULLY RISKING THE HEALTH OF THE US MILITARY [ 3 ] by : MAJ GLENN MacDONALD , USAR ( Ret ) Al Capone would have been proud .
" Former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm. William J. Cro questionable " vaccine " that is supposed to " protect " the nation 's military from the deadly orga nisms .
Not only does Crowe and his mysterious pal , Faud El - Hibri , get an exclusive multi-million dollar contract to produce anthrax vaccine , but the Government agrees to pay triple the original cost in the contract , from $ 3.50 a dose , to over ten dollars !
This , after the company Crowe and El - Hibri partly own - Bioport of Lansing , Mich .
- was temporarily shut down by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) after it failed an inspection in November . "
This is the type of human being that would be inclined to hire mercenary DynCorp , in my humble opinion . ''
< end insert , Chapter 5 > Former Admiral William Crowe is a Neocon and a thug who has paved the way for an unsafe product to be injected into the bodies of now well over 1.5 million US troops who then go serve in the monumental lie of the ' Global War on Terror . '
Crowe is a terrorist , part of arming Saddam Hussein with CBW to attack Iran right along with Cheney and Rumsfeld .
Then to line his pockets even more , he joins BioPort and gets that vaccine pumped into all US troops , many of whom now have ruined health for the rest of their lives ... all due to greedy pricks like Retired Admiral Crowe .
< start insert , Chapter 5 > " " FDA approval granted without testing
In its haste to push this vaccine and order U.S. troops to take it , the normal FDA approval [ 4 ] process was expedited and appropriate testing was not performed .
Even after problems began to be known neither the FDA , DoD nor BioPort have backed up to re-evaluate their actions , this vaccine , or the present and long - term medical complications it is causing and more importantly , known to be causing to our military troops [ 5 ] . " " < end insert , Chapter 5 >
There is plenty of evidence that the BioPort anthrax vaccine , now DynPort Vaccine LLC , is deadly , pure crap and was absolutely not needed except to fill the right pockets in DC ... criminals who have no regard whatsoever for the harm they have done to our military .
< start insert , Chapter 5 > " " Pneumonia Mystery UPI reported in August 2003 [ 6 ] that medical teams had been sent due to about 100 cases of pneumonia that had been contracted by our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
That number is now in the thousands of cases of pneumonia [ 7 ] , but this particular pneumonia is proving out in the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center ( a DoD hospital being used for Iraq and Afghanistan casualties and other health issues ) to be something quite unusual .
They are running tests and there is no bacterium or virus present in these thousands of cases of pneumonia .
What is a commonality is that all of the troops were forced to take the anthrax vaccine shortly before being deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan .
I personally know oneUS soldier that has had this mystery pneumonia four times while deployed to Iraq since March 2003 .
UPI Investigative reporter Mark Benjamin came across this story and I have tried to persuade some of my sources to talk to him about what they know .
They are afraid because the US Army has threatened people regarding any discussion of the various medical conditions that are popping up and , being confirmed by tests , and the apparent links that may go back to this sweetheart deal vaccine that BioPort sells to our DoD as a sole source provider .
I personally think if the whole ugly story were known , the real manufacturer is DynPort and BioPort is a ruse knowing that the litigation is coming and they are positioned already to make sure no plaintiff ever collects a dime in judgments .
There is a word that fits ; it is called " sleazy " . " " < end insert , Chapter 5 >
The correct diagnosis this thus , and is being created by the debilitating and sometimes deadly anthrax vaccine .
< start insert , Chapter 5 > " " Acute eosinophilic pneumonia or AEP .
AEP is an acute pneumonia with fever but without identifiable infectious cause .
It starts rapidly and soon progresses to respiratory failure . " "
< end insert , Chapter 5 >
It is the shitty anthrax vaccine , folks .
Our nanotech researchers have been on this matter for 4 years but Washington , DC is full of liars and despicable people who will do anything but own up to the truth .
To further fleece the US taxpayers and fatten their portfolios , these cretins would , if they could , shoot this deadly crap into every American under the bogus " Project BioSheild . ' program .
They 've already used it on every US soldier and results have been despicably devastating and in a real court of law constitute nothing less than criminal negligence and intent to harm ... and all of it just to make a buck .
Evidently , the FBI has been told ' hands off ' and to stay away from the most likely suspects .
This is a person who was monitored by the security systems of Fort Detrick as entering the building at odd hours , conducting ' research ' when no one else was around and , according to some , caught on security cams in the virus storage areas without authorization .
He may also be the one who stole the exact same type of weaponized anthrax and then used it to spook Americans into hiding under their shadows every time the word ' anthrax ' or ' terrorists ' or that phony ' terror threat color alert ' was rolled out and bludgeoned into the heads of every American by every lap dog media outlet and every fraud politician in DC .
Oops !
" Lab specimens of anthrax spores , Ebola virus and other pathogens disappeared from the Army 's biological warfare research facility in the early 1990s , during a turbulent period of labor complaints and recriminations among rival scientists there , documents from an internal Army inquiry show . " A ' person of interest ' in a real investigation would be one who tried to pin the theft of pathogens and anthrax attacks on an Egyptian scientist who worked at Fort Detrick .
Dr. Philip M. Zack was employed at Fort Detrick and he was ordered to leave due to his harassment of an Egyptian who had come to America 25 years before the anthrax attacks .
The person he was harassing and tried to set up was Dr. Ayaad Assaad .
The FBI has already questioned Dr. Assaad and he was cleared , so why did they not focus on the person who tried to set him up for those anthrax attacks ?
Due to his actions towards Dr. Assaad alone , it is not a stretch to say that Dr. Philip Zack has every appearance of being an Arab - hating Jew .
Who is Dr. Philip Zack ?
Apparently , a Zionist Jew for starters or just a Zionist .
Some claim he is Catholic .
Since it was Israel that was pushing so hard for the total destruction of Iraq , we have a possible motive right there to make America think the bogus Global War on Terror was a real threat .
Where was Dr. Zack employed after he was ordered out of one of the top United States CBW government labs ?
" Anyway , this same Dr. Zack worked for Gilead Sciences in 2000 .
This is the same Gilead Sciences that invented Tamiflu , which has become popular and profitable after the bird flu scare .
This is the same Gilead Sciences that makes popular medicines treating AIDS ( that many people believe was developed in American military laboratories ) .
And who owns Gilead Sciences ?
A major stockholder is none other than NeoCon Donald Rumsfeld , who at one time was its CEO .
Also , Tony Blair of England , who joined Bush in the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq .
And Tom Brokaw who had received one of the anthrax letters .
And another major shareholder is none other than NeoCon Cindy McCain , possibly the next first lady of the US . "
Are you starting to get the picture ?
Is it sinking in yet that the extent that you , America , and the world were lied to by these sub - human greed obsessed morons in Washington , DC ?
The FBI has been playing " Where 's Waldo ? " for over 6 years ... and now their only suspect is dead ??
They have yet to truly focus on who might be the real evildoer .
To make the anthrax vaccine , both BioPort and DynPort Vaccine would HAVE to use the Ft. Detrick weaponized anthrax as the baseline for the vaccine .
I have looked and there is no record of where Dr. Philip Zack was employed during the Fall of 2001 when these attacks occurred .
I 'll bet if a real investigation were conducted , ties between Dr. Philip Zack , Retired Adm .
Crowe , BioPort , DynPort Vaccine , etc , would not be that hard to find .
It is established that Zack worked for Gilead Sciences and that ties him to Donald Rumsfeld .
Why do they lie so much ?
So these people could pull off a $ 5 + trillion genocide / oil theft war scam and try to steal about ( current dollars ) $ 20 to $ 25 trillion in Caspian Basin oil and natural gas .
They have killed over 1 million in Iraq and Afghanistan , so what are a few anthrax attack deaths on top of that ?
There is no telling how many they killed inTurkmenistan , Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan and Tajikistan to remove obstacles ( often entire families ) in their way to try to gain control of that $ 20 to $ 25 trillion in oil and natural gas .
Have you yet had enough of being lied to by these despicable bastards and bitches in DC who pretend they are representing you and leading America ?
They are robbing America .
WAKE UP .
These people are not defending America by ANY measure .
They are slaughtering millions and destroying entire nations to line their pockets .
WAKE UP .
This has all been a complete and total fraud to hide the Rape of America .
WAKE UP .
YOUR graves are being dug .

" Karl ... Another great hit !
Thanks again .
Remember the NEOCON GWB insider , Jerome Hauer ?

I wonder how , if this is true , Jerome Hauer knew about attacks that were not even being discussed or had happened yet ?
Seriously , folks , is Mr. Hauer clairvoyant ... or is he one of the ' RAT Team ' who knows what a total lie the Global War on Terror is ?
Hmm , and what , might you ask , is the latest on Mr. Hauer ?
Why , he is now on the board of Emergent Biosolutions - the new parent of BIOPORT !

They keep changing parents ( from BioPort , to DynPort Vaccine , to SAIC , and now to Emergent Biosolutions ) because of the huge amount of criminal negligence and wrongful death litigation claims that have been filed against these thugs .
Sniff , sniff , yep , I say we got a possible RAT here .
You folks over at FBI , this is worth looking into as well , when you finally get around to addressing the issue of the mysterious Dr. Philip Zack .

California joins big carbon - trade partnership California in North American carbon - trading partnership
California , six other Western states and four Canadian provinces launched plans on Wednesday for one of the world 's largest carbon - trading systems , a sweeping effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming .
The North American program , like a similar market - based system in Europe , focuses on heavy polluters such as electric utilities , oil refineries and large industrial and commercial facilities .
Environmental groups immediately questioned whether the plan will be tough enough on polluters , while industry groups said the program lacks details .
California officials said the proposal will be an integral part of the Golden State 's ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020 , as required by the landmark legislation AB32 that the Legislature approved and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed in 2006 .
" We very much believe this supports California 's own plan to grow the economy and protect the environment , " said Linda Adams , secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency .
The draft plan is a key component of the Western Climate Initiative , a partnership created in February 2007 among the governors of California , Arizona , New Mexico , Oregon and Washington to curb global warming .
The group - which has added Utah and Montana , along with the Canadian provinces of Manitoba , Quebec , British Columbia and Ontario - has set a regional goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent of 2005 levels by 2020 .
Under the plan , industries would be required to begin reporting emission levels beginning in 2011 to allow participating governments to agree on the maximum level of emissions for the region when the program begins in 2012 .
Template for other states
Final recommendations are to be adopted by end of the year and will be used as a template for states to develop their own systems that would link up with others in the Western Climate Initiative .
The California Air Resources Board , which is responsible for implementing AB32 , released a blueprint last month that included such ideas as requirements for cleaner cars , more energy - efficient appliances , less - polluting fuels and more reliance on wind and solar energy .
But the air board 's preliminary recommendations also cited the need to work with states and provinces in the Western Climate Initiative to develop a cap - and - trade program , under which heavy - polluting firms would buy carbon credits from less - polluting companies .
The air board said such a system would account for as much as 20 percent of California 's projected reductions in carbon emissions .
Mary Nichols , who chairs the board , has said a broader market would be more effective than a statewide one .
While the formation of the North American partnership has been applauded by both industry and environmental groups , the proposal received mixed reviews Wednesday .
Gary Stern , Southern California Edison 's director of market strategy and resource planning , said he wished the 10 - page document had specified how states would initially distribute carbon credits , which can be used in place of reducing emissions .
Cap - and - trade program
" In any type of cap - and - trade program , we 're ultimately going to be concerned with what the cost to customers is going to be , " he said .
But Stern said he liked the program 's aim to include many types of industries , unlike the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative , a similar program among 10 Northeastern states that targets only electric utilities .
The European Union 's system to cut greenhouse gases , the only other regional cap - and - trade program , got off to a rough start because the emissions cap was too high and companies were awarded carbon credits for free , said Erin Rogers , California outreach coordinator for the Union of Concerned Scientists , an environmental group .
The result was that the high emissions cap meant most companies were n't required to cut emissions , while the flood of free carbon credits made them virtually worthless , Rogers said .
The European Union has since tried to fix its system by resetting the cap and requiring companies to buy carbon credits through an auction system , Rogers said , a lesson for California and other jurisdictions .
Potential problems
Environmentalists said the Western Climate Initiative 's draft plan does not clearly state whether carbon credits would be given away for free or sold in an auction .
Another potential problem , they said , is the draft plan 's emphasis on offsets , a program under which polluters could emit greenhouse gases above the capped level by purchasing carbon credits from groups or businesses with environmental programs such as reforestation or mega- dairies that capture methane gases for energy use .
Jason Barbose , global warming advocate for Environment California , said that under the draft plan , industries may be able to meet all their emissions requirements by purchasing offsets .
" It would be far better to require power companies and oil companies to invest in clean energy and better transit than to pay someone else in some other country to reduce their pollution instead , " he said .
Bigfoot Press Conference Hoax Video
The Bigfoot press conference held today in Palo Alto , CA , has failed to convince skeptics that the Bigfoot corpse shown in photos released by bigfoottracker.com , is little more than a 500 pound Bigfoot hoax .
The press conference , held by self - proclaimed bigfoot expert Tom Biscardi , promised to provide DNA evidence that the Bigfoot body two hikers from northern Georgia found was the real deal .
Of three samples in a preliminary DNA test , one came back inconclusive , one contained traces of human DNA and one had traces of opossum DNA — probably from something the creature ate , they said .
My guess is the opossum DNA came from the entrails lying on top of the corpse .
Experts who have analyzed the photos say the creature 's guts lying on top appear to be staged and are likely the insides of another animal ( a opossum perhaps ? ) .
Matthew Witton and Rick Dyer , the two men who claim to have bigfoot 's body stuffed in a freezer , have told three different versions of how they stumbled upon the creature .
In one , the animal was shot by a former felon , and the men followed it into the woods .
In a second version , they found a " family of Bigfoot " in North Georgia mountains .
In the third , the two were hiking and stumbled upon the corpse with open wounds .
Although the two men say they are n't sure how they will profit from their discovery , they have been talking about starting a Bigfoot expedition tour .
Ironically , the reason given at the press conference for not disclosing the exact location of their find was " to protect the creatures . "
The group says the body is being held in an " undisclosed location " awaiting an autopsy .
Biscardi , founder of the Great American Bigfoot Research Organization , perpetuated another Bigfoot hoax in 2005 when he claimed his group captured an 8 - foot - tall Bigfoot .
That claim was quickly disputed .
Biscardi's operations include a Bigfoot web site , a Bigfoot merchandise line and a Bigfoot internet radio show .
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Reserve officers are not taking the claim seriously and will not investigate Bigfoot because it is not a federal priority .
" It 's not on endangered species on any list that we 've got , " spokesman Tom Mackenzie said .

ABC News :

John McCain on Friday abruptly cancelled a Monday fundraiser that had been scheduled at the home of a Texas oilman , after ABC News contacted the campaign inquiring about a verbal blunder the Texan made during an unsuccessful 1990 campaign for governor .
Clayton Williams stirred controversy during his 1990 campaign for governor of Texas with a botched attempt at humor in which he compared rape to weather .
Within earshot of a reporter , Williams said : “ As long as it 's inevitable , you might as well lie back and enjoy it . ”
His Democratic opponent at the time , the late Ann Richards -- who , coincidentally , would lose the governor ’s mansion to George W. Bush in 1994 -- highlighted the comments in a TV ad during that 1990 campaign .
( see above )
McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers said the Monday event was being cancelled , given the offensive comments .
He said he could not yet say what McCain would do with donations brought into the campaign by Williams .
" These were obviously incredibly offensive remarks that the campaign was unaware of at the time this event was scheduled , " Rogers said .
He added that Williams apologized for the comments back in 1990 , but he said that does not excuse them .
Williams told the Midland Reporter - Telegram recently that he had already raised more than $ 300,000 for McCain and the fundraiser to be held at his home in Midland .
Williams said that he needed to help McCain raise money to stop an Obama campaign that would enact “ socialist ” policies if elected to office .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
After being pummeled by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , New Orleans is showing signs of recovery - ranking as the fastest - growing large city in the nation , according to a government report released Thursday .
The Census Bureau said New Orleans ' population rose 13.8 % , to 239,124 , in the year ended July 1 , 2007 .
That was a faster growth rate than any other city with a population of 100,000 or more .
The figures can be taken with a grain of salt .
Over the first seven years of this decade , " The Big Easy " experienced both the largest rate of loss and largest numerical decline , due primarily to the storm that devastated the city nearly three years ago .
The government said the city 's population fell 50.7 % since 2000 , when it stood at 484,674 .
The Census Bureau said the second fastest growing city in the nation was Victorville , Calif. , whose population climbed 9.5 % to 107,221 .
Located in Southern California , Victorville 's population passed the 100,000 mark for the first time in 2007 .
Big states dominate .
California and Texas dominate the fastest growing cities , both in the recent annual data and in the data from 2000 through 2007 .
California and Texas each placed five cities on the list of the 25 fastest - growing cities between 2006 and 2007 , as well as on the list of the 25 biggest numerical gainers for the period .
Three cities in the Lone Star State made the fastest - growing top 10 list for the most recent year : McKinney , which was 3rd ; Killeen , which was 6th ; and Denton , which ranked 10th .
Other cities on the most recent list of the fastest growing cities were North Las Vegas , Nev. , ranked 4th ; Cary , N.C. , ranked 5th ; Port St. Lucie , Fla. , ranked 7th ; Gilbert , Ariz. , ranked 8th ; and Clarksville , Tenn. , ranked 9th .
For the period from 2000 through 2007 , McKinney , Texas , was the nation 's fastest - growing city , its population more than doubling to 115,620 .
Eight of the top 25 fastest - growing cities for the period from 2000 through 2007 were in California : Victorville , Elk Grove , Irvine , Roseville , Rancho Cucamonga , Moreno Valley , Bakersfield and Fontana .
By the numbers .
While smaller Sun Belt cities top the fastest - growing list , the Census Bureau 's top 10 list of numerical gainers was populated by larger cities .
In terms of sheer numbers , Houston led the nation 's cities in numerical increase during the period .
Houston added 38,932 residents in the year ended July 1 , 2007 to reach 2.2 million .
Four of the top ten cities that showed the greatest numerical increases for the year were in Texas .
In addition to Houston , San Antonio came in 3rd , Fort Worth was 4th and Austin was 8th .
Other cities in the top 10 of greatest numerical increases were Phoenix , which ranked 2nd , New Orleans , which was 5th , New York , which was 6th , Atlanta , 7th on the list , and two North Carolina cities , Charlotte in 9th place and Raleigh in 10th .
New York City was the largest numerical gainer between 2000 and 2007 , adding 265,873 residents over the period .
Houston added 233,876 people since the start of the millennium , in second place behind New York City .
Big Apple is still the biggest .
The Big Apple continues to be the most populous city in the nation , with 8.3 million residents , according to the Census Bureau .
Los Angeles ranked second with 3.8 million residents .
With 2.8 million , Chicago was third , followed by Houston and Phoenix , which each had 1.6 million .

The following is a reader take by Matthew Mintz .
Despite being mentioned on ABC News , and the medical blogosphere , the recent study in the Archives of General Psychiatry that shows psychiatrists are less likely to use “ couch ” therapy has n’t garnered the attention it deserves .
The study found that for patients who saw psychiatrists , the percentage of visits involving psychotherapy ( where the physicians talk to you ) decreased from 44.4 percent in 1996 - 1997 to 28.9 percent in 2004 - 2005 .
This is despite that fact that psychotherapy has been found to be effective for many mental health disorders .
The authors and commentators note that the way in which psychotherapy is reimbursed ( “ reimbursement for one 45 - to 50 - minute outpatient psychotherapy session is 40.9 % less than reimbursement for three 15 - minute medication management visits ” ) , but the findings go far beyond that and are a good indication of the future of primary care .
What is not clearly stated in the study is that in 1996 - 97 , about 55 percent of patients who paid out of pocket received psychotherapy compared to about 40 percent who paid with insurance .
In 2004 - 05 , the percentage slightly increased for patients paying out of pocket ( 59 percent ) , but dropped by almost half ( 23 percent ) for patients using insurance .
The reality is that over the past decade , the way in which psychiatry is practiced and delivered has dramatically changed based on reimbursement structures .
We now have two types of care delivery for mental health services .
In general , there are two types of psychiatrists whose practices are remarkably different : those that accept insurance and those that do not .
For those that do not take insurance , psychiatrists prescribe medication , administer psychotherapy , or do both .
Those psychiatrists not taking insurance generally manage medication only , using other health care professionals ( psychologists , licensed psychiatric social workers , etc. ) to administer counseling and other forms of “ talk therapy . ”
For many insurances , mental health is a carved out benefit .
In other words , instead of getting a referral from your primary care physician to a specialist who accepts your insurance , patients needing mental health care must call the central number of the company their insurance contracts with , and speak to an intake person , who is usually a nurse or social worker .
This person will then authorize therapy and direct the patient to a covered provider .
Sometimes they determine whether or not a psychiatrist is really needed or whether a non-physician provider can do the job .
Alternatively , some mental health benefits direct all patients to a psychiatrist initially , whose main job is to manage medication and direct patients in need of counseling to non-physician providers .
This description is by no means intended to discredit psychologists or psychiatric social workers , who provide excellent and effective care .
In fact , I am not even arguing that this is a bad system .
With limited health care dollars , maybe it makes sense for MDs to focus on medication , and non-MD professionals to deliver cognitive services .
The point is that the low reimbursement for cognitive services from both government and private payers has dramatically changed the way mental health care is delivered in the US , transforming it into a two tiered system .
More importantly , the same is likely to happen to primary care , where much of the work of the primary care physician is non-procedural .
The rise of concierge care is only the beginning .
Unless there are substantive changes to the way cognitive services are reimbursed , specifically for primary care , general health care will similarly develop into a two - tiered system for those patients who pay for primary care with health insurance and those that pay out of pocket .
Having a primary care physician that knows you as an individual , calls you back on the phone to answer questions , fits you in to an appointment when you are sick and takes the time to talk to you in an unrushed visit will only be available to those that can pay for these visits out of pocket .
Those paying for primary care with insurance should expect ( in the not too distant future ) limited access , routine care delivered by PA ’s and NP ’s , and rushed visits with the MD , whose primary focus will be medication management and directing you to non-physician providers for counseling and discussing your various health concerns .
Health care reform that does not address the central issue of low reimbursement for cognitive service and high reimbursement for procedures and diagnostic studies will only encourage this shift .
In fact , this trend has already started .

With the number of attacks in eastern Afghanistan up by 40 percent from a year ago , senior Bush administration officials have been voicing increasing alarm about the growing strength of the militants using havens in Pakistan .
“ The ability of the Taliban and other insurgents to cross that border and not being under any pressure from the Pakistani side of the border is clearly a concern , ” Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates told reporters two weeks ago in one of his most pointed comments to date on the situation .
“ That ’s the area that needs to be addressed with the Pakistani government . ”
The Bush administration is struggling to work with the Afghan and Pakistani governments to find an effective combination of political , diplomatic and military tools to help stem the increasingly entrenched insurgency , but it has faced difficulties dealing with Pakistan ’s new coalition government , officials say .
“ We ’re trying to impress upon the Pakistanis how bad things are , ” said one senior administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities .
“ Before , we could go to Musharraf , ” the official said , speaking of President Pervez Musharraf .
“ Now it ’s more of a power - sharing agreement , and it ’s more difficult .
There ’s no apparent solution at hand .
The next six months look like they ’ll be a lot like the past six months . ”
Four senior military officials said that Al Qaeda was strengthening its increasingly close operational ties in the tribal areas with the Taliban and various other militant groups  financing , training recruits and facilitating attacks into Afghanistan , though not necessarily conducting attacks themselves .
Inside Pakistan , the forces of the Tehrik - e - Taliban of Pakistan , an umbrella group of Taliban , are most prominent among the militants .
The group is led by Baitullah Mehsud , who is accused by the Pakistani government of masterminding the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December and running scores of suicide bombers on both sides of the border .
Mr. Mehsud , who has risen from near obscurity to become a powerful ally of Al Qaeda , brazenly held a news conference in May in his home base , South Waziristan , to announce that he would expand his fight against the American military across the border in Afghanistan , where the group has close links to other Taliban forces .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Thursday soaring oil prices pushed its second - quarter earnings up 14 percent , again breaking its own record for the highest - ever profit by a U.S. company .
A Mobil gas station is seen in Medford , Massachusetts April 30 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Brian Snyder
Net income in the quarter rose to $ 11.68 billion , or $ 2.22 a share , from $ 10.26 billion , or $ 1.83 a share , last year .
Exxon -- the world ’s largest publicly traded company -- previously set the high - water mark for quarterly earnings in the fourth quarter of last year , when it brought in $ 11.66 billion .
Despite the new record , Exxon ’s results lagged behind analyst expectations .
The company posted operating earnings of $ 2.27 a share in the quarter , which exclude a $ 290 million charge related to the recent Supreme Court ruling in the Exxon Valdez case .
Analysts , on average , had expected the company to earn $ 2.53 a share , according to Reuters Estimates .
Revenue in the quarter rose about 40 percent to $ 138.07 billion .
Exxon both produces oil and refines it to make gasoline , and profit margins for gasoline were weak during the quarter , holding back earnings slightly .
The company said earnings from its exploration and production business rose about 68 percent to $ 10.01 billion .
But its refining and marketing earnings fell about 54 percent to $ 1.56 billion .
U.S. oil prices averaged slightly less than $ 125 a barrel in the quarter , nearly double prices from a year earlier .
Gasoline prices only rose 25 percent during that same period , resulting in weak profit margins for the fuel .
Shares of Exxon Mobil fell 2.2 percent in pre-market trade after its earnings were announced .
Through Wednesday ’s close , they were down about 10 percent this year , underperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange ’s oil index , which has fallen about 5.2 percent over the same period .
Luis Prazeres was the first native - born airline captain in São Tomé and Príncipe , and the country 's first minister of natural resources .
He knew a lot about flying and nothing about oil .
But neither did anyone else in the tiny African island nation , which had just been told it was on the verge of a petroleum boom .
" There were all these foreign companies telling us that we had huge oil reserves , and bringing us agreements to sign , " said Prazeres , who took up his minister 's post in 1999 .
" Nobody here understood how complex it was . "
Other governments are now finding themselves in similar situations .
Rising oil prices have led to a surge in exploration in countries with little or no petroleum experience .
Hopes of petrodollar bonanzas have already been raised in Ghana and Uganda , while prospecting companies are crawling over Gambia , Madagascar , Tanzania and Somalia .
Yet São Tomé 's bitter experience should serve as a cautionary tale .
In the decade since a little known Texas oil firm wandered into government offices with an audacious plan , the 160,000 inhabitants of the lush , somnolent islands have seen dreams of their country becoming the next Brunei or Kuwait melt away in the equatorial sun .
Their leaders have signed some of the most lopsided petroleum contracts in history .
Bribes have allegedly been offered and pocketed .
Regional bullies have muscled in , and in May the government fell to a no -confidence vote .
" We have already seen everything that goes with an oil boom , " said Rafael Branco , the newly appointed prime minister .
" Everything , except a single drop of oil . "
Offshore reserves
The twin islands of São Tomé and Príncipe squat in the Gulf of Guinea .
Their nearest neighbours are Nigeria , Cameroon , Equatorial Guinea and Gabon .
All have found significant reserves of oil , much of it offshore .
In 1997 , a tiny Houston - based company called Environmental Remediation Holding Corporation ( ERHC ) , which had no history of oil finds or production , decided São Tomé might have its own deep - water deposits .
In return for near - exclusive mineral exploration and exploitation rights for 25 years and a half share of profits , ERHC offered São Tomé $ 5 m and its marketing services .
São Tomé , heavily in debt and reliant on donors to fund most of its $ 30 m budget , was desperate for cash .
The deal was signed .
Industry watchers such as Mohamed Yahya , of the UK - based peacebuilding NGO International Alert , would later describe the contract as " one of the worst in the history of oil " .
And ERHC 's gamble paid off .
Seismic data showed there could be up to 11bn barrels of oil under the sea around the islands .
The most promising area was north of Príncipe , in waters also claimed by Nigeria .
Nigeria , with decades of oil experience , agreed to establish a joint authority over the oil zone , but insisted the profits be split 60:40 .
When São Tomé 's current president , Fradique de Menezes , was elected in 2001 he threatened to have ERHC 's contract torn up , but by then the US company had been bought by Chrome , a Nigerian firm headed by a businessman with strong ties to Nigeria 's ruling regime .
Though the contract would be renegotiated twice , pressure from Nigeria ensured ERHC 's deal remained vastly disadvantageous for São Tomé .
Meanwhile , the potential oil reserves were causing excitement abroad .
After the 9/11 attacks , the US government was seeking ways to reduce reliance on oil from the Middle East .
Democratic , largely stable , and with a US - friendly president , São Tomé seemed ideal .
Several top US lawyers soon arrived to offer assistance in managing the oil contracts .
A team from Columbia University 's Earth Institute helped draft model legislation that would ensure transparency and hold back some of the oil revenues for future generations .
" All people could talk about was oil , oil , oil .
The politicians made it sound like it would start flowing tomorrow , and everyone was just sitting back and waiting for the proceeds , " said Arlindo Carvalho , who was oil minister from 2003 to 2005 .
The best blocks in the joint São Tomé - Nigeria oil zone had been put up for auction in 2003 .
In the first round , only one consortium , led by Chevron and ExxonMobil , emerged with a successful bid .
São Tomé 's share of the fee was $ 49 m - a lot to a tiny country , but far less than expected .
Late in 2004 , more than two dozen companies competed for the remaining blocks .
Many were Nigerian - linked firms with no experience of oil production .
Manipulation
A report by São Tomé 's attorney general a year later concluded the auction had lacked transparency , was subject to " serious procedural deficiencies and political manipulation " , and had resulted in winning bids from unqualified firms .
ERHC 's preferential rights had discouraged the more reputable companies from bidding , and cost São Tomé up to $ 60 m in fees , it said .
Even more damning , to São Toméans , were allegations in the report that their politicians had been bribed .
One of the president 's top advisers was revealed to own a stake in ERHC , while a company controlled by Menezes was found to have accepted $ 100,000 from Chrome .
Menezes and Chrome said the payment was a legitimate election contribution .
Public anger was followed by disappointment at the oil drilling results .
When Chevron tested its deep - water block in 2006 , it struck oil but not in commercial quantities .
Other companies plan tests next year .
The government also intends to sell exploration rights in its exclusive territorial waters in 2009 .
Even if commercial quantities of oil are discovered , it will be at least six years before production starts .
" There is a lot of exhaustion with the whole process , " said Paulo Cunha , who managed the Columbia University project .
" But I think it would be wrong to brand São Tomé 's oil experience a failure .
It still has time on its side . "
Others are not so certain .
There is still very limited oil expertise on the islands .
And given the alleged corruption , many local people have serious doubts that oil revenues could be managed properly , regardless of the good laws in place .
" São Tomé 's institutions remain among the weakest in Africa , " said Yahya .
" The best thing that could happen to the country is if no oil is found . "

It ’s got a maximum range of 22 feet , takes five hours to charge , and then only lasts for around seven seconds .
If you want watch this weapon in its full glory jump to the 5 minute video right below .
The big financial story today is the dollar ’s rally --
The dollar fell when oil rose , and now it is rising as oil falls .
Plus , a couple of the key factors that have supported the euro against the dollar -- the ECB ’s tightening bias and Europe ’s resilience ( and specifically Germany ’s resilience ) in the face of the US slowdown -- seem to be withering away .
I agree with John Jansen : this is more a story about incipient weakness in Europe than strength in the US .
Only yesterday US Treasuries rallied ( i.e. yields fell ) on the back of bad US news .
A dollar rally is one way for the RMB to strengthen against its largest trading partner -- though at the end of the day , the RMB needs to strengthen against both the euro and the dollar to help reduce the world ’s imbalances , not just to strengthen against one or the other .
Most of the data I follow looks back not forward -- even the weekly custodial data reported by the New York Fed .
I though was struck by the strong increase in the Fed ’s custodial holdings ( money the New York Fed holds for foreign central banks ) last week : Total custodial holdings were up $ 24.5 b , with a $ 25.6 increase in the Treasury holdings and a slight $ 1.0 b fall in custodial holdings of Agencies . *
The $ 24.5 b weekly increase is almost as large the $ 29.1b increase in July .
And the $ 25.5 b in Treasury purchases is n’t that much smaller than the roughly $ 35 b sovereign funds have invested in US financial institutions .**
It is a huge number .
Right now there are only three countries adding to their reserves at a rate than could explain this kind of growth : China , Russia and Saudi Arabia .
Of course , a large country that is n’t adding to its reserves could also shift funds over to the New York Fed , increasing its custodial holdings in the absence of an increase in its overall reserves -- but I suspect that at least one of the countries now adding to its foreign assets at a rapid clip is making heavy use of the New York Fed ’s custodial accounts .
And it is striking that all the increase went into Treasuries .
Treasury Secretary Paulson is in Beijing for the Olympics .
I would be a bit surprised if he also does n’t swing by SAFE and explain how the US government plans to backstop the Agencies ...
* This is the change from the July 30 to August 6 , not the change in the weekly averages .
** I have n’t updated by calculations for the latest Merrill recapitalization , so I do n’t have a precise number .
The total before the last Merrill recapitalization was $ 31.4 b .
This number also excludes the money sovereign funds have invested in European institutions like UBS and Barclays .
Step right up and prepare to be amazed !
Do n’t be shy .
Friends and children of all ages … behold the wonderment that is Offshore Drilling .
A true modern miracle !
Step up to the greatest show on earth !
Yes , it will dazzle you – no , it will bedazzle you – with its awesomeness !
It ’s fast acting , 3 - times concentrated and cheaper than the leading brand .
It reduces the price of gasoline to mere pennies , and it ’s 100 % effective in the fight against plaque and Global Warming .
But that ’s not all folks .
No more starving babies in Africa – especially the cute ones .
And it does n’t stop there – it gives you longer and more satisfying sex , whether you ’re having it with someone else or not .
It ’s that good !
SPOILER ALERT : No .
It ’s .
Not .
Thar ’s Black Gold in Them Thar Hills : Actually , not so much .
When it comes to the production of crude oil , America does takes the bronze .
But it ’s a slighted accomplishment , considering that the top oil producers – both Russia and Saudi Arabia – out produce the U.S. by a factor of 2 to 1 .
In reality , the U.S. only contributes to about 10 - percent of the world ’s oil supply .
Confessions of a Consumer Whore :
Though , we are the heavy weight champions when it comes to consumption .
We use over 25 - percent of the world ’s oil , of which more than half of that is imported .
That ’s twenty - five freakin percent !
Wow , we ’re almost kinda special .
It ’s the Economy , Stupid :
We consume 20.7 million barrels of oil a day , but only 40 - percent of that is home grown .
Considering we only own 3 - percent of the world ’s oil reserves , offshore contributions would barely be significant .
And even if they were , the price of oil is still set by a global market .
Therefore no employee discount , we ’re still stuck with high prices .
Danger , Will Robinson : Even if we could Dumbledore our way into having offshore crude oil today , it still does n’t address our biggest fossil - fuel - foul , global warming .
It just postpones it .
We are making progress .
SUVs are going the way of the Dodo bird ; alternative fuel vehicles are becoming more and more prevalent .
Heck , even my mom uses reusable bags now .
But here ’s the half - empty : offshore drilling is not a solution , it ’s not even a quick fix – it ’s a mistake , plain and simple .
The only thing it has to offer is false hope and more environmental damage .

Disney Admits ‘ Prince Caspian ’ Release Date Was A Mistake
It was a decision that was filled with risks , and Disney are admitting that The Chronicles of Narnia : Prince Caspian may have been released at a time that was too competitive .
Released May 16 , 2008 , two weeks after Iron Man and a week before Memorial Day and the subsequent release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , the sequel to The Lion , The Witch and the Wardrobe was always going to face a tough road .
According to THR , Disney CEO Robert Iger , speaking at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in New York last Wednesday , said that Prince Caspian is a better movie than the first installment , but as a result of its release date , audiences are overlooking it .
Disney made the choice to delay the film until May due to the release of Sony Pictures The Water Horse : Legend of the Deep during the Christmas holidays , their original aim for Prince Caspian .
The sequel to a movie that featured a cameo from Father Christmas , Prince Caspian seemed a perfect choice for a Christmas holiday opening .
Competing with The Water Horse probably would have seen it come out on top , especially considering the fan base Narnia has behind it .
It gets worse for Disney , when you compare the amount that The Water Horse made ( $ 102.6 million ) , to The Lion , The Witch and the Wardrobe ‘s $ 744.8 million during its run .
Sadly , due to its untimely release — which not only saw it go up against Iron Man and Indy 4 and now Sex and the City , Prince Caspian has only managed to take in an estimated $ 115.6 million .
Hopefully Disney will learn from their mistakes for future releases , in particular the May 7 , 2010 release of The Chronicles of Narnia : Voyage of the Dawn Treader .
With any luck , that movie will move to a December 2009 release date !

[ digg- reddit- me ]
With some new information , I ’m adding to the timeline I created to demonstrate the significance of FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell ’s comments on net neutrality ( which is also a useful link to check out if you ’re unfamiliar with the Fairness Doctrine ) a few days ago .
The situation :
The Politics :
Obama is in favor of net neutrality .
McCain thinks it ’s all confusing and claims he does n’t know what his position is ( though he has made definitive statements opposing it . )
The Democrats are generally in favor of net neutrality .
It has not been a big issue for Republicans , but a few have come out against it ( see Ted Stevens . )
The conservative base hates the Fairness Doctrine though with a passion .
Since the idea occured to them :
Big internet companies want to charge more for customers to access certain internet sites , or to allow certain sites to have priority and to slow down others , and in general to assert control over internet content .
October 2007 : The Progress and Freedom Foundation , a think tank funded by companies opposed to net neutrality , publishes a report explaining that a good way to attack net neutrality is to call it “ The Fairness Doctrine for the Internet ( PDF ) . ”
Spring 2008 : Internet providers begin experiments with tiered pricing and other anti-net - neutrality practices .
After McCain secures Republican nomination :
He begins to rake in large sums of money from AT&T , the US Telecom Association , Verizon , and other companies opposing net neutrality .
June 2008 : A Republican Congressmen introduces a bill to outlaw the Fairness Doctrine ( which has been illegal since the 1980s ) .
Later in June 2008 : A conservative reporter publishes a story which alleges that Nancy Pelosi is considering reinstating the Fairness Doctrine .
August 12 , 2008 : FCC Commissioner , Robert McDowell , says that net neutrality could lead to the regulation of political speech on the internet , as if it ’s the Fairness Doctrine for the internet .
The Drudge Report publicizes the speech with the scare headline :
Now : Conservative talk radio hosts are talking about how net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine for the internet .
( I heard Steve Marlsburg , a bete noir of this blog , who is so old he probably still calls the internet the world wide web ranting on this subject on his show yesterday . )
Conservative bloggers are jumping on the bandwagon .
Next week , McCain plans on releasing the details of his Technology Policy which is reported to be “ market - oriented . ”
Then for my pessimistic speculation …
These conservatives begin to raise the issue in attacks on Obama , liberals , etcetera .
Progressives and liberals defend net neutrality .
And then : Independent - minded people and journalists who have n’t been paying attention to this issue finally notice now that conflicts are arising .
Journalists cover the issue giving “ both sides ” and independents throw up their hands , unable to pick a side .
And : Conservatives mount a campaign attacking Democrats .
Even those conservatives who support net neutrality are silent because they ’re happy for any issue on which they can hit Democrats and which they can use to fund raise .
Finally , January 2009 : After the election , Democrats attempt to pass net neutrality legislation .
A grass - roots structure has been created to oppose them , and many Republicans have publicly committed to oppose it .
An obvious policy choice that should have bipartisan support becomes a struggle to enact .
( On a hopeful note , I think this is a fight the Democrats and supporters of the internet can win . )
This is how public opinion is manipulated .
This is how our political system is corrupted as the obvious and clear policy is shrouded in spin and the consensus is replaced by deliberate polarization .
…
Matt Stoller of OpenLeft is more sanguine about the effects of this campaign to tar net neutrality :
Now , the question is not substantive , it ’s whether this campaign will work to persuade people that up is down , that black is white .
I do n’t think it will .
But what I think Stoller is missing is that this propaganda campaign does not seem directed to the public at large , but at conservative activists .
The Fairness Doctrine is not something that gets the blood of the average American boiling .
But it does evoke a Pavlovian response among conservative activists and right - wing radio listeners .
And although these groups are not large enough to force their way , they are large enough to derail the political conversation and make it harder to enact this obvious policy .
Even if some do realize they are being manipulated , many are willing to go along with the party - line and take the necessary positions to gain power .
All of which points to one thing : without Barack Obama as president , net neutrality may not have the necessary support .

Kudos to Albert G. Marquis ’ Monday letter , headlined “ McCain ’s smears reek of desperation , ” wherein Mr. Marquis correctly suggests John McCain is willing to stretch the truth to win the presidential election and Barack Obama is rational and reasonable and deserving of our vote .
This reminds me of the recent McCain TV commercial suggesting Obama is responsible for high gasoline prices .
The last time I checked , McCain was the longtime incumbent who must be blamed for many of the woes facing this nation and this world , and Obama was a first - term U.S. senator .
As Bob Dylan sang , “ You do n’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows . ”
The wind is blowing in the direction of Obama and , therefore , you can be assured McCain will become more and more desperate as we get closer to Election Day .
It ’s time for us to heed the words of the late Tim Russert , who believed his highest calling was to make sure we are “ an informed electorate . ”
This is not surprising given that Russert worked with U.S. Sen.

On Chinese Ch'an in Relation to Taoism [ 1 ]
By Wu Yi
Journal of Chinese Philosophy

To discuss the relationship between one school and another in the history of thought is a very subtle topic in which it is hard to draw an obvious conclusion .
Moreover , to discuss the influence of one school on another will entail many difficulties , because schools have similar styles , always pose similar questions , and have similar ideas and similar methods .
So it is difficult to say who influences whom .
Moreover among some opposite schools , even if one school is influenced by the other or if the philosopher of one school quotes from the classics of the other , they never say who they are quoting .
Therefore it is not easy to judge who has influenced whom .
For example , in the Book of Chao[a ] [ 2 ] , it is very obvious that Seng - chao[b ] ( 384-414 ) was influenced by the thought of Lao Tzu[c ] and Chuang Tzu[d ] , because he used the terms of Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu everywhere in his book .
But he still did not say where he was quoting from .
For this reason , this paper , concerning the relationship between the Ch'an[e ]
School and the thought of Taoism and Confucianism is just a suggestion for discussion , not a dogmatic conclusion .
In the beginning , the Ch'an School had a closer relationship to Taoism than to Confucianism .
However , the position was later reversed ; after the T'ang [ f ] Dynasty ( 618-907 ) , the influence that the Ch'an School had on Confucianism was very important .
When Indian Buddhism was transmitted into China , the first Chinese School to welcome it was Taoism .
At that time the school of " Ke I " [ g ] [ 3 ] explained the Buddhist teachings by means of Taoist terms , and the thought of many Dharma Masters such as Seng - chao , Hui- yuan [ h ] ( 523-592 ) , Tao - sheng [ i ] ( 360-434 ) was intermingled with the thought of Taoism .
Moreover Taoist " learning of the mystery " ( hsuan hsueh[j ] ) was flourishing during the period from the Wei- Chin[k ] to the North and South Dynasties ( 220 -581 ) , and it was natural that Taoist thought influenced the formation of the Ch'an School .
Further the period between Hui-neng [ l ] ( 637-713 ) and when the five schools [ 4 ] were formed was the golden age
p.132
of the Ch'an School .
At that time Confucianism was in decay , and Taoism became united with the Ch'an School .
Then in the Sung [ m ] Dynasty ( l960 - 1279 ) there were many Neo-Confucianists who were influenced by the Thought of the Ch'an School .
For example , Chou Tung - yi[n ] had friendly relations with Ch'an Masters Ho Lin Shou - yee[o ] , Huang Lung Hui - nan [ p ] Hui Tang Tsu-hsin[q ] .
and Lu Shan Fu-in[r ] .
At the same time , Chou Tung - yi and Chang Heng - chu[s ] learned from Ch'an master Tung Lin Chang - tsung[t ] , Cheng Ming - tao[u ] confessed that he had studied the thought of Lao Tzu and Buddhism for several decades , Ch'eng Yi-chuan[ v ] had asked Ch'an Master Huang Lung Lin-yuan[w ] about Tao , and had a friendly relationship with Ch'an Master Hui Tang Tsu-hsin. Chu Hsi[ x ] had studied under Ch'an Master Ta Hui Tzung - kao[y ] .
Thus most of Confucianists in the Sung Dynasty drew a good deal of their thought from the Ch'an School .
However these interactions also influenced the Ch'an School .
For example the Ch'an Masters Miao - hsi[z ] and Chu-an[aa ] in the Sung Dynasty edited a famous book named " Valuable Instructions in the Forest of Ch ' an . " which adopted many of the moral norms of Confucianism .
We will now look at these subtle relationships by means of the four characteristics of the Ch'an School .
They are " not depending upon words and letters " , '' meditation " , " kung - an [ ab ] " , and " sudden enlightenment " . [ 5 ]
I. Not Depending upon Words and Letters
The Lankavatara and Vajra Sutras set forth the idea " not depending upon words and letters " , but why did this idea not turn into a movement and become a great school ?
The Lankavatara and Vajra Sutras themselves consisted of words .
The idea of " not depending upon words and letters " only refers to a high state , but the actual texts are very repetitive .
Therefore the movement of " not depending upon words and letters " was achieved slowly after Indian Buddhism had been transmitted to China .
I use the qualification " slowly " with a special connotation , because an external historical condition was needed for the development of a school around the idea of " not depending upon words and letters "
The original schools of Taoism and Confucianism claimed that profound thought should be expressed in simple words and deep meanings .
p.133
Both of them had the tendency of " not depending upon words and letters " .
For example , in the " Appended Remarks " of the Book of Changes it is said , '" Through ease and simplicity , the principle of the world will be obtained . "
Confucius said , " I wish to say without speaking . "
Lao
Tzu said , " The sage practices the teaching of no speech . "
Chuang
Tzu emphasized , " The perfect words are without words " .
But all of these are just theories which needed an external cause to be turned into a movement .
The external cause was the arising during the T'ang Dynasty of a reactionary movement which claimed to return to the original simple state of the ancients .
It arose in response to the change of Character style and the invention of printing after the Ch'in[ac ] Dynasty ( 221-206 B.C. ) .
Language become more adorned , and the commentaries on the classics turned into linguistic analysis .
Therefore many scholars and writers brought out a movement to revive the ancient writing style .
For example , the simple poetry of T'ang Dynasty took the place of the long fu[ad ] ( one kind of rhymed composition ) of the Han Dynasty [ ae ] ( 206B.C.-220AD. ) ; the clear writing of the ancient style replaced the overadorned pien - li[ af ] writing ( one kind of antithesis ) in the Six Dynasties ( 222-589 ) .
The development of Chinese Buddhism came with the movement of returning to ancient ways of thought .
After the Han Dynasty , most of the Indian Buddhist sutras were translated into Chinese , and all schools strived with one another for bringing out a new theory .
Then they caused the repetitive Sutras more complicated and less significant .
During the period of Wei and Chin , such intelligent and honorable monks as Seng - chao and Tao - sheng claimed to go " beyond words " a concept which they absorbed from the thought of Taoism .
But during this period the external conditions were not mature , and their claims drew no response .
But the T'ang Dynasty , when Hui-neng lived , was a period of change in thought , and , aided by the external conditions , he started the movement of " not depending upon words and letters "
During Hui-neng 's time , many monks misunderstood " not depending upon words and letters " as " not using words and letters " .
Hui -neng 's criticism was very reasonable .
He thought that " not depending upon words and letters " simply meant not becoming attached to words and letters , and not establishing the obstruction of words and letters .
In fact " not depending upon words and letters " is just a slang , Hui -neng 's real intention was to advise us to meditate in our mind , and to practice by ourselves .
After
p.134
Hui-neng , in the Ch'an School , many monks took a wrong path , throwing away the sutras and not reading them .
But there were also a lot of Ch'an Masters who were good students of the sutras .
For example , Hui-neng 's disciples , Fa-ta[ ag ] recited the Saddharmapundarika Sutra ( the Louts Sutra ) , Chih- tung[ah ] in the beginning read the Lankavatara Sutra more than a thousand times , Chih- tao[ ai ] studied the Mahaparinirvana Sutra for more ten years , In - tsung [ aj ] was versed in the Mahaparinirvana Sutra , Yung- chia[ak ] studied all the Sutras and versed in the very subtle Dharma - door of concentration and contemplation according to the T'ien - tai [ al ] school .
Ch'an Master Pei-chang [ am ] gives a good explanation of reading sutras :
" When you read the sutras and study scriptures , you must take all words as returning to yourself .
All words and teachings just bring out your own awakening nature .
If you are not moved by the state and Dharma which are existent or non-existent , it is called the teachers .
If your wisdom can illuminate and break through all states and Dharmas which are existent or non-existent , it is called Vajra .
This means that you have the nature of freedom and independence .
If you fail to do this , even you have recited the twelve Vedas Sutras it just add to your arrogance of superior knowledge .
This is like slandering the Buddha it is not a cultivation .
To read sutras and to study the scriptures are good things for the common people .
If you over - emphasize on reading sutras and studying scriptures for those who have understood the principle , you will block them . " [ 6 ]
This is a proper explanation of " not depending upon words and letters " , and it is in accord with Hui-neng 's thought .
Afterward , the Confucianists of the Sung and Ming [ an ] Dynasties ( 960 - 1644 ) also responded to this thought .
For example , Ch'eng Ming - tao ( 1032 - 1085 ) said :
" Although my learning comes from the ancients ' teachings , the idea ' Heavenly principle ' is just awakened by myself " [ 7 ]
Lu Hsiang - shan[ao ] ( l139-1192 ) said :
p.135
" In learning , if I know the original , then all of the Six Classic Books are my footnotes . " [ 8 ]
Wang Yang- ming [ ap ] ( 1472-1528 ) said :
" There is no matter outside mind ; there is no affair outside mind ; there is no principle outside mind ; there is no righteousness outside mind ; there is no goodness outside mind " . [ 9 ]
All of these are quoted from the School of Mind in Neo-Confucianism , which is commonly acknowledged to have a close relationship with the Ch'an School .
Actually , most of Neo-Confucianists emphasized on cultivation in their own mind , and experience of the principle of Heaven .
Moreover , they claimed to not depend upon words and letters just as did the Ch'an School .
They did not seek for the explanation of words and sentences in the ancient sage 's classics .
It is obvious that they took this course in response to the Ch'an School .
II .
Meditation
Meditation , originally , was a practice common to Indian Buddhism and all Indian religions .
Although the Ch'an School takes the word " ch'an " as its name , its primary meaning is not meditation .
Therefore Hui-neng explained meditation with a special meaning , and emphasized it as a cultivation of understanding the mind and seeing the original nature .
The " Great Learning " [ 10 ] which is a Confucianist classic says : " After knowing where to rest on , one can be calm .
After being calm , one can be tranquil .
After being tranquil , one can be peaceful .
After being peaceful , one can be thoughtful .
After being thoughtful , one can attain the end . "
This passage uses the terms " rest " , " calm " , and " tranquil " which seem like the Dharma - door of concentration and contemplation .
But its contents are different from meditation .
p.136
The close relation with meditation is Chuang Tzu's " sitting in forgetfulness " and " mind fasting " .
For example :
" Destroying the limbs and body , renouncing cleverness and intelligence , departing from form and knowledge , one can be in accord with the great universality .
This is called sitting in forgetfulness . " [ 11 ]
" Being concentrated , one should not hear with one 's ears , but with one 's mind ; one should not hear with one 's mind , but with one 's breath .
Hearing stops with the ears , mind stops with the symbol , but the breath is empty and waits for all things .
Only Tao gathers in emptiness .
The emptiness is mind fasting ' ' [ 12 ]
D.T. Suzuki said :
" The most distinctively characteristic hallmark of Zen is its insistence on the awakening of pratyatmajna which is an inner perception deeply reaching the core of one 's being ......
This corresponds to Chuang Tzu's mind fasting or mind forgetting or clear as the morning . " [ 13 ]
This is not sufficiently clear and needs more explanation .
First we must know the difference between meditation that Hui-neng emphasized and the Dhyana of India .
Dhyana emphasizes sitting in meditation and Samadhi , but the meditation that Hui-neng emphasizes as its primary meaning the understanding of the mind and the seeing of the nature .
and the awakening to the original face .
The " sitting in forgetfulness " which Chuang Tzu emphasizes is to see the true master .
and " mind fasting " is to understand the true mind , so in this point , the Ch'an School 's thought is as same as Chuang Tzu's .
Although we cannot say that Hui-neng 's explanation of meditation is completely influenced by Chuang Tzu , we can at least say that the idea of meditation in the Ch'an School after Hui-neng is very close to Chuang Tzu's thought .
The special meaning of meditation which Hui-neng developed obviously influenced the Neo- Confucianists ' thought in the Sung and Ming Dynasties .
( 960-1644 )
p.137
There was no method of meditation in the field of Pre-Ch'in Confucianism .
Although there was mention of meditation on similar terms in the first chapter of the Great Learning , it did not draw more Confucianists ' attention before the Sung Dynasty .
But afterward having been influenced by the Ch'an School , the Neo-Confucianists learned sitting meditation .
In order to establish a difference from the meditation of Buddhism , they took the first chapter of the Great Learning as the foundation of their meditation , and explained that their meditation was for making mind sincere , not for becoming a Buddha .
The Neo-Confucianists were always interested in the sitting in stillness .
For example , Chu Hsi said :
" Ming - tao teaches people the sitting in stillness , and Mr. Lee[aq ] also teaches people sitting in stillness , because if one 's mind is not firm , then one cannot find a place to cultivate the Tao[ar ] and virtue . " [ 14 ]
Chu Hsi himself taught people how to sit in stillness .
He said :
" To begin in learning , the first method is the sitting in stillness .
If one sits in stillness , one 's basic source ( mind ) is firm .
Although one 's mind cannot be free from seeking for outside things , when one returns to oneself , there is a peaceful place for oneself . " [ 15 ]
But they worried that the other people would mistakenly think that they had learned to meditate , So Chu Hsi specially explained :
" Sitting in stillness is not like meditation and Samadhi which are beyond thought .
It simply causes the mind return and not to do any useless things .
Then the mind is clear , without anything to do , and it is naturally concentrated , when there is something to do , the mind can respond to it .
But when the matter is done , the mind will return to its stillness . " [ 16 ]
Wang Yang - ming had practiced sitting in stillness with his students , he feared that his students did not understand the meaning of sitting in stillness as
p.138
taught in Confucianism , so he immediately sent a letter to his students , which says :
" The sitting in stillness in the temple which we have talked about is not meditation or Samadhi .
Since we are always confused by things and affairs , and do not know how to cultivate ourselves , we practice this in order to complete the effort which can take our wandering mind back . " [ 17 ]
Although the Neo-Confucianists denied it , it is obvious that the sitting in stillness which they practiced was influenced by the Ch'an School .
Both of them cultivate in the mind , one to understand the mind and see the original nature , the other to take the wandering mind back .
III .
Kung-an
The Kung-ans of the Ch'an School are very complicated , but if we analyze them in detail , we will find that they have a certain pattern .
I have written a paper about the method of Kung - an .
According to their different dialogues .
I divided them into ten kinds .
Maybe there are more than ten , but at least we must acknowledge that many Kung - ans have the same method of expression .
the meanings they manifest are the same .
It shows us that Kung - ans have certain patterns .
If we study these patterns .
we find the foundation of these patterns lies in the " opposite Dharmas " which are described in the Sixth Patriarch Platform Sutra .
It says :
" When someone asks you question , if he asks about being , answer by non-being ; if he asks about non-being , answer by being ; if he asks about the common , answer by the sagely ; if he asks about the sagely , answer with the common .
The two paths depend on each other and produce the middle way .
If the other dialogues are like this , you will not lose the principle . " [ 18 ]
The Kung -ans which the later Ch'an Masters created and used were transformed from this pattern of dialogue .
Hui-neng had in fact used it by
p.139
himself .
For example :
" A monk asked Hui-neng , Who knows the meaning of Huang - mei ? [ as ]
The Master answered , ' Those who understand Buddha can know . '
Then the monk asked , ' Do you understand ? '
The Master answered , ' I do not understand Buddha Dharma ' . " [ 19 ]
If we agree that the method of " the opposite Dharmas depending on each other " which was emphasized by Hui-neng is a basic pattern of Kung - an , then we will find its source in Lao Tzu's statement that " Reversal is the movement of Tao " .
Lao
Tzu said :
" The bright Tao looks dim , the advancing Tao seems to be retreating , the level Tao looks rough , the high virtue looks like a valley , the great whiteness looks spotted , the abundant virtue looks deficient , the vigorous virtue looks like a coward , the pure substance looks changeable , the largest square is without corners , the great vessel is completed lately , the great music is without sound , the great image is without form " [ 20 ]
From this chapter , we find that Lao Tzu 's teaching is expressed by the pattern which he said " The real words sound the opposite . "
Although the Kung-an was created by the Ch'an School , its basic pattern had a close relationship with Taoist thought .
During the period of Wei and Chin ( 220-420 A.D ) , Taoist thought became a metaphysical studies which was called " learning of the mystery " ( hsuan hsueh ) .
At that time the " pure talk " ( ch'ing t'an ) [ at ] of " learning of the mystery " is sometimes like the dialogue of Kung - an , for example ;
" A guest asked the magistrate Yueh [ au ] about the meaning of ' The point cannot touch the thing itself .
Yueh did not analyze the sentence ; he just touched the table with the end of a duster and said , ' Does it touch the table ? '
The guest answered , ' It has touched . '
Yueh , then , raised the end of the duster and asked , ' If it has touched it , how could it leave it ? '
Then the guest was awakened and admired him .
Yueh 's speech is simple and pene -
p.140
trating .
All of his sayings are like this . " [ 21 ] " The general Ying [ av ] asked , ' Nature creates all things without mind .
Why are there few good men and many bad men in the world ? '
None of the guests could answer .
Only Liu Yuan[aw ] replied .
' It is as when water is poured upon the earth .
It flows everywhere and has many forms but few of them are completely square or circular . '
Everyone praised the answer as perfect and penetrating " . [ 22 ]
" The magistrate Ying asked , ' What is the substance of the Change ? '
Hui -yuan answered .
' The response is the substance of the Change . '
Ying asked , ' The mountain of copper collapses in the west , the spiritual bell responds in the east .
Is it the Change ? '
Hui -yuan just laughed without answering . " [ 23 ]
If the above stories were interpolated into the Records of the Transmission of the Lamp , they would become wonderful Kung-ans .
Therefore I believe that there was the expression as Kung-an in the development of Taoist thought .
Because many Neo-Confucianists were friends with Ch'an masters , they sometimes treated them as teachers .
Thus many Neo-Confucianists became actors in Kung - an stories .
For example :
" Lee Ao[ax ] joined his palms and asked .
' What is Tao ? Yo - shan [ ay ] pointed up and down with his finger and asked , ' Do you understand ? '
Ao answered .
'l do not understand . '
Yao - shan said .
' The cloud is in the sky , the water is in the bottle . '
Ao was very happy and bowed to Yao - shan , then wrote a gatha , ' Having cultivated his body as a crane , he was reading Sutras among thousands of pine tree .
I went to ask him about Tao .
He did not speak any words besides . '
The cloud is in the sky and the water is in the bottle . " [ 24 ]
So it is natural that the Neo-Confucianists unintentionally used the witty words of the Kung - ans when they talked with students .
For example :
" Yuan Yeh - ming [ az ] asked Cheng Tzu[ba ] , ' What is Tao ? '
Ch'eng
Tzu answered .
' It is that which you practice . " [ 25 ]
p.141
" When Ch'eng Tzu was going to die , his students said , ' You must now use what you have learned , ' Ch'eng Tzu answered ' To be used is not the Tao . ' " [ 26 ]
" I - ch 'uan [ bb ] asked , ' We are now going to say good - bye forever , would you teach me more ? '
Shao k'ang - chieh [ bc ] raised his hands to show him .
I - ch 'uan asked , ' What is the meaning ? '
K'ang - chieh answered , ' You must make the road broad before you .
If the road is narrow , then you yourself cannot traverse it .
How could you lead other people ? ' " [ 27 ]
The last dialogue was included in The Valuable Instructions in the forest of Ch'an .
Just the names of two men were changed .
Thus :
" Huang - lung Hui-nan told Wang An- shih , [ bd ] ' In whatever you want to do , you should always make your road broader and make it easy for everyone to pass .
This is the function of the great man 's mind .
If the road is narrow and blocked , not only others can not pass , but you yourself cannot pass either . ' "
Later , Wang Yang - ming sometimes intentionally used the witty words of Kung - ans to awaken students ; for example :
' 'A student asked Wang Yang - ming about the learning of a sage .
He answered , ' You now just know the common things .
After you have really understood how to make up your mind to become a sage , I will tell you . ' " [ 28 ]
" Wang Yang - ming always visited the temples of Nan - ping [ be ] Hu-pao[bf ] .
There was a monk who had sat in a locked room and has not seen anyone or spoken for three years .
Wang Yang - ming yelled at him , ' You , monk !
What do you say when you open your mouth all day ?
What do you see when you open your eyes all day ? ' " [ 29 ]
The pattern of these dialogues is of the kind usually used in kung - an .
So we can say that there is a close relationship between kung - an and the dialogues
p.142
of the Neo-Confucianists .
IV .
Sudden Enlightenment
As for sudden enlightenment , we cannot find the same idea in the thought of the Pre-Ch'in Confucianists .
In Taoism , Lao Tzu often used the word ming [ bg ] ; for example : " To know eternity is called ming " , " Those who know themselves are ming ' ' .
The ming is as same as enlightenment , but not then same as sudden enlightenment .
In the Book of Chuang Tzu , there is a similar description of sudden enlightenment :
" After three days , I can be beyond the world .
After seven days more , I can be beyond outside things ;
After nine days more , I can be beyond life ;
After being beyond life , I can be enlightened in the morning .
After being enlightened in the morning , I can see Oneness ; After seeing Oneness , I can be beyond the ancient and modern .
Being beyond the ancient and modern , I can attain the state of no - death and no-birth . " [ 30 ]
" Enlightenment in the morning " means the clear state of morning .
Why do I say that it is the same as sudden enlightenment ?
Because after being enlightened in the morning , one can see Oneness .
The Oneness means the absolute one , or the substance of the Tao .
In Buddhist terms , it is to see the self - nature or to see one 's original face .
Therefore enlightening in the morning to see the absolute Oneness is like the state of sudden enlightenment .
D.T. Suzuki has said that Chuang Tzu's " enlightenment in the morning " is as same as the Ch'an School 's " seeing the nature " , but he just drew this conclusion from the words .
In fact there was an external cause to make them have a close relationship .
During the period of Wei and Chin , the first two monks who brought out the idea of sudden enlightenment and had a close relationship with the thought of Chuang Tzu were Chih Tao - lin[ bh ] and Tao -sheng .
Chin Tao - lin made a commentary on the first chapter of Chuang Tzu , " Roaming Carefree " , so it is obvious that his thought had a close relationship with Chuang Tzu's .
In the Commentary of the Book of Chao [ 31 ] it
p.143
says :
" The meaning of the small sudden enlightenment as Chih Tao - lin saying , ' On the seventh ground one can see the state of no - birth ' "
In Buddhist terms , there are many kinds of ten grounds .
It is unnecessary to describe the ten grounds in detail in this paper .
But the no-birth which Chih Tao - lin speaks of is an obvious parallel to the state of no - death and no-birth which is described in the section of the enlightenment in the morning of Chuang Tzu .
Later ,
Tao -sheng thought that since Chih Tao - lin 's sudden enlightenment is just on the seventh ground , it is not the utmost .
So he brought out the idea of the great sudden enlightenment .
In The Commentary of The Book of Chao his thought was quoted as follows :
" Dharma Master Tao- sheng has described the idea of the great sudden enlightenment .
He said : the word " sudden " means that the principle is beyond discrimination and the word ' enlightenment ' means extreme illumination .
The non-dual enlightenment is in accord with the principle of no-discrimination .
Reason and intelligence are completely renounced , that is called sudden enlightenment .
To understand by seeing is enlightenment , to understand by hearing is faith .
Understanding by faith is not true , when enlightenment is attained , the faith will disappear .
The way of principle is as natural as fruits falling down by themselves .
Enlightenment can not be produced by itself ; it must go through faith . "
It is obvious that Tao - sheng 's great sudden enlightenment is more complete than Chih Tao - lin 's small sudden enlightenment .
But Tao - sheng 's idea about the great sudden enlightenment was not without relationship with Chuang Tzu's thought .
For example , in the Biographies of Eminent Monks , he was described as follows :
" After Tao - sheng had thought for a long time , he awakened to the state which was beyond words , and sighed , ' The image is
p.144
used to exhaust the meaning ; if one has obtained the meaning , one should forget the image ; words are used to explain the principle ; when one has attained the principle one should cease speaking .
When the Buddhist Sutras were transmitted into China , the translators , because of the difficulty of the foreign language , always became attached to the words , and few of them knew the complete meaning .
If one has gotten fish and forgotten the trap , one is able to discuss the Tao . '
Then he observed the true and the common , and studied causes and conditions .
He formed the theory that the good will not bring good retribution , and through sudden enlightenment one will become a Buddha . "
What Tao -sheng sighed here simply responds to the words of Chuang Tzu :
" The trap is for fish .
If one has got fish , one should forget the trap .
The snare is for rabbits .
If one has got a rabbit , one should forget the snare .
The words are for expressing the meaning .
If one has got the meaning , one should forget the words .
Where can I talk with the man who has forgot the words ? " [ 32 ]
I emphasize the relationship between Chih Tao-lin , Tao-sheng and Chuang Tzu with sudden enlightenment in order to explain the close relationship between the Ch'an School and Taoism at the source .
Chuang
Tzu's enlightenment in the morning which is able to see the absolute oneness and Tao - sheng 's great sudden enlightenment which must come through gradual cultivation are definitions of Hui-neng 's sudden enlightenment .
In the Sixth Patriarch 's Platform Sutra Hui-neng emphasized again and again that sudden enlightenment was just seeing the nature and that it did not mean giving up gradual cultivation .
Actually sudden enlightenment is just self - awakening .
To add the word " sudden " means that the enlightenment is complete and pure , and the method simple and direct .
If the Ch'an School is not a farce which plays in beating and kicking , but is the basic understanding of the mind and seeing the nature , penetrating throughout outside and within , then the Ch'an School 's influence on the Neo-Confucianists is very deep and great .
How deep is it ?
it touches the central idea of Confucianism , it is " jen " , [ bi ]
p.145
( Humanity , benevolence etc. )
The " jen " of Confucianism has no fixed definition .
The Analects says , " Confucius seldom spoke of profit , and fate , and jen , " Confucius did not give any definition for jen , when his students asked him about it , he simply told them , depending on their individuality , of the practical virtue of jen , such as " to love people " , " filial piety and brotherly love " , " loyalty and magnanimity " , " respect , forgiveness , faith , cleverness , wisdom " and so on .
Mencius thought that jen is a kind of love .
Therefore the idea of jen before the Chen Dynasty means the practical virtues .
But the Neo-Confucianists who were influenced by the Ch'an School thought of jen as a mental quality , and explained jen as awakening .
For example , Chen Ming - tao said :
" The medical book says , 'Paralysis of the hands and feet is called a lack of jen . '
This is a good description .
The man with jen accords with heaven and earth as the same substance .
Nothing is not himself , and no place is beyond himself .
If he does not take everything as himself , then nothing has a relationship with him .
It is like the paralysis of the hands and feet ; the energy cannot go through them , so they do not belong to him .
Therefore , universally giving to and saving all beings is the merit and function of the sage .
Jen is difficult to describe , therefore it is simply said , ' If you wish to stand , you should let other people stand : if you wish to develop , you should let other people develop .
Take the example of the things which are around you : this is the way to attain jen . '
If we contemplate jen in this way .
we can obtain its substance . " [ 33 ]
Here jen is explained as the awakening of mind .
The later Confucianists afterward explained the mind as spiritual brightness .
It is equal to say that Jen is the spiritual brightness of mind .
Ming - tao further emphasized :
" The early sages and the later sages are the same .
It is not to transmit the Tao of a sage , but the mind of a sage .
It is not to transmit the mind of a sage , but your own mind .
Your own mind is not different from the sage 's mind .
it is broad and boundless .
It includes all goodness .
if you wish to transmit the Tao of a
p.146
sage , what you have to do just expand this mind . " [ 34 ]
This idea is not only , on the surface , like the Ch'an School 's transmission of mind ; but actually , it places the substance of Tao in the mind .
Later , the ideas of Lu hsiang - shan 's " The mind is same , the principle is same . [ 34 ] " , and Wang Chi's [bj ] ( Yang - ming 's student ) " An people in the street are sages . " [ 35 ] were drawn from this thought .
The Neo-Confucianists explained the mind of jen as spiritual awakening , and so naturally they took the sudden enlightenment of the Ch'an School as their method .
The obvious example is Wang Yang - ming 's saying :
" I teach by two methods .
I cause those who are sharp in nature to be enlightened directly to the source , because the source of mind is originally clear without any obstruction , and it is originally an intermediate state which precedes action .
Those who are sharp in nature awaken to the substance that is their effort to make other people and himself , outside and inside into one . " [ 37 ]
This is completely the same as sudden enlightenment .
Because this .
he had a practical method like meditation on a kung - an ; it is the Hua - t ' ou [ bk ] [ 38 ] of pursuing innate knowledge .
For example ?
he said :
" If we see there is a little bit energy moving in our body , we must bring out the hua - t'ou of pursuing innate knowledge to help us to control the energy each other . " [ 39 ]
" To be cautious and to cultivate is the effort of holding the hua-t 'ou and not letting it go . " [ 40 ]
Both in his thought and in his practice in life , Wang Yang - ming is of complete Confucianist spirit , but his method of bringing out hua - t'ou was not used in the Pre -Ch'in Confucianists .
It is obvious that he is influenced by the Ch'an School .
I have been discussing a simple comparison .
The more important thing is to understand through this comparison these three schools ' development and their intermingling in the history of Chinese thought .
p.147
Confucianism and Taoism have the same source , they matured together during the Period of Spring and Autumn and the Warring States ( 722-222 B.C. )
Lao Tzu's thought influenced the governing of Huang - Lao[bl ] , and Confucianism was respected by Emperor Wu[bm ] of Han Dynasty , but their thought did not go beyond the practice of politics , and had not great achievement in the realm of thought itself .
During the Period of Wei-Chin , and North and South Dynasty , Taoist thought turned to " learning of the mystery " and " pure talk . "
Although Taoism was flourishing in that time , it was just a game of ideas without real vigor .
At that time Indian Buddhism was transmitted to China , and Taoism was the first to welcome it .
Neo -Taoists and Buddhists made an effort together to create the Ch'an School , which was basic on Chinese thought .
It was a combination of the thought of Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu and the Prajna Teaching of the Great Vehicle .
During this period , Taoist thought was twisted and became the religion of Taoism and the Study of Immortality .
So there were no pure Taoists as transcendent as Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu .
But many Ch'an Masters in the T'ang Dynasty actually had the spirit of Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu. Thomas Merton said :
" The true inheritors of the thought and spirit of Chuang Tzu are the Chinese Zen Buddhists of the T'ang period . '' [ 41 ]
Actually , we can say that Taoists in the T'ang Dynasty were simply Ch'an Masters .
The history of Chinese Ch'an between T'ang and Sung Dynasties was just a combination of the thought of Taoism and the Prajna of the Great Vehicle .
For example , the thought of Bodhidharma 's disciple Hui- k'e , [ bn ] the thought of Tao - sheng ' s [ bo ] disciple Fa-jung [ bp ] , the thought of the sect of Neo - t' ou [ bq ] which was started by Fa-jung , and the thought of Hui-neng and his disciples Ma-tsu [ br ] Shih - t' ou [bs ]
Nan-ch 'uan [ bt ] Chao - chou[bu ] , were all intermingled with the thought of Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu .
In the Sung Dynasty , Chinese thought entered into a period of a great harmonization .
The three schools , Confucianism , Taoism , Buddhism , each had the characteristic of harmonization .
Thus the Neo-Confucianism adopted the thought of Buddhism and Taoism ; the Ch'an School adopted the thought of Confucianism and Taoism ; as to Taoism , sometimes it entered into Confucianism and led some Neo-Confucianists to adopt the thought of Taoism ;
p.148
sometimes it permeated Buddhism and caused some Ch'an masters to adopt the thought of Taoism .
Even in the religion of Taoism , the School of Ch'uan - chen [ bv ] , which was created by Wang Ch'ung - yang [ bw ] adopted the thought of Confucianism and Taoism . [ 42 ]
But generally speaking , Taoism has no clear development , except that it was twisted and became the religion of Taoism .
Buddhism , after the Sung Dynasty .
was in decay .
Even the new School of Ch'an almost decayed into a crazy Ch'an , because it became attached to the four characteristics and departed from the simplicity of the thought of Hui-neng .
Therefore , after the Sung Dynasty , the major school in the history of Chinese thought is Neo-Confucianism .
Neo-Confucianism , whether the School of Ch'eng - Chu[bx ] [ 43 ] or the School of Lu- Wang [by ] [ 44 ] .
always had a relationship with Buddhism .
and involved the thought of Ch'an .
The School of Lu- Wang , especially , was often criticized by the term " the man of Ch'an " .
Many ancient philosophers and modern scholars have an idea that one is Confucianist , one must be a complete Confucianist , and if one is a Buddhist .
one must be a pure Buddhist .
Because of this psychological problem .
some philosophers and scholars dared not confess that the , adopted thought and method of other schools .
Moreover , they criticized one another according to whether or not they had adopted the thought of other schools .
An example was the conference of Goose Lake and the debate about Tai - Che [ bz ] and Wu - Che[ca ] in Neo-Confucianism .
Many later scholars have followed this and have taken it as a standard to distinguish among one another .
It is a severe misunderstanding which obstructs the development of Chinese thought .
The great master Han- shan[cb ] of the Ming Dynasty wrote an easy called " To Contemplate the Shadow and Echo About Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu " to criticize this misunderstanding .
He wrote :
" I always saw that many scholars were frightened and dared not go on .
as if they were meeting a tiger in the road , when they read the quotations of other philosophers and historic books in the Sutras and commentaries .
If you ask them to practice , they will say , ' These speak of an outside way ' , and they turn their backs to them .
I also saw that some superior men who studied the thought of Chuang Tzu took the Buddhist teaching to
p149
certify Chuang
Tzu's meaning , and said ' All Buddhist Sutras come from here . '
Thinking in this way , can we say they understand the principle ?
In fact , those who learn Buddhist teaching , but do not understand the thought of all other philosophers , not only do not understand the worldly Dharma , but also do not understand the Buddha Dharma .
Those who explain the thought of Chuang Tzu , and say that Chuang Tzu's thought can exhaust the meaning of all Buddhist Sutras , not only do not know the Buddhist teaching , but also do not know Chuang Tzu 's thought .
This is the reason that truth is difficult to understand .
Therefore it is said : ' From the standpoint of the large looking at the minute , one cannot understand the minute completely ; from the stand - point of the minute looking at the large , one cannot understand the large clearly . '
I have taken three things for self - discipline .
There are : if one does not know the Annals of Spring and Autumn , one cannot govern the world ; if one does not know Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu , one cannot forget the world ; if one does not investigate Ch'an , one cannot transcend the world .
If one knows these things , one may be talked of as being learned . "
Han - shan 's opinion is correct .
In academic studies , I believe that if a Ch'an Master has one tenth of Taoist thought in his thought , he is one tenth a Taoist ; if half his thought is Taoist , he is half a Taoist .
It is as same with Confucianism and Taoism .
What school he belongs to on the surface is just a title and a classification .
What is most important is the substance of his thought .
In fact , his absorption of the thought of other schools , far from decreasing his importance , simply demonstrates that his thought is large enough to include other schools .
In my view , then , although the Neo-Confucianists adopted the thought of the Ch'an School , it did not vitiate their achievement when it was done correctly ; rather it had the capacity to bring out a new state and a new development for both schools .
For example , in the Sung Dynasty , the Ch'an School did not use in a proper manner the four characteristics which I have described ; that caused many monks to stop studying the Sutras , to sit in deathlike meditation , to create kung - ans , and to seek for sudden enlightenment in a wrong way .
During that time the Ch'an School lacked practical
p.150
moral rules .
But the Neo-Confucianists achieved a great deal in ethical thought , thus they could have helped the Ch'an School in its decay .
Therefore we should neither criticize Wane Yang - ming as a " man of poor Ch'an " from the viewpoint of Confucianism , nor say from the Buddhist viewpoint that he stole the Ch'an Dharma - door .
Rather , from the Confucianism 's standpoint , we should respect the openness of his mind in using Ch'an Dharma - door ; and from the Buddhist standpoint , we should be glad to see Ch'an thought planted in a new field .
It is a pity that the Neo-Confucianists did not take this view , and that the decaying Ch'an School failed to seek renewal through this view .
Instead , Neo-Confucianism and the Ch'an School remained divided and went down a dead - end road .
Today , when we discuss this matter from an objective standpoint , we should open the doors of the three schools wider .
A monk asked Chao - chou , " What is Chao - chou ? " Chao - chou answered , " The east gate , south Fate , west gate , and north gate , " This is the same as saying that we can attain tile Tao through any gate .
Now we need to say also , " After attaining the Tao , all gates are open to one another . "
Having attained this state , we go beyond the academic field , and attain the state of practice .
The topic which I have discussed will become useless talk .

There is currently no cure for Alzheimer 's disease Dementia could be slowed significantly by treatments which reset the body 's natural clock , researchers have said .
The Dutch team used brighter daytime lighting - with or without the drug melatonin - to improve patients ' sleep , mood and cut aggressive behaviour .
It concludes that these can slow deterioration by 5 % - which a UK specialist said meant patients living in their own homes for months longer .
The study appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
If someone could be kept at home for an extra six months , rather than placed in a care home , there are huge personal and social benefits
Dr Michael Hastings
MRC Laboratory for Molecular Biology , Cambridge
The disruption to the body 's circadian rhythm - the natural cycle that governs sleep and wakefulness - can be one of the most difficult of dementia symptoms for carers to cope with .
It can mean that people with the illness can be asleep during the day , but fully awake for periods during the night .
Other studies have suggested that the use of bright room lighting and melatonin can help adjust the " clock " , and the researchers from the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in Amsterdam managed to recruit 189 care home residents to take part in an unique trial .
Six of the care homes taking part had lighting installed , and this was turned on between 9 am and 6 pm every day .
Some of the patients , most of whom had some form of dementia , received melatonin , a naturally - occurring hormone , and their progress was then monitored for at least the next year .
Those who had melatonin , but no extra lighting , had better sleep patterns , but tended to be more withdrawn and have a worse mood .
However , patients having melatonin and bright light together managed to avoid these mood problems .
Even having the light without melatonin slowed " cognitive deterioration " by 5 % compared with those homes which did not install brighter lighting , and depressive symptoms fell by 19 % .
' Spectacular '
The study authors said that care homes should consider introducing the lights for their residents with dementia .
Dr Michael Hastings , from the Medical Research Council Laboratory for Molecular Biology in Cambridge , and himself a researcher into circadian rhythms and Alzheimer 's disease , said the study results were " spectacular " .
" Although 5 % may not sound like a huge amount , it compares well with treatments such as Aricept designed to slow the progression of the illness .
" Over the course of Alzheimer 's , it could represent six months , and you have to remember that the light therapy is completely non-invasive , and melatonin is a very gentle drug . "
He said that sleep disturbances were often the " final straw " for relatives trying to cope for people with dementia .
" You can have a situation where someone is asleep for part of the day , then at 3 am will be awake , wandering around the house , turning the gas on .
Relatives can manage quite a few of the symptoms of mild or moderate dementia , but this can be too much .
" It 's a crunch issue , and if someone could be kept at home for an extra six months , rather than placed in a care home , there are huge personal and social benefits . "
He added that since circadian rhythm disruption was a feature of other neurological diseases , such as Huntington 's and Parkinson 's , there might also be an application for the therapy elsewhere .

What are these ?
When the results began coming in from the 30 March 2005 Powerball drawing , lottery officials suspected fraud was underway .
Although only one winner qualified for the $ 13.8 million jackpot , a record 110 players were claiming second prizes of either $ 100,000 or $ 500,000 ( depending on whether they ’d paid an extra dollar for the Power Play option that multiplies a win ) for having matched the first five of the six numbers drawn .
Normally the lottery , which is held across 29 states , pays out only about four or five second - place prizes .
Having 110 claimants of second - place money appeared highly suspect .
Yet it turned out no chicanery had been afoot : the unexpected result had been just the way the cookie crumbled .
The roughly one - in - three - million combination of 22 , 28 , 32 , 33 , and 39 had been selected by so many hopeful lotto players because it had been the set of “ lucky numbers ” given to them in their fortune cookies .
( The cookies missed on having all six winning numbers by a mere matter of recommending 40 rather than 42 as the red Powerball number . )
The sagacious confections had been manufactured at Wonton Food Inc. of Long Island City in Queens , New York .
That factory produces four million fortune cookies a day vended under a variety of brands , which is how the cookies came to influence lottery players in so many states .
Stunned lottery officials heard time and again from the second - place winners that they ’d gotten their numbers from cookies .
Additional confirmation of the claim came from the lottery tickets themselves : nearly all of them listed “ 40 ” as the Powerball number , and 40 had been the final of the six numbers given on the fortune cookie slips .
While not everyone plays numbers that are suggested to them by external sources , a great many do .
A March 2005 episode of television ’s Lost included a sequence of lottery numbers , and hundreds of viewers subsequently played that combination .
It did n’t win , though .
Pelosi indicates openness to offshore drilling vote David Edwards and Nick Juliano

This A week after House Republicans began daily demonstrations to demand expanded oil drilling , Speaker Nancy Pelosi is showing signs she might be willing to reverse her longstanding opposition to giving oil companies more access to America 's coastlines .
Pelosi told CNN's Larry King that she would consider including expanded offshore drilling in energy legislation that also would include provisions to increase investment in renewable energy and release oil from the US strategic reserve .
The San Francisco Democrat maintained that oil drilling alone would do little on its own to lower gas prices .
She urged oil companies to drill on the 68 million offshore acres they already have access to and accused Republicans of perpetrating a " hoax " in their push for expanded drilling .
" They have this thing that says , ' Drill offshore in the protected areas . '
Well we can do that .
We can have a vote on that , but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public , and not just a hoax on them , " Pelosi said on Larry King Live Monday night .
Offshore drilling " is not excluded , let me say it that way , " Pelosi told the CNN host .
" It depends on how that is proposed , if the safeguards are there . "
Angry Republicans have taken to an empty House floor every weekday since Aug. 1 , when the chamber formally adjourned for its five - week summer recess .
Accusing Democrats of ignoring the plight of consumers to go on vacation , the conservative members have called on Pelosi and President Bush to call Congress back into session to vote for what they 're calling an " all of the above " solution that would expand offshore drilling while simultaneously upping investments in technologies like wind , solar and hybrid fuels .
Pelosi accused the GOP of simply acting on behalf of their Big Oil benefactors -- " they rule " the Republicans , Pelosi said of the oil companies -- but she predicted a compromise was possible between when Congress returns next month and before it adjourns at year 's end .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Oil prices will hit $ 300 a barrel in 10 years if the United States fails to reduce its dependence on foreign imports , billionaire oil investor T. Boone Pickens told U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday .
T. Boone Pickens , founder and CEO of BP Capital Management , prepares to to testifiy before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee about alternative energy plans at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington , July 22 , 2008 .

The United States imports nearly 70 percent of its oil and Pickens said the world ’s top petroleum - consuming nation would import 80 percent in a decade if it does not aggressively tap its own natural gas and renewable resources .
“ If we continue to drift , oil will hit $ 300 a barrel in 10 years , ” Pickens testified at a hearing of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee .
He testified as the Senate planned to debate energy legislation amid calls for more oil drilling to help lower oil prices which hit a record this month of over $ 147 a barrel .
Pickens has been touring the country pushing a plan under which domestic natural gas supplies would be used to power cars instead of electrical power plants .
The federal government and private investors would build a massive wind farm system in the middle of the country from Mexico to Canada to provide electricity .
Pickens , who heads the hedge fund BP Capital , stands to benefit from such a program .
He ’s building a 4,000 megawatt , $ 10 billion wind farm in northern Texas that should start generating power in 2011 .
Industry group the American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) has said the Pickens plan could work if the government renews the production tax credit for renewable energy , preferably for longer than a year or two .

Growth in U.S. wind power has been dramatic .
Preliminary figures show the United States in July may have surpassed Germany as the world ’s largest generator of wind power , AWEA said .
“ We ’re on track to doing that , if it has n’t happened already , ” said an AWEA spokeswoman .
Wind could generate 20 percent of U.S. electricity by 2030 , only slightly less than natural gas currently fires , the Department of Energy said in a report .
EMINENT DOMAIN
Building transmission lines and securing corridors to bring wind power from the heartland to the coasts would be a major effort .
“ I think we ’re talking eminent domain , ” Pickens told reporters after the hearing , referring to the practice in which the government sometimes seizes private property with monetary compensation .
He said bringing the power to the coasts would take an effort similar to former president Dwight Eisenhower ’s building of the national highway system during the Cold War .
It could cost hundreds of billions of dollars to develop wind power .
Pickens said reduced crude oil imports could pay .
Natural gas analysts were less certain the country can convert quickly from its gasoline - and diesel - based vehicle transport and fueling systems .
Chris Kostas , analyst at Energy Security Analysis Inc in Boston , said growing oil demand from developing countries like China and India could keep crude prices rising even if the United States succeeded in cutting oil imports .
Some 8 million vehicles in the world run on natural gas , with only about 140,000 in the United States , said Pickens , who owns a Honda car that runs on natural gas .
House Democrats were to hold a closed door caucus meeting with Pickens on Tuesday evening to discuss his plan .
Tumor - stricken Novak retires from column gig RAW STORY
Published : Monday August 4 , 2008
Print This Email This Conservative political columnist Robert Novak , who was diagnosed last month with a " dire " brain tumor , has retired from his position with the Chicago Sun Times , the paper reports .
" The details are being worked out with the doctors this week , but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy , " Novak said .
The Evans - Novak column was first distributed by Publishers Newspaper Syndicate on May 15 , 1963 , with the New York Herald - Tribune , the flagship newspaper .
When the Herald - Tribune folded in 1966 , the Chicago Sun-Times became their home newspaper .
After revealing his brain tumor diagnosis last week , Novak initially said he hoped to be able to return to work soon .
Monday 's decision to end his run as one of Washington 's most well known conservatives indicates the cancer may be worse than he originally thought .
 I will be suspending my journalistic work for an indefinite but , God willing , not too lengthy period , " Novak said in a statement released July 28 .
After more than four decades in Washington , Novak built a Rolodex of sources throughout the conservative political establishment , with more than a few Democrats delivering information to the journalist , as well .
In recent years , Novak has become best known for his role in the leak of former CIA agent Valerie Plame 's identity .
Novak fingered former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage , who the columnist described as not having a political ax to grind , as the primary source for his July 14 , 2003 , column that first publicly identified Plame , who was the wife of administration critic Joseph Wilson , a former ambassador .
An investigation into who leaked Plame 's name later resulted in Lewis " Scooter " Libby , a former top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney , being convicted of lying and obstructing the probe .
The trial revealed that Libby had leaked Plame 's name to New York Times reporter Judith Miller .
Last week Novak hit a pedestrian on a Washington street with his car but did not stop immediately and later said he was unaware he had hit the man .

LOS ANGELES , July 27 ( UPI ) -- U.S. broadcast networks had more negative coverage of Barack Obama than John McCain during the first weeks of the general election campaign , a study indicated .
The Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University in Virginia , which has studied network news since the 1980s , analyzed content on ABC , CBS and NBC news shows and found that when reporters and anchors expressed opinions they were significantly more negative toward Obama and more positive toward McCain , the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday .

The researchers found that most statements by anchors and reporters were neutral , but when opinions were expressed 28 percent of statements about Obama were positive while 72 percent were negative .
The study indicated opinions about McCain were 43 percent positive and 57 percent negative .
Robert Lichter , the director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs , has been a preferred source of data among conservatives , the Times said .
" This information should blow away this silly assumption that more coverage is always better coverage , " he told the newspaper .
The study is based on an analysis of content beginning June 8 , the day after New York Sen .
Hillary Clinton conceded the race for the Democratic nomination to Obama , and ending June 21 , as Obama embarked on a trip to the Middle East , Afghanistan and several European capitals .
Defence files have revealed the United States military was planning to test deadly nerve gas on Australian troops in a far north Queensland rainforest in the 1960s .
Australian Defence Department files obtained by Channel Nine show the US was planning to test Sarin and VX nerve gas on up to 200 Australian combat troops by aerial bombing areas around Lockhart River .
The plan never went ahead , but American survey teams inspected the proposed testing site .
The prime minister at the time , Harold Holt , vetoed the plan .
His former staffer , Peter Bailey , says the Australian government was concerned that its Cold War alliance with the US would be damaged if it did not acquiesce .
" If they were n't pretty good and pretty faithful to the Americans we would be dumped , so I think ministers were very aware that this was probably our one main support , " he said .
Former Democrats Senator Lyn Allison has told Channel Nine the current Government should make the documents public .
" There 's apparently a whole unit which the minister says did n't conduct testing but I think we need to know what they were doing and it is time for these documents to be released , " she said .
" Let us have a look at what was being contemplated just 40 odd years ago - it's not the deepest , darkest history of Australia we 're talking about . "
Two of the country ’s biggest financial firms agreed Thursday to buy back $ 17 billion in troubled fixed - income securities , ratcheting up pressure on the rest of the industry to bail out clients stuck with the investments .
Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co. promised to repurchase so - called auction - rate securities at face value from individual investors -- as well as charities and small businesses -- who have been unable to sell them at full price since the market for them seized up in February .
The repurchases will help 70,000 customers -- 40,000 at Citigroup holding $ 7 billion in securities and 30,000 at Merrill with $ 10 billion .
Citigroup estimates that the securities it is repurchasing have a current market value of $ 6.5 billion .
Merrill did not provide an estimate .

The deals intensify the legal and public relations pressure on dozens of other banks to cut deals with their clients , experts said .
“ This was the necessary domino falling for all the other dominoes to fall , ” Andrew Stoltmann , an investors ’ attorney in Chicago , said of Citigroup ’s action .
“ It provides cover to the other firms to be able to say to their boards of directors , ‘ Gee , look what Citigroup did .
Let ’s follow that .’ ”
Citigroup agreed to its buy - back as part of a settlement with New York Atty .
Gen. Andrew Cuomo and the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The company also will pay a $ 100 - million fine .
Merrill announced its buy - back plan several hours after the Citigroup settlement was unveiled .

Neither company is buying auction - rate securities held by institutional investors , but Citigroup pledged to help 2,600 institutional clients unload $ 12 billion of the investments .
The Citigroup deal ended a probe by regulators into whether the company downplayed the riskiness of the securities to customers .
Merrill also has been under investigation by Cuomo .
The two firms ’ buyback plans differ in their timing .
Citigroup said it would finish its repurchases by Nov. 5 .
Merrill said it would conduct its program over the course of a year starting Jan. 15 .

Investors such as Melinda Bittan can only hope that other banks follow suit .
The freelance public relations specialist in Los Angeles had half her life savings invested in auction - rate securities at Wells Fargo & Co. when the market capsized in mid-February .
“ I was thrilled when I heard about ” the buyback , Bittan said .
“ It gives you hope that it sends a message to other firms that they [ should ] do something before an attorney general comes after them . ”
Banks attracted thousands of individual investors to auction - rate securities in recent years by pitching them as safe and easily redeemable but higher - yielding than money market funds .
More than $ 300 billion of auction - rate securities -- long - term debt instruments that , in effect , were marketed as short - term debt -- were issued in recent years .

Investors were told they could unload the securities at face value at regular auctions held as frequently as once a week .
The interest rates would be reset at each auction based on how much buyers were willing to pay .
But the reset auctions ground to a halt in February as the credit crunch worsened and demand dried up for complex securities of any sort .
Although issuers have redeemed some auction - rate securities , investors still hold more than $ 200 billion of them , said Barry Silbert , chief executive of Restricted Stock Partners in New York .
Citigroup and Merrill said they had been trying to help customers unload their auction - rate securities .
“ Our most important focus continues to be on helping our clients , ” Citigroup said in a statement .

“ Our clients have been caught in an unprecedented liquidity crisis , ” Merrill Chief Executive John Thain said in a statement .
“ We are solving it by giving them the option of selling their positions to us . ”
Also Thursday , Morgan Stanley agreed to repurchase $ 1.5 million in auction - rate securities from two municipalities in Massachusetts , and Bank of America Corp. disclosed that it had received subpoenas and requests for information from state and federal regulators regarding its sale of auction - rate securities .

Today , August 14 , Dmitri Medvedev celebrates 100th day as President of the Russian Federation .
What conclusions can be made about the new president ?
Well , not many .
Other than the fact that Medvedev is trying really , really hard to be the best protege he can be .
Sure , he ’s a little shorter , a little meeker and much less manlier than his mentor , but that does n’t mean he is n’t trying his best .
And as one Russian newspaper points out , he ’s not doing too bad of a job , either .
See how he ’s holding up to Putin ’s patented muzhik ruling style :
Exhibit A : Medvedev doing the Putin swagger
Exhibit B : Medvedev still mastering the Putin talking - point finger
Exhibit C : Medvedev ’s near perfect imitation of the bored Putin slouch and hand fidget
Exhibit D : Medvedev ’s still got a ways to go until he masters the Putin man grip
Exhibit E : Medvedev ’ got the casual Putin shades look down pat , albiet in brighter , more liberal tones

Barack Obama continued his theme of energy week in Youngstown , OH today where he criticized John McCain ’s energy plan , and labeled the Republican the candidate of the oil companies .
“ And unfortunately , in this election , Senator McCain has proposed an energy plan that ’s nothing but four years more of the same .
He ’s offering a plan with no significant investments in alternative energy .
He ’s offering a gas tax holiday that will pad oil company profits and save you – at best – half a tank of gas over the course of an entire summer .
And he ’s offering $ 4 billion more in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies in America – including $ 1.2 billion to Exxon - Mobil , a company that just recorded the largest profit in the history of the United States .
A company that , last quarter , made the same amount of money in 30 seconds that a typical Ohio worker makes in a year , ” Obama said .
Obama repeated his attack that McCain ’s plan wo n’t help anyone now , “ Instead of offering a real plan to lower gas prices , the only energy proposal he ’s really promoting is more offshore drilling .
This plan wo n’t lower prices today .
It wo n’t lower prices during the next Administration .
The truth is , we would n’t see a drop of oil from this drilling for at least seven years .
And while Senator McCain ’s plan wo n’t save you at the pump anytime soon , it sure has done a lot to raise campaign dollars .
Senator McCain raised more than one million dollars from the oil industry just last month , most of which came after he announced his plan for offshore drilling to a room full of cheering oil executives . ”

He said that the oil companies have placed their bets on McCain , “ So to sum up , under Senator McCain ’s plan , the oil companies get billions more , we do n’t pay any less at the pump , and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis .
The oil companies have placed their bet on Senator McCain , and if he wins , they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy …
Because after one president in the pocket of the oil companies – we ca n’t afford another .
For the sake of our economy , our security , and the future of our planet , we must end the age of oil in our time . ”
I think labeling McCain as a puppet of the oil companies is a smart strategy .
The numbers do n’t lie .
Obama has gotten over $ 300,000 from the oil companies and McCain over a million .
It is n’t a coincidence that after McCain changed his position on offshore drilling ; he raised a million dollars from the oil companies .
Big Oil has owned the GOP for decades .
It is the Republicans who have been blocking alternative energy bills for decades .
It is the Republicans who rewrote the terms of the federal drilling leases so the oil companies paid less .
It was the Republicans who passed billions of dollars in tax breaks for big oil .
John McCain put out a new ad today that touts his independence , but when it comes to Big Oil , he has been in lockstep with the GOP .
What kind of independent votes with his party 95 % of the time anyway ?
Everyone knows that the maverick McCain is dead .
He has been replaced with a neo -con McClone .
Obama best line of attack is to keep pointing out that a vote for McCain is a vote for more pain at the pump .
If McCain is elected the oil companies will continue to reign supreme .
I think this is a powerful message to send to voters .
“ They have got some of the information already from their lawyers and investigators and they are waiting to hear from them what is legitimate , what is promising and what is not .
Furry Giants The Trials and Triumphs of a Monster Bunny Breeder
The man who breeds the worlds biggest bunnies has gotten over the drama of last year when , he claims , North Koreas leaders ate the prize rabbits he sold them to set up breeding farms .
Karl Szmolinsky shares his latest adventures and the tricks of a trade whose days seem sadly numbered .
I ’ve decided to share my opinion on the recent New Yorker cover controversy .
While it may be true that none of you know / care who I am , I like to think of myself as an amateur satirist , and thus my opinion on this matter should be regarded highly and maybe even taught in schools .
Now , I struggled with what to think about the illustration .
Part of me disagreed with the negative reaction because satire is an important part of a healthy democracy .
It ’s pretty easy to just make jokes poking fun at something , much like what Jon Stewart does on The Daily Show , but I think it ’s much more difficult and valuable to make satirical jokes which cause the listener or reader to think “ Are they being serious ? ” much like what Stephen Colbert does on The Colbert Report .
The latter exercise forces the recipient to examine the context of the joke and actually think about the issues surrounding it .
Having said that , satire is not easy , and it often falls flat on its face .
I do n’t know a clear and easily applicable rule for what makes satire succeed or fail , but it seems to me that the success often depends on how far removed the joke is from the reality it is professing to imitate .
I know that sounds like an oxymoron , but there ’s a subtle difference between satirizing a thing versus simply depicting or duplicating it .
I often feel that there is a certain threshold of silliness beyond which something becomes satirical .
After all , the goal of satire is to make people think about how silly and ridiculous something is .
I do n’t mean to keep harping on The Colbert Report , but it ’s probably the best example of successful satire in popular culture today : when Colbert introduces a guest and then jumps up and proceeds to bask in the applause which is not intended for him , or when Colbert , citing his inability to recognize skin color due to his transcendence of racial sensitivities , asks an African American guest if he / she is in fact black , it ’s silly enough that anyone with half a brain cell will understand that he ’s joking .
Let me give you some real life examples of satire crossing and / or falling short of what I am now referring to as Dr. Phil Medley ’s Silliness Threshold ( copyright pending ) :
If a good friend of mine who is black is telling me a story and ends it with the phrase “ God , I hate white people , ” that ’s silly enough for me to find it hilarious .
On the other hand , if I turn to a stranger on the metro and say , “ God , I hate black people , ” that may seem silly to me , but not to the very angry gentleman sitting next to me who has no idea who I am or what Klan chapter I belong to .
I had to learn that lesson the hard way .
This is why I think The New Yorker blew it — they did n’t cross the silliness threshold .
Obviously , the joke they ’re trying to make is that a lot of people incorrectly hold the opinion that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama are scary , anti-American , Black Panther Muslims .
It does n’t work , just like my hypothetical joke on the metro .
Some of you may have seen recently that an American company was selling Obama “ sock monkey ” dolls .
Maybe the people who run that enterprise and the people who bought their shit are not racist at all and are satirizing the racist depiction of African Americans as monkeys , but without such insight , the way it appears to any normal person is that this company and its customers are purely racist .
When it really boils down to it , The New Yorker cover requires that you know for a fact that the Obamas are not scary , anti-American , Black Panther Muslims , and unfortunately many people are still on the fence about that and could be pushed to believe it by a depiction such as this one .
Of course , we could talk about whether or not these people are retarded , but that ’s for another article .
In search of the American ' center '
In the asylum that is American politics , beware a candidate like Barack Obama when he is lauded for moving to " the center " - because usually that means he is drifting away from it .
Over the last month , the Democratic presidential nominee has backed a measure to permit warrantless wiretapping and protect telecom companies when they violate customers ' privacy ; sent conflicting signals about whether he will reform the NAFTA trade model ; and threatened to revise his timetable for ending the war in Iraq .
Universally , reporters have billed this dance as a move to the middle .
As the Associated Press claimed in a typical description , Obama 's shifts are designed " to appeal to the center of the electorate . "
However , empirical data prove " the center of the electorate " is exactly the opposite :
-- Polls by Quinnipiac University and the Mellman Group found majorities support warrant requirements for wiretaps and oppose immunity for companies that released private consumer information without such warrants .
-- Surveys by Fortune magazine , CNN and the Wall Street Journal report that most Americans oppose NAFTA - style trade policies .
-- For years , major polls have consistently shown Americans want a firm timetable for withdrawal from Iraq .
As just one of many examples , five separate USA Today surveys since 2007 have shown majorities want the president to " set a timetable for removing troops from Iraq and to stick to that timetable regardless of what is going on in Iraq . "
So , the undebatable evidence tells us precisely where the center of public opinion is .
Yet when a presidential candidate moves away from the center , we are told he is moving toward it .
What gives ?
Part of the up - is - down distortion reflects perspective - or lack thereof .
Most politicians and journalists who set the parameters of our political debate live in Washington and make six - figure salaries .
They are geographically , financially and socially isolated from the blood - and - guts consequences of today 's two wars - the one in Iraq and the one on the middle class .
That insulation skews viewpoints .
Indeed , the center of opinion in the nation 's capital is very different from the center of opinion in the country at large .
In elite D.C. , a moderate is one who backs job - killing trade deals , legal immunity for corporate wrongdoers , and wars for oil , regardless of casualties .
And so when Obama embraces those positions , Beltway opinion - makers really think he 's being a " centrist " - regardless of how far away from the actual center he 's moving .
But , then , not all politicians and pundits are completely ignorant of life outside the palace walls .
A calculated Jedi mind trick is at work here , too .
When regular folks talk to friends and neighbors , we sure feel like our desire for privacy , disgust with NAFTA and opposition to the Iraq war are mainstream majority positions - and they are .
But then comes the barrage .
Day after day , smiling anchormen , blow - dried correspondents and silver - tongued congressmen follow the Big Lie theory of indoctrination , taking to our televisions , radios and newspapers insisting that crazy is normal , the majority is the minority and - most importantly - the fringe is the " center . "
This is no accident .
These voices of the status quo do not want the status quo challenged .
They deliberately broadcast messages crafted to get us - the mainstream - to question our mainstream - ness , while convincing politicians that the Establishment 's extremism represents a responsible middle ground .
More Aldous Huxley than George Orwell , these are the methods of modern propaganda , with the celebration of Obama 's " centrism " the latest doublespeak .
In this brave new world , language is sculpted to skew the " center , " intimidating the majority from demanding concrete change for fear of looking like lunatics .
It is a slickly packaged process of marginalization and demoralization - one with an underlying goal : keeping the real lunatics running the asylum .
In pictures : Kate Bush at 50 The career of singer - songwriter Kate Bush , who celebrates her 50th birthday today , has spanned more than 30 years .
The star , whose hits include Wuthering Heights and Running Up That Hill , has been famously enigmatic in recent years .
Her most recent album was released in 2005 after a hiatus of more than a decade .
Two musicians who have worked with the singer reveal their impressions of Kate Bush both inside and outside of the studio .
ROY HARPER
Folk - rock musician Roy Harper released his first album in 1966 and had a song recorded in his honour by Led Zeppelin .
Kate Bush duetted with him on his 1980 song
You and he sang backing vocals on her hit Breathing in the same year .
A decade later Bush contributed to Harper 's album Once .
Kate is a fantastic musician and very professional as well .
Working with Kate is a very smooth operation because she always knows what she wants to do , surprising you too , which is what good musicians always do .
Roy Harper praises Kate Bush 's generosity
She is a perfectionist with her art , but is n't like that with all aspects of her life .
She is a wonderful person and it would be impossible to speak highly enough of her .
She is the kindest woman I 've ever met and if she 's a friend of yours , she is for life .
I would go round there and we used to talk all night and exchange ideas .
On a social level she is very graceful and has given me some beautiful presents including a wonderful kaleidoscope one year which is an absolute treasure .
Her songs are brilliant , simple deepnesses and a fantastic degree of musicianship goes into them .
There is nobody quite like her .
I think she should eventually be honoured by her country because she is an outstanding contributor to the cultural life of her generation .
COLIN LLOYD TUCKER Musician Colin Lloyd
Tucker produced his first album at the age of 17 , playing all the instruments himself , when he first met the Bush family .
After recording with Kate Bush 's musician brother Paddy , he was invited to perform backing vocals on her 1993 album The Red Shoes .
He also played a devil in The Line , The Cross and The Curve , a film produced and directed by Bush which accompanied the record .
The singer begins by explaining how he came to work with Kate Bush .
Colin Lloyd Tucker ( l ) has recorded with Kate Bush 's brother Paddy ( r ) Kate was living next door to Paddy at the time and would come by at night to listen to what we 'd been doing .
She heard us singing together and said it would sound great on a track she was working on .
She directed us through the whole thing and is easy to work with because she knew what she wanted and spent a long time getting it right .
But it was n't painful and she was very patient at communicating what she wanted .
It was quite exhausting but we were very well looked after - she makes a lovely ham salad sandwich !
But she 's also intuitive and if a mistake is made that she really likes , she 'll keep it .
Music is her whole life and when she 's making it she 's extremely professional and courteous .
But when she 's off duty she 's an extremely relaxed person and has you creased up in hysterics .
She 's a really normal person and happy in her domestic life and the people she has around her are nice to be around .
She 's easy - going and not at all aloof which is a common misconception .
Kate is a musician through and through and she 's never going to stop writing .
I would n't be surprised if there 'll be a flurry of activity when her son gets a bit older .

He was 17 when he came to New York from Hong Kong in 1992 with his parents and younger sister , eyeing the skyline like any newcomer .
Fifteen years later , Hiu Lui Ng was a New Yorker : a computer engineer with a job in the Empire State Building , a house in Queens , a wife who is a United States citizen and two American - born sons .
But when Mr. Ng , who had overstayed a visa years earlier , went to immigration headquarters in Manhattan last summer for his final interview for a green card , he was swept into immigration detention and shuttled through jails and detention centers in three New England states .
In April , Mr. Ng began complaining of excruciating back pain .
By mid-July , he could no longer walk or stand .
And last Wednesday , two days after his 34th birthday , he died in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a Rhode Island hospital , his spine fractured and his body riddled with cancer that had gone undiagnosed and untreated for months .
On Tuesday , with an autopsy by the Rhode Island medical examiner under way , his lawyers demanded a criminal investigation in a letter to federal and state prosecutors in Rhode Island , Connecticut , Massachusetts and Vermont , and the Department of Homeland Security , which runs the detention system .
ATHENS ( Reuters ) - A 31 - year - old Greek beheaded his girlfriend and carried her head round the popular tourist island of Santorini before he was arrested , police said on Sunday .
The man , who police said had psychological problems , injured a police officer and two women while trying to escape arrest after killing the 25 - year - old teacher in Greece ’s most picturesque island .
“ He was walking around , carrying her head and telling the astonished villagers not to stop him , ” a police official told Reuters .
“ They knew he had psychological problems ... but they did n’t expect he would reach this point . ”
The man knifed a policeman who tried to arrest him , stole a police car and crashed into a motorcycle injuring two women , before police ended his escape by ramming the car .
Tourism Minister Aris Spiliotopoulos vowed earlier this week to make Greek resorts safer after a spate of violent incidents at the peak of the tourist season .
MADRID ( Reuters ) - Spain ’s Industry Minister Miguel Sebastian buoyed hopes in the country ’s solar power industry on Monday just days after announcing a dramatic cut in subsidies .

Madrid last week announced plans to cut by almost 90 percent its subsidies for solar photovoltaic ( PV ) power after a stampede for support left Madrid with a multi-billion euro liability .
But the cuts will not apply to solar thermal , a technology that concentrates the sun ’s light to produce heat and steam which in turn drives turbines , rather than producing electricity directly in silicon PV panels .
“ It is Spanish companies which are exporting technology to generate this ( solar thermal ) energy , including to the United States , ” said Industry Minister Miguel Sebastian .
Sebastian was speaking as work started on Monday on a new 50 megawatt plant in the southern town of Ciudad Real , slated to come on line in 2010 and which could power around 30,000 homes .
The Cobra unit of Spanish construction company ACS will build the plant .
“ This makes us the standard for clean technology with a great future , ” he said , suggesting the government was committed to this form of solar power .
Sebastian ’s comments buoyed hopes among investors , some of whom expect Madrid to cut support for solar thermal from 2010 .
Shares in Solaria , a Spanish company which makes both solar thermal panels and PV panels , rose more than 25 percent directly as a result of Sebastian ’s comments , traders said .
Solar thermal , also known as concentrated solar power ( CSP ) , has been slower to take off than other , smaller scale alternative energy technologies such as wind and solar PV , because it requires more up - front investment .
But it may be the next big thing as coal and oil prices rise and because of new subsidy support in hot , sunny countries like Spain , where it works best .
Germany ’s Solar Millennium helped develop Spain ’s Andasol 1 solar thermal project , Europe ’s first such plant , which is due to start power production in October .
U.S. MARKET
“ The feed - in tariff ( subsidy ) in Spain gives a lot of confidence to banks , ” Henner Gladen , Solar Millennium chief technology officer , told Reuters .
“ The next big market will be the United States , once we see the investment tax credit in law , which we expect either end this year or next year , ” he added , expecting 200 MW or 400 MW units there which would rival the capacity of conventional gas and coal plants .
Other expected markets where subsidies are planned or in operation include Australia , Italy and Greece .
Spain ’s planned solar PV cut , announced last week , will grant subsidies annually to 100 MW large installations , compared with expected installations this year of at least 1,000 MW .
The cap will also allow for 200 MW of smaller , roof - mounted units .

The battle to protect Americans from warrantless wiretaps and hold telecommunications companies accountable is all but lost , Sen . Russ Feingold , a leading critic of President Bush ’s likely illegal surveillance programs , said Monday .
The “ farce ” of a surveillance law deal heralded by House Democratic leaders last week could permanently hide evidence of an “ impeachable offense ” on the part of President Bush , the Wisconsin Democrat said .
Feingold spoke at the New America Foundation in Washington about the nation ’s intelligence needs .
He panned an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that quickly passed in the House last week .
The Senate is expected to follow suit this year , officially putting the Democratic - controlled Congress ’s seal of approval on an administration backed gambit to essentially legalize Bush ’s warrantless surveillance program while at the same time letting off the hook phone companies that critics say facilitated the contravention of current law .
“ I do think this is a total farce with regard to the immunity [ for telecommunications companies ] .
It basically guarantees the immunity , ”  Feingold said .
“ It does n’t simply have the impact of potentially allowing telephone companies to break the law .
It may prevent us from ever getting to the core issue “ ¦ which is the president ran an illegal program that could ’ve been an impeachable offense . ” 

This is a political parable for the ages : the guy who was behind one of the knockout punches to John Kerry four years ago is now doing Democrats the biggest favor of the election by calling Republicans on their phony energy campaign .
“ Totally misleading ” is the way Pickens describes Republican attempts to convince the public that if we just opened up all these forbidden areas to oil drilling then gas prices would fall .
He ’s not against new drilling , but he is honest enough to say it would n’t do anything .

( NewsTarget ) Resveratrol , a compound present in grapes and red wine , reduces the number of fat cells and may one day be used to treat or prevent obesity , according to a new study .
The results will be presented at The Endocrine Society 's 90th Annual Meeting in San Francisco .
Past research found that resveratrol protected laboratory mice that were fed a high - calorie diet from the health problems of obesity , by mimicking the effects of calorie restriction .
Researchers at the University of Ulm in Germany wanted to know if resveratrol could mimic the effects of calorie restriction in human fat cells by changing their size or function .
The German team used a strain of human fat cell precursors , called preadipocytes .
In the body , these cells develop into mature fat cells , according to the study 's lead author , Pamela Fischer - Posovszky , PhD , a pediatric endocrinology research fellow in the university 's Diabetes and Obesity Unit .
In the cell - based study , they found that resveratrol inhibited the pre-fat cells from increasing and prevented them from converting into mature fat cells .
Also , resveratrol hindered fat storage .
Most interesting , according to Fischer - Posovszky , was that resveratrol reduced production of certain cytokines ( interleukins 6 and 8 ) , substances that may be linked to the development of obesity - related disorders , such as diabetes and clogged coronary arteries .
Also , resveratrol stimulated formation of a protein known to decrease the risk of heart attack .
Obesity decreases this substance , called adiponectin .
The new finding is consistent with the theory that the resveratrol in red wine explains the French paradox , the observation that French people eat a relatively high - fat diet but have a low death rate from heart disease .
" Resveratrol has anti-obesity properties by exerting its effects directly on the fat cells , " Fischer - Posovszky said .
" Thus , resveratrol might help to prevent development of obesity or might be suited to treating obesity . " Fischer - Posovszky cautioned that , while the health benefits of resveratrol seem promising , there is not sufficient knowledge about the effects of long - term treatment .
One small study found that a single dose of up to 5 grams of resveratrol ( much higher than the amount in a bottle of red wine ) caused no serious ill effects in healthy volunteers , she pointed out .
However , she said another study theorized that resveratrol may stimulate the growth of human breast cancer cells , possibly because resveratrol 's chemical structure is similar to a phytoestrogen , an estrogen - like substance found in some plants .
This study was partly funded by the German Research Association ( Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft ) and the Ministry of Science , Research and Arts ( Ministerium fuer Wissenschaft , Forschung und Kunst ) , Baden - Wuerttemberg .

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexican archeologists have discovered a maze of stone temples in underground caves , some submerged in water and containing human bones , which ancient Mayans believed was a portal where dead souls entered the underworld .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Clad in scuba gear and edging through narrow tunnels , researchers discovered the stone ruins of eleven sacred temples and what could be the remains of human sacrifices at the site in the Yucatan Peninsula .
Archeologists say Mayans believed the underground complex of water - filled caves leading into dry chambers -- including an underground road stretching some 330 feet -- was the path to a mythical underworld , known as Xibalba .
According to an ancient Mayan scripture , the Popol Vuh , the route was filled with obstacles , including rivers filled with scorpions , blood and pus and houses shrouded in darkness or swarming with shrieking bats , Guillermo de Anda , one of the lead investigators at the site , said on Thursday .
The souls of the dead followed a mythical dog who could see at night , de Anda said .
Excavations over the past five months in the Yucatan caves revealed stone carvings and pottery left for the dead .
“ They believed that this place was the entrance to Xibalba .
That is why we have found the offerings there , ” de Anda said .
The Mayans built soaring pyramids and elaborate palaces in Central America and southern Mexico before mysteriously abandoning their cities around 900 A.D .
They described the torturous journey to Xibalba in the Popul Vuh sacred text , originally written in hieroglyphic script on long scrolls and later transcribed by Spanish conquerors .
“ It is very likely this area was protected as a sacred depository for the dead or for the passage of their souls , ” said de Anda , whose team has found ceramic offerings along with bones in some temples .
Different Mayan groups who inhabited southern Mexico and northern Guatemala and Belize had their own entrances to the underworld which archeologists have discovered at other sites , almost always in cave systems buried deep in the jungle .
In the Yucatan site they have found one 1,900 - year - old ceramic vase , but most of the artifacts date back to between 700 and 850 A.D .
“ These sacred tunnels and caves were natural temples and annexes to temples on the surface , ” said de Anda .
A new report by Australia 's top scientists predicts that the country will be hit by a 10 - fold increase in heatwaves and that droughts will almost double in frequency and become more widespread because of climate change .
The scientific projections envisage rainfall continuing to decline in a country that is already one of the hottest and driest in the world .
It says that about 50 % of the decrease in rainfall in south - western Australia since the 1950s has probably been due to greenhouse gases .
Yesterday , Australia 's agriculture minister , Tony Burke , described the report as alarming and said : " Parts of these high - level projections read more like a disaster novel than a scientific report . "
The analysis , commissioned by the government as part of a review of public funding to drought - stricken farmers , was published days after another report , by Professor Ross Garnaut , warned that Australia had to adopt a scheme for trading greenhouse gas emissions by 2010 or face the eventual destruction of sites including the Great Barrier Reef , the wetlands of Kakadu and the nation 's food bowl , the Murray - Darling Basin .
The prime minister , Kevin Rudd , who swept to victory on a green agenda last November , said the analysis by the Bureau of Meteorology and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation was " very disturbing " .
The reports will put pressure on him to act swiftly on his pledge for Australia to lead the world in tackling polluters .
However , the rising cost of living has dented his government 's popularity and his plans for a carbon trading scheme have begun to unnerve voters and industry .
Rudd has acknowledged that tough debate lies ahead and has said the government will map out its policy options this month .
Yesterday 's report revealed that not only would droughts occur more often but that the area affected would be twice as large as now .
The proportion of the country having exceptionally hot years could increase from 5 % each year to as much as 95 % , according to the projections .
The report says rainfall in Australia has been declining since the 1950s and about half of that decrease is due to climate change .
It says the current thresholds for farmers to claim financial assistance are out of date because hotter and drier weather will become the norm .
Burke said it was clear that the cycle of drought was going to be " more regular and deeper than ever before " .
He added : " If we failed to review drought policy , if we were to continue the neglect and pretend that the climate was n't changing , we would be leaving our farms out to dry . "
Parts of Australia are now in a sixth year of drought , and the report coincided with an announcement that there has been a worsening of the drought in New South Wales .
Some 65 % of the state is affected , an increase of more than 2.3 % on last month , although opinion is divided on whether it can be attributed to climate change .
A plague of locusts is also threatening crops in the state , with farmers on 900 farms reporting finding locust eggs .
The government plans to fight the infestation with aerial spraying before the eggs hatch .
I did n’t realize that Big Oil and Wall Street freeloaders could make up 24 % , but I guess you learn something new every day ..
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp .
Poll showed that 24 percent have a positive outlook for the country , while 76 percent say things are on the wrong track .
It is the lowest number on record since 1980 and the third time in four decades that the number has dropped so low .
Recent CNN / Opinion Research Corp. polling has shown a steady drop in the country ’s mood .
In April 2007 , 51 percent said things in the country were going badly .
A year later , 70 percent reiterated that position .
The poll questioned 1,041 adult Americans by telephone July 27 - 29 , 2008 .
The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points .
“ Only three events — Watergate , the Iran hostage crisis , and the economic downturn of 1992 — have driven below 30 percent the number who think things are going well , ” CNN ’s polling director Keating Holland said .
The mood of the country has been assessed since 1974 .
Only four presidents — Richard Nixon , Gerald Ford , Jimmy Carter , and the elder George Bush — have seen that number drop below 30 percent during their time in office ; their parties all lost the White House in the next presidential election .

According to the rules of the US House of Representatives , any state legislature can present a resolution to impeach the president .
Deborah Gordan and Stan Lofalia of MaineImpeach.org hope Maine will be the first state to do so , though similar efforts are under way in several other states .
The group of artists and activists has collected 3600 signatures on a petition to US representatives Michael Michaud and Tom Allen , as well as to state lawmakers , hoping to push any or all of them toward seeking impeachment .
Organizers say they want to collect 10,000 signatures before formally submitting them to Michaud , Allen , and others .
The MaineImpeach.org
Web site lists ten reasons for impeachment : launching a war without a cause ; authorizing the use of torture ; detaining Americans and non-Americans without due process or cause ; violating the Geneva Conventions ; using illegal wiretaps against American citizens ; the use of “ signing statements ”  to defy Congress ; obstructing honest elections in 2000 , 2002 , 2004 , and 2006 ; using disinformation and paid propaganda to deceive the public ; abusing presidential powers ; and negligence in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Supreme Court on Monday upheld a law aimed at preventing child pornography , ruling a provision dealing with " pandering " illicit material does not violate constitutional protections on free speech .
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority , calling Internet child porn a " threat . "
The 7 - 2 ruling rejected suggestions the law is overly broad , and will stifle a range of expressive or artistic material that is not obscene .
The case involves Michael Williams , convicted in a Florida federal court for promoting child pornography on the Internet .
A 2003 federal law made it a crime not only to produce and possess child porn , but also to " pander " material , conveying the belief that material contains minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct .
The pandering provision covers anyone who " advertises , promotes , presents , distributes , or solicits " this material .
Justice Antonin Scalia , writing for the majority , said Congress ' latest attempt to deal with this " threat " was legally " successful . "
The " Protect " Act was Congress ' latest attempt to control graphic images on the Internet .
Previous efforts were struck down by the high court on First Amendment issues .
As part of a 2004 sting operation , an undercover Secret Service agent ( using the screen name " Lisa - - n -- Miami " ) communicated with Williams in an Internet chat room .
Williams allegedly wrote , " Dad of toddler has ' good ' pics of her an ( sic ) me for swap of your toddler pics , or live cam . "
He posted nonpornographic photos of a young girl and claimed he had " hc , " or hard - core , kiddie pictures , prosecutors contend .
The man then allegedly posted photos of youngsters involved in " sexually explicit conduct , " according to court records .
Twenty - two other child porn images were found on his home computer .
A federal appeals court upheld a possession conviction against Williams , but threw out the separate soliciting charge , which carried a five - year mandatory minimum sentence .
A three - judge panel concluded the provision was " substantially overbroad and vague , " and that " non-commercial , non-inciteful promotion of illegal child pornography , even if repugnant , is protected free speech . "
In other words , the judges said merely talking about child porn is not necessarily criminal .
Scalia said judges had proper discretion to decide when anti-pornography laws should be properly applied , but he noted that such illicit material has increased in recent years .
" Child pornography harms and debases the most defenseless of our citizens , " he said .
" This court held unconstitutional Congress ' previous attempt to meet this new threat , and Congress responded with a carefully crafted attempt to eliminate the First Amendment problems we [ earlier ] identified . "
The Bush administration urged the high court to accept the case , saying the overall impact of the law was being held " hostage to a few hypothetical scenarios . "
Solicitor General Paul Clement argued to the justices that not only is promoting real child porn against the law , but " speech that falsely proposes an unlawful transaction is likewise unprotected . "
Clement announced last week that he is stepping down from his post next month .
But during oral arguments , six justices offered specific examples they said might unfairly target someone who was engaged in lawful , artistic or editorial free speech .
Among them were mainstream movies such as " Lolita , " " Traffic , " and " Titanic , " all of which depicted scenarios in which underage girls were engaging in simulated sex .
Justices David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented .
Souter wrote that a double standard exists since those pandering images not involving minors engaging in simulated sex could now be prosecuted , but possession of those images would not be subject to prosecution .
" I believe that maintaining the First Amendment protection of expression we have previously held to cover fake child pornography requires a limit to the law 's criminalization of pandering proposals , " Souter said .
The justices five years ago struck down a 1996 federal law dealing with child porn , giving legal protection to youthful sexual images that were nether obscene nor involved sexual abuse .
In its ruling , the high court said thinking dirty thoughts is not necessarily criminal , and the government cannot " suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech . "
Most of the 2003 Protect Act 's provision have survived judicial scrutiny .
A coalition of free speech and commercial interests were supporting Williams ' constitutional claims , including the Free Speech Coalition and National Coalition Against Censorship .
On the other side , 27 states backed the United States , as well as a range of child advocacy groups .
Also on Monday , the justices :
• Reinstated the full conviction of a terrorist implicated in the failed " millennium " bomb plot in an 8 - 1 ruling .
A jury had found Ahmed Ressam guilty of various conspiracy charges in the plan to detonate explosives at Los Angeles International Airport in the days before New Year 's Day 2000 .
A federal appeals court had overturned some of the convictions , and the Justice Department successfully appealed to the Supreme Court .
Opinion
• Refused to intervene in the pending deportation of a former Nazi prison camp guard , upholding a lower court ruling that authorized a 2004 removal order for John Demjanjuk , 87 , to either his native Ukraine or to another country , possibly Poland or Germany .
He was once accused by the U.S. and Israel of being the notoriously brutal S.S. guard known as " Ivan the Terrible . "

Palace officials said the cost of royal travel would vary from year to year The Queen and the Royal Family have cost the taxpayer £ 40 m during the last financial year - up £ 2 m on the previous 12 months , official accounts show .
The total is equivalent to 66 p per person in the UK - an increase of 4 p .
The cost of official royal travel and the Queen 's Civil List - funds for her work as head of state - also increased .
Officials said the money was spent on more official overseas trips and palace maintenance .
Republicans have called for royal spending to be overhauled .
Buckingham Palace accounts reveal the Treasury contributed the equivalent of 66 p per person in the country to help maintain the monarchy - up by 5 % on the previous year .
American visit
The amount spent on royal travel rose by £ 600,000 to £ 6.2 m during the 2007 - 08 financial year and the Queen 's Civil List increased by £ 500,000 to £ 12.7 m .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The most expensive official overseas engagement was the Queen 's state visit to America in May last year to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the Jamestown settlement .
A plane was chartered at a cost of £ 381,813 .
Buckingham Palace officials described the cost of the Royal Family to taxpayers as less than the price of two pints of milk or an MP3 player download .
Sir Alan Reid , Keeper of the Privy Purse , pointed out that the annual cost of the monarchy was lower in real terms than in 2001 and that the royals had responded to demands from government to carry out more visits abroad .
" Expenditure on royal travel , which will vary from year to year , also increased in response to the number of overseas visits undertaken at the request of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and UK Trade and Investment , " he said .
He said a grant from the Department for Culture , Media and Sport ( DCMS ) for the maintenance of palaces was to remain at £ 15 m each year for the next three years .
ROYAL PUBLIC FINANCES
Financial summary , year to 31 March 2008 2008 ( £ millions ) 2007 ( £ millions )
The Queen 's civil list 12.7 12.2 Parliamentary annuities 0.4 0.4 Grants - in - aid 22.0 20.6 Expenditure met by gov depts 4.9 4.8 Total 40.0 38.0
This meant that without an increase in funding for 12 years , " the backlog in essential maintenance projects has continued to grow " , he added .
" In the absence of any increase of funding , the backlog of work is estimated at £ 32 m in today 's money . "
The accounts showed areas of work needed , including the replacement of slate roofs at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle , estimated at £ 16 m , and updating heating and electrical services at the palace at a price of £ 2.4 m .
Replacing cast iron and lead Victorian water mains at Windsor Castle was estimated to cost another £ 3 m .
A spokesman for the DCMS said the department was working with property maintenance experts and the royal household 's property services section " to ensure that the maintenance work is properly prioritised to control the backlog . "
Reform ' needed '
The £ 40 m quoted in the accounts does not include the cost of security provided by the police and Army or the ceremonial duties carried out by the armed forces .
Campaign group Republic repeated its demand for reforms to royal spending .
Spokesman Graham Smith said as Britons were being told to tighten their belts because of the credit crunch , " the Windsor family digs deeper into the taxpayers ' pockets " .
" Clearly there is an urgent need to reform the way the monarchy is paid for , " he said .
Mr Smith called for the Queen to be paid a salary and the monarchy to be budgeted and accounted for in the same way as all other government departments or public bodies .

I ’m not surprised Dan Bartlett is going to one of the networks ; I ’m surprised Dan Bartlett did n’t go to one of the networks sooner .
( via TP )
Former Counselor to President Bush , Dan Bartlett , has joined CBS News as a political analyst .
Bartlett will provide on - air analysis on a variety of political issues , “ including at the Democratic and Republican National Conventions and beyond , ” according to the press release .
Said CBS News & Sports president Sean McManus , “ We ’re very pleased to have Dan Bartlett join our team .
We now go into the final stages of this fascinating political season with two analysts — Dan and Joe [ Trippi ] — who have had unique and extensive hands - on experience in major political campaigns and government . ”
This is the latest part of a strange phenomenon of rewarding the Bush gang with high - profile opportunities at major media outlets .
The Bush White House has been , for lack of a better word , a disaster for the country .
From a journalistic perspective , these guys have been a nightmare — embracing almost comical levels of secrecy , propaganda , and media manipulation .
And yet , the moment presidential aides leave the West Wing , media outlets jump at the chance to put them on the payroll .
Michael Gerson was picked up as a columnist for the Washington Post .
Sara Taylor , who was integrally involved in the U.S. Attorney Purge scandal and the politicization of federal agencies , became a pundit for MSNBC .
Karl Rove became a Fox News “ analyst , ” a columnist for Newsweek , and a columnist for the Wall Street Journal .
Tony Snow went from the White House briefing room to a gig on CNN .
Frances Fragos Townsend also went from the White House to CNN .
Nicole Wallace went from Rove ’s office to CBS News ( she left soon after to join the McCain campaign ) .
And now Dan Bartlett will be an “ analyst ” for CBS News .
The obvious joke is to note how not - at - all liberal the media is , but I think this speaks to a larger problem of a revolving door between the political establishment and the political media .
A guy like Bartlett spun and misled news outlets , professionally , for most of Bush ’s presidency .
I do n’t doubt he goes to the same cocktail parties as the producers of the major networks , but rewarding him , and putting him on the air as a credible media figure , is absurd .
A traditional childhood pastime could provide a breakthrough in renewable energy , after successful experiments in flying a giant kite at one of Europe 's top research centres .
Scientists from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands harnessed energy from the wind by flying a 10 - sq metre kite tethered to a generator , producing 10 kilowatts of power .
The experiment generated enough electricity to power 10 family homes , and the researchers have plans to test a 50 kW version of their invention , called Laddermill , eventually building up to a proposed version with multiple kites that they claim could generate 100 megawatts , enough for 100,000 homes .
Wubbo Ockels , a professor of sustainable engineering and former astronaut who leads the Laddermill project , believes kites are a cheap way to harvest the enormous energy in the wind at a kilometre or more above the ground , where winds carry hundreds of times more energy than on the ground .
' We need to use all the energy supplies that are offered to us by nature , we need diversity and kites are ... intriguing and fascinating , ' he said .
Ockels is not alone .
Google.org , the philanthropic arm of the Californian web - search company , invested $ 10 m ( about £ 5 m ) last year in a US kite company called Makani , one of the first awards as part of the organisation 's Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal programme .
The aim of both teams is to tap into high - altitude wind , which is an energy source that is more abundant and reliable than the ground - level wind on which normal turbines depend .
Ken Caldeira , a climate scientist at Stanford University 's Carnegie Institution , has estimated that the total energy contained in wind is 100 times the amount needed by everyone on the planet .
But most of this energy is at high altitude .
The blades of modern commercial windmills sit around 80 metres from the ground , where the wind speed is almost five metres per second .
At 800 metres , however , wind speed rises to seven metres per second , potentially generating considerably more energy .
It would be virtually impossible to build a standard turbine to take advantage of the wind at 800 metres , but kites could easily get to these heights .
Furthermore , thanks to the high - speed jet stream , countries such as the UK , the Netherlands , Ireland and Denmark are particularly suited to flying kites .
' Pretty much anywhere in the UK you could run a kite plant economically , but you could n't run a wind turbine economically , ' said Allister Furey of the University of Sussex , who develops computer control mechanisms to maximise the power generated from kites .
A kite generates power by pulling on a string attached to generators on the ground .
When it has reached its maximum height , it is reeled back down to repeat the process .
Using computer models , Furey has worked out that flying kites in a figure of eight pattern means the air flowing over them travels even faster than the ambient wind speed .
When a kite needs to be reeled in , it is angled so that it falls out of the sky like a glider , without the need for much power .
Ockels 's system uses these flying patterns to maximise the power the kites can generate .
He is also looking at extending his basic prototype to use multiple kites that yo- yo : when one goes up , another goes down .
Ockels estimates that kites could generate power at less than 4 p per kilowatt - hour , which is comparable to coal power and less than half the cost of electricity from wind turbines .
' The first systems will be community scale that could power a large farm and sell some electricity back to the grid , ' said Furey .
' Once the technical issues have been sorted out , you can scale them up to the level of a coal - fired plant .
All you have to do is multiply the number of kites and you can have a farm as big as you want . '
There are many ideas for commercial - scale demonstration projects .
An Italian company , Kitegen , has come up with a theoretical design for a system that could generate a gigawatt , as much power as a standard coal - fired power station .
Its idea involves flying 12 sets of lines with four 500 - sq metre kites on each .
A spokesman for the British Wind Energy Association welcomed the idea of devices that could harness the power of jet streams and higher - altitude winds , saying : ' There is a vast potential that could be harnessed with the technology now available . '
Nick Rau , energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth , agreed .
' We could easily supply our electricity demand from offshore , even with other demands on sea such as shipping , fishing and defence radar .
These new [ kite ] technologies allow us to go further offshore and avoid other problems .
We have an abundance of renewable energy and there are a lot of visionary technologies coming along so that , in future , the sky 's the limit . '
How quickly technology will make it to market depends on how much investors are willing to put in .
Ockels said that commercial systems could be operational within five years if the money was made available ; otherwise the technology could languish in the lab for a decade or more .
' The Google prize is nothing compared to taxpayer money flowing into energy research .
If you take sustainable energy seriously , the money flow to sustainable energy should also be serious . '
A municipal worker in Tokyo has been killed and four are missing after being struck by a tide of sewage while repairing a drain , reports say .
The worker died in hospital after being found floating unconscious in a river near the drain , emergency officials told the Associated Press news agency .
A fifth worker managed to escape the sudden surge under a manhole in the south - east of Japan 's capital .
The repair work on the drains followed thunderstorms and flooding in the city .
The fire department is working to locate and rescue the missing workers , spokesman Masami Komura told AP .

Video :
So how was ' 30 Days ' ?
by Jeremy Hooper
Alright , so the contentious " 30 Days " episode has now aired .
And guess what ?
The Peter Sprigg interview portion just might have been worse than we had even anticipated .
Here 's the clip :
( property of FX ; brief clip posted for commentary purposes only )
So first , just as we had been warned , they introduce Peter Sprigg and let him present his baseless " facts " in an unchallenged fashion .
Even though the episode featured several pro-gay speakers , it is 100 % irresponsible to let Sprigg , sitting in the " expert " chair , rail off this list of supposed gay ills as if they are the gospel .
That simply would not be accepted with any other group of people !
And it 's unfair to just trust that the American public is going to realize that Sprigg 's words are the product of his own one - sided views , and not credible information .
But that being said , this portion of the program gets almost worse after the Sprigg clip , when the show proceeds to present the conversation with Dawn Stefanowicz in a way that makes it sound as if she is merely a child of gay parents who has written a book about her experiences .
Only problem with that ?
Dawn is not just someone who they found through an advertisement of casting call .
Dawn is an anti-gay activist who has taken a situation that is unique to herself , filtered that through a faith in Jesus , and began a new career of using her own past paint to fight against equal rights for gays and lesbians ( attracting the attention of rabidly anti-gay extremists like the American Family Association in the process ) .
She is telling the story of her family , from only her own personal perspective , even admitting that " it was not until [ her ] father , his sexual partners and [ her ] mother had died , was [ she ] free to speak publicly about [ her ] experiences . "
And she 's taking that one - sided story , with nobody alive to challenge it , and sweepingly misapplying it to gay parenting as a whole .
It 's patently unfair , both Dawn 's misuse of personal trauma , and her inclusion on this program in this casual , unfleshed out way !
Now to be fair , we did find the episode as a whole pretty good , and we ...
** SPOILER ALERT **
... were quite glad that the gay men featured in the show did not accept the anti-gay mother 's " let 's just agree to disagree and be friends " pact , and instead told her that non-acceptance of their family is a deal breaker .
There were certainly " teachable moments " to be had in the show as a whole .
However , that being said , we sincerely hope that when dealing with future episodes , the producers and the network will not hold these separate on - camera interviews with figures who look and are meant to look like " experts , " without ( a ) more clearly identifying their roles in this " culture war " , and ( b ) giving equal time to their counterpoints .
These off - set interviews click in a different way in the viewer 's mind .
In the reality genre , they pull the audience 's consciousness away from the primary story , where opinion and off - hand remarks abound , and put it into the realm where the viewer expects to be schooled with hard data .
Sprigg and Stefanowicz offer anything but !
**SEE ALSO : Dan Savage has some thoughts : Tonight ’s 30 Days [ Slog ]
Your thoughts
Jeremy , I absolutely agree 100 % with your assessment .
On some level it appeared as if they went out of their way to overstate the opinions of the anti-gay machine , going well afoul of any semblance of fair - and - balanced .
And Stefanowicz , who waited until everyone who could counter her claims was dead before she start cashing in on her alleged miserable childhood , may actually have had a bad experience .
We do n’t have any proof of that , but even if she did , I would bet that just about every person on this planet knows of at least one kid who had a miserable life at home with their parents .
And miserable to the extent that is equally as shocking ( with the added credibility of being perfectly truthful ) , but that is absolutely the result of bad parenting , and nothing to do with having a same - sex attracted parent .
But ( having now vented most of my frustration ) I do have to admit that they did two things ( IMHO ) at least somewhat reasonably .
Not that it was their intent , mind you , but more that it is simply the way things generally are .
First , they showed that even for a woman who had an absolute zero - tolerance mindset against the idea of same - sex parents raising children , even for her the issue became a little bit less absolute .
But the second thing really stood out : the ANGER coming from that woman .
I can understand the frustration of trying to convince the inconvincible .
But when this woman ’s pat answers ( answers that always work with the less inquisitive likeminded of her clan ) did n’t clinch the argument , that RAGE just boiled up in her .
She probably had to go and take a shower to get those filthy and depraved rational - minded opinions off of her .
And that rage seems to permeate that crowd – so much so that they have cautioned their hordes to feign an attempt at “ play nice ” in hopes of improving their chance of getting this constitutional amendment passed .
And , I agree with you that the Patrick family was right not to agree to disagree and still be friends .
When someone shows you that level of absolute disgust and intolerance , no one needs “ friends ” like that .
Posted by : Dick Mills | Jun 25 , 2008 4:51:49 AM
I agree with Dick Mills , Kati 's anger really stood out .
She 'd say horrific and hateful things to people ( her comments to that woman who lost visitation rights to her son were appalling ) and then she 'd fly into a rage or start sobbing if anyone questioned her .
Sadly , it 's not surprising .
The anti-gay movement has started using the " How dare you call me a bigot ? ! " excuse more often and more loudly .
As society moves toward acceptance of gay and lesbian people , more and more people are seeing bigotry for what it is .
It 's not an opinion , or a belief system , it 's just hate and bigotry .
And the anti-gays know that 's a losing battle , so they try to create this myth that calling them bigots is unfair and ridiculous .

Personally , I did n't think that the Sprigg interview was n't that big of a deal : they introduced him before his interview as head of the " Christian - based Family Research Council . "
Obviously , there was no pretense of objectivity with that .
I did , however , have a problem with Stefanowicz 's interview .
Comeon , they pulled out the sad music and the fading picture montage !
They made it seem like the horror story she allegedly live is a common occurrence in gay adoption .
As to the episode , it was pretty good ( and infuriating ) .
The woman did often contradict herself by saying that the Patrick 's family was good and healthy , and then turning around and calling out their homosexuality as inherently evil and child damaging .
Furthermore , every time she mentioned how she felt " attacked " with everybody coming at her for her morality and beliefs , I kept on yelling at the screen " Welcome to the club , lady !
That 's exactly how it feels growing up gay and being called immoral and the primary factor of the degradation of civilization ! "
Okay , well , maybe I did n't yell that exactly , but my point has been laid out .

* was that
Posted by : Joshua Rodriguez | Jun 25 , 2008 4:05:22 PM
I had to chuckle at the " let 's just agree to disagree and be friends " approach .
Imagine if you told a Christian that you thought Christians should be allowed to have kids , and that you would vote as such , and then you tried to say " let 's just agree to disagree and be friends " .
I do n't see how I can be " friends " with anybody who insists that I should have inferior rights and privileges based on who I am .
The concept is laughable , and if you applied it to numerous other circumstances it would be seen as absurd .
Yet some people who think we should have " second class citizen " status actually think we should " be friends " .
Amazing !

not really a crosspost , but an opinion from my personal blog and / or : We watched it , and I came out of it with a bad taste in my mouth ( no it was n't the spinach / feta ) .
The section with Peter Sprigg was disturbing because it was just flat fundie talking points , misrepresentations and outright lies , with no counter position .
Bringing Dawn Stefanowicz into the equation made no sense other than making me feel the need to take a shower .
If this woman ’s story is credible it's an anomaly .
How convenient is it that nobody 's alive to refute her story and she chose to write a book about it after the fact .
. . . one serious side of the pie that just does n't cut it .
One wonders if Dobson does n't personally sign the paycheck for this woman ’s appearances .
In the comments over on G.A.Y. someone said : " Come on GLAAD , really ?
It 's INCREDIBLY important that these attitudes and opinions be included .
It saddens me that an org like GLAAD is missing the point .
To edit what really happened would be defeating the purpose of the show / experiment .
Lighten up . "
My argument is exactly the opposite because the network excluded balance .
.
. inserting interviews with known anti-gay zealots without rebuttal .
It was n't an edit to what happened . . . they supplimented with faux " interviews " . . . giving yet another opportunity to fundimentalists and charlitans to spew anti-gay and anti-family rhetoric .
If it 's " INCREDIBLY important that these attitudes and opinions be included " , it 's all the more important that both sides of the coin are given equal air .
The bottom line for me is that nothing good came out of this episode . . . from either standpoint .
Posted by : Gary | Jun 25 , 2008 8:52:47 PM
OK , I had recorded the show and just watched it .
I was surprised to find out the woman was LDS and lives about two miles from me .
Having grown up LDS in this area , I have probably been in church meetings with her and if not , you at least got a good idea of what the majority of the LDS church beleives about gays and lesbians .
I saw in her what I see in my family now that I am out .
They know the talking points and somehow find it easy to seperate the individuals from the " truth " .
How she could live with an obviously loving and caring couple with 4 adopted kids and hear the stories of those who grew up in group homes and then turn right around and ignore those after crying about it is unreal , and yet I see it all the time .
I have grown up seeing those of " faith " cry about the problems in the world but as they do n't directly affect them , they can feel bad about it and then continue to ignore it .
Not all , but too , too many .
Overall , I too felt that the opposition talking points were made strongly and largely went unrefuted , however , I feel that all the gay and lesbians portrayed made a subtle counterpoint to all the arguments .
I just think that most people who are already opposed , like Katie , will miss the obvious health and well - being of those kids and continue to beleive the talking points with zero evidence to support it .

One thing I found interesting was how difficult it was for Kati to understand why the guys were taking her points ( that gays should n't be allowed to raise kids b/ c homosexuality is wrong ) personally .
I can't remember which man replied to her , but one of them said that it became personal when she took action on her opinions in ways that had a negative impact on his life .
And she STILL could n't see it .
Another cognitive disconnect was that she claimed to understand how awful the foster care system can be , and yet when asked ( more than once ) if it was better than the boys ' situation in her host home , she kept silent .
And when they interviewed Dawn Stefanowicz as though she represented children raised by gays , all I could do was shake my head and contemplate how heteros would react to the depiction of ( I 'm going to get this name wrong ) the Paskewitz family , with the parents having sex every night in their 24 - foot camper on the beach , their 11 children present and witnessing , as representative of how heterosexual child rearing can damage young ones .
This segment was unconscionable , and Spurlock should be ashamed of himself .
I kept wondering why Kati had agreed to this visit .
Was she hoping to bring people to Christ ?
Was she hoping to see lots and lots of horrible stuff so she could report back and validate her cult 's irrational position ?
One thing is certain : she did n't expect that a calm , reasonable , inquisitive lesbian sitting casually in a lawn chair on a pleasant afternoon could send her whimpering into a corner with her tail between her legs .

Jazzers and Programmers
Posted by Nick Sieger
At RubyFringe , I could have gone the easy route and talked about any manner of tech that I ’ve been working on or associated with , including JRuby , JRuby - Rack , Warbler , image_voodoo , Glassfish , activerecord - jdbc , Connection pooling for Rails , or Ruby - Processing .
Instead , I took a risk and went in a completely different direction .
What follows are some thoughts I expressed in the talk .
I ’d be interested to hear your take as well .
Jazzers and Programmers
Why do we program ?
Why do you program ?
Not the 9 - 5 systems analyst working for a paycheck .
I ’m talking about you and me ; we , the passionate fringe of the programming world .
Fame and fortune ?
A knee - jerk answer , but that ’s not the one I ’m looking for .
What I think drives great programmers is the desire to learn , share , collaborate , and constantly get better at what you do .
Which might explain , to a large degree , why all of you came to RubyFringe .
Ruby Fringe bills itself as deep nerd tech with punk rock spirit .
So what are some elements of punk rock spirit that we identify with ?
While I enjoy and appreciate punk and its culture of DIY , I ’m not an expert .
However , I am passionate and knowledgeable about jazz .
At this point you may be shaking your head , “ Sieger did n’t get the memo ! ”
At which point I counter : if you think this clown and the music he plays is jazz , then prepare to be corrected , because you need to hear what I ’m about to tell you .
Listen .
Jazz is punk before punk even existed .
And if we ’re associating ourselves with punk , the fringe , or , to use another word , vanguard , perhaps we can learn a few things from this truly unique American art form .
How did I pick this topic for my talk ?
I was thinking about the fringe , the vanguard and growing up nerdy and a misfit , which we probably all can relate to .
In addition to my interest in computers , I was also a band geek .
I wore ties on random days at school just to accentuate myself away from the “ in ” crowd .
And after school , I played in the jazz band .
Playing in the jazz bands continued through college , where despite my majoring ( and graduating ) in electrical engineering , I decided to move to New York City to experience the big city and hopefully continue to play jazz .
Instead , in an odd but practical twist , NYC became my transition into a programming career .
Because you gotta pay the bills somehow , after all .
Recently , after taking in David ’s “ Surplus ” talk at RailsConf , although it sounds trite , I really took his suggestion to heart to look outside the programming world for insights on how to become a better programmer .
I soon realized that jazz , my dormant passion , was that place right in front of me that might hold some of those crucial insights .
And as odd as it may appear that I am speaking about jazz at a programming conference , I thought I ’d share some thoughts about this from my vantage point as programmer and jazz musician .
( Plus , I get a kick out of saying that I came to RubyFringe , stood up in front of a captive audience , and auditioned jazz clips for 30 odd minutes . )
Styles of Jazz
It ’s taken me all my life to learn what not to play .
– Dizzy Gillespie
Jazz as a unique musical style is incredibly diverse .
Its history spans over a hundred years , and is remarkable in its breadth .
From Ragtime , New Orleans “ Hot ” Jazz , Swing , Bebop , Cool , Hard Bop , Free / Avant Garde , Jazz Rock / Fusion to splintering into a thousand directions , the music was ( and is ) constantly evolving and changing with the times .
The history of programming is undergoing a similar arc , but is nowhere near as developed as a communication medium as jazz is .
Whereas modern programming only 40 - 50 years old depending on when you start counting , jazz was just getting a head of steam at that point .
You could break it down like this : C is akin to New Orleans “ hot ” jazz : foundation for much that followed , and still relevant in a lot of ways , but definitely showing its age .
Java is like swing ( literally ! c.f javax.swing .* ) : appeals to the masses , anyone gets it without a lot of cognitive load .
Ruby is like bebop : favors minimalism , more powerful , more intellectual , and less understood .
So what does that mean for the future of programming ?
We ’re already seeing an increase in DSLs , polyglotism , and languages and tools used for specialized purposes .
I would expect that trend to continue , and using the development of the many styles of jazz as a ruler , would say that there will not be a Next Big Language ( NBL ) .
Specialization and niche skills will be increasingly important as differentiators in our careers , but that means there will also be plenty of opportunity to stake out that new ground for ourselves and become leaders in these new specializations .
Jazz Fundamentals
Anyone can make the simple complicated .
Creativity is making the complicated simple . ” – Charles Mingus
Jazz as a creative medium has a number of compelling features that surround the music itself as well as the players .
Let ’s examine a few of these , using them as a mirror to reflect on programming .
Instrumentation .
The modern jazz small ensemble is built upon the rhythm section -- piano , bass , and drums .
The bass is the starting point , and is responsible for marking the beat as well as laying the harmonic foundation , often by “ walking ” .
Because of this critical role , the bass player in a jazz band is almost always positioned in the rear - center of the stage , between the piano and the drums .
The piano and drums also have a role in keeping time , but have more freedom in creating tension and dissonance by layering rhythms on top of the bass , in an activity known as Comping .
The easiest parallel to programming is libraries , frameworks and patterns .
These are the building blocks upon which we code .
A well - designed library makes your work as a programmer easier and more enjoyable in the same way a solid , experienced rhythm section complements a soloist .
To use an example from web programming , may I suggest Bass - Drums - Piano == Model - View - Controller ?
When you hit a wrong note it ’s the next note that makes it good or bad .
– Miles Davis
Musical Structures .
Much of bebop and straight - ahead jazz employs the well - established structure of the head , followed by solos , and finally repeating the head .
The head is basically a crib sheet that consists of a tune or melody ( usually a well - known jazz standard ) and a set of chord changes that forms the harmonic basis for the entire piece .
During the solo section , one or more musicians improvise over the changes for one or more “ choruses ” .
The 12 - bar blues is easily the most common form found in jazz .
It is usually the first form that a budding jazz musician practices when learning how to improvise .
Every working jazz musician is expected to memorize and be able to play a large number of tunes and harmonic structures .
This body of tunes is exemplified by the Real Book , an underground , illegal transcription of a large number of tunes by some Berklee College students in the 70’s that has become a standard part of a jazz musician ’s toolbox .
Collectively , these musical conventions and rules form a jazz vocabulary and a shared ritual that allow musicians to play together in a jam session without having played together before .
The takeaway is that conventions and standards , when organically grown , tend to be powerful , liberating forces for communication and collaboration .
There was no OASIS - or W3C - like committee that sat down when the roots of jazz were taking hold and dictated that it would be played this way .
It just happened , night in , night out , on bandstands and in sessions all over New Orleans and Chicago and New York .
I believe that some of the best examples of programming and technology embody those same ideas .
Certainly Rails is a shining example in the programming world of such a set of conventions and how they allow you to be productive no matter what Rails project you ’re working on .
It was when I found out I could make mistakes that I knew I was on to something .
– Ornette Coleman
Improvisation .
Making it up as you go .
Jazz would n’t be jazz without improvisation .
The whole concept of improvisation in jazz builds upon the conventions and structure , but gives you the license to do whatever you want .
Improvisation is what turns those constraints into freedom .
Conviction is the key .
Get up and play , tell your story , tell it with conviction , and there will be no wrong notes .
Improvisation is also where the musical conversation happens .
Where the soloist connects with the crowd and his / her fellow musicians .
As a listener , following along with that conversation sometimes takes a trained ear .
But there are still some musical devices that are easy for anyone to appreciate and can give you something to listen for .
Trading fours is a conversational device between players in the group .
Most commonly , it ’s used to give the drummer a chance to stretch out by alternating four bars of soloing with one or all of the instrumentalists .
It ’s a great way to enjoy the inventiveness of the group collaboration element of jazz by listening to how the soloists play off each other in short spurts .
An outstanding example of trading fours can be found in “ The Blues Walk ” between Clifford Brown and Harold Land ( at about the 5:30 mark in the tune ) .
They trade fours for two choruses , then twos , then ones , then halfs .
The lines they weave are unreal !
Quoting is humor and inventiveness applied to improvisation .
It ’s named for a device where a player spontaneously inserts a recognizable melody into the middle of a solo .
It ’s basically easter eggs applied to jazz .
Dexter Gordon and Sonny Rollins are two players known for their penchant for breaking out and quoting in the middle of a solo .
Improvisation and Programming
Learn the changes , then forget them .
– Charlie Parker
As far as programming is concerned , it ’s harder to see how improvisation can translate .
Chad Fowler recently posted about programming as performance , asking for examples .
Unfortunately , most of the examples given use programming as a means , but with some form of multimedia art as the end .
I ’d like to see programming performance where the code itself is the end result .
Do programmers improvise ?
I certainly believe that the best ones do .
While it may be hard to capture the spontaneity of pure , real - time improvisation in a way that maps to how we write code , I think we can get close .
Continuous rewrites .
Consider Fred Brooks ’ axiom , “ Plan to throw one away ; you will , anyhow . ”
Jazz musicians do this on the bandstand every night !
What if , rather than throwing one away , you rewrote a non-trivial piece of code five , ten , twenty times ?
What do you think would come out of that exercise as a result ?
Live coding as a performance and teaching mechanism .
I think live coding is an awesome example of spontaneity and risk - taking in programming , and one that not enough people attempt .
Have you ever looked over the shoulder of a great programmer ?
It ’s fun to watch , because you learn a lot .
I could easily sit for an hour watching a seasoned programmer create code while working in their own environment .
On the other hand , there ’s a trend in conference talks where the presenter , to avoid the wrath of the demo gods , stands idly by while playing back a pre-recorded video of the demo .
Sorry , I do n’t buy this .
If it ’s not live , it ’s not real .
Let ’s make live - coding something we all strive to do !
Do n’t be afraid to show the audience that you ’re not perfect !
Do not fear mistakes .
There are none .
– Miles Davis
Instead of a hackfest , try a Coding Jam Session .
Hackfests only rarely unite people to work toward a common cause ; people enjoy the communal feel but too often people revert to working on their own thing instead of collaborating .
Sprints are better , where the general topic or project is shared but each person is still working on their separate pieces .
Rather , what I ’d like to see is a group of programmers working toward a single shared goal .
Plan ahead for a gathering of a handful of people for a lengthy period of time , say 8 or 12 or even 24 hours .
Agree upon a theme or rough plan ahead of time , but allow for serendipity and improvisation to take hold of the group during the session .
Get together , and start writing code .
Try “ trading fours ” , allowing each person in the session to drive and add their bit of code into the mix in short spurts .
The overarching theme should be collaboration and building on each other ’s contributions .
Avoid negative responses , such as saying “ No ” or “ Yes , but ... ” or taking over and deleting or substantially rewriting someone else ’s code .
Instead , say “ Yes , and ... ” .
Imagine yourself on the bandstand , where once a note is played , it ca n’t be taken back .
Really try hard to put away your devil ’s advocate side or need to take control and instead play up to each others ’ strengths .
Depending on the blend of personalities , this could be a great way to spike a idea for a new website or a startup !
Group Gitjour repository sharing .
Crazy idea : what about using gitjour at a coding jam in a mode where everyone broadcasts their own repository and adds everyone else as remotes ?
Commit notifications could be broadcast on the local network with Growl or a similar tool , and pulling in someone else ’s changes could be a simple short one - line command , or perhaps even automatic .
Imagine writing code together where suddenly a git merge is done for you automatically and the text changes right before your eyes right in your editor !
Real - time collaboration !
Join the conversation !
I hope you ’ll join me and post your thoughts about some of these ideas , either in the comments below or on your own blogs .
And find some inspiration in your passions and pastimes you have outside of the programming world that help you become a better programmer and collaborator !

AS New York ’s all - important financial industry faces what could be years of lower profits and fewer jobs , the city and state face multibillion - dollar deficits – and the temptation to fix their problems by turning a crisis into a disaster .
Tax hikes and harsh cuts to core services like public safety are the wrong medicine .
Consider : City spending is now set to rise more than 20 percent over the next three years , while revenues will grow by just 13 percent .
That means a $ 5 billion - plus deficit ( more than 11 percent of tax - funded spending ) in two years ’ time .
And that ’s a rosy scenario , based on the city comptroller ’s prediction of low growth this year and next , but then a quick ( if weak ) recovery .
If things do n’t turn out so great , revenues could actually shrink – as they often did in the ’70s and again in 1990 and 2002 .
At the state level , Gov. Paterson predicts a nearly $ 8 billion deficit in two years ( following a $ 6 billion - plus gap next year ) – smaller in percentage terms than the city ’s , but still grave .
Things look worse than some experts thought just a few months ago .
The city ’s pension costs could be $ 100 million higher than expected next year :
Taxpayers will likely have to make up for negative returns on the city ’s pension funds .
The Wall Street slowdown hits New York so hard partly because the state and city depend so much on taxing top incomes :
A few bad years for the rich is disastrous for the place they live .
Two years ago , the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid nearly 48 percent of the city ’s personal - income taxes , up from 34 percent two decades ago , reports the city Independent Budget Office .
( The state is also dangerously dependent on the rich . )
It could be disastrous if city and state leaders bet that this Wall Street downturn is another blip , rather than a long readjustment – and prove to be wrong .
FOR a quarter - century , New York has stuck to one playbook whenever Wall Street hit one of its periodic downturns :
Jack up taxes to make up for lower tax revenues , cut spending a bit and wait for the industry to come roaring back .
This time around , tax hikes could be calamitous – because Wall Street may not come roaring back as it has before .
Look back to the ’60s – when New York last raised taxes while its major industry , then manufacturing , was shrinking .
In 1965 , Mayor John Lindsay enacted the city ’s first personal - income taxes , as well as new business taxes in 1966 .
The city went on to lose half of its 1 million manufacturing jobs by 1975 .
It also lost many corporate headquarters ( and their legions of well - paid employees ) :
By the end of the ’ 70s , half the city ’s 140 Fortune 500 firms had fled .
New York did n’t anticipate this change or understand it as it was happening .
Well into the ’ 70s , the city thought it could keep taxing and spending because the future had to mirror the “ Soaring ’ 60s . ”
Nor did city leaders realize how quickly quality of life could deteriorate ( or how quickly middle - class folks would flee ) :
As they focused on social spending rather than vital services like policing , murders shot up from 645 in 1965 to 1,146 in 1970 .
The meltdown finally came in the the spring of ’ 75 , when Gotham wrestled with a budget deficit that equaled 14 percent of its expected spending – and creditors cut the city off .
Forced to beg for cash from the state and federal governments , the city gutted trash pickup and policing , murders climbed to 1,500 a year – and more residents left .
Today ’s New York likes to think of itself as far superior .
But once again , on the brink of what may be a major economic upheaval , it risks continuing to act with complacency even as rhetoric heats up .
WHILE the city cut expected spending this year , the cuts were modest – far less than the 6 percent Mayor Bloomberg had called for .
And the mayor and the City Council spent the spring bickering over tiny cuts to education , rather than looking closely at a scary long - term picture .
This year ’s small cuts hit almost every department , police to homeless services .
But this strategy can’t carry the city through a protracted downturn : Vital services can’t withstand deep cuts .
The city must not alienate the middle class – it has to protect the Police Department and keep streets clean and libraries open .
One worrisome sign :
In May , Bloomberg delayed the hiring of 1,000 new police officers for more than a year , even as New Yorkers are becoming wary of crime again .
Another of this year ’s fixes that ca n’t be repeated :
The mayor cut 20 percent from the capital budget , which funds physical infrastructure .
But failing to fix infrastructure is no way to save money : Waiting will worsen the decay , and mean more expenses later .
Where should we cut ?
* Education is an inevitable place to start :
That ’s where the money is .
* Within the capital budget , the city should kill its spending on economic - development and affordable - housing subsidies , and protect funds for things like roads and transit .
* New York pols have to stop regarding the operating and capital budgets as unrelated .
Cutting 10 percent of Medicaid ’s $ 6 billion - a- year take would go a long way toward cutting the deficit and upgrading the city ’s roads and subways .
* In the end , we ca n’t fix the city ’s budget without addressing the half that the mayor has called “ uncontrollable ” : pensions and benefits for city workers , plus debt costs .
Their growth will be responsible for three - fourths of the deficit in three years ’ time .
Bloomberg ( and his successor ) must use fiscal stress in bargaining for changes in city contracts – and Paterson and the Legislature have a duty to back them up .
The city ca n’t let other unions get the big raises the police got through arbitration – because they do n’t need them , as the cops did , for staff retention .
One opportunity is the city ’s contract with 100,000 - plus nonuniformed workers , which expired this spring .
New York should negotiate with the union , DC37 , and Albany to let new employees accept a pension plan in which the city contributes to workers ’ private accounts – rather than guaranteeing a pension for life .
The Independent Budget Office puts the budget savings from that at nearly $ 100 million a year within half a decade .
Requiring these workers to pay 10 percent of their health - insurance premiums would save half a billion more .
Extending the city work week from 35 and 37 hours to 40 would net another half - billion – all savings the city will dearly need if Wall Street does n’t roar back .
AS Gov. Paterson said last night , New York ca n’t follow a strategy of waiting for things to fix themselves , as they generally have in the past .
The city does n’t have to default on its bonds to run into serious problems .
Sacrificing quality of life through poorly managed budget cuts so that it can pay those bonds would do as much damage .
The risk is hard to quantify – but real .

The March of Esperanto Language Nerds to Tackle Globalization at G - 8 Summit
The international language Esperanto is meant to foster peace and international understanding .
But a group of Esperanto speakers planning to attend protests at the upcoming G - 8 summit in Hokkaido in July are causing concern for Japan 's security services .

Please Note
I originally wrote this article for myself alone .
It served as my way of learning the rules of language .
The fact that it got some attention mostly bothers me , to be honest , as I was n’t intending for this to become some sort of authoritative source by any means .
I worry this might be the case for a few , which I ’m ashamed of as it was nothing more than practice and play for a literary child .
Reading through the comments makes two things clear : little , some , much , most of what is here is wrong .
Secondly , what is right and what is wrong is subjective .
You would be much better off finding a much more substantial and educated opinion -– might I suggest The Elements of Style by Strunk & White ?
The Maira Kalman illustrated edition is quite lovely .
Thank you
When you know the correct way to structure a sentence , the world becomes a scary place — you start to notice how many people get it painfully wrong .
The ease of content creation that the web now affords us is making the problem worse , so why not get a basic understanding to help make your text a little more professional ?
Before we get into this , let ’s establish two things .
A lot of these ‘ rules ’ are different country to country , decade to decade .
The way a proof reader or typesetter might lay out a page in Britain is different to how it might be done in America .
How it ’s done in 1985 is different than how it might be done in 2005 .
The styles of typesetting can change over time and throughout different regions .
Always be consistent , even if it might not be ‘ correct ’ .
Some companies will have certain ways they layout text , even if it might be considered wrong for their geographic location .
But they are consistent with how they lay their text out and that is the most important thing .
You do n’t want your audience to get half way through a piece of text and get confused because you changed the way you laid something out .
Double Spaces
Never use them .
Ever .
Your high - school teacher was wrong , do n’t ever use them .
Apostrophes
An apostrophe is inserted when letters are removed .
Let ’s go to the race .
( Let us go to the race . )
It ’s going to be a great day .
( It is going to be a great day . )
The other use of the apostrophe is to show ownership .
The runner ’s shoes .
Mayor Swanks ’ opening speech .
Tip :
If the last letter of the owners name ends in s , place the apostrophe on the end without adding the extra s .
Commas
Ah the lovely comma .
A comma can help you set the pace of your text , but do n’t go crazy .
He ran faster and faster , faster still , his muscles burnt , his face dripped .
Is more interesting than :
He ran faster and faster .
His muscles burnt and his face dripped .
There are also a few rules when using a comma :
Use it to divide items in a list ( of three or four items ) , when in a run-on sentence .
Use with and , but , for , or , nor , so , yet .
She ran as fast as her body would let her , yet it was n’t enough .
Use to separate contrasting parts of a sentence .
She felt she could n’t summon the energy to run the fastest , she was wrong .
Use in a similar way to parenthesis , but when you do n’t want to break the flow .
She smashed her feet on the pavement , not realising the damage she was doing , in an effort to win .
Paragraphs
This can be a problem on the web , as apparently the ‘ enter ’ key is a little hard to find .
We ’ve all seen those sites , where someone posts an article that is n’t broken into paragraphs correctly .
The problem with this is that your text needs to breathe , flow well and look smooth – a lot of this is achieved by well spaced paragraphs .
A couple of simple guidelines :
Stick to around 5 sentences
The reality is that you can have as many sentences in a paragraph that you feel is needed to get your point across , but for arguments sake , let ’s save five or six is somewhat of a limit .
Keep each paragraph topical and relative .
Do n’t make two distinct points in one long paragraph when two short ones will work better .
Quotation Marks
The British will use single quotes , then double quotes , when there is a quote within a quote .
‘ I ca n’t forget I “ can run as fast as lightning ” for as long as I need ’ Samantha told herself .
While the Americans will do this the other way around .
“ I ca n’t forget I ‘ can run as fast as lightning ’ for as long as I need ” Samantha told herself .
The British idea is that single quote marks are less obtrusive , the American idea is that double quotation marks are more noticeable .
So really , they have their preference for the exact same reason .
However , as I am an Australian , I go by the British standard of singles first .
Punctuation in Quotes
If the question mark , full stop or any other punctuation is part of the quote , then include it within the quotation marks .
He raised an eyebrow and scoffed , “ Did you hear that Samantha is ‘ going to run me into the ground ’ at today ’s race ? ”
If the quote is part of a sentence , and the punctuation is n’t part of the quote , then keep the punctuation on the outside .
To think , he thought he could win , he even went as far as to say ‘ you are n’t even a blip on my radar ’ , in that cocky I ’m - a - prick tone of his .
If the whole sentence is a quote , then keep the punctuation inside of the marks .
‘ I won , I won , I won , even with this athletes foot , I won !
Whooo !’
Hyphens & Dashes
There is a difference here and this is probably the thing most people get wrong on the web .
The hyphen is essentially used to join two words together , without space on either side .
Dashes are different .
There is either the en dash or the em dash .
An en dash will be the width of the capital N in any given font , while the em dash is the width of a capital M in said font , and they both have different usages .
Em Dash ( in HTML : — )
You would use an em dash instead of a comma or brackets as it helps give emphasis and is the typographical equivalent of the dun - dun - da music .
Just make sure you never have space on either side of an em dash .
The race was almost over — but it was only really beginning for Sam .
The race was almost over — it has been a hard hour for all — and it was only down to a few contenders .
En Dash ( in HTML : – )
The en dash is used between a range of numbers , while kept closed , and is best used when the span is part of a list .
1—5 runners are expected to fail .
10 — 25 runners will be hurt .
However , if the span is part of running prose , then it ’s generally nicer ( phonetically and typographically ) to use from and to , but use your own judgement on this .
One to five runners are expected to fail .
The mini-Olympics will run from the 29th until the 30th .
The temperature is expected to have a top of 20 — 25 degrees on the day of the race .
Another use of the en dash is when you want to offset a phrase , but without the sudden hit of an em dash .
Use it with a space either side .
Winning a race can be very hard work – I knew I could do it .
Tip :
An easy way to easily insert the correct dashes into your writing , if using a CMS or something similar is to type out — for en dashes , or — for em dashes .
Then perform a find and replace and presto , you ’re done .
Numbers
This is nice and easy – numbers up to ten are typed in full , 11 and beyond are numerical .
However , sometimes it ’s nicer to spell them out .
Runners eight and 17 broke their legs .
The first place winner won two million dollars , second place received $ 158 .
Conclusion
There you have it !
A quick list on how to use some basic grammar that will set you apart from most schlumps who do n’t know their ems from their ens .
This list is quite basic and is n’t enough for perfect writing , but it ’s enough to make you look like you actually care about your content , and you do care , do n’t you ?
Yeah , that ’s what I thought .
The two books I used for guides , both of which you should already own or pick up eight copies of each of were ;
Type it Write .
A Voice project .
The Elements of Typographic Style – Robert Bringhurst .
I ’m willing to bet you own the second book , or currently waiting for it to arrive ( seriously , this thing is the typographic bible ) , but the first may be a little obscure to some of you .
It ’s a small book that was put together by the Voice group from Adelaide , Australia .
It ’s an awfully handy little thing and well worth grabbing a copy , whenever you see it .
29/08/2008 – A very special thank - you to those in the comments for letting me , and anyone else who is reading this article , know of the mistakes originally made .
It is greatly appreciated !
Nils Olav is a penguin .
But not just any penguin .
Everything started in 1972 at the Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland during the Edinburgh Military Tattoo , the annual military music festival , when the penguin became a mascot of the King ’s Guard .
The name , he got it from lieutenant Nils Egelien who declared him an honorary member of the military and after Olav V. , king at the date .
Even though the penguin died , every time he was replaced and kept the name , the notoriety and the rank .
The Nils Olav of today is the third penguin which in 2005 got promoted from regimental sergeant major to honorary colonel - in - chief of the elite Norwegian King ’s Guard .
After lots of medals for good conduct and long service , Nils Olav became the most royal of all penguin on Friday after a knighthood ceremony at the Zoo .
With a fanfare behind and escorted by the King ’s Guard Color Detachment , he inspected the troops and stopped to crane his neck at every little detail before moving forward .
He was thorough .
On behalf of Norway ’s King Harald V , British Maj . Gen. Euan Loudon took care of taking off the colonel - in - chief badge and wrap the new one to its flipper .
Nils Olav will be a SIR now .

The Nobel laureate and former US vice - president , Al Gore , has urged Americans to abandon electricity generated by fossil fuels within a decade .
Mr Gore compared the scale of the challenge to that of putting a man on the moon in the 1960s .
He said it did not make sense that the US was borrowing money from China to burn oil from the Middle East which then contributed to climate change .
Critics say weaning the US off fossil fuels is not possible within a decade .
Mr Gore , who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for his work on climate change , insists his goal is achievable and affordable .
We have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
Robby Diamond ,
Securing America's Future Energy
" The answer is to end our reliance on carbon - based fuels , " he said in a speech in Washington .
" When you connect the dots , it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever - rising energy prices . "
To secure this green revolution , Mr Gore said the single most important policy change would be to " tax what we burn - not what we earn " .
Green campaign ?
Mr Gore 's speech elicited huge cheers from a packed conference hall near the White House , but whether his message is taken up in the presidential election campaign depends on how much the electorate warms to his vision , says the BBC's Warren Bull .
Mr Gore said US presidential contenders Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain were way ahead of most politicians in the fight against global climate change .
They appear to agree on the need for progress on green issues , says our correspondent .
President George W Bush has often been criticised for not doing enough to tackle climate change .
At the recent G8 summit of developed nations in Japan , he did move the US closer to a consensus on climate change , by agreeing to language which makes achieving 50 % cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 a G8 " vision " .
Cold turkey Electricity generated from non-fossil sources amounted to almost 28 % of the total in 2007 , according to US government figures , with most of that coming from nuclear power .
Hydro-electric stations generated nearly 6 % of US electricity needs and other renewable sources such as wind , solar and wood accounted for 2.5 % .
Burning coal provided almost half of US electricity last year .
Mr Gore 's ambitious plan would still rely on nuclear energy for a fifth of America 's energy needs .
Many see the goal as unachievable .
Robby Diamond , president of a bipartisan think tank called Securing America 's Future Energy , said weaning the nation off fossil fuels could not be done in a decade .
" The country is not going to be able to go cold turkey , " he told the Associated Press .
" We have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete . "

Newswise —
A new study of DNA from ancient and modern chickens has shed light on the controversy about the extent of pre-historic Polynesian contact with the Americas .
The study questions recent claims that chickens were first introduced into South America by Polynesians , before the arrival of Spanish chickens in the 15th century following Christopher Columbus .
It is published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA ( July 28 ) by an international research group , including scientists from the University of Adelaide 's Australian Centre for Ancient DNA ( ACAD ) .
ACAD Director Professor Alan Cooper says there has been considerable debate about the existence and degree of contact between Polynesians and South Americans , with the presence of the sweet potato throughout the Pacific often used as evidence of early trading contacts .
" Similarly , Polynesians are known to have spread chickens across the Pacific at least as far as Easter Island , but were not thought to have introduced them to South America , " he says
A recent study claimed to have found the first direct evidence of a genetic link between ancient Polynesian and apparently pre-Columbian chickens from archaeological sites in Chile , supporting the idea that there was extensive contact between Polynesia and South America and that chicken and ' chips ' had been traded in opposite directions .
The current work challenges this conclusion however , by generating DNA data from 41 native Chilean chicken specimens , and comparing these with over 1000 modern domestic chickens from around the world , and the previously published DNA from Polynesian and Chilean chicken bones .
" The results showed that the ancient Polynesian and Chilean chickens possessed a genetic sequence that is the most common in the world today , the so - called ' KFC ' gene " Professor Cooper says .
" This sequence would undoubtedly have been common in the early Spanish chickens , and therefore provides no evidence of Polynesian contact .
So while we can say the KFC chicken was popular amongst early Polynesian voyagers , we certainly can't use it as evidence for trade with South America " .
The researchers did find a highly unusual DNA sequence in the ancient Easter Island chickens , which originate from Indonesia or the Philippines , but this apparently did not get passed on to South America .
" This is important because Easter Island is commonly thought of as a major jumping off point for Polynesian contact with South America , " says team member and ACAD PhD student Nicolas Rawlence .
According to project leader Dr Jaime Gongora from Sydney University , many people in South America like to believe they are descendants of Polynesians .
" This study does not disprove this idea , but we have found no evidence to support pre-historic contact . "
Sri Lanka Flips Out Over Fossilized Buddha ’s Tooth
Cannons explode and dancers backflip , while stilt walkers and fire swallowers march alongside a dazzling procession of jewel - cloaked elephants .
Sri Lanka ’s greatest event has has begun !
The Esla Perhahera , arguably Asia ’s most spectacular festival , happened this month in Sri lanka during the late summer full moon ( August 7th through 17th , 2008 ) .
The centuries - old celebration of Sri Lankan Buddhism brings a large chunk of the country ’s population up to the lakeside capital city of Kandy .
It also attracts over 10,000 foreign tourists .
The 10 day parade has the fire and flair of events like Carnival or Mardi Gras , minus all the alcohol and sexual energy .
It is , in fact , deeply rooted in Buddhist traditions .
The holiest part of the festival is an elephant - mounted display of the Sacred Tooth Relic .
The Tooth Relic is said to be the left canine tooth of the Buddha , snatched from his funeral Prye over 2,500 years ago , and smuggled from India to Sri Lanka in the 4th century AD .
While Sri Lankan Buddhists and historians believe in the authenticity of this sacred relic , some outsiders are more skeptical .
The late English occultist Aleister Crowley writes in his autobiography that while studying meditation in Sri Lanka he was :
“ permitted to be present at the annual inspection by the trustees .
I believe the tooth to be that of a dog or crocodile , but though I got an excellent view at close quarters , I am not anatomist enough to be positive .
I am , however , quite certain that it is not a human tooth . ”
For centuries the actual tooth was paraded on the back of an elephant , but nowadays , a symbolic casket is paraded .
Security is too tight to bring the national treasure into public crowds .
Â
Over 8,000 policemen patrol the area during the festival .
Why ?
In 1998 the Temple of the Tooth was bombed by Tamil terrorists who want more power as a minority ethnic group in the country .
This year ’s Perahera went over well with few incidents , except for an elephant that went bezerk and tried to rip out traffic signs until it was restrained , according to Sri Lanka ’s Daily News .
Check out this video of the Perahera festival :

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
You might want to go green , but how do you know what you 're buying is truly ethical ?
Greenwash -- the ignoble art of misleading consumers about a product 's true green worth -- is on the rise .
But thanks to the work of increasingly vigilant regulators , some of the more curious and downright spurious claims are being weeded out .
TerraChoice 's " six sins of greenwashing " include vagueness , irrelevance and outright fibbing .
TerraChoice , a Canadian environmental marketing agency , has devised a guide for consumers which they hope goes some way to eradicating greenwash .
They 've called it " the six sins of greenwashing . "
Scott McDougall , President and CEO of TerraChoice told CNN : " The regulatory initiatives in Canada , the U.S. , Australia and , I suspect , Europe are rather impenetrable bureaucratic documents , and are not very useful to the average consumer .
So we developed it as a tool that would be memorable and useful to consumers . "
The sins include " Vagueness " -- terms like 100 percent natural and earth - friendly which do n't really mean anything , " Hidden Trade Off " -- is a product truly sustainable ?
And the " Lesser of Two Evils " -- trying to make consumers feel green about products that have dubious environmental benefit .
Set up in 1995 as part of the Canadian Federal Government 's program against greenwash , TerraChoice examines the entire life cycle of a product and the science of environmental claims with a view to awarding Canada 's environmental certification mark , the EcoLogo .
" Our position is to help genuine environmental leadership win market share , " McDougall said .
Fact Box
The six sins of greenwashing according to TerraChoice :
The Hidden Trade - off
No Proof
Vagueness
Irrelevance
Fibbing
The Lesser of Two Evils
The six sins of greenwashing according to TerraChoice :
TerraChoice is currently completing a 20 - year study of green marketing claims .
They have discovered that greenwash is more prevalent when public interest in environmental issues is greater , and that there 's been a gradual increase in claims over time .
" It 's a kind of a sawtooth curve , " McDougall said .
This rise appears to be a global phenomenon .
The UK Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) says that complaints about environmental claims " increased dramatically " in 2007 -- 561 compared with just 117 the previous year .
Car manufacturer Lexus ran into trouble in the UK with its " High Performance .
Low Emissions .
Zero Guilt " advert .
The ASA ruled that " zero guilt " implied " little or no damage to the environment . "
British Gas was also found to have misled the public by claiming in a television ad that its green energy was " carbon zero . "
The regulator agreed with complainants that the phrase implied that no carbon dioxide was produced .
In their 2007 report the ASA concluded that ; " claims about carbon emissions and green tariffs were among those most likely to confuse consumers . "
Australia is also clamping down on greenwash .
In June 2008 , the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) demanded that tire manufacturer Goodyear compensate consumers after claiming that their Eagle LS2000 was eco-friendly and cut carbon emissions .
The ACCC -- which is also taking Swedish car manufacturer Saab to court over inflated green claims -- has recorded a tenfold increase in complaints since October 2007 .
So does McDougall think businesses are starting to get the message about greenwash ?
" Those sectors under particular scrutiny are educating themselves more quickly about what legitimate green marketing is , " he said .
" In particular , cleaning formulations and cleaning chemistry .
I think there is a great deal of movement towards greening generally . "
But should products which are inherently bad for the environment be allowed to promote their improving green status ?
Well , Norway does n't think so .
In October 2007 they banned all green references in automobile advertising .
In TerraChoice 's " six sins " many motorized forms of transport would fall into the " Lesser of Two Evils " category .
McDougall thinks that this is increasingly a problem area .
" It has been suggested to us that some of the claims about fuel efficiency and carbon issues are fundamentally deceiving , " he said .
Inevitably , some products are going to fail the criteria needed to achieve an EcoLogo -- McDougall once had to politely reject a bid wanting organic cigarettes certified -- but he says in most cases that TerraChoice has studied there was not a malicious attempt to mislead .
With such a barrage of eco-messages slapped on products these days even McDougall concedes that " the six sins of greenwashing " might be too much for consumers to remember when out shopping .
So , in a nutshell , what 's his advice ?
" The most essential guide I can offer consumers is ; choose the product that appears to be doing its best to educate you , to offer you information and in precise language . "
Do you think greenwashing is a problem ?
Do we need more or less regulation ?
Have your say in the " sound off " box below .
All About Nature and the Environment • Global Climate Change • Advertising

Myrtle called it The article that launched a thousand posts … , and counting comments on this and several other blogs , that may not be too much of an exaggeration .
Yet the discussion feels incomplete — I have not been able to put into words all that I want to say .
Thus , at the risk of once again revealing my mathematical ignorance , I am going to try another response to Keith Devlin ’s multiplication articles .
Let me state up front that I speak as a teacher , not as a mathematician .
I am not qualified , nor do I intend , to argue about the implications of Peano ’s Axioms .
My experience lies primarily in teaching K - 10 , from elementary arithmetic through basic algebra and geometry .
I remember only snippets of my college math classes , back in the days when we worried more about nuclear winter than global warming .
I will start with a few things we can all agree on …
We All Agree on Some Things
Elementary students will use addition to solve beginning multiplication problems .
What else could they do ?
They have not yet learned multiplication .
The multiplication table is initially built by repeated addition , as our students add up ( or count by ) the numbers in each row and column .
Even adults , when they get stumped by a math fact they ’ve forgotten , will use repeated addition to figure out the answer .
Repeated addition does give the correct answer for any multiplication of whole numbers .
Sometimes it is more trouble than it is worth — who wants to add up 957×842 ?
But by using the Distributive Property , any multiplication of whole numbers can be reduced to a repeated addition calculation :
4 × 3 = ( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 ) × 3 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3
Rational number multiplications can be calculated as addition of parts .
This is how the Egyptian scribes handled multiplication of fractions .
But be careful !
To calculate the parts , one needs multiplication — or rather , its inverse , division .
So to use this as a definition , one must resort to circular reasoning .
Finally , I think we can all agree that repeated addition is an important problem - solving tool .
Repeated addition can help students think their way through simple multiplication word problems .
It does n’t always work , but sometimes it is the quickest way to understand a situation .
So What ’s the Problem ?
So what is wrong with the definition , “ Multiplication is repeated addition ” ?
Perhaps wrong is too strong a word — perhaps in some deep , theoretical sense , the statement is true , at least for the whole numbers — I ’ll leave that argument to the mathematicians .
( See , for instance , How multiplication is really defined in Peano arithmetic . )
But speaking as a teacher , the phrase can definitely be misleading .
To define multiplication as repeated addition is to make multiplication a sub-species of addition .
It is as if there were two types of addition : regular , random , “ wild ” addition and the specially - bred variety of addition to which we give the name multiplication .
Is that really how we want our students to think ?
Multiplication is not a mere sub-species of addition .
Multiplication is its own animal , an independent operation .
The operation of addition has its identity element .
The operation of multiplication has its identity element .
And they are not the same .
Every number has its own additive inverse .
Each number has a multiplicative inverse , too .
And they are not the same .
Addition has its inverse operation , subtraction .
Multiplication has its inverse operation , division .
And they are not the same , because the operations are not the same .
[ Sidetrack : Oops !
I forgot that zero does not have a multiplicative inverse .
Jonathan pointed out my mistake . ]
[ Another side note : I find it interesting that repeated subtraction can be a useful tool in solving some division problems , just as repeated addition can be a useful tool in understanding multiplication .
Subtraction plays an important role in the algorithm for long division .
I suppose someone will argue that this is evidence multiplication is repeated addition after all . ]
Dimensional Reasoning
Dimensional analysis means looking at the dimensions ( units of measurement ) of a quantity to help you solve a science or engineering problem .
Addition requires identical units .
The sum must always have the same units as the addends :
2 apples + 3 apples = 5 apples
2 apples + 3 oranges = ??
What does that second equation give you ?
Fruit salad ?
In order to add quantities with unlike units , we need to find a common denominator .
Apples and oranges are both pieces of fruit , so …
2 apples + 3 oranges =
2 pieces of fruit + 3 pieces of fruit = 5 pieces of fruit
Multiplication requires different units .
The product does not have the same units as either the multiplier or the multiplicand .
2 baskets × 3 apples per basket = 6 apples
How can we make multiplication come out the same as repeated addition ?
The only way to do it is to change the units .
3 cm + 3 cm = 6 cm
But …
2 cm × 3 cm = 6 cm2
We need …
2 lengths × 3 cm per length = 6 cm
We do not normally think about dimensional analysis when we work with plain numbers in math class .
But the fact remains that multiplication changes things in a way that addition does not .
Addition is one - dimensional , but multiplication is multi-dimensional .
This is why the rules for fraction addition and fraction multiplication are so different .
When you add positive rational numbers , you always get a sum that is bigger than either addend .
But when you multiply rational numbers , all bets are off — the product may be bigger , smaller , or somewhere in between the numbers .
Language Does Matter
Addition : addend + addend = sum .
The addends are interchangeable .
This is represented by the fact that they have the same name .
Multiplication : multiplier × multiplicand = product .
The multiplier and multiplicand have different names , even though many of us have trouble remembering which is which .
multiplier = “ how many or how much ”
= “ how many or how much ” multiplicand = the size of the “ unit ” or “ group ”
Different names indicate a difference in function .
The multiplier and the multiplicand are not conceptually interchangeable .
It is true that multiplication is commutative , but ( 2 rows × 3 chairs / row ) is not the same as ( 3 rows × 2 chairs / row ) , even though both sets contain 6 chairs .
A New Type of Number
In multiplication , we introduce a totally new type of number : the multiplicand .
A strange , new concept sits at the heart of multiplication , something students have never seen before .
The multiplicand is a this - per - that ratio .
A ratio is a not a counting number , but something new , much more abstract than anything the students have seen up to this point .
A ratio is a relationship number .
In addition and subtraction , numbers count how much stuff you have .
If you get more stuff , the numbers get bigger .
If you lose some of the stuff , the numbers get smaller .
Numbers measure the amount of cookies , horses , dollars , gasoline , or whatever .
The multiplicand does n’t count the number of dollars or measure the volume of gasoline .
It tells the relationship between them , the dollars per gallon , which stays the same whether you buy a lot or a little .
By telling our students that “ multiplication is repeated addition , ” we dismiss the importance of the multiplicand .
But until our students wrestle with and come to understand the concept of ratio , they can never understand multiplication .
How Then Shall We Teach ?
If we accept this argument , if we agree to no longer define basic multiplication as repeated addition , then what ?
How does that affect the way we teach ?
Mainly , we need to change our focus from how to why .
We can teach multiplication in much the same way that we do now , using manipulatives arranged in groups or rows , pictures of multiplication situations , and rectangular arrays of dots or blocks .
But instead of drawing our student ’s attention to the process of adding up the answer , we want to focus on the fact that the items are arranged in equal sized groups .
In other words , we teach our students to recognize the multiplicand :
Teach children the useful word “ per ” and how to recognize a “ this per that ” unit .
Have them label the quantities in their workbook : 3 cookies per student , 5 flowers per vase , 1 eye per alien , or whatever .
If we need a simple , elementary - level catchphrase to replace “ multiplication is repeated addition , ” how about this ?
Multiplication is counting by this - per - that groups .
As with any such phrase , this statement fails to capture all that multiplication entails .
The definition will have to be expanded as students learn about rational numbers .
“ Oh , look !
We can count just part of a group , and we can measure with a unit that is not a whole number . ”
Our students will someday have to learn about real numbers , complex numbers , and matrix multiplication .
Even so , the phrase captures an important aspect of many multiplication situations our students will meet in K - 12 : that there is a multiplicand , some “ this per that ” quantity .
This approach should be especially helpful to those frustrating students — you know , the ones with the blank stare — who read a word problem and then ask , “ Do I add or multiply ? ”
A Useful Tool
Completing the circle , I come back to the point of my first “ repeated addition ” post .
I would like you to consider the teaching power of bar model diagrams to represent arithmetic operations .
These diagrams are used in the Singapore Primary Math books , and according to one commenter they are popular in Russia and Australia .
They are even beginning to show up in newer American textbooks , where they are sometimes called “ tape diagrams . ”
Here are some advantages of the bar diagram model :
Bar diagrams chunkify the number line and make number relationships less abstract .
They provide elementary students with a pictorial algebra that can help them think through complicated word problems .
It is easy for students to see the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction , or between multiplication and division .
Because they are based on the number line , the diagrams extend naturally to rational and real numbers , growing in application with your students ’ growing understanding .
Addition is “ this AND that ” : putting two ( or more ) amounts together .
This is the basic addition / subtraction diagram :
Multiplication is “ how many or how much OF the unit ” : measuring or counting parts of a given size .
Here is the diagram for multiplication / division :
To learn more about modeling arithmetic problems with bar diagrams , check out the Mad Scientist ’s Ray Gun model of multiplication :
And here is an example of the multiplication bar diagram in action :
OK , Now It ’s Your Turn
I ’ve talked long enough .
What do you think :
Is there really a difference between multiplication and repeated addition , or am I tilting at windmills here ?
Is it even necessary for teachers to define multiplication ?
Or is the teacher ’s job to provide plenty of examples of multiplication in action ?
Should we let the students intuit their own definition (s ) ?
Will it help students if we change our focus from “ how to get the answer ” and teach them to identify the multiplicand , the “ this per that ” unit ?
Or will that introduce new difficulties I have n’t considered ?
Or do we already teach this way , only in different words ?
If you are an elementary teacher , how do you teach multiplication to your students ?
Are some students clueless because , no matter how we explain it , they just do n’t pay attention ?
Have you tried using bar diagrams to model elementary arithmetic situations ?
And if so , how did your students respond ?

Ever since John McCain apparently ran out of ' get out of gaffe free ' cards and was actually held to account for having more homes than he could keep track of , it has this blogger wondering if the traditional media might finally be ready to fairly report the facts and not the myths about our candidates .
If so , CNN 's dual " Revealed " episodes on both candidates the other night was a fair start in that direction .
Besides actually asking McCain about his role in the Keating 5 scandal , they also confronted him about his multiple extramarital affairs .
Watch it :
Download Download
John Cole ties the affair , McCain 's housing crisis , and what has been the media 's Orwellian framing of elitism in this campaign all together and sums it up neatly :
Just so we are clear - visiting your grandmother while vacationing in Hawaii , the state where you were you were born - elitist .
Meeting the millionaire heiress daughter ( who you will soon begin an affair with and divorce your first wife and then go on and buy a ton of houses ) in Hawaii and then going on and honeymooning in Hawaii – not elitist .
Yes , McCain 's affairs and charges of corruption in the Keating affair are old news to the villagers , but it 's been so ignored and glossed over for so long by McCain 's media that many voters today across the country have no idea about any of it .
All we 've been told for years now about McCain is that he 's a maverick and a war hero , and yet we 've been inundated with every scrap of negative reporting on Obama that could be dug up , no matter how tangential or untrue .
Given the fact that the McCain campaign is now claiming that everything is " fair game " and vowing to rehash all of the tired old dirt on Obama brought up over and over for months during the primaries , it 's past time the voters this cycle get a full accounting of both candidates ' good , bad and ugly , so long as it's the truth .
Which brings me back to the affairs .
A few months ago , when Mike Stark asked John McCain point blank if he had ever cheated on his current wife Cindy , McCain refused to answer .
If McCain has never cheated on Cindy ( say , with Vicki Iseman , for example ) , as he most certainly did with his first wife , Carol , why would n't he just answer with some straight talk ?
As Stark pointed out , " McCain surrogates furiously denounced the story , but oddly , John McCain never brought it up , " and the traditional media collectively gave McCain a pass .
Given his history , is a little follow up on that really too much to ask ?
And since the McCain camp is calling everything fair game , Jed has a few more questions , in the interest of fairness , that likewise deserve reporting on :
If McCain wants to play this game , he should explain why he asked convicted felon G. Gordon Liddy -- who has advocated killing federal agents and said Adolf Hitler gave him strength -- to host a fundraiser for him in 1998 .
McCain should also explain why he repeatedly voted against federal legislation banning domestic terrorism against patients , doctors , and staff of abortion and women 's health clinics .
What else should we know more about McCain that we already would if it were about Obama ?
Would you sign a contract that says , " Any term can be changed at any time for any reason , including no reason " ?
Anyone who uses a credit card already has .
Such are the absurd terms of the consumer credit - card industry , which is poised to be the next big crisis ( after housing ) that banks have aided and abetted in US households .
Americans have now racked up nearly $ 1 trillion in credit - card debt .
As housing equity shrinks and costs rise , agencies such as Moody 's report swelling numbers of accounts with balances three or more payments past due .
Reinforced by abusive industry practices , the plastic safety net is becoming a permanent cage .
But here 's the good news :
If you 've ever been steamed by surprise fees on your credit - card statement or had your interest rate cranked up without warning , the Federal Reserve Board wants to help you .
The Fed ?
That oracular secret society whose chairmen say Yoda - like things about interest rates ?
Well , actually , yes .
Ever since its remarkable " oversight " of junk lending led to the mortgage melt - down , the Fed seems determined not to let credit - card defaults drive the American banking system any closer to Third World standards .
There 's plenty to reform .
During the housing bubble , credit - card vendors inflated interest rates – even as the Fed slashed them – and found increasingly sneaky ways to usher their customers into perpetually indebted servitude .
Such as :
• Raising rates as high as 32 percent on existing balances , with no notice , even when they 've always been paid on time .
• Compressing the time between statement mailings and due dates .
• Charging interest on debt already repaid .
• Posting on - time payments after their due date – and then charging late fees .
• Neglecting to disclose how much interest and time it will take to pay off a balance with minimum payments ( if ever ) .
Banks in the card game are raising rates and fees to limit their losses on mortgage loans they made .
This is doubly ironic , since their delusional lending and exotic mortgage cocktails gave the housing bubble its irrational effervescence to begin with .
So now millions of American households are being dragged under even further .
This year , card companies will break all records for late fees , over - limit charges , and other penalties , pulling in more than $ 19 billion .
Not to mention extra charges for paying by mail or by phone ( try $ 14.99 ) .
Credit card is the only industry where customers pay extra to be allowed to pay .
Where agreements can be changed without notice .
Where nearly half of industry revenues come from penalty fees .
You can't just dismiss these predatory practices as a tax on stupidity .
Borrower beware ?
A quaint notion , when bankers play misleading and retroactively abusive games with other people 's lives .
Competition ?
Five card vendors control nearly 80 percent of the market .
State regulation ?
Enforcement has been rendered toothless .
Recourse to the courts ?
This industry , given mandatory binding arbitration , is shielded from any class action .
Meanwhile , the average mailbox is stuffed with 24 credit card offers each year .
I 'm looking at one from First Premier Bank , at an attractive 9.9 percent rate , whose fine print cost in first year fees and interest is $ 256 .
For a $ 250 credit line .
Provided I pay on time .
Enter the Fed. Randall Kroszner , a Chicago economist hotly averse to regulation , is pushing to regulate the most misleading and predatory practices .
The card vendors will tie this up in court , in an endless argument about jurisdiction .
That 's why legislation is needed , to make new rules stick – and why every e-mail or phone call to Congress will be another good reason to fix this .
Rep. Carolyn Maloney ( D ) of New York recently got the House lined up for a floor vote .
Similar bills have floated and died before .
The Senate " may " hold hearings in September .
Got debt ?
Before you get your next statement – or right now , if you 're online – contact your senator at www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm and share your own credit - card horror story .
If you want the card companies to play fair , your senator needs to hear from you .
Banks should manage risk by reflecting it in their rates and credit limits up front – not through the back door , with sneaky fees and phantom interest rates .
It 's time for card vendors to let consumers work down debt , on terms that make it possible to do so .

GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE , Cuba , July 22 ( Reuters ) - Osama bin Laden 's driver knew the target of the fourth hijacked jetliner in the Sept. 11 attacks , a prosecutor said on Tuesday in an attempt to draw a link between Salim Hamdan and the al Qaeda leadership in the first Guantanamo war crimes trial .
Hamdan 's lawyer said in opening statements that the Yemeni , held for nearly seven years before his trial , was just a paid employee of the fugitive al Qaeda leader , a driver in the motor pool who never joined the militant group or plotted attacks on America .
But prosecutor Timothy Stone told the six - member jury of U.S. military officers who will decide Hamdan 's guilt or innocence that Hamdan had inside knowledge of the 2001 attacks on the United States because he overheard a conversation between bin Laden and his deputy , Ayman al - Zawahiri .
" If they had n't shot down the fourth plane it would 've hit the dome , " Stone , a Navy officer , said in his opening remarks , repeating Bin Laden 's deputy 's claim .
The tribunal 's chief prosecutor , Col. Lawrence Morris , later explained that Stone was quoting Hamdan in evidence that will be presented at trial .
Morris declined to say if the " dome " was a reference to the U.S. Capitol .
" Virtually no one knew the intended target , but the accused knew , " Stone said .
Latest News : CBS scrubs McCain 9/11 gaffe from broadcast .
United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in a field in rural Pennsylvania .
U.S. officials have never stated it was shot down although rumors saying that abound to this day .
Hamdan , a father of two with a fourth - grade education , is charged with conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism in the first U.S. war crimes trial since World War Two .
He could face life in prison if convicted .
Prosecutors say Hamdan had access to al Qaeda 's inner circle .
Stone told the jury that Hamdan earned the trust of bin Laden and helped him flee after attacks on U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998 and the Sept. 11 attacks .
" He served as bodyguard , driver , transported and delivered weapons , ammunition and supplies to al Qaeda , " Stone said .
Hamdan was being tried in a hilltop courthouse at the U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo Bay , which has been a lightning rod for criticism of the United States since early 2002 , when it began housing a prison camp to hold alleged Taliban and al Qaeda fighters from the battlefields of Afghanistan .
The war crimes tribunal system has been criticized by human rights groups and defense lawyers , some of them U.S. military officers .
Detainees have been held for years without charges .
Washington has declared them unlawful enemy combatants not entitled to the rights afforded formal prisoners of war .
Responding to the widespread criticism , Morris , the chief prosecutor , said on Tuesday : " In my opinion they are seeing the most just war crimes trial that anyone has ever seen . "
WORKED FOR WAGES Defense lawyer Harry Schneider described Hamdan as a poor Yemeni who lost his parents at a young age and lived on the streets , where he developed a knack for fixing cars .
" The evidence is that he worked for wages .
He did n't wage attacks on America , " he said .
" He had a job because he had to earn a living , not because he had a jihad against America . "
" There will be no evidence that Mr. Hamdan espoused or believed or embraced any form of what you will hear about , radical Islam beliefs , extremist Muslim beliefs , " he said .
The first two prosecution witnesses were U.S. military officers who were in Afghanistan during the early days of the U.S. invasion in 2001 .
Both addressed a key issue at trial -- whether Hamdan had surface - to - air missiles when he was captured at a checkpoint near Takhteh Pol in November 2001 .
Defense lawyers dispute the prosecution 's contention that Hamdan had the weapons .
But a U.S. officer identified only as " Sergeant Major A " said the missiles were found in the " trunk of a car driven by Mr. Hamdan . "
He said troops also found a mortar manual with " al Qaeda " on the front , a book by bin Laden and a card issued to al Qaeda fighters and signed by Mullah Omar , the Taliban commander .
Ali Soufan , an al Qaeda expert with the FBI , took the jury through a long description of al Qaeda 's hierarchy and called bin Laden " the emir , the prince . "
He said Hamdan was part of bin Laden 's security detail .
" The people who are around bin Laden have to be trusted ... true believers in the cause , " he said .

Enter string in the table of ``interned '' strings and return the interned string - which is string itself or a copy .
Interning strings is useful to gain a little performance on dictionary lookup - if the keys in a dictionary are interned , and the lookup key is interned , the key comparisons ( after hashing ) can be done by a pointer compare instead of a string compare .
Normally , the names used in Python programs are automatically interned , and the dictionaries used to hold module , class or instance attributes have interned keys .
Changed in version 2.3 : Interned strings are not immortal ( like they used to be in Python 2.2 and before ) ; you must keep a reference to the return value of intern ( ) around to benefit from it .

I 'm working with a lot of data , and running out of memory is a problem .
When I read a line of data , I 've often seen the same data before .
Rather than have two pointers that point to two separate copies of " foo " , I 'd prefer to have two pointers that point to the same copy of " foo " .
This makes a lot of sense in Python since strings are immutable anyway .
I knew that this was called the flyweight design pattern , but I did n't know if it was already implemented somewhere in Python .
( Strictly speaking , I thought it was called the " flywheel " design pattern , and my buddy Drew Perttula corrected me . )
My first attempt was to write code like :
This code looks up the word " foo " and returns the sameevery time .
Notice , it works .
However , Monte Davidoff pointed out that this is what the intern builtin is for .
From the docs :
Here it is in action :
Well did it work ?
My program still functions , but I did n't get a tremendous savings in memory .
It turns out that I do n't have enough dups , and that 's not where I 'm spending all my memory anyway .
Oh well , at least I learned about the intern ( ) function .
Dems badger McCain on money
The Democratic National Committee on Saturday called for Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) to return money raised for his campaign by controversial Texas Republican Clayton “ Claytie ” Williams Jr .
ABC News reported Friday night that the McCain campaign canceled a Monday fundraiser at Williams ’ home after the campaign was reminded of a comment he made that drew fire when he ran unsuccessfully for Texas governor in 1990 against the late Ann Richards .

A reporter overheard Williams comparing rape to weather : “ As long as it 's inevitable , you might as well lie back and enjoy it . ”
The McCain campaign has not said what it will do with money Williams has already raised for the campaign .
Williams told the Midland Reporter - Telegram in Texas that he has raised more than $ 300,000 for the campaign .
Democratic National Committee Communications Director Karen
Finney says in a release going out Saturday : " John McCain should make it clear that he understands just how offensive these comments are by not only canceling a fundraising event but also returning the money Williams raised for his campaign .
Senator McCain should know that you cannot expect the American people to trust you if you say one thing when you stand on the stump and turn a blind eye to this kind of language when you think no one will notice . "
Most video games can be likened to a theme park .
The fun , like a roller coaster ’s , has been entirely created by a team of professionals , and the players then progress through each loop , each dip , each turn in a way that has been meticulously designed to produce a specific effect .
Books and films tell stories in a similar way .
Eve Online is more like a sandbox , where the players have been thrown in with a bunch of tools , like shovels and buckets , and are left to their own devices to create what they will .
In Eve ’s futuristic setting , miners extract ore from asteroids and refine it into minerals .
Industrialists run huge factories to turn the minerals into spaceships , weapons and modules .
Financiers provide investment capital , and traders take products to market .
Finally , pilots buy the ships and fly them in combat , carving out player - controlled empires among the thousands of solar systems in the Eve galaxy .
Players can enjoy
Eve in any of those roles , a diversity of experiences unmatched in any other game .
But the most glamorous aspect of the game is participating in the epic wars for territory that can go on for months or years , involving tens of thousands of players .
( Unlike those of most games , all of Eve ’s more than 200,000 players are in one shared game universe , rather than split up among different copies of the virtual world ; on weekends there can be 35,000 players or more online at once . )
For at least two years , the dominant conflict in the game has been between two alliances known as Band of Brothers and Goonswarm .
Band of Brothers , known as BOB , is a wealthy , elite ( some would say elitist ) group that many players simultaneously admire , fear and despise .
Goonswarm is a proudly profane group that conducts highly effective psychological warfare alongside its military campaigns .
Like the members of BOB , Goons are also simultaneously admired , feared and despised by many Eve players .
In a famous 1979 television interview , Democratic presidential contender Ted Kennedy flubbed a softball question : " Why do you want to be president ? " Mr. Kennedy 's sputtering answer did real damage to his campaign .
At the recent Saddleback Civil Forum on the Presidency , Senators Obama and McCain gave more coherent answers when Pastor Rick Warren asked the same question .
But in an America with a saner perspective on the presidency , their answers would have been disqualifying as well .
What moved Barack Obama to seek the presidency was " the basic idea of empathy " and the notion that if " we see somebody down and out ... we care for them . "
Republican John McCain explained that he was running " to inspire a generation of Americans to serve a cause greater than their self - interest . "
Noble sentiments , to be sure , but in the original constitutional scheme , the president was neither Empath - in - Chief nor a national life coach .
His role was to faithfully execute the laws , defend the country from attack , and check Congress with the veto power whenever it exceeded its constitutional bounds .
What we expect the president to do
But there 's a reason candidates talk the way they do .
Their rhetoric faithfully reflects the public 's outsized expectations for the office : Grow the economy .
Give us better , cheaper healthcare .
Protect us from hurricanes .
Stop global warming .
Bring peace to the Middle East .
Lead us .
Inspire us .
We crave a spiritual superhero , not just someone who will " preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution . "
As the conventions celebrate the anointed , it 's worth exploring how our long slide away from the Founding Fathers ' modest notion of presidential responsibility has left us with a dysfunctional politics and a bloated imperial presidency .
The McCain campaign has found its groove lately by skewering Mr. Obama 's quasi-messianic pretensions .
A recent McCain campaign ad , mockingly titled " The One , " mixes clips of Obama speeches with Charlton Heston as Moses , parting the waters .
" And the world shall receive [ Obama 's ] blessings , " the narrator intones .
It 's an effective ad , playing on the grating arrogance that periodically emerges from the Obama campaign .
As Michele Obama said in February 2008 : " Barack Obama is the only person in this race who understands that , that before we can work on the problems , we have to fix our souls .
Our souls are broken in this nation . "
But make no mistake : Both parties view the president as our national guardian and redeemer , a figure entrusted with the care of America 's very soul .
It 's a theme that President Bush has sounded repeatedly .
And it 's practically de rigueur for GOP presidential contenders .
When Mike Huckabee announced his candidacy in January 2007 , he said he was running because " America needs positive , optimistic leadership to kind of turn this country around , to see a revival of our national soul… . "
Mr. McCain , too , sees the president as a soul - healer .
His hero , Teddy Roosevelt , was a great president , McCain insists , because he " liberally interpreted the constitutional authority of the office , " and " nourished the soul of a great nation . "
If soul - nourishing is part of the president 's job , what is n't ?
That grandiose conception of the president 's role could n't be further from how our Founding Fathers saw the office .
As The Federalist No. 69 tells us , the Constitution 's chief executive officer had an important job , but he'd have " no particle of spiritual jurisdiction . "
Instead , as presidential scholar Jeffrey K. Tulis explains , unlike " polities that attempt to shape the souls of their citizenry and foster certain excellences or moral qualities by penetrating deeply into the ' private ' sphere , the founders wanted their government to be limited to establishing and securing such a sphere . "
The men who designed our Constitution never thought of the president as America 's " national leader . "
Indeed , for them , the very notion of " national leadership " raised the possibility of authoritarian rule by a demagogue who would create an atmosphere of crisis in order to enhance his power .
Hard as it may be to imagine in the midst of a modern campaign season , the Framers wholly rejected the notion of the " bully pulpit . "
Presidents were to be seen more than heard , which is why our first seven presidents averaged a little over three public speeches a year .
Nor did early presidents follow the modern practice of referring to themselves as the " commander in chief , " as if all America was a vast army directed by a supreme military leader .
When George Washington referred to the office he held , most often it was with the humble term " chief magistrate . "
Alas , humility is hard to discern on the modern campaign trail .
If our presidential candidates seem to embrace an exalted notion of their status , perhaps that 's a function of the adulation they 're greeted with by the crowds at campaign appearances .
A recent feature in The New York Times described the prevailing atmosphere : " Look at the faces – not of the candidates , but of the rope - liners themselves , with arms and fingers extended , their eyes bugged and sometimes tearful . "
" I got to smell him , and it was awesome , " exclaimed Kate Homrich , who managed to get close to Obama at one campaign rally .
Another , Bonnie Owens , got a finger - pinch from the Illinois senator : " Best experience of my life , " she declared .
And it 's not just voters at campaign rallies who fall prey to presidential idolatry .
If anything , American political elites – pundits , talking heads , and presidential scholars – are worse .
When President Bush traveled to Blacksburg , Va. to offer comfort after the April 2007 shooting rampage at Virginia Tech , David Gergen , adviser to one Democratic and three Republican presidents , commented , " At times like this , [ the president ] takes off his cap as commander in chief and puts on the robes of consoler in chief . "
Leon Panetta , former chief of staff to President Clinton , went even further : " In many ways , [ the president ] is our national chaplain . "
Arthur Schlesinger Jr. , author , ironically enough , of " The Imperial Presidency , " captured the modern , bipartisan consensus in the introduction to his 1996 presidential ranking survey , maintaining that a great president needed to " have a deep connection with the needs , anxieties , dreams of the people . "
Of course , the ability to channel the collective spirit of the American public is n't a skill that the chief magistrate needs to faithfully execute the laws or defend the country from foreign attacks .
But that boundless view of presidential responsibility has helped lead to dramatically enhanced presidential power .
Some might counter , though , that all this " soul talk " is mere rhetoric .
After all , it 's not as though any president , concerned about spiritual " malaise , " has appointed a " national - soul czar , " charged with reforming the American spirit through the coercive power of government .
Terrible consequences
But ideas have consequences , and few ideas have had worse ones than the belief that Americans need grand federal crusades to pull them away from private , parochial concerns and invest their lives with meaning .
As David Brooks wrote in a 1997 essay in The Weekly Standard , " … ultimately , American purpose can find its voice only in Washington … .
Without vigorous national vision , we are plagued by anxiety and disquiet . "
That helps explain why Washington does n't just attempt to solve problems ; it launches wars – on drugs , poverty , terror , disease .
Noble aims all , but the destructive cost of these wars is mind - boggling .
When he boosted drug war funding in December 2001 , Bush declared that " when we fight against drugs , we fight for the souls of our fellow Americans . "
As a result of that fight , nearly half a million Americans are currently behind bars for drug offenses , and America has a per-capita prison population that dwarfs China 's and Iran's .
The notion of president - as - spiritual - warrior has aided dangerous excesses in the war on terror .
The week after 9/11 , Bush announced that we would not only answer the attacks , we would also " rid the world of evil . "
A mission that vast demanded equally vast powers – powers that the public was all too willing to grant in the post - 9 - 11 crisis atmosphere .
An increasing number of Americans worry that the presidency has grown too big , too powerful , and too menacing .
Yet we also want the government – chiefly , the president – to " do more . "
And when terror strikes , hurricanes ravage , homes foreclose , the stock market drops , and food prices rise , we inevitably blame one person : the president .
Investing our lives with hope , uniting us all behind a higher calling , fixing our " broken " souls – none of this is remotely the president 's business .
It 's not surprising that presidential contenders cater to our contradictory expectations .
That 's the business they 're in .
But if we 're unhappy with the results , we ought to recall the wisdom contained in the Pogo Principle : " we have met the enemy and he is us . "
So long as we embrace – or even tolerate – the idea that the president is the guardian of our national soul , we have little right to complain about our burgeoning Imperial Presidency .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy on Wednesday made his first appearance in Congress since being diagnosed with brain cancer nearly two months ago , casting a single vote to help break a Republican filibuster of an important Medicare bill .
Colleagues greeted Kennedy with a lengthy standing ovation on the Senate floor just after 4:15 p.m .
The bill would reverse a 10.6 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors .
The cuts in Medicare payments -- part of a scheduled cost - saving formula -- went into effect July 1 , although the Bush administration said it will hold off processing claims until mid-July to give Congress time to reach a compromise .
In a written statement , Kennedy said , " I return to the Senate today to keep a promise to our senior citizens -- and that 's to protect Medicare .
Win , lose or draw , I wanted to be here .
I was n't going to take the chance that my vote could make the difference . "
Watch the senators applaud Kennedy 's arrival »
A vote on the bill before the July 4 recess fell one shy of the 60 needed to clear a Republican filibuster and advance in the Senate .
Senate Republicans joined the White House in objecting to the Democratic - backed bill because it trimmed government support for private insurance programs that provide coverage to Medicare patients .
The private Medicare programs are a top policy initiative for Republicans .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto says the president 's senior advisers would still advise the president to veto the bill in its current form .
The vote to end the GOP filibuster on the Medicare bill was 69 - 30 , nine more than the 60 votes needed and two more than needed to override a presidential veto .
The senators agreed to consider the bill passed if the filibuster were broken .
Kennedy had surgery to remove a tumor June 2 and is now undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid talked to Kennedy 's wife , Vicki , twice since Sunday about having Kennedy return for the vote , the source said .
Reid " was not pushing , just asking , " the source said .

Kennedy is chairman of the Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee and is an influential Democrat on health - care issues .
Some members of the Democratic leadership thought it would be a " great idea " if Kennedy were able to return because it would " buck up " Democratic senators who worked hard to pass the stalled bill , the source said .

( CNN ) -- Former Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic , accused of masterminding " ethnic cleansing " deportations and killings of Bosnian Muslims and Croats , has been arrested after more than a decade in hiding , a U.N. war crimes tribunal said Monday .
Radovan Karadzic , shown here in 1995 , is charged with war crimes relating to the 1992-1995 Bosnia conflict .
Karadzic , 63 , is charged with genocide , crimes against humanity and violations of the law of war .
Last seen in public in 1996 , Karadzic was the Bosnian Serb political leader during the 1992-1995 war that followed Bosnia - Herzegovina 's secession from Yugoslavia .
The conflict included the Srebrenica massacre of thousands of Bosnian Muslims and a deadly , 44 - month siege of Sarajevo .
Former U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke blamed Karadzic for all the deaths in the three - year war in Bosnia , which had the bloodiest of the Balkan conflicts that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia .
" Without Radovan Karadzic , this thing would n't have happened , " Holbrooke told CNN .
Watch CNN 's Christiane Amanpour explain Karadzic 's rise and fall »
Early estimates of the death toll from the three - year war ranged up to 300,000 , but recent research concluded about 100,000 were killed .
Vladimir Petrovic , the charge d'affairs at the Serbian Embassy in Washington , said his government 's security forces made the arrest , but said no further details had been released .
" I think this is an example that the Serbian government is committed to all its international obligations and that it will continue cooperation with the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , " Petrovic said .
Serge Brammertz , the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , congratulated Serbian authorities for taking Karadzic into custody and called it " an important day for the victims . "
" It is also an important day for international justice , because it clearly demonstrates that nobody is beyond the reach of the law and that sooner or later all fugitives will be brought to justice , " Brammertz said .
He said authorities " in due course " will determine when Karadzic is to be transferred to the tribunal at The Hague .
Karadzic 's arrest leaves former Gen. Ratko Mladic , the Bosnian Serb military commander , as the top - ranking war crimes suspect still at large .
" While this is an important milestone , the work of the International Tribunal will not be complete until all fugitives have been arrested and tried , " a spokesman for U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-Moon said .
News of Karadzic 's arrest was greeted with jubilation in the streets of Sarajevo , the Bosnian capital , which Bosnian Serb forces had shelled heavily during the war .
" Today , I can tell you that I feel kind of good , " said Zlatko Lagumdzija , a former Bosnian prime minister wounded during the siege .
He said the arrest could offer " a chance for new thinking " in Bosnia , still grappling with the scars of war .
" Today it looks like a new wind is moving from Belgrade , " he said .
" And I hope it will be a signal to Bosnian authorities that the state has to be set in order to deliver what the state is supposed to deliver : peace and justice . "
Karadzic , a one - time psychiatrist and self - styled poet , declared himself president of a Bosnian Serb republic when Bosnia - Herzegovina seceded from Yugoslavia in 1992 .
The Bosnian Serbs , backed by the Serb - dominated Yugoslav military and paramilitary forces , quickly seized control of most of the country and laid siege to Sarajevo , the capital .
During the conflict that followed , the Serb forces launched what they called the " ethnic cleansing " of the territories under their control -- the forced displacement and killings of Muslims and Croats .
Among the crimes Karadzic is accused of overseeing is the massacre at Srebrenica , a U.N. " safe area " overrun by Serb troops in July 1995 .
Nearly 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed at Srebrenica , the worst European massacre since World War II .
During the siege of Sarajevo , " shelling and sniping killed and wounded thousands of civilians of both sexes and all ages , including children and the elderly , " according to the U.N. tribunal 's indictment of Karadzic .
He was removed from power in 1995 , when the Dayton Accords that ended the Bosnian war barred anyone accused of war crimes from holding office .
But he remained " kind of a Robin Hood " to Serbs during more than a decade as a fugitive , said Holbrooke , one of the architects of the Dayton Accords .
Serbia 's government has been under increasing pressure to arrest war crimes suspects such as Karadzic and Mladic -- who were believed to be in hiding in Serbia rather than Bosnia .
The European Union warned in December that any steps toward allowing Serbia into the organization would depend on its cooperation with the war crimes tribunal .

Pesticide for SE Texas ' crazy ' ants approved by EPA
Help may be on the way for Houston - area residents driven to wits ' end by the relentless attack of crazy Rasberry ants , which have caused damage estimated at $ 30 million in Harris and six other Southeast Texas counties .
Acting on a request by the Texas Department of Agriculture , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday approved a crisis exemption for use of fipronil ( Termidor SC ) on crazy ant infestations .
The crisis exemption is in effect until the EPA rules on the state 's request for a specific exemption so the pesticide could be used for three years .
Crazy Rasberry ants , called " crazy " because of their zigzag march and named after Tom Rasberry , the Pasadena exterminator who discovered them in 2002 , now infest Harris , Brazoria , Galveston , Jefferson , Liberty , Montgomery and Wharton counties .
The rice - grain - size ants , which can bite but not sting , have a penchant for infesting electrical devices and have been blamed for the failure of computers , sewage pumps and electric gate motors .
Agriculture spokesman Bryan Black said only licensed exterminators can apply the liquid pesticide , which kills by short - circuiting the insect 's central nervous system and is approved for treating termite infestations .
Jason Meyers , a Texas A&M University doctoral candidate who is considered an expert on the ants , said the poison likely will be an effective management tool of the pests but " not an end - all . "
" It should be useful for individual homeowners , " he said , " but it 's not going to eradicate the ants from any area .
Not by any means . "
Some studies have shown the poison can wipe out 95 percent of specific insect populations in three days .
The EPA considers fipronil moderately toxic and a possible human carcinogen .

Bolstered by falling oil prices and a rising dollar , US stocks could extend their modest gains next week , even in the face of still troubling consumer - and housing - related data .
Wall Street could extend gains next week if financial results from market bellwethers and data suggest the U.S economic slowdown is n’t as dire as once feared .
A slide in energy prices is a welcome boost in an economy hamstrung by the housing slump and mounting mortgage losses in the financial services sector .
In the near term , consumers and business should feel some respite as energy costs recede , boosting prospects for a range of market constituents , including airlines , retail , industrial and technology sectors .
Oil ’s downward trend helped boost consumer spending slightly in the past month , with crude hitting a three - month low below $ 114 a barrel on Friday .
But its path remains volatile , prompting some investors to remain cautious about the market .
The dollar ’s recent jump suggests to some that the health of the US economy could improve .
The US economy began weakening before others and now that investors are seeing poor economic data from Europe and Asia , some think the United States is closer to a recovery than others .
“ For the past two years , crude has followed the dollar almost lock - step . ”
“ The strength we ’ve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down .
At this point , as you move backward , it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy . ”

That said , news on the consumer cannot be ignored .
Although petrol prices have fallen since last month , consumer spending – which accounts for two - thirds of the US economy – continues to falter .
Next week , investors will get further data after quarterly earnings from retail giant Target , home improvement retailers Home Depot and Lowe ’s Companies , and tech bellwether Hewlett - Packard .
This comes after J C Penney , Wal - Mart Stores , Nordstrom and Macy ’s posted earnings this week that exceeded analysts ’ estimates , but issued cautious forecasts for the second half of the year amid concerns on slow consumer spending .
New data on the Producer Price Index , housing starts and manufacturing will also be released next week .
But the price of oil and the value of the dollar are more likely to sway investors , analysts said , because the data is based on oil and commodity prices last month , which were markedly higher .
Investors are also still wary of the rally in financial stocks in the past week , as analysts emphasise that the fallout from the credit crisis is far from over .
Thin trading volume indicates that there is still widespread concern about the US economy ’s health , especially following a $ 1.5 billion write - off from JPMorgan Chase and Company .
Two economic reports on housing are expected next week .
Tomorrow , the National Association of Home Builders will release its Housing Market Index for the month .
On Tuesday , the government releases last month ’s housing starts .
Analysts expect the government data to show housing starts slipped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 960,000 units , slightly below June ’s seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.066 million units .
Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on Thursday could be an important indicator of consumer spending in the year ’s second half .
But the focus next week will be on oil and the dollar .
Oil prices fell below $ 114 a barrel on Friday , down from $ 115.20 a week ago on growing concerns about demand in industrial nations and the stronger dollar .
Equally important , crude has fallen sharply since reaching an all - time high of $ 147.27 a barrel on July 11 as growing global economic problems and high fuel prices have cut demand in the US and Europe .
On Friday , the front - month US crude oil futures contract fell $ 1.24 to settle at $ 113.77 a barrel – down 23 per cent from last month ’s record on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
But investors are keeping a wary eye on the continued fighting between Russia and Georgia .
Russian armed forces have occupied parts of Georgia since repelling a Georgian attack last week on the tiny pro-Russian separatist territory of South Ossetia , which in the 1990s threw off control of Tbilisi , the capital of Georgia .
Any geopolitical developments , whether it be the Iranian situation or further developments with Russia and Georgia , will influence oil markets .
Xeros Ltd's washing machine uses less than 2 percent of the water and energy of a conventional machine .
A new washing machine that uses just a cup of water , a pinch of detergent , and about 1,000 small plastic chips to clean clothes may be available for consumers in the UK next year .
Researchers at Leeds University designed the machine , which will be marketed by a spin - off company called Xeros Ltd ( which means " dry " in Greek ) .
Company founder Stephen Burkinshaw , a professor of textile chemistry , explains that the machine will reduce both water and energy consumption .
Currently , washing machine use accounts for 13 percent of daily household water consumption in the UK , or about 21 liters ( 5.5 gallons ) of water per day , according to the UK organization Waterwise .
Besides saving water , the Xeros machine uses just 2 % of the energy of a conventional washing machine .
And since clothes come out nearly dry , they don´t require the use of a dryer .
" We have shown that it can remove all sorts of everyday stains , including coffee and lipstick , while using a tiny fraction of the water used by conventional washing machines , " Burkinshaw said .
When doing a load of wash , users throw their clothes in like a normal washing machine .
Then a cartridge in the back of the machine adds plastic chips - about 45 pounds ( 20 kg ) of them - to the load .
Next , a cup of water containing the detergent is added .
After the water dissolves the dirt , the chips absorb the water , without the need for a rinse or spin cycle .
When finished , a grill at the bottom of the machine opens to collect the chips .
According to Xeros , the chips can last for about 100 loads of laundry , or about six months for an average family .
The company has not yet provided details on what the chips are made of , or how easily and safely the chips can be disposed of or recycled .
Working with Leeds University´s commercialization partner IP Group , Xeros has secured an investment of almost 500,000 pounds ( $ 984,400 ) for the project .
The price of the Xeros washing machines for consumers is " not expected to be dramatically different from ( conventional ) washing machines , " according to the company .

Do you remember a time when most people on the roads just drove their car ?
Let me be more explicit .
Do you remember a time when the main activities drivers engaged in were talking to a passenger , singing , and eating or drinking something ?
Today it ’s not often that I simply see someone driving ; a good third or so of the people are talking on their cell phones .
Now I realize that my percentage is far from accurate data but the fact that a large number of people talk ( via cell ) and drive is common knowledge .
Of course the prominence of cell phones goes beyond the streets .
You can find cell phones attached to ears everywhere .
Little is sacred now ; once that little phone rings a quick “ excuse me ” is the standard protocol .
Sometimes I wonder if society is addicted ; after all , people seem to take their phones everywhere , even when they are in the company of others .
I see it when I walk my son around the neighborhood , other walkers and their cell phones .
I ’ve been out to eat with acquaintances that interrupt our dinner for their daily touch - base with their aunt .
I ’ve even accidentally responded to strangers in the grocery store who were looking my way , saying something , yet talking on those headset devices .
The good news for our cell - crazed culture is that a German study recently announced that their decade ’s long study found that cell phones were safe for adults .
Of course there were caveats : they cannot make conclusions based on more than 10 years of cell phone usage and some cellular activity did change while being “ under the influence ” of mobile / cell phone radiation .
( According to the article , even this information did not dissuade the survey from concluding that cell phones were safe . )
So , the good news is that , as of now , we can continue being a country obsessed with cell phones .
I think it ’s important to note though that the study could not make any safety statements regarding children and cell phone usage .
Therefore , since there is not evidence one way or another they suggest that children do not use mobile phones .
Although most kids probably are n’t concerned about how healthy it is to use cell phones , as their parents , we have to be .
And since having a cell phone is starting to become “ the thing ” at earlier and earlier ages , we need to pay extra attention to future studies that focus on this population and cell phone exposure .
It may just be that we have to tone down our usage of cell phones in order to keep our kids from becoming too eager to start acting like adults at the expense of their health .
The question is : could we do it ?

It 's bad enough when a parasite latches on to your body to suck you dry .
But when it starts eavesdropping on your communications , enough already .
That 's what the parasitic dodder vine does .
It consumes water and nutrients from a host plant and , scientists have just discovered , it taps into the host 's communication system .
Plants use RNA molecules to send messages to different parts , say from roots to leaves .
In the new study , RNA molecules from a host tomato plant were found in the parasitic dodder vine , up to a foot away ( 30 cm ) from where the dodder grafted itself to the host .
Picking up these RNA messengers could help the parasite synchronize its lifecycle with that of the host plant , explained Neelima Sinha at the University of California , Davis .
" It might be important for the parasite to know when the host is flowering , so it can flower at the same time , " before the host dies , she said .
The research , funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and detailed online in the journal New Phytology , could lead to new ways to combat parasites that attack crop plants .
The discovery is yet one more surprising method of communication involving planets .
In a 2006 study , baby dodder plants were found to sniff the air for signs of plant victims , then attack .
Similarly , a western U.S. shrub called sagebrush has a remarkable ability to chat .
When one is damaged by insects , it broadcasts the predator 's presence by releasing odors into the air .
Other sagebrush pick up on the smells from their wounded brethren and get their defenses going .
Earlier this year , a research team found that insects below and above the ground use the mustard plant like a chemical telephone .
A bug munching on the roots , for example , could send chemical signals up to the leaves to essentially put out a " no vacancy " sign .
Russia sent hundreds of tanks and troops into the separatist province of South Ossetia and bombed Georgian towns today in a major escalation of the conflict that has left scores of civilians dead and wounded .
Georgia , a staunch Western ally , had launched an offensive yesterday to retake control of breakaway South Ossetia .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Russia , which has close ties to the province and posts peacekeepers there , responded by sending in armed convoys and combat aircraft .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters in Moscow today that some 1,500 people have been killed , with the death toll rising .
The figure could not be independently confirmed , but witnesses who fled the fighting estimated that hundreds of civilians had died .
They said most of South Ossetia 's provincial capital , Tskhinvali , was in ruins , with bodies lying everywhere .
Russian General Vladimir Boldyrev said in televised comments that Russian troops had driven Georgian forces out of the Tskhinvali .
Witnesses confirmed that there was no sign of Georgian soldiers on the streets .
Georgia 's President Mikhail Saakashvili proposed a ceasefire today .
As part of his proposal , Georgian troops were pulled out of Tskhinvali and had been ordered to stop responding to Russian shelling , said Alexander Lomaia , secretary of his Security Council .
Russia did not immediately respond to Saakashvili 's proposal .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev had said earlier that Moscow sent troops into South Ossetia to force Georgia into a ceasefire .
Lomaia said there had been direct fighting between Russian and Georgian soldiers on the streets of Tskhinvali .
He estimated that Russia sent 2,500 troops into Georgia .
The Russian army has not said how many of its troops were deployed .

Russian military aircraft also bombed the Georgian town of Gori today , leaving several apartment buildings in ruins , some still on fire , and scores of dead bodies and bloodied civilians .
The elderly , women and children were among the victims .
" Georgia is facing Russia 's military aggression , " Saakashvili said , noting that Russian forces were attacking areas outside South Ossetia .
" Georgian authorities support a ceasefire and separation of the warring parties . "
The fighting threatens to ignite a wider war between Russia and Georgia .
Georgia , a former Soviet republic with ambitions of joining Nato , has asked the international community to help end what it called Russian aggression .
It will probably also increase tensions between Moscow and Washington , which Lavrov said should bear part of the blame for arming and training Georgian soldiers .
Moscow has said it needed to protect its peacekeepers and civilians in South Ossetia , most of whom have been given Russian passports .
Ethnic Ossetians live in the breakaway Georgian province and in the neighbouring Russian province of North Ossetia .
When striking Gori , Russian planes appeared to have targeted a military base in Gori 's outskirts that sustained hits .
They also apparently hit nearby living quarters .
Overnight , Russian warplanes bombed the Vaziani military base on the outskirts of the Georgian capital and near the Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan oil pipeline , Georgian Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili said .
He added that two other military bases were hit , and that warplanes bombed the Black Sea port city of Poti , which has a sizable oil shipment facility .
Lavrov said Georgia brought the airstrikes upon itself by bombing civilians and Russian peacekeepers .
He warned that the small Caucasus country should expect more attacks .
" Whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers , this side is not safe and they should know this , " Lavrov said .
Asked whether Russia could bomb the Georgian capital , Tbilisi , Lavrov answered : " I do n't think the bombing is coming from Tbilisi , but whatever part of Georgia is used for this aggression is not safe . "
Georgia , meanwhile , said it had shot down 10 Russian planes , including four brought down today .
The first Russian confirmation came from Russian Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn , Deputy Chief of the General Staff , who said two Russian planes were downed .
He did not say where or when .
Russian military commanders said 15 peacekeepers have been killed and about 150 wounded .
It was unclear what might persuade either side to stop shooting .
Both claim the battle started after the other side violated a ceasefire that had been declared just hours earlier after a week of sporadic clashes .
US President George Bush urged an immediate halt to the fighting , which he said endangered peace throughout the volatile region .
White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Bush had spoken very recently with Medvedev and Saakashvili .
Washington 's top Caucasus envoy , Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza , was heading to the region .
Diplomats also called for another emergency session of the UN Security Council , its second since early yesterday morning seeking to prevent an all - out war .
It is the worst outbreak of hostilities since the province won de facto independence in a war against Georgia that ended in 1992 .
Russian troops went in as peacekeepers but Georgia alleges they now back the separatists .
Russia , which has granted citizenship to most of the region 's residents , appeared to lay much of the responsibility for ending the fighting on Washington .
Georgia , which borders the Black Sea between Turkey and Russia , was ruled by Moscow for most of the two centuries preceding the breakup of the Soviet Union .
Georgia has angered Russia by seeking Nato membership - a bid Moscow regards as part of a Western effort to weaken its influence in the region .
Saakashvili , a U.S. - educated lawyer , long pledged to restore Tbilisi 's rule over South Ossetia and another breakaway province , Abkhazia .
Both regions have run their own affairs without international recognition since splitting from Georgia in the early 1990s and have built up ties with Moscow .
Georgia had about 2,000 troops in Iraq but Saakashvili called them home in the face of the South Ossetia fighting .
The Georgian commander of the brigade in Iraq said they would leave as soon as possible .
With the opportunity for sustained media face - time at a premium before the upcoming national party conventions , people are expecting to learn any day who the presidential candidates have chosen to be the respective choices for vice - presidential candidates .
Now that energy and environmental issues have become increasingly salient , each of the candidates has to give at least some consideration to how their potential ticket - mate stands on energy - related and environmental issues .
Believe it or not , this may actually ring more true for Republican John McCain than it does for Democrat Barack Obama , as the Democrats have historically been the party of environmental protection .
To help you wade through all of media hype and speculation , I ’ve put together a short list of possible McCain runningmates and their positions on energy and the environment .
To add some color , I ’ve enlisted the support of several prominent bloggers who have more intimate knowledge of the potential candidates ’ environmental stance and record ( where possible ) .
[ Please note that I do not claim to be a prognosticator .
And with the list of potential GOP vice - presidential candidates longer than the list of Beltway lobbyists running the McCain campaign , who actually can ?
I ’ve added a few ‘ long - shots ’ to the end of this list , but it is quite possible that McCain ’s selection is absent from the following collection . ]
The Short List :
Tim Pawlenty : Pawlenty is relatively young , conservative , and popular .
As the Governor of Minnesota , Pawlenty Advanced the Community Based Energy Development Credit to encourage the development and use of locally owned wind and clean energy sources and established a goal of obtaining 800 megawatts of community based wind to be added to our electric system by 2010 .
Pawlenty also proposed and passed Minnesota ’s largest ever Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program ( CREP ) agreement , authorizing the set - aside of 120,000 acres of marginal crop land near environmentally sensitive waterways .
Maria Surma Manka of Maria Energia : “ Governor Pawlenty has responded well to Minnesotans – including his evangelical Christian pastor – who have demanded action to fight global warming .
Thanks to citizens , legislators and the Governor , Minnesota has a biofuels mandate , renewable energy standard and efficiency requirements .
But we still struggle with our dependence on coal and oil .
Whether chosen as VP or not , I hope “ T. Paw ” will show even stronger leadership to help move us away from our old - fashioned energy system and on to something cleaner and more efficient for the 21st century . ”
Mitt Romney : I know I might make some enemies by saying this , but I have a hard time believing that anyone with five children in this day and age can honestly call themselves an environmentalist [ Editor ’s note : this thread has been picked up in the GO Forums if you ’d like to discuss it at depth ] .
As governor of Massachusetts from January 2003 to January 2007 , Mitt Romney got off to a promising start on a green issues , but then repeatedly disapointed the state ’s environmental community [ PDF ] .
In 2005 , Romney pulled Massachusetts out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative , a pact between Northeastern states that calls for emissions cuts , even though his administration had spent more than two years helping to shape the deal ( since then , Romney ’s successor , Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick [ D ] , reversed that decision ) .
Romney ’s opposition to the proposed offshore wind farm in the waters of Nantucket Sound is not likely to gain him any favor in the eyes of renewable energy advocates , or the larger environmental community .
Wendy Williams at The Huffington Post : “ Throughout his four - year term heading up the Bay State government , Romney ’s behind - the - scenes stalling tactics were both legion and legend . ”
Charlie Crist : Florida Governor , Charlie Crist may have one of the most progressive environmental platforms of all McCain ’s pottential VP candidates .
In a January interview with Grist , Gov. Crist spoke unflinchingly about his support for the environment .
He said , “ [ I ]t really goes back to Teddy Roosevelt for me , as a Republican — here was a guy 100 years ago who understood the importance of conservation : protecting the environment , establishing our national park system .
Noah Levy of Red , Green , and Blue : “ He has shown himself through words and actions to be a true friend to the environment .
However , the reversal of his position toward offshore drilling combined with his shrugging off of McCain ’s negative vote toward the restoration of the Everglades reek of political opportunism . ”
John
Thune :
The young , extremely conservative senator from South Dakota , spent 3 terms in the House and then knocked off Tom Daschle in the 2004 election .
Thune had the highest LCV score of all the potential VPs at 30 % .
But that figure is up from a 9 % rating the Congressman earned in the 109th Congress ( 2001 - 2002 ) , and from 2004 , when he earned the LCV’s “ Dirty Dozen ” designation .
More recently , Thune has been a champion of the corn ethanol industry , and has voted to protect the economic interests of Big Ag in his home state of South Dakota .
Thune is also part of the so - called “ Gang of Ten , ” a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators pushing a proposed energy policy that would break the stalemate currently dogging Congress .
The proposal would open additional drilling areas in the Gulf of Mexico , and allows Virginia , North Carolina and Georgia to choose whether they want to drill of their coasts .
Existing bans off the West Coast and ANWR would remain in place .
The proposal would also dedicate $ 20 billion to R&D of alternative fuels and extends a series of tax credits and incentives , such as for the purchase of hybrid vehicles .
Eric Cantor :
The four - term Republican Representative from Virginia ’s seventh district took two full terms to break out of the basement of the LCV ratings with a score of 0 % ; but is now making a run for double digits as Cantor has moved to 5 % in the last term and 7 % in the current term .
Terry Carter of Too Progressive : “ Eric Cantor has a history of blindly following the failed regressive policies of the Bush administration and the Republican party as a whole , voting nearly 100 percent of the time with the Bush administration throughout his ( Cantor ’s ) Congressional career .
That having been said it pretty much goes without saying that Cantor is once again siding with the Republican party ( and the big oil companies ) and promoting a regressive energy policy that will provide virtually no long OR short term relief for average American ’s struggling with gas and energy prices .
Cantor , a potential VP candidate , Republican presidential nominee John McCain and the Republican party as a whole are once again showing where their true allegiance lies – with the big oil companies that have upported their party for years .
a prolific fundraiser for the campaign . ”
Longer Shots :
Christine Todd Whitman :
Though probably a long shot , the former Secretary of the EPA in the at the beginning of George W. Bush ’s first administration now runs an energy lobbying group called the Whitman Strategy Group .
Newt Gingrich : Newt ’s been hard at work billing himself as an environmentalist as of late .
Economically - bereft “ Drill Here , Drill Now , Pay Less ” campaign .
While Gingrich might have the conservative record to attract that particular wing of the party , he may be too polarizing of a figure to be McCain ’s runningmate .
Bobby Jindal : of Louisiana .
Jindal Voted NO on removing oil & gas exploration subsidies in 2007 and Voted YES on deauthorizing “ critical habitat ” for endangered species in 2005 .
It ’s not all bad though .
Jindal did vote YES on increasing AMTRAK funding by adding $ 214 M to $ 900 M in 2006 .
Bob Portman : Virtually unknown nationally , Portman is a former one - term congressman from the key state of Ohio , who , in his single term as a U.S. Representative earned an LCV score of 36 % in the 105th Congress ( 1998 - 1999 ) .
Portman likes canoeing and kayaking .
In 1984 he traveled to China to kayak the Li River and a portion of the Yangzi River .
He has also kayaked the entire Rio Grande .
Concluding Remarks :
John McCain has a very real dilemma to address :
How does he simultaneously satisfy the conservative wing of the Republican Party and attract the moderates and independents who would be a critical component of a McCain win ?
More specifically , can candidate McCain select a VP runningmate with a strong record on the environment , one that might also support a cap - and - trade for carbon emissions – a rather unpopular among most conservative Republicans – and still mobilize the conservative base ?
We ’ll soon find out .

A masters student researching terrorist tactics who was arrested and detained for six days after his university informed police about al - Qaida - related material he downloaded has spoken of the “ psychological torture ” he endured in custody .
Despite his Nottingham University supervisors insisting the materials were directly relevant to his research , Rizwaan Sabir , 22 , was held for nearly a week under the Terrorism Act , accused of downloading the materials for illegal use .
The student had obtained a copy of the al - Qaida training manual from a US government website for his research into terrorist tactics .
The case highlights what lecturers are claiming is a direct assault on academic freedom led by the government which , in its attempt to establish a “ prevent agenda ” against terrorist activity , is putting pressure on academics to become police informers .

There are at least four things that I can think of right off hand that almost nobody in America does any more .
They 're all things that your grandparents , and in my case my parents , did because they lived through the Depression , and remembered when energy was n't " free . "
Then along came the 1950s and 1960s , and Americans got in the bad habit of thinking of everybody else in the world 's natural resources as ours for free .
Which still was n't reason enough to stop doing some of these things and go the other way ; I 'll probablyunderstand why some of these things happened .
And they 're all things that tick me off every time I walk by or into a house or apartment that does n't do them , at least a little bit .
I try not to be judgmental , I know that I myself am greatly ignorant in many areas , but some of these things strike me as so stupid not to do that I weep for my country that we do n't all do them .
Oh , and by the way ?
They all reduce " greenhouse gases . "
They also all reduce " throwing away blood and treasure that this country can't afford after an ill - considered land war in Asia . "
No matter why you should do them , ca n't we all just agree to do them ?
Except for maybe surgical operating rooms and other clean rooms , it ticks me off to walk into any room , anywhere , and not see a ceiling fan running .
This is especially true when the building was built prior to 1950 , because I know full well that that rooma ceiling fan at some point and someripped it out for no good reason .
I know that it would cost as little as $ 25 per room to put one in , less than a c - note for a good one .
And run full time , a modern ceiling fan will pay for itself in less than a year , not even counting what 's going to happen to energy prices this year .
Let me run through this one more time , because I am constantly reminded that there are people to whom this is n't obvious .
All winter long , nearly all of your heating bill is spent heating the ceiling .
Most of the benefit you 're getting out of running your furnace comes from what little heat radiates down off of the ceiling ; no wonder your feet are cold .
Every time I bring this up , somebody says , " but I do n't want a fan blowing on me in the winter . "
Really ?
Even if it '
sAnd all summer long , half or more of the cold air that your air conditioner pumps out never gets any higher up than your knees , never gets up to the core area of your trunk where it 's needed the most .
So to solve this problem , you freeze the lower half of the room , so that eventually some of air where you actually live radiates its heat into it .
No , really : from about November to April , you should have a ceiling fan at all times blowing hot air down off of the ceiling , and from April to November , that same ceiling fan should be running the opposite direction to bring cold air up off of the floor .
Not only will this make your furnace and air conditioner run so much more efficiently that your energy bill will go way down , it 'll make the center part of the room so much more comfortable that you may well find that you can stand to turn your furnace down 3 degrees or more , and your air conditioner up 3 degrees or more , without sacrificing a lick of comfort .
( And that 's on top of the extra 1 to 2 degrees of perceived warmth you can get all winter long by running a humidifier , but most people I know do that nowadays . )
I 'm not asking you to be miserable to save money or the environment , I 'm asking you to make yourselfto save money or the environment -- why does n't everybody do this already ?
When I was a kid , almost all residential houses except in the wealthiest neighborhoods still had metal awnings over every window except for ones sheltered by porches or very , very deep eaves .
Then over the course of my childhood , virtually everybody in America tore theirs down , and I willunderstand why .
I mean , never mind that it 's a one - time investment of a couple or a couple dozen bucks per window to almost never have to clean the outside of your windows again , because they keep the rain and the dust off -- they keep the rain and the dusttoo , which means you that you can actually open your windows without being afraid of the rain .
But then comes the part where this is also about saving a ton of money and / or a ton of greenhouse gas emissions :
A proper window awning factors in your latitude , so you get winter sun , but not summer sun , which saves you a small fortune on your air conditioning bill even if youopen the windows in the spring and fall .
Seriously , what is not to like about awnings ?
I know I 'm going to catch some grief for this one from people who know what they 're talking about , but hear me out .
Although I will say , ironically , that if you live in St. Louis , at least that I know of , I may not have to tell you about this one after all ; this is enough of a peculiarly St. Louis vice / virtue that some of you may well be doing it : plant fast - growing deciduous ( leafy ) softwoods like sugar maples , sweet gums , Bradford pears , or Tree of Heaven ( the proverbial tree that " Grows in Brooklyn " ) .
What these trees all have in common is that from one end of North America to the other , on any ground with full sun almost no matter how bad the soil is or how little water there is , they grow like weeds .
We 're talking 10 ' tall from a 2 ' sapling in 2 years , 30 ' tall in little more than that , topping out at 60 ' to 80 ' tall almost before you know it , with no care in particular on your part .
Plant one each on the east and west sides of your home if your windows are n't already in the shade all day , and as many as 2 or 3 on the south side of the house , well back from the sidewalk or road and away from the house itself .
Now I 'd better give you the reason why some botanists and foresters are going to scream bloody murder at me for telling you this , and you if you do it .
These trees only live about 40 to 60 years .
Then you 're stuck with a 60 ' tree that has to be taken down by a professional tree - trimmer with a crane , before some storm brings it down on your house .
Big hairy deal .
How much residential property do Americans live on any more that does n't get bulldozed and rebuilt every 40 to 60 years , anyway ?
And even if it does have to come down , how many greenhouse gas emissions will it save , and how much money will it save , over those four to six decades of giving you beautiful shade that cools your entire yard , including the house , by around 10 degrees Fahrenheit all summer long without cooling it at all in the winter ?
More than enough to pay the tree trimming company , I 'm thinking .
And the beauty of this , as documented ( with a note of unnecessary alarm ) in Sunday ' sis that research shows that unlike a lot of other plants , these are the exactly the kind of " weedy " or " trash " trees that will actually growandthe more that you need them !
( See Tom Christopher , " Can Weeds Help Solve the Climate Crisis ? , " 6/29/08 . ) This technology was perfected during the Depression era , when almost every home in the suburbs had one ; then as soon as air conditioners came around , every idiot in the country ripped his out .
And oddly , I say " perfected " during the Depression only loosely , because we have the basic engineering knowledge now to make ones that are even better than the ones my parents , your grandparents , used during hot weather , but good luck finding one at all .
It 's nothing but a large , low - to - medium speed fan placed in the ceiling of the center of the top floor of the house , aimed to suck air up out of the house , into the attic , and out through the attic vent (s ) .
This lets you take advantage of how much cooler the air is outside than in ( remember , now that you 've actually got shade , easily 10 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than the rest of the city ) and pull it into the house at good , steady breeze speeds through every window in the house simultaneously .
Older ones are a bit noisy ; we know more about building quiet , high efficiency fans these days than my grandparents ' generation did .
And you would be absolutely amazed how late into the summer you can go , on a shady lot , with an attic fan and room ceiling fans going , without turning the air conditioning on even once .
Yes , even if the humidity is high ; the cool air coming up off the floor and in through the windows will still dry you off so fast , your mind will boggle , at a tiny fraction of the cost of your air conditioner .
So , " save the planet . "
" Save endangered species . "
Save however many thousands of American soldiers ' lives fighting in wars we could ignore if we did n't need to import so much oil .
Save a ton of money we 're not going to have any time soon .
If I 'm wrong about us not having the money , save a ton of money you can spend on stuff that 's more -- or at the very least , that you can spend on the doctor bills or mortgage that are bankrupting you .
I do n't care why you do these things , ca n't we at least agree to do them ?
It saves less than the examples above , and it involves the aggravation of training yourself , your roommates , and / or your kids , but it saves more than you might think : get fanatic about closing cabinets and closets and keeping them closed .
Why spend good money ( and generate extra CO ) heating or air conditioning a closet full of towels or a cabinet full of canned vegetables ?

It is the stuff of escapist fantasy .
A tall , dark and handsome type sweeps a cream - and - roses Home Counties heroine off her feet .
In its 100 years of publishing , the exotic alpha male has been a staple of the Mills and Boon romance .
The tale of the passionate desert sheikh who sweeps secretary Janna Smith off her feet in Violet Winspear 's 1970 romance Tawny Sands is perhaps the quintessential Mills and Boon story .
Silent film sex symbol Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik " His tone of voice was softly mocking , but she knew he did n't really jest .
He was Raul Cesar Bey and the further they travelled into the desert the more aware she was of his affinity with the savage sun and tawny sands . "
Shocking and suggestive , the tale of their love was wildly popular with a generation of readers .
It is also typical of a taste for foreign pleasures when it comes to romantic fiction .
It 's 100 years since Mills and Boon published their first book .
Sold in 109 countries and translated into 26 different languages , it is arguably Britain 's best - known publishing house worldwide .
From early in the company 's history , its winsome heroines have looked beyond Britain 's shores to find love .
Nobody can quite identify the very first Mills and Boon romance to feature an exotic hero or location .
But Dr Joseph McAleer , author of Passion 's Fortune : The Story of Mills and Boon , says it was probably in the 1910s , following the lead of Hollywood cinema and its preoccupation with desert sheikhs and jungle escapades .
The fascination still exists today with the best - selling title of the June 2008 Modern Romance series being Desert King , Pregnant Mistress by Susan Stephens .
" Exotic locations gave great scope to authors to be a bit racier .
It is usually an English person going into the tropics to experience this different culture , " Dr McAleer says .
" But they never lose their moral foundation .
The heroines normally wind up reforming the sheikh . "
Steamy scenes
In 1915 Louise Gerard wrote The Virgin's Treasure , the story of Dr Keith Harding , who leaves England for Africa to treat tropical diseases .
A fine wartime romance " This was not England but the tropics where blood was hotter and where incredible things happen with amazing swiftness " Gerard writes , preparing the reader for the steamy scenes to come .
It was only in the 1930s that Mills and Boon became a dedicated romantic fiction publishers .
Since then , enigmatic sheikhs , brooding Spaniards and sardonic Greek tycoons have become a staple of their storylines .
These international tales have tended to mirror broader social trends .
The experience of World War II enhanced the possibilities of love abroad .
WAAF Into Wife , by Barbara Stanton , follows the fortunes of Mandy Lyle , who falls under the spell of Count Alexei Czishkiwhizski , leader of a Polish squadron .
" With horizons being broadened and more international travel , the romances set in rose - covered cottages did not have the same cachet as Greece , Ibiza , and South Africa , " Dr McAleer says .
The exotic and the international became a key measure of the ultimate romantic lead .
" The alpha male has to be larger than life , an incredibly heroic figure .
He was usually fabulously wealthy with a mystery about him , " says Dr McAleer .

Advertisement Greek shipping magnates emerged in the 70s and 80s , and the Mediterranean hero rose in popularity as package holidays became the norm .
The growth in air travel also saw the rise of the air hostess / pilot romance , with many tender words lavished on the captains holding passengers ' lives in their manly hands .
It could happen to you ...?
Nowadays , Italians and Spaniards remain popular heroes and at least one sheikh romance a month is published .
Even Russian oligarchs have made an appearance .
" As the world has become more globalised our settings have had to become more exotic , more luxurious and exciting .
Where our heroes were once millionaires , now they have to be billionaires , " says Clare Somerville , marketing director for Mills and Boon .
Middle Eastern tycoons feature frequently but hail from fictional countries and kingdoms - there is little room for the realities of the region 's geopolitics in escapist fiction .
The company 's largest markets have been the UK , United States , Canada , Australia and New Zealand .
Demographically , North America is the biggest market but with the launch of English - language editions in India earlier this year , Mills and Boon acknowledges this could change .
The real aim of romance is to provide escape and entertainment
Violet Winspear
As India 's middle classes exercise their consumer muscle , so the company wants to expand its roster of romantic heroes .
" We are also looking at the Indian prince idea .
He is a clear extension of the alpha male and we are looking at launching this next year , " says Ms Somerville .
It is also running a competition to find new local authors in India .
Mills and Boon novels are translated in China , and for some years now its romances have graced Japanese bookshelves in the form of manga comics .
Exotic escape Mills and Boon claim its readership all over the world look for the same thing : identification with the heroine and intense romantic relationships .
You 're not in Liverpool now , Shirley Violet Winspear , one of Mills and Boon 's best - selling authors in the 1960s and the author of Tawny Sands , set many of her books in Greece , Spain and North Africa .
But she was a spinster who reputedly never left south - east England - instead she meticulously researched her far - flung settings at the local library .
Miss Winspear caused considerable controversy when explaining her archetypal hero - the sort of men " who frighten and fascinate " and " the sort of men who are capable of rape : men it 's dangerous to be left alone in the room with " .
Although this comment would haunt her , Dr McAleer says she thought hard about what exotic themes brought to her readers .
In a letter to her publisher , Miss Winspear wrote : " Who on earth can truly identify with a sardonic Spanish Don , a handsome surgeon , a dashing Italian or a bittersweet Greek ?
The real aim of romance is to provide escape and entertainment , not to dish up ' real life ' and ' real life people on a plate with egg on it ' ! "
Shirley Valentine would surely agree .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I 've never read any Mills and Boon but my favourite book of all time is Gone With the Wind - Rhett Butler sounding like the template for all M&B heroes since .
It 's not real life , it 's luxurious escapism .
Thanks for bringing this to my attention , I 'm off to the library ...
Becky , Durham , UK I must say I do agree that there is just something about a foreign man , in particular never knowing what to expect having spent so little time around them .
We cannot read them like we can the English boys .
But I want to know when M&B will do a book where the man is n't rich / in a first class job ?
I like the classic stable boy / generally working outside - a bit rustic and roguish but can still sweep you off your feet .
Larz , Chelt I think Mills and Boon is fantastic and although it is no longer truly a British business , I still feel a little proud that they created such a well - known brand name .
Love them or hate them , I think pretty much everyone knows what Mills and Boon are .
There is pretty much something for everyone from very steamy lines such as Blaze , Desire and Modern Heat to very respectable Romances and Super - romances .
But at the core , all of them deliver the same thing - a feel - good , escapist fantasy .
Mills and Boon are also one of the few publishers that are willing to help , and accept material from , new unagented authors .
Which is something of a rarity these days .
For all these reasons Mills and Boon have done an awful lot for the average woman , be she a stay at home mother or a business woman .
Clarissa , Cheshire
When I was a teenage boy I read a few of my elder sister 's M&B ( entirely as a result of the rather saucy shots on the cover ) .
I have to say that at that formative age , it gave me some precious insights into the bizarre workings of the female brain , which has been very useful ever since .
Dave , Belfast , Northern Ireland
In my time it was associated with James Bond ... but I 've always found it so vexing that the girls I knew growing up would consciously repudiate as repulsive the alpha male type , but then either fantasize about one or actually go off with one .
It 's the bad boy syndrome ... all the nicest girls in school would spurn the intelligent or geeky guys in favour of the dangerous and cool guys .
And some girls were noted for choosing an endless series of such partners , enduring the treatment such macho males are known to dish out , until they became ruined and incapable of a healthy relationship .
Can any woman present please explain this well - known phenomenon to me from the female perspective ?
It has always been a mystery .
Dayfydd Griffing , Naples , Long Beach Dayfydd , it 's a bit of a mystery to me , too - I think it 's something to do with women 's desire to reform dangerous men ( a desire which usually results in complete disaster in real life ) .
Show me a real life sheikh as a romantic prospect - and I 'd run a mile .
Give me the geeks any day .
Liz , Glastonbury , UK I have been a Mills and Boon reader for about 20 years .
At one time I had over 900 books but cleared out to my local charity shop since then I have once again collected over 300 which will be going to the charity shop soon .
I read each book at least twice some by my favourite authors many more times .
I love the twists and turns .
Yes I suppose it is an escapism but who cares I do n't - I just enjoy them .
Beryl , Cleethorpes , England Congratulations to Mills & Boon for creating the desperate housewife .
Faiza , West Sussex
Sadly these tomes of rubbish detract from real literature that should be valued .
They are to be ranked alongside what is now commonly known as the Daddy No! titillation books littering the supermarket shelves .
Being written to a formula will not give any insight to anything .
Try reading The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho .
It will open your eyes .
Maggs , Cornwall Maggs , I do n't think it 's fair of anyone to say what people should and should n't read .
M&B might not be Booker prize - winning stuff , but is has its place and is enjoyed by millions the world over .
As a commercial lawyer there are times when my day / life is so stressful that I love to come home , run a bath and sink into an easy read .
As long as a book gives enjoyment then that 's all that matters .
Rebecca , Norwich Congratulations Mills & Boon on your 100th anniversary .
I am 29 & have been buy your books since I was 16 .
I was quite surprised to find out just how many people actually buy them in my generation .
I do n't want to read about drugs , death etc I just want to lose myself in some far away country with a big strong rich handsome man for a couple of hours .
Alas I can't do this in real life so I read Mills & Boon .
Keep up the good work & here 's to another 100 years .
Monique Rowe , Cardiff
The " ism " and or " isms " of the politically correct were created by a small minority intent on putting Western culture six feet underground .
But what 's this ?
Hip Hip Hooray !
Folks still buy Mills & Boon , rejecting all those PC ideals we are supposed to be agreeing with .
Beware the PC police - ever watchful .
The construct that creates hate speech will have Mills & Boon books burned one day , mark my words .
Cliff Taylor , London , UK Congratulations to Mills & Boon .
It was what ushered most of my friends and I into the world of romance , but of course we always knew that men in real life are not that handsome .
After all they are all over on the streets , but it certainly afforded us an opportunity to escape while entertaining us .
Salome , Accra , Ghana
As a foreign , tall , dark , and handsome billionaire I find these stories offensive in the extreme , reducing my whole existence to nothing more to a piece of meat manipulated to provide women with some animal titillation .
Shame on you all , especially if you are the type who complain about girly mags on the top - shelf of your newsagent .
Walter , London Walter , I want you for your brains and kindness .
Where can I find you ?
Helen , Oxford
You know , M&B could do all the men on the planet ( AND their loyal readers ) a great service by writing a book entitled How To Be a Mills & Boon Romantic Hero .
Simon C , Copenhagen , Denmark I love Mills & Boon .
I think there is this belief that only bored , unfulfilled housewives read them for a little escapism and titillation from the otherwise monotonous daily grind .
On the contrary , I have a business Degree and was an A * English pupil at school .
My book shelf at home is the ultimate paradox of M&B lined up next to historical non-fiction , business textbooks & biogs and classic historical fiction and plays .
Everybody at sometime or other needs to feel what its like to be in someone else 's shoes .
Jenny , West Yorkshire
" But they never lose their moral foundation .
The heroines normally wind up reforming the sheikh . "
And so the alpha male is neutered and domesticated .
He then slowly gains weight , becomes slower witted and learns to keep his mouth shut lest his opinion differs from that of his love .
The remote control becomes his only friend .
Romance is a one way street it seems .
The ladies seem to be attracted to that which they cannot abide .
Contrary .
Bill , Glasgow I have been a M&B reader for the past 20 years and still do not get bored of reading them as I have a fascination for romantic stories .
They are very much popular in India and the new idea to include the Indian Prince is welcome .
Patricia Britto , Chennai , India
I 'm surprised that in this article there is no mention of the highly racist nature of these books .
An exotic man , is only exotic because they are kept as an outsider within the readers ' countries .
" But they ( the heroines ) never lose their moral foundation .
The heroines normally wind up reforming the sheikh . "
This reinforces that people of " othered " cultures , who are under the " SAVAGE sun " , are immoral and need to be changed .
The people who may identify with them are PEOPLE who are Spanish , Greek , or dating or married to a gorgeous doctor .
It is this type of literature that created and now reinforces that cultures outside of an Anglo - Saxon base are to be feared , or considered mysterious ... this is dehumanizing .
These books are just one of the MANY mediums in the Western world that increase the xenophobia and an " Us and Them " mentality within our societies .
Nisha , Toronto , Canada Nisha , would it make you feel better to know that lots of sexy Mills & Boon heroes are NOT sheikhs or from , as you say , " othered " cultures ?
They are simply larger than life fantasy heroes who star in escapist fiction .
To paraphrase Mae West - I 'm pretty sure it was Mae West - sometimes , a cigar is only a cigar .
Sandy , Connecticut , USA I have never read a M&B publication and I must admit that I always turned my nose up at romance novels with steamy covers but my husband recently pointed out to me ( after very kindly watching all five hours of Pride and Prejudice ) that P&P has a similar story .
Mr Darcy is certainly tall , dark , handsome , wealthy , and in need of reform by Elizabeth .
He even takes her off to a foreign place ( the Lake District ) .
Why should one be considered great literature and the other looked down upon ?

What are these ?
I keep wanting to say something about ‘ current events ’ , or perhaps to be more clear , the ever accelerating deterioration of current events .
But it ’s a very difficult subject for me now .
But in practical fact , it may simply be too late to change anyone ’s mind about anything , and even if they do , it may be too late for them to understand what needs to be done .
And even if they do , if may be too late to actually do any of it .
And even if it is n’t , what little can be done , may not matter much .
One of the hard truths of being a healer , no matter what kind of a healer you happen to be , is that you do n’t fix problems without the cooperation of the involved party .
It just does n’t happen , and trying only drains and damages you , emotionally , spiritually and physically .
Too much of the world is simply not involved in fixing what is going on .
They have opted out of that possibility and like I say , it may be too late for some people to opt back in .
So trying to fix something beyond what little sphere of consent you happen to operate in , is probably a tragic mistake .
This is not fatalism , or pessimism or cynicism .
It simply is what it is .
There will be more than enough exceptions to prove the rule .
Unless something dramatically changes the established pattern of human behavior in extremely short order , much of the world is simply going to die .
How much of our existing food supply is inextricably tied to our fossil energy outputs ?
Let ’s be charitable and say 70 % .
It ’s probably closer to 80 or 90 actually , at this point , but let ’s just err on the side of optimism .
The most absolutely conservative estimates in terms of decline in oil fields that have passed peak say a 3 % loss of output , year on year is what we can expect .
We already have examples of super giant fields that are closer to 5 - 10 % a year .
But again , let ’s just say 3 % .
And we ’ll just forget about demand increase altogether , which would probably yield a year on year net - shortfall of more like 6 % .
Again , the most wildly optimistic estimates have it that if we had a working alternative liquid fuel source today , and we committed to retrofitting our infrastructure completely to this new source , it would take about 20 years to ramp up to anything like today ’s production levels .
And finally , let ’s be really optimistic and say that we have n’t actually hit the back of the oil production curve yet , and we still have a couple years before we go over the decline cliff .
This would be ignoring basically all the evidence since 2005 that indicates we have already peaked , but I ’ll be generous .
So starting in a couple years time , we would have our 3 % energy shortfall , and let us again say that optimistically , this shortfall is allocated evenly across all regions and all sectors of use .
There ’s not the slightest fucking chance of that , my friends , but let ’s all try and sleep tonight , what do you say ?
So that ’s a 3 % loss of energy inputs to all food production and distribution , everywhere , in the first year .
And let ’s pretend that this will be a totally linear impact and that supply chains will not simply collapse , that farmers will not simply go bankrupt and abandon their plots , that economic instability will not close borders , or any number of things .
I think we ’ve already seen how in a hyper connected global system that you cannot contain chaos , and indeed , it infects everything around it at the speed of light .
The relation of energy inputs to caloric production is a bit nebulous , but again , I think I ’m being quite optimistic here : let ’s just imagine in a perfect world that everyone simply reduces their net caloric intake by 3 % .
I know for myself , that I ’ve probably done that in the last year already , just in terms of certain foods that are getting beyond the price range I ’m comfortable with .
It ’s a trivial , and probably healthy , loss , which I could replace , if I felt like spending the extra money , but the bottom line is , I need to spend more ‘ energy ’ to stay in the same place .
And if this effect is steady and cumulative , sooner or later I could n’t .
Imagine what those people rioting over tortillas or soybeans are thinking .
same line , different points .
I ’ll be fine .
You ’ll be fine .
For awhile .
But how many people in the world are living on the edge of starvation already ?
How many people die when you slice their caloric intake by just 3 % ( and let ’s just remember that it ’s probably more like 6 % , if you spread it evenly , and upwards of 20 % if we admit that it will be concentrated in certain areas , at least at first ) ?
We ’ve got around 40 000 starvation deaths per day already .
Now let ’s compound it .
Because every year if we ’re lucky , for the next ten - twenty years at least , those energy inputs will continue to fall .
After ten years , you and everyone else has had your caloric intake reduced by upwards of 30 % , and after 20 years , 60 % .
The average westerner / european can still live on this but much of the rest of the world is simply gone .
The world average caloric intake is currently about 2700 calories per day .
1500 is pushing it and 1200 is in starvation mode .
This is not complex math .
the best case is that hundreds of millions of marginally - fed people are wiped out , year on year , for about 15 - 20 years .
the worst case is the population gets cut by about half in 6 - 7 years , and we bottom out some where around pre-green revolution levels .
I may be overestimating this , but I ’m not completely wrong .
Like I say , I ’ve fudged all these numbers wildly in the positive direction .
If I am just missing something , I ’d sure like to hear how and why .
please , be my guest …

In a recent study , an interesting factoid has been discovered .
According to a survey of 1,000 American adults , local and national environmental issues are of more concern , than global issues like global warming and climate change .
“ The survey ’s core result is that people care about their communities and express the desire to see government action taken toward local and national issues , ” said David Konisky , who conducted the survey .
A policy research scholar at the Institute of Public Policy , Konisky is also an assistant professor in the Truman School of Public Affairs at the University of Missouri .
In polling , Konisky enquired about peoples level of concern for the environment , and their preferences for what action the government should take on a wide variety of environmental issues .
“ People are hesitant to support efforts concerning global issues even though they believe that environmental quality is poorer at the global level than at the local and national level .
This is surprising given the media attention that global warming has recently received and reflects the division of opinion about the severity of climate change . ”
Konisky ’s survey found that a vast majority of respondents expressed concern about the environment , but were more community minded in their concerns .
The top three issues that respondents wanted governments to address were protecting community drinking water , reducing pollution in US water ways , and improving urban air quality .
“ Americans are clearly most concerned about pollution issues that might affect their personal health , or the health of their families , ” Konisky said .

SAN JUAN , Puerto Rico ( AP ) --
A small snake has sparked a big debate in Barbados .
Residents of the wealthy Caribbean nation have been heating up blogs and clogging radio airwaves to vent their anger at a U.S. scientist , who earlier this week announced his " discovery " of the world 's smallest snake and named it " Leptotyphlops carlae , " after his wife Carla .
" If he needs to blow his own trumpet ... well , fine , " said 43 - year - old Barbadian Charles Atkins .
" But my mother , who was a simple housewife , she showed me the snake when I was a child . "
One writer to the Barbados Free Press blog took an even tougher tone , questioning how someone could " discover " a snake long known to locals , who called it the thread snake .
" How dare this man come in here and name a snake after his wife ? " said the writer who identified themselves as Margaret Knight .
The man she refers to is Penn State University evolutionary biologist S. Blair Hedges , whose research teams also have discovered the world 's tiniest lizard in the Dominican Republic and the smallest frog in Cuba .
Hedges recently became the first to describe the snake -- which is so small it can curl up on a U.S. quarter -- when he published his observations and genetic test results in the journal " Zootaxa . "
Full - grown adults typically are less than 4 inches long .
Do n't Miss Scientist : World 's tiniest snake found in Barbados
Hedges told The Associated Press on Friday that he understands Barbadians ' angry reactions , but under established scientific practice , the first person to do a full description of a species is said to have discovered it and gives it a scientific name .
He said most newly " discovered " species are already well known to locals , and the term refers to the work done in a laboratory to establish a genetic profile .
In the study , he reported that two specimens he analyzed were found in 1889 and 1963 .
" There are no false claims here , believe me , " Hedges said .
Damon Corrie , president of the Caribbean Herpetological Society , acknowledged that Hedges is the first to scientifically examine and describe the snake , but the so - called discovery makes locals seem ignorant .
" It gives the impression that people here ... depend on people from abroad to come and show us things in our own backyard , " Corrie said .
Karl Watson , a historian and ornithologist at the University of the West Indies in Barbados , said it 's common for people to get excited over very tiny or very large animals .
" Probably people have overreacted .
...
It 's nationalism going a bit awry , " Watson said .
Hedges agreed : " I think they 're carrying it a bit too far . "
" Snakes are really apolitical , " he said .

Missile strike reported in northwest Pakistan RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday August 20 , 2008
Print This Email This Update at bottom : Witnesses heard ' drone ' aircraft just before blast Update at middle : Official tells AFP missiles came from Afghanistan Pakistani officials say missiles have struck a suspected militant hideout near the Afghan border , the Associated Press reports .
Three intelligence officials told The Associated Press that the missiles destroyed a compound near Wana , the main town in the South Waziristan tribal region , on Wednesday evening .
Two of the officials said initial reports indicated that several people were killed .
The third official said foreign militants were known to frequent the compound .
All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media .
Pakistan army spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas confirmed there was an explosion in the area but had no further details .
Official tells AFP missiles came from Afghanistan
PESHAWAR , Pakistan ( AFP )  Missiles fired from Afghanistan hit a militant hideout in Pakistan 's tribal belt Wednesday , killing at least eight people including some foreign extremists , security officials said .
The strike in the South Waziristan region was the first since key US ally Pervez Musharraf resigned as president on Monday and left Pakistan 's recently elected government in charge of tackling the militants .
Two missiles hit a house owned by a local tribesman with links to Islamic militants in Wana , the main town in South Waziristan , a known haven for Al - Qaeda and Taliban rebels , the officials said .
" It was a known hideout for militants .
At least eight people were killed and some foreign militants are among them , " one security official told AFP on condition of anonymity .
" The missiles came from Afghanistan , " the official said .
Residents said the owner of the house , named as Haji Yaqub , was wounded and was pulled from the rubble , but people were scared to stay in the area because aircraft were flying overhead .
" Arabs often stayed with him ( Yaqub ) , " one resident said .
Pakistani authorities use the term foreigners to describe Al - Qaeda militants .
Security officials said there were no immediate indications that senior Al - Qaeda rebels were killed in the latest strike .
There has been a series of missile attacks on militants in Pakistan in recent weeks attributed to US - led coalition forces or Central Intelligence Agency drones based in Afghanistan .
Al - Qaeda chemical and biological weapons expert Midhat Mursi al - Sayid Umar was killed in a similar missile attack in July .
The Egyptian , 54 , also known as Abu Khabab al - Masri , had a five - million - dollar bounty on his head .
Pakistan has come under mounting international pressure to clamp down on militants in the rugged tribal belt who are accused of launching attacks on US - led and NATO troops in Afghanistan .
US missile strikes have intensified this year and reports in US media have said that Washington is considering a further boost in operations , possibly including " hot pursuit " raids by ground forces .
A suspected US missile strike on an Islamist training camp in South Waziristan a week ago killed at least 10 militants
During talks with US President George W. Bush last month , Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani called on the United States not to act " unilaterally " against Islamic militants in Pakistan .
The government launched negotiations with the Taliban earlier this year but has since launched several military operations , including an ongoing offensive in the Bajaur tribal region which has left around 500 people dead .
Witnesses heard ' drone ' aircraft before blast
DERA ISMAIL KHAN , Pakistan ( AP )  Missiles destroyed a suspected militant hide - out near the Afghan border Wednesday where foreign insurgents were known to frequent , killing at least five people , Pakistani officials said .
The reported strike came as a power struggle intensified in Pakistan days after Pervez Musharraf 's resignation from the presidency , with a major opposition party backing former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 's widower to become the country 's next leader .
Four intelligence officials told The Associated Press the missiles destroyed a compound near Wana , the main town in the South Waziristan tribal region .
They spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media .
Initial reports from the area indicated between five and 10 people were killed and several others wounded , they said , but there were no details about the identity of the victims .
Foreign militants were known to frequent the compound in the village of Zari Noor , two of the officials said .
Pakistan army spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas confirmed there was an explosion near Wana and that several people were killed , but said he could not give any details until the army had investigated .
Militants have cordoned off the area , he said , making the job difficult .
There was no claim of responsibility for the apparent attack .
However , U.S. forces operate aircraft armed with missiles along the rugged Afghan - Pakistani border .
Waliur Rehman , a shopkeeper in Wana , said he heard the familiar sound of a drone at about 7:30 p.m. followed by two explosions .
" The planes are still in the air .
People are scared and are staying indoors , " Rehman told the AP by telephone .
A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad said he had no information on the incident .
Pakistan 's tribal regions such as South Waziristan are believed to provide sanctuary to pro-Taliban insurgents fighting in Afghanistan as well as members of al - Qaida .
Both Osama bin Laden and al - Qaida No. 2 Ayman al - Zawahri are believed to be hiding in the rugged and lawless tribal regions along the Afghan - Pakistan border .
Last week , a suspected U.S. missile strike on a militant training camp in another area of South Waziristan killed at least nine people , including foreigners , Pakistani officials said .
Similar strikes have killed at least two senior al - Qaida militants inside Pakistan this year , including an Egyptian explosives and poisons expert , Abu Khabab al - Masri , who died in a strike in late July .
The missile strikes , however , have strained ties between Washington and Islamabad .
Meanwhile , Pakistan 's constitution requires the election of a new president by Parliament within 30 days of Musharraf 's resignation Monday .
On Wednesday , Bhutto's widower , Asif Ali Zardari , received backing from the Muttahida Qaumi Movement , a major opposition party .
Zardari leads the largest party in Pakistan 's ruling coalition and has played down speculation that he covets the top job .
However , opposition backing will strengthen his hand in a struggle with coalition partner Nawaz Sharif over a compromise candidate to fill the post and the even more urgent issue of restoring judges purged by Musharraf .
A leader of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement , Haider Razvi , said it wanted Zardari as president because of his past sacrifices and for his " wisdom and vision " in handling Musharraf 's ouster .
The MQM , a strong backer of Musharraf , is the second - largest opposition group in Parliament .
Few analysts expect the coalition to collapse , arguing that Sharif and Zardari need to share the burden of tackling Islamic militancy and serious economic problems .
However , if it does , Zardari 's party could look to the MQM and even elements within the Pakistan Muslim League - Q , Musharraf 's main prop , to shore up the government .
The main opposition bloc , the Pakistan Muslim League - Q , said it would wait for the coalition to come up with a candidate before deciding whether to field their own .
Associated Press writers Riaz Khan , Zarar Khan and Stephen Graham in Islamabad , Pakistan contributed to this report .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton 's one - time chief strategist wanted to attack Sen. Barack Obama for lacking " American roots " during the Democratic primary battle , according to a magazine article set to be published online Monday evening .
A Mark Penn memo reportedly said the U.S. would n't vote for a candidate who was not " fundamentally American . "
" All of these articles about his boyhood in Indonesia and his life in Hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse , multicultural and putting that in a new light .
Save it for 2050 , " Mark Penn , then Clinton 's chief strategist , wrote in a March 2007 memo , according to an article to be published in the September edition of The Atlantic magazine .
" It also exposes a very strong weakness for him -- his roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited .
I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and in his values , " Penn wrote , according to the article by Joshua Green .
The article is expected to be available on the magazine 's Web site Monday evening , The Atlantic said .
The print version of the magazine is expected to hit newsstands August 19 .
Green noted that Clinton did not pursue the strategy Penn suggested during the contentious Democratic primary battle , which resulted in Obama defeating the former first lady and locking up their party 's presidential nomination .
In April , Penn was forced out of his position as chief strategist after revelations that he lobbied for a U.S. - Colombia trade deal on behalf of the Colombian government despite Clinton 's opposition to the measure .
Penn , however , never left the campaign entirely .
In the Atlantic article , which is based on internal Clinton campaign memos and e-mail messages , Green highlighted bitter fighting among Clinton 's staff , writing that her advisers " could n't execute strategy ; they routinely attacked and undermined each other and Clinton never forced a resolution . "
The internal communication also suggests that the lack of clear lines of authority within the campaign meant that issues that ultimately led to Clinton 's defeat -- her lack of support in the Iowa caucuses , the absence of a strategy to capture delegates after the Super Tuesday primaries and her failure to prepare for a protracted primary fight -- went unaddressed for months , Green wrote .
" What is clear from the internal documents is that Clinton 's loss derived not from specific decisions she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make , " Green wrote .
" Her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency . "
The documents also suggest the Clinton staff remained divided throughout the campaign on whether she should run a positive campaign or attack Obama and her other rivals for the Democratic nomination as being untrustworthy and underqualified , Green wrote .
" Clinton 's top advisers never agreed on the answer .
Over the course of the campaign , they split into competing factions that drifted in and out of Clinton 's favor but always seemed to work at cross purposes .
And Clinton herself could never quite decide who was right , " he wrote .

Last week ’s utterly useless and hugely expensive G8 summit in Japan was at least a welcome comic relief after all the bombast and threats flying back and forth between the US , Israel and Iran .
The world leaders dined on caviar as they earnestly discussed hunger and the global food crisis .
They agreed to do something about global warming by 2058 .
That ’s real courage and leadership .
" Yo Harper , " called out President George Bush , beckoning Canada ’s prime minister to come meet the president of Nigeria .
Stephen Harper now joins Britain ’s late , unlamented former PM Tony Blair in being treated like a White House car jockey .
Bush ’s arrogant public behavior towards two of his most faithful followers says a great deal about the importance of America ’s " key " allies to Washington .
Bush and Harper , who had just come from a session blasting Zimbabwe ’s ruler , Robert Mugabe , as a wicked , corrupt tyrant , glad - handed with Nigeria ’s President Umaru Yar - Adua who won office last year in one of Nigeria ’s most spectacularly rigged elections .
That ’s saying a lot , since Nigeria is without doubt the world ’s most corrupt nation .
But Nigeria has oil , and may supply up to 25 % of America ’s future requirements .
The US is also building bases in West Africa to oversee the region ’s growing oil exports .
Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe , which I fondly remember when it was prosperous , beautiful Rhodesia , is now dirt poor and bankrupt thanks to Afro- socialism and expulsion of its white minority .
Obedient western - backed dictators who rig elections are hailed as " statesmen . "
Insubordinate rulers who do n’t cooperate are branded " dictators " or " tyrants . "
Good for old crocodile Mugabe for refusing to be pushed around by the hypocritical western powers who are screaming about his electoral fraud while blessing worse fraud and oppression in the Arab , Central Asian , and African dictatorships they support .
Invited guests at the G8 summit included Ethiopia , which is inflicting wide - scale atrocities in Somalia and on its own Oromo minority , and is now facing another major famine .
Oil and gas - rich Algeria , whose brutal military rulers , one of the world ’s most repressive regimes , proudly call themselves " the eradicators . "
One of Bush ’s official briefing books fell into media hands .
It described Italy as " known for governmental corruption and vice , " and called Bush ’s " best pal " PM Silvio Berlusconi a " political dilettante " who holds power thanks to his ownership of the media .
" Are the courts still after you , Silvio , " tactfully called out buddy Bush to Italy ’s embarrassed leader ?
Mama mia !
Italians have a perfect expression for this : " bruta figura . "
Adding to the surreal aura at the G8 , and exposing the utter falsity of Washington ’s faux " war on terror , " the Bush administration announced it was taking Nelson Mandela off its terrorist list .
Who is next ?
The late Mother Theresa ?
Bambi ?
While this farce was going on in northern Japan , Bush ’s girl Friday and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice flew to Prague to initial a truly daft plan to build a new US anti-missile system ( ABM ) in the Czech Republic and Poland .
Washington claims the system is designed to shoot down Iranian long - ranged missiles — which Iran does not have — carrying nuclear warheads — which Iran also does not have .
" We are protecting Europe , " chirped Rice .
Of course , Condi .
Those mad mullahs in Tehran are just itching to attack Belgium and Norway .
The only possible use for these ABM missiles would be to protect US military bases in Western and , more important , Eastern Europe , from some future missile attack by Iran .
But Iran would only attack US bases , and thus court national destruction , if it were first attacked by the United States .
Predictably , Moscow went ballistic .
It has been fuming for over a year over Bush ’s missile plan , and getting angrier by the month .
The Kremlin actually threatened a " military - technical " response , whatever that means , if the US installs an ABM system on its doorstep .
Nearly 70 % of Czechs and Poles also oppose this crazy and unnecessarily provocative plan .
Poland is demanding a $ 3 billion air defense system from Washington as its price for basing the interceptor missiles .
The clever Poles may be trying to sabotage the plan without having to say no to their protector and ally , the US .
One wonders how much Czech politicians are getting paid to go along with Bush ’s little Central European Maginot Line ?
If the White House is so determined to provoke Russia , why does n’t it just go and bomb Putin ’s country dacha or Lenin ’s tomb ?
Bush and Rasputin Dick Cheney have broken a 1991 pledge made by President Bush Senior to Soviet chairman Michael Gorbachev .
In exchange for Gorby ’s not using the Red Army to crush spreading revolts in East Germany and across the dying Soviet Union , Washington agreed not to advance NATO eastward toward Russia or into the old USSR .
Gorbachev ’s courageous , humane concession averted a crisis that could have led to a nuclear war .
Gorbachev kept his side of the bargain , allowing the Soviet Union to implode .
But the US , sneering at Boris Yeltsin ’s bankrupt , demoralized post - imperial Russia , quickly reneged and began advancing NATO ever closer to Russia ’s borders .
Washington is currently mucking around in Georgia and Ukraine , both parts of Russia ’s back yard and considered seriously off limits to the western powers .
Small wonder Bush ’s foolish ABM system so outrages the Ruskis who have every right to moral outrage and being angry as hornets .
Bush ’s paranoia and obsession with Iran is causing him to risk provoking a military clash with Russia .
He is fast pushing Russia ’s new President Dimitri Medvedev and PM Vlad Putin to the wall .
John McCain is cheering Bush on .
He recently called for Russia to be expelled from the G8 and vowed that if elected president , he would " confront " Russia .
At least old crocodile Mugabe is n’t threatening to start a war or two .

The Best of Eric S. Margolis
Britain's honeybees have suffered catastrophic losses this year , according to a survey of the nation 's beekeepers , contributing to a shortage of honey and putting at risk the pollination of fruits and vegetables .
The survey by the British Beekeepers ' Association ( BBKA ) revealed that nearly one in three of the UK 's 240,000 honeybee hives did not survive this winter and spring .
The losses are higher than the one in five colonies reported dead earlier this year by the government after 10 % of hives had been inspected .
The BBKA president , Tim Lovett , said he was very concerned about the findings : " Average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease vary from between 5 % and 10 % , so a 30 % loss is deeply worrying .
This spells serious trouble for pollination services and honey producers . "
The National Bee Unit has attributed high bee mortality to the wet summer in 2007 and in the early part of this spring that confined bees to their hives .
This meant they were unable to forage for nectar and pollen and this stress provided the opportunity for pathogens to build up and spread .
But the BBKA says the causes are unclear .
Its initial survey of 600 members revealed a marked north - south divide , with 37 % bee losses in the north , compared to 26 % in the south .
" We do n't know why there is a difference and what is behind the high mortality , " said Lovett .
The government recognises that the UK's honeybee hives - run by 44,000 mostly amateur beekeepers - contribute around £ 165 m a year to the economy by pollinating many fruits and vegetables .
" 30 % fewer honeybee colonies could therefore cost the economy some £ 50 m and put at risk the government 's crusade for the public to eat five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day , " Lovett warned .
The Honey Association warned last month that English honey will run out by Christmas and no more will be available until summer 2009 .
It blames the shortage on fewer honeybees and farmers devoting more fields to wheat , which has soared in price but does not produce nectar .
The UK 's leading honey company is so concerned by the crisis that it has pledged to donate money to honeybee research .
From next month , for each jar of Rowse English honey sold in supermarkets 10 p will be donated to a fund dedicated to improving the health of the nation 's honeybees .
Stuart Bailey , chairman of Rowse Honey said : " We are working with the UK Bee Farmers ' Association and are sponsoring research to the minimum value of £ 25,000 over the next 12 months to selectively breed a hardier bee that can better withstand parasites and diseases . "
Rowse 's clear English honey comes mainly from the borage plant , also known as starflower , which has been grown increasingly as a source of a fatty acid rich in omega - 6 for pharmaceutical products .
But farmers have planted much less borage this year as ready - processed borage oil is being imported and wheat is more profitable to grow due to the increase in demand for biofuels .
Bailey added that the shortage had been exacerbated by an 11 % rise in demand for English honey over the last year .
Although British honey only accounts for 10 % of the 30,000 tonnes of honey consumed in the UK , other major honey producing countries have also been severely hit by poor weather and bee diseases .
Argentina is the world 's honey pot , producing up to 75,000 tonnes a year - three times that of its nearest rival Mexico .
But Argentina has suffered a 27 % drop in yield due to droughts and the planting of huge swathes of land with soya beans for biofuel .
As a result , there has been a 60 % rise in the price of raw honey .
In the US , honey yields have been decimated by honeybee loses of 36 % , many due to colony collapse disorder ( CCD ) , a mysterious disappearance linked to the blood - sucking varroa mite , lethal viruses , malnutrition , pesticides , and a lack of genetic diversity .
CCD has spread to Canada , France , Germany and Italy but has not yet been confirmed by government in the Britain .
The BBKA is calling on the the UK government to put £ 8 m over five years into researching honeybee losses and improving bee health .
Farming minister , Lord Rooker , has predicted the demise of the honeybee within a decade .
Last November , he told parliament : " We do not deny that honeybee health is at risk .
Frankly , if nothing is done about it , the honeybee population could be wiped out in 10 years . "
Yet the Department of Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) spends just £ 1.3 m on bee health each year - less than one per cent of the bees ' value to the economy - with an additional £ 200,000 for research .
The National Farmer 's Union said it was essential for government to increase its funding of honeybee research .
" Research is vital into varroa , bee breeding and the Nosema parasite , " said Chris Hartfield , NFU horticultural adviser .
" We are talking about food security and world food supplies being put at risk . "
Defra said a further £ 90,000 had been allocated to the NBU this year to expand investigations into colony losses .
It is currently consulting on a honeybee health strategy , with responses required by the end of this month .
A Defra spokesman said : " Significant public funds are already provided to support this area of work but to ensure this intervention is effective , it it vital that work is driven by a well thought out strategy agreed by all relevant parties . "
In the heart of the Perseus galaxy cluster lies a remarkable galaxy known as NGC 1275 , which has long " filaments " of glowing gas that snake out from its center .
Astronomers have tried to explain how these beautiful structures can have survived for so long , given that the filaments reach out from their home galaxy into the Perseus cluster , which is a hostile , high - energy environment with a strong , tidal pull of gravity .
These combined forces should have ripped apart the filaments in a very short time , causing them to collapse into stars [ The Independent ] .
Now , thanks to images from the Hubble Space Telescope , astronomers say they understand how the filaments have held their shape for over 100 million years : Magnetic fields are keeping the filaments together , they say .
The magnetic fields ... hold onto the filaments because they wield influence over charged particles – such as protons and electrons – in the filaments ' gas [ New Scientist ] .
NGC 1275 is a galaxy built around a massive black hole , which helps explain its unusual structure :
The filaments may represent the most visible effect of the galaxy 's central black hole on its gaseous surroundings .
The black hole 's high - energy jets have heated up the gas to about 70 million degrees Fahrenheit ( 40 million Kelvin ) , which in turn produces glowing bubbles that float outward from the galaxy center .
The bubbles pull colder gas outward behind them in the form of the trailing filaments
[ SPACE.com ] .
The study , reported in the journal Nature [ subscription required ] , shows that the filaments are up to 20,000 light - years long , yet only 200 light - years wide .
Lead researcher Andy Fabian calculates that the magnetic fields holding them together are only 0.01 % as strong as the field on the Earth 's surface , yet says that 's enough to insure the " survival and integrity " of the filaments :
" Without them , these beautiful structures would be unable to withstand their surroundings and would collapse into stars " [ Telegraph ] .

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - A judge on Thursday jailed indicted Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick for violating the conditions of his bond by crossing the Canadian border without permission .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The 38 - year - old mayor , once seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party , faces a trial on charges of perjury , obstruction of justice and official misconduct stemming from a sex scandal and his handling of a whistle - blower lawsuit .
He went to neighboring Windsor , Canada , in July without informing authorities , a breach of a condition of his $ 75,000 bond that allowed him his freedom before trial .
The mayor ’s jailing adds another layer of uncertainty to Detroit , the 11th largest U.S. city that is headquarters to the nation ’s struggling auto industry .
Lawyers for Kilpatrick appealed the ruling by Michigan District Court Judge Ronald Giles to another state court .
Circuit Court Judge Thomas Jackson was expected to hear the appeal on Friday morning , meaning that Kilpatrick was likely to spend at least one night in the Wayne County jail .
Kilpatrick has steadfastly refused calls to step down .
Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm , also a Democrat , has the power to remove him but has not stepped into the case .
The mayor may face additional charges stemming from an incident last month in which he shoved a sheriff ’s deputy serving a subpoena on one of Kilpatrick ’s friends .
A statement from Kilpatrick ’s office said Deputy Mayor Kandia Milton , who was appointed last week , would oversee city operations in the mayor ’s absence .
Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy , who announced the eight - count indictment against Kilpatrick in March , said the mayor was treated justly , “ considering his most recent behavior . ”
Kilpatrick apologized to Judge Giles and admitted violating the conditions of the bond by going to Windsor in what he said was a bid to preserve jobs , according to remarks posted on the Detroit Free Press Web site .
Kilpatrick ’s former chief of staff , Christine Beatty , also faces perjury and obstruction of justice charges .
The two exchanged text messages that appear to show they lied when they testified in a police whistle - blower lawsuit that they had not had a sexual relationship or discussed the firing of a police official .
The city agreed to settle the whistle - blower lawsuit without knowing of the arrangement with defense lawyers to keep the text messages private .
The messages were disclosed by the Free Press in January .
Kilpatrick has waived his right to a preliminary hearing on the perjury and misconduct charges and opted to go directly to trial , with his arraignment set for August 14 .
He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted .
Exclusive Graphics and games engineers angered by the delayed OpenGL spec and threatening to adopt Microsoft 's DirectX have been asked to hold out a little longer for promised changes .
Neil Trevett , president of the cross-industry Khronos Group leading OpenGL , told The Reg on Tuesday that his consortium hoped to start the process of streamlining OpenGL with version 3.1 .
Trevett also personally hopes OpenGL 3.1 can be delivered in six months ' time , as opposed to the two years it took to craft 3.0 , which was released on Monday .
The key to delivering the changes is the introduction of a deprecation mechanism for the first time in OpenGL 's 16 - year history with this week 's release .
The deprecation mechanism will let OpenGL planners flag up features that 'll be removed from the next version of the 2D and 3D graphics rendering and visualization spec , so programmers and CAD designers are prepared .
" OpenGL 3.0 is a solid step in the direction of making OpenGL more streamlined , " Trevett - also a vice president of Khronos member Nvidia - said .
" There 's already stuff in 3.0 that 's marked and that will come out by 3.1 . "
Trevett was speaking in the wake of a firestorm over OpenGL 3.0 , which many feel basically failed to deliver on changes that were promised despite a six - month delay and coming two years after the previous update .
The objective of version 3.0 ?
A fundamental revision of the API , to speed performance and ease development .
Buttons pushed
Such has been the expletive - filled reception to OpenGL 3.0 that Khronos ' web master has turned censor and deleted words considered offensive from the barrage of comments on the OpenGL message boards .
People have also been asked to mind their language .
The final spec was branded a let - down , undeserving of the 3.0 moniker , with calls for members of the Khronos consortium to step down .
" Khronos Group should be ashamed of themselves , " user glDan wrote on the discussion board .
" The Khronos Group should resign after this folly .
They have not shown ANY leadership , and only ended up pissing off the entire OpenGL community . "
Another commenter , Eckos , fell foul of the Khronos ' web master : " This is fucking horse [ censored ] .
We wait for two years for nothing ? "
The CAD industry was widely scapegoated as responsible for delivery of a spec seen as not living up to the promised re-write .
" Thanks CAD people for screwing us over because you 're so damn lazy to update your piece of junk software .
Man it seems the only way to go about anything now is the Microsoft way , so Microsoft wins yet again .
I see why no games are developed in OpenGL now , " Eckos said .
" When will we ever get a real pure OpenGL 3.0 instead of this junk ? "
Trevett said the re-write was simply too much to engineer at the time .
OpenGL is used in massive range of scenarios and supported by AMD , Apple , Intel , Dolby , Ericsson , Panasonic , Nokia and Symbian to name just a few of the 100 Khronos members .
Trevett reckoned that while people worked on the big goal of shrinking OpenGL the delays this produced meant companies relying on the API had been unable to take advantage of latest changes in hardware .
" Games are rebuilt every generation , " Trevett said .
" CAD programs can't have stuff disappear at short notice . "
He added that while OpenGL 3.0 is n't as streamlined as people were hoping it would be , the deprecation mechanism is a step towards that bigger goal while giving people in CAD a chance to find out what 's going to disappear ahead of time , and to prepare accordingly . ®
In 2006 , I interviewed dozens of experts on energy , climate , and the economy for a story in our ongoing Energy Challenge series , and more than a few warned then that , in the world of politics and policy , the need to deal with a growing global oil crunch could well trump the need to curb greenhouse gases and limit long - term climate risks .
President Bush ’s statement today on oil could be interpreted by some as proof positive , at least for the final months of this administration , that oil still trumps broader energy and climate issues .
In his Rose Garden speech , Mr. Bush briefly noted a planned boost in fuel - mileage standards for vehicles and technologies that might move the country away from petroleum in coming decades .
But the four prongs of the speech were not about using less fuel , but boosting supplies : drilling offshore , extracting oil from shale , drilling on the coast of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , and adding refineries .
In discussing oil shale , Mr. Bush made a fresh effort to get Democrats in Congress to consider unlocking the vast deposits of the Green River Basin , saying the cost of production is low enough to make such supplies competitive at current prices .
But he did n’t mention the non-monetary costs , which include the enormous amount of energy required to heat the rock and resulting carbon dioxide emissions if that energy comes from fossil fuels .
Mr. Bush ’s statement is included below .
I encourage you to weigh in on particular assertions , either supporting or challenging them .
( Joe Romm at Climateprogress.org has already noticed an Energy Department study projecting that offshore drilling would n’t have an impact on oil production or prices before 2030 . )
If you make your comment specific , I can add a footnote - style link to the relevant sentence .
For Immediate Release June 18 , 2008
STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT ON ENERGY
Rose Garden
10:30 A.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT : Good morning .
I want to thank Secretary Kempthorne and Secretary Bodman for joining me .
For many Americans , there is no more pressing concern than the price of gasoline .
Truckers and farmers and small business owners have been hit especially hard .
Every American who drives to work , purchases food , or ships a product has felt the effect .
And families across our country are looking to Washington for a response .
High oil prices are at the root of high gasoline prices .
And behind those prices is the basic law of supply and demand .
In recent years , the world ’s demand for oil has grown dramatically .
Meanwhile , the supply of oil has grown much more slowly .
As a result , oil prices have risen sharply , and that increase has been reflected at American gasoline pumps .
Now much of the oil consumed in America comes from abroad — that ’s what ’s changed dramatically over the last couple of decades .
Some of that energy comes from unstable regions and unfriendly regimes .
This makes us more vulnerable to supply shocks and price spikes beyond our control — and that puts both our economy and our security at risk .
In the long run , the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies .
My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas - saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells .
We ’ve mandated a large expansion in the use of alternative fuels .
We ’ve raised fuel efficiency standards to ambitious new levels .
With all these steps , we are bringing America closer to the day when we can end our addiction to oil , which will allow us to become better stewards of the environment .
In the short run , the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil .
And that means we need to increase supply , especially here at home .
So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production .
Unfortunately , Democrats on Capitol Hill have rejected virtually every proposal — and now Americans are paying the price at the pump for this obstruction .
Congress must face a hard reality : Unless Members are willing to accept gas prices at today ’s painful levels — or even higher — our nation must produce more oil .
And we must start now .
So this morning , I ask Democratic Congressional leaders to move forward with four steps to expand American oil and gasoline production .
First , we should expand American oil production by increasing access to the Outer Continental Shelf , or OCS .
Experts believe that the OCS could produce about 18 billion barrels of oil .
That would be enough to match America ’s current oil production for almost ten years .
The problem is that Congress has restricted access to key parts of the OCS since the early 1980s .
Since then , advances in technology have made it possible to conduct oil exploration in the OCS that is out of sight , protects coral reefs and habitats , and protects against oil spills .
With these advances — and a dramatic increase in oil prices — congressional restrictions on OCS exploration have become outdated and counterproductive .
Republicans in Congress have proposed several promising bills that would lift the legislative ban on oil exploration in the OCS .
I call on the House and the Senate to pass good legislation as soon as possible .
This legislation should give the states the option of opening up OCS resources off their shores , provide a way for the federal government and states to share new leasing revenues , and ensure that our environment is protected .
There ’s also an executive prohibition on exploration in the OCS .
When Congress lifts the legislative ban , I will lift the executive prohibition .
Second , we should expand oil production by tapping into the extraordinary potential of oil shale .
Oil shale is a type of rock that can produce oil when exposed to heat or other process [es ] .
In one major deposit — the Green River Basin of Colorado , Utah , and Wyoming — there lies the equivalent of about 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil .
That ’s more than three times larger than the proven oil reserves of Saudi Arabia .
And it can be fully recovered — and if it can be fully recovered it would be equal to more than a century ’s worth of currently projected oil imports .
For many years , the high cost of extracting oil from shale exceeded the benefit .
But today the calculus is changing .
Companies have invested in technology to make oil shale production more affordable and efficient .
And while the cost of extracting oil from shale is still more than the cost of traditional production , it is also less than the current market price of oil .
This makes oil shale a highly promising resource .
Unfortunately , Democrats in Congress are standing in the way of further development .
In last year ’s omnibus spending bill , Democratic leaders inserted a provision blocking oil shale leasing on federal lands .
That provision can be taken out as easily as it was slipped in — and Congress should do so immediately .
Third , we should expand American oil production by permitting exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , or ANWR .
When ANWR was created in 1980 , Congress specifically reserved a portion for energy development .
In 1995 , Congress passed legislation allowing oil production in this small fraction of ANWR ’s 19 million acres .
With a drilling footprint of less than 2,000 acres — less than one - tenth of 1 percent of this distant Alaskan terrain — America could produce an estimated 10 billion barrels of oil .
That is roughly the equivalent of two decades of imported oil from Saudi Arabia .
Yet my predecessor vetoed this bill .
In the years since , the price of oil has increased seven - fold , and the price of American gasoline has more than tripled .
Meanwhile , scientists have developed innovative techniques to reach ANWR ’s oil with virtually no impact on the land or local wildlife .
I urge members of Congress to allow this remote region to bring enormous benefits to the American people .
And finally , we need to expand and enhance our refining capacity .
Refineries are the critical link between crude oil and the gasoline and diesel fuel that drivers put in their tanks .
With recent changes in the makeup of our fuel supply , upgrades in our refining capacity are urgently needed .
Yet it has been nearly 30 years since our nation built a new refinery , and lawsuits and red tape have made it extremely costly to expand or modify existing refineries .
The result is that America now imports millions of barrels of fully - refined gasoline from abroad .
This imposes needless costs on American consumers .
It deprives American workers of good jobs .
And it needs to change .
So today I ’m proposing measures to expedite the refinery permitting process .
Under the reformed process that I propose , challenges to refineries and other energy project permits must be brought before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals within 60 days of the issuance of a permit decision .
Congress should also empower the Secretary of Energy to establish binding deadlines for permit decisions , and to ensure that the various levels of approval required in the refinery permitting process are handled in a timely way .
With these four steps , we will take pressure off gas prices over time by expanding the amount of American - made oil and gasoline .
We will strengthen our national security by reducing our reliance on foreign oil .
We will benefit American workers by keeping our nation competitive in the global economy — and by creating good jobs in construction , and engineering , and refining , maintenance , and many other areas .
The proposals I ’ve outlined will take years to have their full impact .
There is no excuse for delay — as a matter of fact , it ’s a reason to move swiftly .
I know the Democratic leaders have opposed some of these policies in the past .
Now that their opposition has helped drive gas prices to record levels , I ask them to reconsider their positions .
If congressional leaders leave for the 4th of July recess without taking action , they will need to explain why $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline is not enough incentive for them to act .
And Americans will rightly ask how high oil — how high gas prices have to rise before the Democratic - controlled Congress will do something about it .
I know this is a trying time for our families , but our country has faced similar strains before and we ’ve overcome them together — and we can do that again .
With faith in the innovative spirit of our people and a commitment to results in Washington , we will meet the energy challenges we face — and keep our economy the strongest , most vibrant , and most hopeful in the world .
Thank you for your time .

Greenspan says ARMs might be better deal By Sue Kirchhoff and Barbara Hagenbaugh , USA TODAY WASHINGTON  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Monday that Americans ' preference for long - term , fixed - rate mortgages means many are paying more than necessary for their homes and suggested consumers would benefit if lenders offered more alternatives .
In a standing - room - only speech to the Credit Union National Association meeting here , Greenspan also said U.S. household finances appeared generally sound , despite rising debt levels and bankruptcy filings .
Low interest rates and surging home prices have given consumers flexibility to manage debt , he said .
" Overall , the household sector seems to be in good shape , " Greenspan said .
AP file Greenspan Americans have been buying homes and refinancing mortgages at a record pace in the past several years , lured by low interest rates .
Most mortgages are fixed rate , so consumers can prepay when rates go down but do not face higher costs if rates rise .
Under adjustable - rate mortgages ( ARMs ) , which made up about 28 % of mortgages in January , borrowers usually have lower initial rates but face the risk of higher payments if rates in the broader economy rise .
While borrowers can refinance fixed - rate mortgages , Greenspan said homeowners were paying as much as 0.5 to 1.2 percentage points for that right and the protection against a potential rate rise , which could increase annual after - tax payments by several thousand dollars .
He said a Fed study suggested many homeowners could have saved tens of thousands of dollars in the last decade if they had ARMs .
Those savings would not have been realized , however , had interest rates shot up .
" American consumers might benefit if lenders provided greater mortgage product alternatives to the traditional fixed - rate mortgage , " Greenspan said .
Joseph McKenzie , deputy chief economist at the Federal Housing Finance Board , says buyers like the stability of fixed - rate mortgages , but there is increasing flexibility in products .
" There are lots of innovative programs , especially targeting low - income and first - time buyers , " he says .
The Mortgage Bankers Association said the average rate for a 30 - year fixed mortgage in the week ended Feb. 13 was 5.46 % , compared with 3.27 % for a one - year ARM .
Mark Zandi of Economy.com says that although Greenspan is technically correct , for some borrowers , including those with high debt , fixed - rate mortgages may be a better bet .
Just two weeks after the US decided to list the polar bear as an endangered species because of the threat of climate change , conservationists have launched a campaign to afford its diet – Arctic seals – the same protection .
The same scientists say tens of thousands more Arctic species may soon be listed as “ endangered ” because of a threat several decades down the line .
Some conservationists argue that all Arctic species be listed .
The Center for Biological Diversity launched a petition to have ringed , bearded and spotted seals added to the US Endangered Species Act .
Like the polar bear , all three species rely on ice at some point in their life cycles .
“ While the polar bear may be the first Arctic species listed under the Endangered Species Act due to global warming , it will , unfortunately , not be the last , ” says Shaye Wolf , a biologist with the Center for Biological Diversity .

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that between 1 °C and 3 °C of warming could increase the risk of extinction for up to 30 % of species .
Between 4 °C and 5 °C could cause more than 40 % of species around the globe to disappear .
“ Arctic sea ice is melting so rapidly in the face of global warming that every ice - dependent marine mammal is imperilled and needs the protections of the Endangered Species Act , ” says Wolf .
Strict guidelines
Wendy Foden of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) is more cautious .
“ Thresholds have to be reached , ” she says .
While the polar bear may be the first case of the US government listing a species as endangered because of climate change , the IUCN already does this .
The IUCN listed the polar bear on its Red List of endangered species in 2006 because it deemed that its population would drop by more than 30 % in three generations due to climate change , one of the IUCN ’s strict rules for classifying a species as endangered .
The organisation is currently working on guidelines to help nations assess the future threat posed by climate change to individual species .
It hopes to have this ready in summer 2008 .
The guidelines cover existing methods : the minimum and maximum temperature range and amount of rainfall needed by a species ’ is determined based on its current distribution .
Climate models are then used to determine where those conditions will be available in future and how far this species will have to shift to find its new niche .
Slow response
But there are limits to these methods .
For example , they do not include other threats , such as poaching or deforestation , so a species could suffer more than predicted .
In addition , the method does not take into account different generation spans for different species .
“ So you might expect that an animal ’s environmental niche will be much reduced but if it ’s in 50 years and it ’s something like a mouse [ with a short generation time ] then it could n’t be red listed under current criteria , ” says Lera Miles , senior programme officer at the UN Environment Programme ’s World Conservation Monitoring Centre .
“ The current system wo n’t fail it , but it wo n’t catch it as early on its decline as we ’d like , ” agrees Foden .
Second method
As a result , the IUCN is working on a second way of assessing the future threat to species because of climate change .
“ We are working with life history traits –if a species has very specific requirements , how will those be affected by climate change ? ” says Foden .
She and her colleagues have identified 84 traits – such as migration timing and a requirement for certain temperatures – that could make a species vulnerable .
They are now engaged in a mammoth project to assess all birds , amphibians and warm water corals – 16,800 species in total – for these traits .
They will present their preliminary findings in October at the World Conservation Congress .
Policy response
Once the species are listed , there remains the difficult issue of what can be done to protect them .
Responding to the threat of climate change is quite different to responding to illegal poaching , they say .
“ We can eliminate all other threats that might be operating on the species , such as hunting and habitat destruction , ” says Foden .
“ This will give the species the best chance of surviving climate change .
Listing species on global and federal threatened species lists will help in this regard . ”

The world according to John McCain is one in which America is triumphant at home and abroad thanks to the Bush legacy , rolling to victory internationally and mastering its domestic economic problems .
If daily news , like reports of the 10 French soldiers killed by a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan and the U.S. government 's imminent nationalization of much of the American mortgage - lending industry , would seem to deny such a rosy scenario , then that only shows skeptics lack the courage that sustained McCain as a prisoner of war in Vietnam .
There you have it encapsulated , the McCain campaign for president , an irrational melange of patriotic swagger and blindness to reality that is proving disturbingly successful with uninformed voters .
How else to explain the many millions of Americans who tell pollsters they prefer a continuation of Republican rule when so many of them are losing their homes to foreclosure and the nation is devastated by out - of - control military spending ?
The economy is in a downward spiral , the national debt is at an all - time high , the dollar is an international disgrace and inflation in July had the steepest rise in 27 years , driven by oil prices fivefold higher than when George W. Bush invaded the nation with the world 's second - largest petroleum reserves .
While the oil - rich Mideast nations we protect refuse to fully open the oil spigots as payback for our military efforts , McCain celebrates Gen. David Petraeus as his No. 1 hero for " victory " in Iraq .
Aside from the reality that victory there is now defined as returning to the level of stability provided by Saddam Hussein , who the Bush administration admits had nothing to do with the bin Laden - led terrorists , even that goal requires the cooperation of our former sworn enemies , Iran 's ayatollahs .
Presumably McCain envisions a more favorable outcome for Georgia , to which he would commit the unqualified support of the United States with his outrageously overreaching statement that " we are all Georgians . "
If Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama had been in contact with the leader of a nation before and after that nation provoked a war , his campaign would be a shambles .
Not so McCain , who is acting as if he is already the elected commander in chief ensconced in a reconstituted neoconservative - dominated White House .
By contrast , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has been reduced to a blustering bystander .
That military victory in Iraq and any other trouble spot is the key selling point of the McCain campaign is odd , because McCain 's credentials derive from participation in a war that resulted in the most ignominious defeat in U.S. history .
How else to think of the loss of almost 59,000 Americans and 3.4 million Indochinese in a war that even McCain has long since not seriously tried to defend .
Surely McCain accepted the notion that a Communist Party - run Vietnam was compatible with U.S. security interests when he , along with Sen.
John Kerry , led the fight for U.S. recognition of Vietnam .
Would n't it have been grand if McCain , who made his own pilgrimage of reconciliation to Hanoi , would have drawn the proper lesson from that sad chapter in American history -- that victory is n't everything it 's cracked up to be ?
Or , by extension , from the recent Olympic festivities in still - Red China , where Bush was photographed quite happily near portraits of the once - dreaded Chairman Mao , whom U.S. propaganda had long described , quite erroneously , as chief sponsor of the Vietnamese communists .
We are reminded of how brilliant Republican Richard Nixon was in rejecting the neoconservative addiction to the Cold War that McCain embraces when the late president traveled to Beijing to make peace with the man previously depicted as the bloodiest of communist dictators .
It turns out that the various communist movements were nationalist above all else , and when we " lost " in Vietnam , the result was not attacks on the United States , but a war between China and Vietnam .
The lesson McCain should have learned is that the world is a complex place , that today 's enemies may be tomorrow 's negotiating partners -- as Obama has at times dared to suggest -- and that the neoconservative idea of a Pax Americana is a dangerous fantasy .
And a costly one at that , not only in lost lives and blowback from the regions we destabilize but also in the dollars that American taxpayers must waste .
Thanks to the absurdly misdirected war on terrorism that McCain so enthusiastically supports , we spend more annually in inflation - adjusted dollars on the military than at any time since World War II , even more than during the Korean and Vietnam wars .
Vote for McCain and forget about funding to solve the Social Security , Medicare and subprime mortgage disasters or for anything else that truly would make America stronger .

Have you heard of New York 's Amazon tax ?
In a modern version of the 18th Century Stamp Act , requiring online retailers to charge sales tax on anything bought by residents of New York .
This has not been very popular – Amazon called it “ invalid , illegal and unconstitutional . ”
In fact , Amazon and Overstock.com have both sued for violation of the 14th Amendment 's equal protection clause :
The companies say the so - called “ Amazon Tax ” unfairly targets some companies , violating the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution and contradicting a 1992 Supreme Court ruling in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota .
(…)
The change clearly is unconstitutional , says Kristina Rasmussen , director of government affairs for the National Taxpayers Union .
“ In 1992 the Supreme Court ruled that ' remote sellers ' –at that time , mail - order firms –did n't have to collect taxes on purchases made by inhabitants of states where the businesses had no ' bricks - and - mortar ' establishments , ” Rasmussen noted .
Press liaison Jeffrey Gordon rejected that argument , asserting with an amazing contortion of logic that it was certainly constitutional : “ New York enacted a requirement that Amazon and others begin collecting sales tax on the basis of Amazon having established a presence in New York State by using in - state affiliates that are encouraging sales through Amazon by linking to its site . ”
In other words , those affilliate programs that pay you a small commission for referring buyers to online retailers ( I used it myself on my old website ) is beng used as away for them to say that these online retailers have a physical presence in the state .
Bricks and mortar by proxy , eh ?
By that logic , any business that links to retailers on the internet in New York would subject the website to this circuitous logic that only a politician could love .
I can definitely see that if this trend were to continue , a de facto internet embargo on New York could spontaneously emerge .
In fact , Overstock has already discontinued their affiliate program in New York , saying “ We now believe it prudent to discontinue , temporarily , our current relationships with our New York affiliates while the battle over the constitutionality of the New York legislation is contested in the courts . ”
The state did n't try this on the old mail order businesses , presumably becuase it really was n't worth it , but with internet sales always on the rise , the lure of big money has a way of bringing out the extortionists in government .
And this law stands to bring in $ 50 million a year for these wannabe mafioso .
That explains why when the New York senate resoundingly passed a repeal of the bill , it was completely ignored .
Now that the legislative session for the year is over , the bill does n't have much hope .
So , the smaller online retailers have all their hopes tied up in the lawsuits by Amazon and Overstock .
Except one .
InternetNews.com reports that one company is showing their huge , brass bollocks by openly flouting the law :
Newegg , a Web - only merchant that sells computers , accessories and consumer electronics products , has reversed its policy of collecting sales tax on New York purchases , the company confirmed .
When the law took effect June 1 , Newegg began collecting the tax like other retailers .
It was not immediately clear what prompted the change , and company spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment …
… On the policy page of its Web site , Newegg states that , “ Sales tax is only required for orders shipping into states where we have or may have nexus for state tax purposes under applicable laws . ”
I 'm not sure how well this is going to go over , but the lawsuits may make it moot .
In the end , this may just be another way of presenting a test case for constitutionality .
But if the courts uphold New Yorks scam as constitutional , they could be in for the same kind of multi-million dollar lesson that Wesley Snipes learned :
Do n't mess with the government .
Firefighters used a vacuum cleaner to suck the kitten out of its hiding place
Firefighters have used a vacuum cleaner with a sock on the end of the nozzle to rescue a six - hour - old kitten which had become trapped down a drain .
The fire crew was called to a house in Dunbar , East Lothian , in the early hours of Monday .
It is thought its mother had climbed behind the kitchen sink to give birth .
Rescuers used a vibrascope camera to locate the kitten , owned by Claire Coutts , before using the vacuum cleaner to pull it to safety .
He said the " fish - scale formation " was a reference to the Roman " tortoise " , a phalanx protected by shields on all sides and from above .
Gu Jianming , who lives near Liqian , said it had come as a surprise to be told he might be descended from a European imperial army .
But then the birth of his daughter was also a surprise .
Gu Meina , now six , was born with a shock of blonde hair .
" We shaved it off a month after she was born but it just grew back the same colour , " he said .
" At school they call her ' yellow hair ' .
Before we were told about the Romans , we had no idea about this .
We are poor and have no family temple , so we do n't know about our ancestors . "
A University of Central Florida researcher may have found a defense against the Black Plague , a disease that wiped out a third of Europe 's population in the Middle Ages and which government agencies perceive as a terrorist threat today .
UCF Professor Henry Daniell and his team have developed a vaccine that early research shows is highly effective against the plague .
Findings of his National Institutes of Health and USDA funded research appear in the August edition of Infection and Immunity .
The vaccine , which is taken orally or by injection , was given to rats at UCF and the efficacy was evaluated by measuring immunity ( antibody ) developed in their blood .
All untreated rats died within three days while all orally immunized animals survived this challenge with no traces of the plague in their bodies .
The rats were exposed to a heavy dose of Yersinia Pestis bacteria , which causes the plague , at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in Maryland .
It is one of a few labs in the world authorized to store and work with the highly dangerous agent .
" We are very excited because it appears the oral vaccine is even more effective than traditional injectable vaccine , " Daniell said .
" This could really make a difference . "
In the event of a bioterror attack , the oral form makes the vaccine practical , as the distribution of pills would be much quicker and likely more effective because no special skills or sterile needles are needed to administer them .
" It worked beautifully , " Daniell said .
" It 's expensive to create an injectible vaccine .
But with oral vaccines , it is quite cheap .
You grow your plants and then you convert them into capsules . "
The plague had a deadly impact on early Europe , it continues to make appearances today in places like Africa and Asia .
The World Health Organization reports at least 2,000 cases of the plague annually .
The most recent outbreak in 2005 killed 56 people in the Congo and another 124 were infected before the epidemic was stopped .
In the mid 1990s more than 400 people were infected in India .
Although human trials are still needed , Daniell is confident the vaccine will work for the bubonic and pneumonic plague based on animal studies .
Pneumonic plague is spread through the air .
Without treatment a person can die within days .
Bubonic plague is the more common form and is transmitted through fleabites and kills about 70 percent of those infected within 4 - 7 days if not treated .
It was the version that ravaged Europe .
If the early findings hold true , this vaccine could mean an extra layer of protection against natural epidemics and man-made threats .
The Centers for Disease Control lists the pneumonic plague as a potential bioterrorism agent because of the speed of which it can be spread and its 60 percent fatality rate if not treated early enough with an aggressive array of antibiotics .
Daniell was inspired to investigate an oral vaccine for the plague because of his pioneering work in diabetes .
He and his team genetically engineered tobacco and lettuce plants with the insulin gene and then administered freeze - dried plant cells to five - week - old diabetic mice for eight weeks .
By the end of this study , the diabetic mice had normal blood and urine sugar levels , and their cells were producing normal levels of insulin .
Daniell figured the same approach might work with a vaccine .
He genetically engineered plant cells with a protein found on the outside of Yersinia pestis .
The vaccine was inside the plant cells , which were given to the rats .
The vaccine was protected from digestion in the stomach and was then absorbed in the gut .
It kick started the immune system into producing antibodies , which protects against the deadly disease .
Three to five doses seem to do the trick .
Daniell , who was born and raised in India , has dedicated his life to finding treatments and cures to diseases that ravage poor countries .
He is conducting research into seven of the top 10 diseases ranked by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control , which remain real issues developing nations .
" I 've seen the need .
There may be some very expensive treatments available , " Daniell said .
" But they are so expensive that developing countries can't access them .
I want to help change that . "
###
Daniell , who is the first UCF Board of Trustee Chair in Life Sciences , began teaching at UCF in 1998 .
His research led to the formation of UCF 's first biotechnology company , called Chlorogen , for the commercial development of patented chloroplast genetic engineering technology .
In 2004 , he won UCF 's Pegasus Professor Award , the top honor given to a faculty member who excels in teaching , research and service .
Daniell also became only the 14th American in the last 222 years to be elected to the Italian National Academy of Sciences .
In 2007 he was named a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
I though this amazing twirling ballerina illusion was an apt metaphor for business and life .
You and I might be looking at exactly the same thing , but we may both see something different .
Consider this next time you think about product design , or find yourself at odds with customers or employees .
So —
What direction is the ballerina turning in the image above ??
If you see this lady turning clockwise you are using your right brain .
If you see her turning anti-clockwise , you are using your left brain .
Some people can see her turning both ways , but most people see her only one way .
See if you can make her go one way and then the other by shifting the brain ’s current .
If you can switch between seeing her turn either way at will without shifting your gaze , your IQ is above 160 which is almost at genius level !

Here is more on the solution to the twirling ballerina illusion :
[ H/T readnrock blog ]
is in full swing .
In every other story you read , the iPhone is being spun as the apex of technological sophistication .
The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , and USA Today reviews , written by authors handpicked by Steve Jobs to receive early review units , have been predictably glowing and effusive .
There are even lines of people waiting outside Apple Stores across the country , shorter than those for the original iPhone , but still far longer than any sane person should wait to buy a phone .
( A , on the other hand )
Nonetheless , you should n't buy one .
Now , do n't get me wrong , the iPhone is a great little handheld .
The touch screen is a ton of fun to use , the music - and video - playback capabilities are fantastic , and it 's easily the best mobile Web - browsing device out there .
And if this version fixes some of the original iPhone 's flaws , including poor voice quality , lousy data rates , and a dearth of third - party apps , it will likely score a high rating .
Only our PC Magazine Labs testing will tell for sure .
For now , I 'll give the phone a pass on voice quality since the early reports indicate that it is much - improved .
The fact remains , the iPhone 3G simply is n't ideal for most people .
I am on record as being a , so I 'm not without some bias here .
Even so , before you spend your hard - earned cash for an iPhone 3G , you should consider each and every one of these facts :
The iPhone 3G is AT&T only .
This alone means that two thirds of the country should look elsewhere .
Even if you do n't like AT&T 's service , coverage , or pricing , it 's your only option if you have to have an iPhone .
There is a persistent belief out there that you 'll be able to buy an iPhone 3G and unlock it after all , you could do it with the original iPhone but this is n't a realistic solution for most people .
Even if you succeed with the unlocking , Apple is determined to brick your phone each time it updates the device 's firmware .
It simply is n't sustainable .
And if you 're like me and are tied into a Sprint ( or any other non -AT&T contract ) , you 'll have to pay to switch .
The iPhone 3G costs more than $ 199 .
That appealing under -$ 200 price tag is featured prominently in many of Apple 's ads , but for most people , it 's pleasant fiction .
That entry fee is only for new subscribers who sign up for a two - year contract , and even then , there 's an additional " upgrade fee " ; if you want to get picky , it 's really $ 217 .
The pricing is fairly complicated , but the bottom line is that a new 16 GB model could conceivably cost you as much as $ 699 .
See our for phone and service specifics .
Speaking of more money :
This is a high - end smartphone and your monthly bills will reflect that .
The iPhone 3G is n't worth the upgrade .
There 's no shortage of iPhones already out there .
Walk down a New York City street and you 'll see them everywhere .
I 'd go as far as to say that anyone who really wanted an iPhone already has one .
The addition of 3G and GPS are great bonuses that come with this iteration , but since existing iPhones can run iPhone 2.0 software and all the new third - party apps too , why upgrade ?
You 'll pay more for an iPhone 3G contract each month , and that original iPhone certainly was n't cheap .
The iPhone 3 G 's battery life is going to suck .
Unfortunately , I do n't know this for sure since Apple did n't give us the head start it gave to David Pogue of The New York Times and author of iPhone : The Missing Manual .
Still , this has been a chronic problem for 3G phones of all varieties .
And when you add a display that is as large as the iPhone 's , power usage will most definitely increase .
If you want to use your iPhone as your MP3 player , PDA , e-mail device , and phone , you 'll never be able to actually leave the house with it .
And , of course , defying all logic and reason , that battery is n't user - replaceable .
The iPhone 3 G 's storage is limited to 16GB .
Right now 8GB and 16GB are your only choices , but I bet we 'll see a 32 GB version by the end of the year .
At 32 GB you 'll have a device that could truly serve as a full - time iPod replacement , with room to store thousands of MP3s and high - quality video files .
Now that might be worth buying depending on the price .
The iPhone 3G is not a feature leader .
The touch screen and interface are impressive achievements , but when it comes to features , the iPhone is n't a leader .
What 's missing : support for additional flash memory ; stereo Bluetooth support ; picture messaging ; video recording ; and the rudimentary ability to cut - and - paste text .
Its 2 - megapixel camera does n't even have a flash !
In short , there are free phones with better features than the iPhone 3G .
Granted there 's more going for the iPhone 3G than just the phone itself .
The App Store will make it a genuine smartphone platform , instead of a trumped - up feature phone .
And MobileMe could make the device a key part of an increasingly cloud - based computing environment .
But right now , despite the incessant buzz , I 'm underwhelmed .
The original iPhone was a game changer , and with it Apple permanently altered the mobile - communications landscape .
That said , given the drawbacks outlined above , I still can't see why people would rush out to buy an iPhone 3G .
If you already own an iPhone , download the upgrade software .
Otherwise , ignore the hype , skip the long lines , and enjoy the weekend .
That 's what I 'll be doing .

An unidentified government official of a U.S. ally wants to participate if and when Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich makes his case to impeach President Bush before the House Judiciary Committee , according to the Ohio Democrat .
The House voted , 238 - 180 , on Tuesday to send Kucinich ’s latest impeachment effort ( H Res 1345 ) to the Judiciary Committee .
Chairman John Conyers Jr. said he will hold a broad hearing on the general topic of abuses of power by the Bush administration .
“ There ’s never been one [ hearing ] that accumulated all the things that constitute an imperial presidency , ”  Conyers said , explaining that the anticipated hearing would review more than a year of committee inquiry into such matters as the firing of U.S. attorneys , the leak of the identity of former CIA operative Valerie Plame and the information provided to Congress in the run-up to the Iraq War .
Kucinich contends that President Bush ought to be impeached for allegedly lying to Congress in order to get approval to invade Iraq .
Conyers does not intend to specifically debate or hold a committee vote on Kucinich ’s article of impeachment , though issues important to Kucinich would get a public airing .
A “ ˜New Angle ’
No matter how the eventual hearing is framed , Kucinich said he would like to be joined at the witness table by a foreign official he would not name .
“ I ’ve been contacted by representatives of a U.S. ally who are seeking an opportunity to appear before the Judiciary Committee , ”  he said in an interview .
“ Legislative leaders of a foreign capital ”  have a “ new angle that I have n’t thought of before but is relevant , ”  he said .
“ This interest in whether we ’ve been told the truth has extended to other countries . ” 
Kucinich would not provide further detail .
And in any event , the power to control the witness list of any congressional hearing rests with the committee chairman — in this case , Conyers .
The article of impeachment that was referred to committee on Tuesday was the fourth introduced by Kucinich .
He also introduced a broader version against Bush ( H Res 1258 ) and two against Vice President Dick Cheney ( H Res 333 , H Res 799 ) .

Tens of thousands of people in Ivory Coast are still suffering serious health problems two years after toxic waste was dumped there , a United Nations human rights expert said on Friday .
Ivorian people search for materials to recycle at a rubbish dump in Adjame , Abidjan , April 21 , 2008 .
Tens of thousands of people in Ivory Coast are still suffering serious health problems two years after toxic waste was dumped there , a United Nations human rights expert said on Friday .
REUTERS / Luc Gnago
Okechukwu Ibeanu , an independent U.N. investigator , said in a statement the seven sites around the commercial capital Abidjan had still not been decontaminated , with dire consequences for those living around them .
“ Victims whom I have met with continue to complain of headaches , skin lesions , nose , throat and lung problems as well as digestive problems , ” he said at the conclusion of a six - day trip to Ivory Coast .
“ I am very concerned about the situation especially for women , who have complained of an increase in premature births , early menopause and miscarriages since the dumping occurred . ”
The Nigerian political science professor said many people were forced to abandon their homes and businesses after the August 2006 dumping , in which chemical slop was offloaded from a ship in open - air sites around Abidjan .
At least 16 people died and thousands were poisoned .
Some have since returned to live and work near the sites because they lack the means to relocate elsewhere , Ibeanu said , calling on the government to act quickly to compensate victims and monitor the dump sites for lingering risks .
People living in affected areas should also be checked and treated for health problems related to the toxins , he said , noting that many victims are unable to afford medical care .
“ The people of Abidjan need urgent assistance .
After two years , they continue to live in precarious conditions and their right to a healthy and safe environment continues to be violated , ” he said .
“ Some of the victims I met are the most vulnerable , without enough money to eat , let alone pay for expensive medical bills . ”
Ibeanu will travel later this year to the Netherlands , where the Probo Koala ship began its journey from Amsterdam , to speak with various stakeholders including executives from the oil trading firm Trafigura which chartered the vessel .
“ I hope to be able to get a more comprehensive view of what happened and ascertain responsibility , ” he said .
Trafigura has agreed to pay a $ 198 million settlement to the Ivory Coast government but denies responsibility for the dumping or any wrongdoing .
Dutch prosecutors said in February they would file criminal charges against the company , and an Ivorian court threw out a case against Trafigura in March .
Ibeanu said the Ivorian government should intensify its pursuit of pending criminal proceedings against people and companies implicated in the disaster .
“ This is to send a signal to other transnational corporations and individuals that such crimes will not go unpunished and that Africa is not a cheap dumping ground . ”
Obama is the first candidate in a long time that I have believed in and thought might actually be above politics as usual .
With the Democratic nomination cinched , I fear his campaign has moved into tactics designed to win votes that may not truly express his my ideals .
From faith - based reform to liquid coal , Obama is making blunders that are shaking his liberal base in order to appeal to more moderate voters .
His long standing support of corn ethanol subsidies is another example that appears he is selling out for votes , or maybe I have misunderstood him from the start and created an ideal candidate that does not exist .
Ethanol is an alternative biofuel that can be made from corn , sugar cane , or switchgrass .
In fact , Henry Ford ’s first mass - produced automobile was designed to run off of 100 % ethanol , so the fuel has a long history in the car industry .
When added to gasoline , ethanol reduces ozone formation by lowering volatile organic compounds and hydrocarbon emissions .
This all sounds good , but there is controversy surrounding corn - based ethanol .
Michael Grunwald of Time reports that one person could be fed for a year “ on the corn needed to fill an ethanol - fueled SUV ” .
Some research demonstrates that the production of corn ethanol consumes more energy than it yields , and there is concern that corn - based ethanol is raising the price of food , although the USDA denies the increase is significant .
If you ’ve ever driven through the midwest , you ’ve seen acres upon acres of corn growing in this fertile land .
Obama reigns from Illinois , the second largest corn producing state .
He has been cozying up to the corn ethanol industry for quite some time .
According to Plenty Magazine :
When Obama campaigns in the corn belt , the Times reports , he often brings along his friend Tom Daschle , the former Senate majority leader , who now serves on the boards of three ethanol companies …
And Obama himself has cozied up to corn ethanol , courting controversy early in his Senate career by accepting subsidized travel on jets owned by Archer Daniels Midland , the country ’s largest ethanol producer .
I do n’t have a problem with ethanol per se , but I am concerned that Senator Obama favors corn - based biofuels over other alternatives .
Obama supports multibillion dollar subsidies for corn ethanol , as well as a steep 54 - cent - a - gallon import tariff on the cheaper and more efficient sugarcane ethanol .
This sounds just like politics as usual , instead of looking at what is best for our environment .
Obama admits , “ Look , I ’ve been a strong ethanol supporter because Illinois … is a major corn producer . ”
Despite these concerns , I still believe Obama is the best candidate .

I believe it is indicative of what is coming down the pike across the nation in Smalltown USA , Midtown USA , and Bigtown USA .
Please consider Freetown rejects all 8 override requests .
FREETOWN —
In no mood for a tax increase , voters Monday turned thumbs down to all eight Proposition 2 ½ override requests , including nearly half a million dollars for the elementary school .
Had the entire $ 740,268 in override requests passed , the average residential taxpayer would have had to cough up an extra $ 174 a year , according to the Finance Committee .
" I am obviously very , very disappointed , " said Superintendent Stephen J. Furtado .
" ( Principal Robert Frizelle ) and I are going to be spending a good part of Tuesday and Wednesday reviewing the options available to us .
I feel badly for the staff and students , but the people of Freetown have spoken loud and clear .
Now , we have to move forward and do the best we can with what we have .

A Clean Sweep
SAN FRANCISCO - Doctors cannot discriminate against gays and lesbians in medical treatment , even if the procedures being sought conflict with physicians ' religious beliefs , the California Supreme Court decided unanimously yesterday .
In the second gay - rights victory this year , the state Supreme Court said religious physicians must obey a state law that bars businesses from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation .
" The First Amendment 's right to the free exercise of religion does not exempt defendant physicians here from conforming their conduct to the . . . antidiscrimination requirements , " Justice Joyce L. Kennard wrote for the court .
The decision stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Guadalupe T. Benitez , a lesbian who lives with her partner in Oceanside , a coastal city 35 miles north of San Diego , and wanted to become pregnant with donated sperm .
Benitez contended that Dr. Christine Brody , an obstetrician at the North Coast Women 's Care Medical Group , told her that her religious views prevented her from performing an intrauterine insemination on a lesbian .
Another physician at the clinic , Dr. Douglas Fenton , told Benitez that the staff was uncomfortable helping her conceive a child and advised her to find a doctor outside the medical group , Benitez said .
The doctors denied the allegations .
Brody said she would not perform the procedure on any unmarried woman , heterosexual or homosexual .
Justice Marvin Baxter , in a separate concurring opinion , said doctors can avoid liability by referring patients who want procedures that conflict with their religion to other physicians in the practice .
A trial court ruled for Benitez , but an appeals court overturned that decision .
After the case landed in the state high court , civil libertarian groups sided with Benitez ; religious groups , including Jewish rabbis and Islamic clergy , argued that doctors were entitled to disavow treatments that conflicted with their religion .
The ruling was unanimous and a succinct 18 pages , a contrast to the state Supreme Court 's 4 - 3 split in May legalizing marriage between same - sex couples .
Benitez , 36 , and now the mother of three , said she has been pursuing her case for 10 years .
" This is n't just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women , " she said .
" It 's a win for everyone , because anyone could be the next target if doctors are allowed to pick and choose their patients based on religious views about other groups of people .
" It was an awful thing to go through , " Benitez said .
" It was very painful - the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are , that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family . "
Benitez has given birth to three children through artificial insemination - Gabriel , 6 , and twin daughters , Sophia and Shane , who turn 3 this weekend .
Jennifer Pizer , Benitez 's attorney , said that the ruling was " a victory for public health " and that she expected it to have nationwide influence .
" It was clear and emphatic that discrimination has no place in doctors ' offices , " Pizer said .
Robert Tyler , general counsel for Advocates for Faith and Freedom , said the decision might be appealed to the US Supreme Court .
He said the ruling would spur voters " to recognize the radical agenda of our opposition " and support a November ballot initiative that would amend the state Constitution to ban same - sex marriage in California .

Is the XM1063 a stink bomb , a banana skin , or a bad trip ?
It 's hard to know .
XM1063 is the code name for the US army 's new secret weapon which will " suppress " people without harming them , as well as stopping vehicles in an area 100 m square .
But is it a violation of chemical weapons treaties , or a welcome move towards less destructive warfare using non-lethal weapons ?
Exactly how it works is classified , but we have established some details .
The first part of the weapon is an artillery round - or as the army puts it , " a non-lethal personal suppression projectile " - fired from a 155 mm howitzer , with a range of 28 km .
It scatters 152 small non-explosive submunitions over a 1 - hectare area ; as each parachutes down , it sprays a chemical agent .
Development was overseen by the US Army 's Armament Research , Development and Engineering Centre ( Ardec ) .
A presentation by the makers , General Dynamics , says the XM1063 will " suppress , disperse or engage personnel " and " deny personnel access to , use of , or movement through a particular area , point or facility " ( =see PDF ) .
Smelling it out
Experts suggest three possible payloads : an existing riot - control agent , malodorants or a new chemical agent .
Existing agents include CS gas and a form of pepper spray .
But these seem unlikely choices , because their effects only last minutes , and could wear off before friendly forces arrive .
They could also face a legal challenge : the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention prohibits the use of riot control agents in warfare
" The matter is further complicated if pepper gas was used as the irritant since this is a plant toxin , " says Steve Wright of Leeds Metropolitan University .
" Such toxins are explicitly banned . "
The possibilities seem to boil down to anti-traction agents ( which make the whole area impossibly slippery ) , a malodorant or some novel chemical agents .
Anti-traction agents are possible , but seem unlikely because research in this area ( such as Darpa 's Black Ice program ) still seems to be at an early stage .
It would be unusual for an agency to still be doing basic research when another is about to field a finished product .
A malodorant is a super stinkbomb with a truly intolerable smell .
The Pentagon has been working on such chemicals for years , and a recent US army briefing on future artillery concepts specifically mentions artillery - delivered malodorants .
( see PDF )
This might sidestep the Chemical Weapons Convention with the argument that malodorants are not chemical weapons .
However , Ralf Trapp , an independent disarmament consultant formerly with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons , challenges this interpretation .
" That argument rests on the assumption that there are no other toxic effects of these chemicals , and that one can control the dose so that one never crosses into the dose range for toxic effects , " says Trapp .
" It also is based a concept of toxicity that is centuries out of date - malodorants do have a physiological effect and toxicity is not limited to lethality . "
Finally , there is the possibility that the US has decided to ignore the convention and use new non-lethal chemical agents .
This approach has supporters in high places .
Before the Iraq war in 2003 , Donald Rumsfeld pushed for rules of engagement that would allow US forces to use non-lethal chemicals .
Until the 1980s , the US maintained stockpiles of a chemical incapacitant known as BZ or Agent Buzz .
BZ is a psychoactive chemical causing stupor , confusion and hallucinations lasting for more than 24 hours .
It has an evil reputation , but this is based largely on rumour as few facts are available .
Most people have only heard of BZ in connection with the film Jacob 's Ladder .
This depicted soldiers exposed to a secret chemical weapon in Vietnam with terrible results , including permanent psychosis .
" We are reaping the whirlwind today because of government secrecy in the past , " says Jim Ketchum , who ran the BZ testing program in the 1960s .
" It has allowed critics to make unsupportable claims about agents such as BZ without rejoinder from the government research community . "
Although the US is known to have been active in this area since 2000 , no comments are available from researchers on non-lethal chemical agents - now termed " calmatives " , whatever their chemical action .
Ketchum has written a book , Chemical Warfare Secrets Almost Forgotten , about his experiences of testing BZ on hundreds of volunteers .
The effects are very different to those portrayed by Hollywood .
None suffered physical harm , mental breakdown or any lasting after - effects .
Rather than driving subjects berserk , it has a sedative action .
But unlike the fentanyl used in 2002 by Russian police when they stormed a Moscow theatre where Chechen rebels were holding hostages , BZ does not rely on sedation for its effects and does not carry the same risk .
Clouding the issue
Ketchum is now retired , and his successors have had decades to develop more effective and safer agents .
But strict secrecy is still in place and there is no information about current research .
Ketchum argues that the use of incapacitants would save lives , especially in situations where insurgents are mixed with the civilian population .
Others believe that such agents are not just illegal but a step towards unlimited chemical weapons .
" It should n't be forgotten that the horrors of gas warfare in the first world war began with teargas , followed up with lethal firepower , " says Wright .
As a sideline , the XM1063 projectile also has a " vehicle area denial " component composed of nanoparticles .
The US army has researched chemicals to interefere with engine combustion in the past , including work with ferrocene ( normally used as an anti-knock additive ) which prevent engines from working , with the idea is that this would stop any vehicle within the affected area .
However , the potential health risks are unknown , especially when nanoparticles are involved .
Testing of the XM1063 was completed successfully last year and it is due for low - rate production from 2009 .
Ardec says that the production decision is on hold awaiting further direction from the program manager .
It seems the decision on whether to enter a new age of chemical warfare now rests with the military rather then civilians .
Unless put under pressure , the US Army seems unlikely to give any details of what 's in the surprise package until it is used .
And maybe not even then .
' Failsafe ' face scanners could replace passport officers at airports
Facial recognition machines are to be installed at airports to replace passport officers under border control plans announced this week .
The machines will scan a travellers ' face to compare them with the images on their biometric passports and open an automated gate when a match is registered .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith , who unveiled details of the scheme , claims it will shorten immigration queues and boost border security .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith is shown a new facial recognition system at Manchester Airport
Critics fear , however , that the technology could generate too many false readings in which passengers with genuine passports are refused automatic entry .
There are also concerns that the replacement of personal inspections by passport officers could reduce the chances of detecting individuals who might otherwise be observed behaving suspiciously .
A trial scheme will begin at Manchester Airport and will be expanded elsewhere in the country if it proves successful .
The facial scanners will be used to check passengers from the EU , Norway , Switzerland and Iceland and are intended to cut the time each traveller needs to clear passport control .
Ministers insist the technology is fail - safe and that when a passenger is refused automatic entry an immigration officer will be on hand to conduct a follow - up check on their status .
A member of the UK Border Agency has his face scanned on the new system at Manchester Airport
Some critics believe the machines will be prone to error because of the inability of facial recognition systems to make perfect matches consistently .
They fear that this could lead to large queues and subject some passengers - such as the elderly - to an unnecessary ordeal each time they try to return to the country .
Ms Smith expressed confidence in the machines , however , and said they could play an important role in strengthening Britain 's borders .
' The UK has one of the toughest borders in the world and we are determined to ensure it stays that way , ' she said .
' Our hi-tech electronic borders system will allow us to count all foreign nationals in and out of the UK , while checking them against watch lists .
' These checks make up just one part of Britain 's triple ring of security , alongside fingerprint visas for three - quarters of the world 's population , and the roll out of ID cards for foreign nationals , locking people to one identity . '
Most passengers from outside the EU are now required to obtain a biometric visa , with details of their fingerprints , before travelling to Britain .
Kiron 's life was not in immediate danger but he and his 22 - year - old mother were moved to the hospital in the nearby city of Jessore city because of the large crowds that had gathered at the clinic , the doctor said .
Barry Welford considers himself lucky .
The weekend he decided one of his blogs , Staygolinks.com , needed a cleanup was the same time a hacker chose to splatter the site with a host of unwanted pages .
" I was doing something I do n't normally do : changing the theme of the blog .
But it turned out that it was just after the hacker had got in , " says Welford .
As he went through the software that drives his Wordpress - based blog , he found a block of code he did n't recognise .
Its job was to subvert the engine that drives Wordpress and generate page after page of links to sites that purport to sell prescription drugs .
" It really was clever programming , " he says .
" He or she was creating a web - page factory within my website that probably , within about 24 hours , created a few thousand pages .
Every time a search engine came in , it would build a new link . "
Bad medicine
As an internet marketing consultant , Welford is one of a growing number who finds that blogging makes a site more visible to the search engines .
But that in turn attracts criminals who want to hijack the traffic that comes with having a high page rank with Google and other search sites .
" It was amazing .
I had the site fixed within 48 hours .
But , even a week or two after that , if you did a search for some of these things , my website came up as number one , two , three . "
Hackers do not just redirect surfers to Viagra vendors .
They will inject code into blog pages that then try to dump password sniffers and other malware on to visitors ' computers .
Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos , says : " We are seeing more and more websites becoming infected .
We count 16,000 new malicious web pages every day .
It 's one every five seconds .
And 90 % of them are on legitimate sites that have been hacked . "
Richard Archdeacon , one of the members of the Symantec security practice , says automated tools have made it easier than ever to create malware that can capture a user 's keystrokes and passwords or help pass control of a user 's computer to criminals .
The blog has simply become one more way of delivering that malware .
" I would put it down as the emerging market , " Archdeacon says .
It is a phenomenon that has appeared in the past 18 months , but he insists it is just one type of attack among many - although the number of compromised blogs has risen quickly in that time .
In July , Sophos reported that Google 's blogging site Blogspot.com is now the number one domain for delivering malware .
Cluley suggests that 2 % of all malware on the web is hosted at Blogspot .
He says : " A lot of that will be the bad guys setting up blogs with malicious content , but some of them will also be sites that have been hacked . "
Security experts reckon weak passwords let in a lot of hackers .
But it 's not the only way in .
In the past year , the open - source blogging software Wordpress became a popular target among hackers , partly because older versions proved vulnerable to attack .
Blog - tracking site Technorati saw an increasing number of otherwise legitimate blogs hosting malicious files and pages .
So , the engineers behind the site decided to stop including those sites in its listings in the hope that this would encourage bloggers to update their software .
" As bloggers have updated to the patched version of Wordpress , we have seen the number of hacked blogs drop accordingly , " says Dorion Carroll , vice - president of engineering at Technorati .
A big problem for bloggers is working out when their site has been compromised .
Hackers do a lot to cover their tracks .
" They want to keep it running , so they want to avoid being a blip on the radar , " Archdeacon says .
The first sign may be when Google removes a blog from its pages or warns that visiting a site may damage your computer .
Security consultant and founder of Blogsecurity .
net David Kierznowski said there are tools - such as iWatch and Tripwire - that site owners can use to watch for changes to files .
" However , these types of tools are overkill for most blogs .
My personal belief is that hosting providers should offer these services . "
Site for sore eyes
Some plug-ins for tracking changes to blog pages have appeared recently in response to the growth in attacks .
" They are certainly looking in the right direction , " Kierznowski says .
To keep his sites running , Welford now has a routine based on the observation that hackers tend to hit blogs at weekends , when many of their users will be doing something else .
" On Saturday morning , I do a check of my various blogs .
And , on Monday , I do it again , " he says .
" On the internet , a lot of traffic comes through Google , so you want to be sure you have a good record with them . "
1. Net Cost of Immigration to Canada : Up to $ 35 Billion per year about 10 years ago .
The amount is now probably at least $ 40 Billion per year .
How many homeless could Canada take off our streets with that $ 40 Billion ?
The lower figure ( $ 35 Billion ) amounts to $ 95,890,000 per day , and so far in , 2 .
Total Foreign Nationals entering Canada through both legal immigration programs and through illegal border crossing into Canada : : over 1.5 million , which includes :
• 340,000 Immigrants in the Economic & Family Class
• 500,000 to 700,000 International Students
• 150,000 to 200,000 Temporary Foreign Workers
• 50,000 to 60,000 Illegal Border Crossers
• 250,000 International Mobility Workers .
All 1.5 million have the potential to apply for legal Permanent Resident ( Immigrant ) status .
The total of 1.5 million is shocking and outrageous !!
Up to now , the total of about 320,000 was already grossly excessive and unnecessary .
It was also the highest per capita intake in the world .
The new total is virtual insanity .
So far in , the following number of foreign nationals who have settled in Canada is : Read More ▼
They contemptuously tell us that this is “ THE NEW NORMAL ” for Canada .
This intake is outrageous , yet our cowardly politicians refuse to debate the intake .
Our national Parliament has been transformed into a House Of Sodomy where MP ’s appease immigrant groups in order to get their votes .
If Canadians think this is an exaggeration , take note that Parliament recently declared the month of April as “ SIKH HERITAGE MONTH ” .
Not a single MP abstained or voted against this law .
The chief “ heritage ” event that Canadians will forever remember Sikhs for is the bombing of an Air India plane .
329 Canadians were killed .
To this day , the main Sikh conspirators remain unpunished largely because of Sikh intimidation of other Sikhs .
See Canada ’s unnecessary and relentless intake is an abnormality in our immigration history , and has made many Canadians feel like strangers in their own country .
And Trudeau and his Somali Immigration Minister are plotting to take even more .
They contemptuously tell us that this is “ THE NEW NORMAL ” for Canada .
This intake is outrageous , yet our cowardly politicians refuse to debate the intake .
Our national Parliament has been transformed into a House Of Sodomy where MP ’s appease immigrant groups in order to get their votes .
If Canadians think this is an exaggeration , take note that Parliament recently declared the month of April as “ SIKH HERITAGE MONTH ” .
Not a single MP abstained or voted against this law .
The chief “ heritage ” event that Canadians will forever remember Sikhs for is the bombing of an Air India plane .
329 Canadians were killed .
To this day , the main Sikh conspirators remain unpunished largely because of Sikh intimidation of other Sikhs .
See Why Parliament should repeal Sikh Heritage month 3 .
According to Canada ’s Border Police ( Canada Border Services Agency or CBSA ) , about 50,000 Illegals entered Canada in each of the three years starting in 2017 .
That ’s a total of 150,000 illegals , most of whom are now fake “ refugee ” claimants .
Remember that this inflow started after Trudeau foolishly declared in January , 2017 : “ To those fleeing persecution , terror & war , Canadians will welcome you , regardless of your faith . ”
According to projections , another 50,000 illegals will enter Canada in .
So far in , the following number have already entered Canada : Read More ▼ Contrary to naive Canadians , the refugee claims of a significant number of these illegals were people whose claims had been rejected by thoughtful U.S. immigration authorities .
Fraudsters from other countries soon realized that they were dealing with a fool and took immediate advantage of Canada .
Millions of dollars have been spent on processing “ refugee ” claims .
Trudeau has been lavish with his apologies to ethnic groups and should have apologized and secured Canada ’s border with the U.S. long ago .
But he still has not done so .
The tragedy for Canada ’s homeless is that Illegals have competed with Canada ’s homeless for available housing .
Scandalously , an undetermined number of the fake refugees have actually been given preference over our homeless for available shelter .

According to Canada ’s Immigration Minister , the total in will be over 700,000 .

As Canada ’s top immigration critic ( Martin Collacott ) has said , “ universities such as UBC have Diversity coming out of their ears ” .
Ethnic Chinese students comprise over 50 % of UBC ’s student population .
Those Chinese contemptuously refer to UBC as the “ University of a Billion Chinese ” .
The pursuit of so - called Diversity has been harmful to Canadian - born and has probably displaced tens of thousands of Canadian - born .
As for the U.S. , the truth is that a study done by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and other agencies showed that in spite of the high fees paid by International Students , U.S. sources were actually subsidizing International Students .
In the case of Graduate International Students , the average subsidy was about $ 12,000 + per year .
Yet , without proof of any economic benefit to Canada , Canada continues to accept large numbers of NEW international students every year .

However , NO Canadian study has ever been done to prove that claim .

For other recent details on the U.S. situation , see 5 . Number of 10 - Year Visa Recipients .
This immigration category was created by former Conservative Immigration Minister Jason Kenney as a way of appeasing ethnic groups ( Sikhs and Chinese especially ) who wanted to bring relatives ( particularly parents and grandparents ) to Canada , supposedly to perform household duties such as babysitting .
The 10 - Visitor Visa program was invented to prevent parents and grandparents from becoming permanent residents and eventually permanent burdens on Canada .
The program allows parents and grandparents of immigrants to stay in Canada temporarily ( up to 10 years ) .
According to Vancouver Sun columnist , Douglas Todd , in the first 3 years of this program , more than 3 million 10 - Year Visitor Visas were granted .
To Canada ’s horror , this program appears to be turning into a national scandal .
According to recent reports , labour contractors in ethnic groups are using the huge pool of 10 - Year Visa Recipients as a pool of cheap labour .
Undoubtedly , these Visa Recipients are taking jobs that Canadians should get .
Assuming a rate of 25,000 new 10 - Year Visitor Visas being issued per year , the total number of 10 - Year Visa recipients issued since 2014 is : 6 . Number of Temporary Foreign Workers .
According to StatsCan , in the years 2013 to 2017 , Canada allowed 540,807 Temporary Foreign Workers to come to Canada to work .

How I did I contract this horrible , symmetrical rash ?
The doctor could not say , but I suspect the poison ivy dreamcatcher I ’ve been weaving may have played a part .
Honest people may disagree about whether or not creating a beautiful dreamcatcher out of poison ivy is a good idea , particularly when the person doing the creating is highly allergic , but that would be missing the point .
The point is that I am half Ojibwa , and one of the many ways I honor my culture is to sleep with a dreamcatcher above my bed .
My last dreamcatcher was full , and so I had to make a new one .
Was poison ivy the best material with which to weave it ?
In hindsight , probably not .
Were I to do it all over again , I might just use twine .
After spending nearly nine minutes researching scabies , a further eleven minutes writing about scabies , and nearly an hour of my day driving to , seeing , and returning from the doctor , I am disappointed to report that I do not have scabies .
Instead , my original diagnosis was correct : contact dermatitis .
What is dermatitis ?
In layman ’s terms , it ’s itis of the derma .
But what ’s done is done and now the question is what do I do about it ?
The doctor gave me a topical steroid cream to apply , but I ’m not going to go slathering myself with ointment because that seems kind of gay .
Instead I am choosing to go the more manly route and burn the shit off .
Before you go , “ Hey , you should n’t burn off your skin , ” let me reassure you all by saying I checked it out on WebMD so it ’s cool .
( Just to clarify , WebMD did not advocate burning yourself as a cure for poison ivy , but nor did they say not to burn yourself .
They did n’t say anything about it all , which leads me to believe it ’s probably fine .
After all , if burning yourself was such a terrible idea , do n’t you think it would say that ? )
The way I figure it , if I can just get all the itchy skin to cauterize , that will probably stop the itching because all the nerve endings will be dead .
The trick , obviously , is not to “ overdo it . ”
If I get carried away , guess what happens ?
Scars .
The best way to accomplish this would be to use a solid - state laser , but after checking Amazon , Macys , and Restoration Hardware , I have come to realize that there is not a single commercially available solid - state laser on the market today .
Why not ?
Laser pointers , yes , but those do n’t generate nearly the kind of heat I need to burn my skin .
I would use an acetylene torch , but the flame spreads too wide .
So I ’m a little bit over a barrel here .
Of course the irony this entire situation is that I spent all this time and energy weaving a dreamcatcher out of poison ivy , but in doing so I contracted a condition which prevents me from sleeping !!!
LOL !
In Ojibwa we have a saying for times like this .
Roughly translated , it goes , “ Do n’t sleep with the wolf to protect you from the bear . ”
And then it says , “ Because the wolf will probably eat your fucking face . ”
It sounds much more beautiful in the original Ojibwean .

High crop prices and favorable weather are triggering bigger harvests world - wide , but grocery shoppers probably wo n't see much relief anytime soon .
The U.S. Agriculture Department Tuesday predicted that the world 's farmers will produce record amounts of wheat and oilseeds this year .
Based on Aug. 1 conditions , U.S. farmers are expected to harvest 12.3 billion bushels of corn , which would be their second - largest crop ever , trailing only last year 's 13.1 billion - bushel harvest .
But global demand for grain is rising so quickly that even bumper harvests can't puncture the two - year - old grain - price rally that has been inflating retail food prices .
USDA economists expect the season average price of the new corn crop , which will be harvested in a few months , to hover around $ 5.40 a bushel , give or take 50 cents .
While corn-futures prices have cooled from the $ 7 level that was hit in June -- when flooding sparked fears of widespread crop damage -- the USDA price forecast means that food executives and livestock producers can expect to pay twice as much for corn in the foreseeable future as they did for much of the previous decade .
" Crop prices are settling at a new and higher plateau , " said Dan Basse , president of AgResource Co. , a Chicago commodity - forecasting firm .

It 's been 75 years since the federal government , on the spurious grounds of fighting the Great Depression , ordered the confiscation of all monetary gold from Americans , permitting trivial amounts for ornamental or industrial use .
This happens to be one of the episodes Kevin Gutzman and I describe in detail in our new book , Who Killed the Constitution ?
The Fate of American Liberty from World War I to George W. Bush .
From the point of view of the typical American classroom , on the other hand , the incident may as well not have occurred .
A key piece of legislation in this story is the Emergency Banking Act of 1933 , which Congress passed on March 9 without having read it and after only the most trivial debate .
House Minority Leader Bertrand H. Snell ( R - NY ) generously conceded that it was " entirely out of the ordinary " to pass legislation that " is not even in print at the time it is offered . "
He urged his colleagues to pass it all the same : " The house is burning down , and the President of the United States says this is the way to put out the fire .
[ Applause . ]
And to me at this time there is only one answer to this question , and that is to give the President what he demands and says is necessary to meet the situation . "
Among other things , the act retroactively approved the president 's closing of private banks throughout the country for several days the previous week , an act for which he had not bothered to provide a legal justification .
It gave the secretary of the Treasury the power to require all individuals and corporations to hand over all their gold coin , gold bullion , or gold certificates if in his judgment " such action is necessary to protect the currency system of the United States . "
The Emergency Banking
Act reached back in time to amend the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 , which had originally been intended to criminalize economic intercourse between American citizens and declared enemies of the United States .
One provision of the act granted the president the power to regulate and even prohibit " under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe … any transactions in foreign exchange , export or earmarkings of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency … by any person within the United States . "
In 1918 , the act was amended to extend its provisions two years beyond the conclusion of hostilities , and to allow the president to " investigate , regulate , or prohibit " even the " hoarding " of gold by an American .
After those two years elapsed , people generally assumed that the Trading with the Enemy Act had passed into desuetude .
But the Supreme Court later explained that the act 's provisions were not limited merely to World War I and the two years that followed — it " stood ready to meet additional wars and additional enemies " and could be called into service once again under those circumstances .
( Little did anyone suspect in 1917 that these " additional enemies " would turn out to be the American people themselves . )
As amended by the Emergency Banking Act of 1933 , the Trading with the Enemy Act no longer said that simply " during time of war " could the president prohibit the export of gold or take action against " hoarding " ( i.e. , holding on to one 's money ) .
Now these actions could be taken during time of war or " during any other period of national emergency declared by the President . "
A month later , claiming authority from the Emergency Banking Act and its amendment to the Trading with the Enemy Act , the president ordered all individuals and corporations in America to hand over their gold holdings to the federal government in exchange for an equivalent amount of paper currency .
The paper currency they were receiving in exchange for the gold had always been redeemable in gold in the past , so few saw anything amiss in this coerced transaction , and most trusted the government 's assurances that this was somehow necessary in order to combat the Depression .
Only later would they discover that they were n't getting that gold back , and that the paper dollars they were being given in exchange would be devalued .
Soon only foreign governments and central banks would be able to convert dollars into gold — and even that link to gold would be severed in 1971 .
On June 5 , 1933 , at the behest of the president , Congress took the next step , passing a joint resolution making it illegal to " require payment in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency , or in an amount in money of the United States measured thereby . "
Any provision in a private or public contract promising payment in gold was thereby nullified .
Payment could be made in whatever the government declared to be legal tender , and gold could not be used even as a yardstick for determining how much paper money would be owed .
For the next six months President Roosevelt pursued an erratic monetary course .
Every day a new gold price was declared , on a basis no one could figure out .
Private lending in effect came to a halt , with the value of the dollar in constant flux amid the prospect of ongoing devaluation .
As Senator Carter Glass ( D - VA ) put it , " No man outside of a lunatic asylum will loan his money today on a farm mortgage . "
And thus the government could triumphantly announce that since the private sector was cruelly depriving Americans of credit , it would have to step in and provide relief .
Meanwhile , Senator William Borah was assuring his countrymen that when it came to the nation 's monetary system , " there is no limitation upon the power of Congress .
It is not circumscribed in any respect whatever .
It is given full and plenary power to deal with that subject ; and therefore it is the same as if there were no Constitution whatever . "
Borah also tried to argue that " when an individual takes an obligation payable in gold " he does so " with the full understanding that the Government may change its monetary policy at any time and that he must accept whatever the Congress says at a particular time shall constitute money . "
The general rule ( to which there are occasional exceptions ) that no senator should ever be listened to on anything holds here : the power of Congress over money is in fact very limited .
It has the power to " coin Money , regulate the Value thereof , and of foreign Coin , and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures . "
Coining money simply refers to the process of taking a precious metal , converting it into coins , and stamping those coins with an indication of their metal content .
The power to regulate the value of money does not involve a power to dilute the value of money by inflation , an absurd and self - serving rendering .
Regulation of the value of money is a power of declaration and comparison , whereby some monetary standard is compared to other coins in circulation and an exchange rate for these various kinds of currency established according to the amounts of precious metals ( with due allowance for the distinct values of different precious metals ) in each .
In other words , if Congress were to declare by statute what the prevailing market exchange rate between gold and silver was , and thus to " regulate " gold and silver coins vis - à - vis one another — or , more precisely , vis-à - vis the Spanish silver dollar that constituted the American monetary standard — then it would be properly exercising its constitutional power , which consists of nothing more than this .
That is why this power appears in the same clause with the power to " fix the Standard of Weights and Measures , " which involves the measurement of fixed standards in order to assure uniformity throughout the nation .
That power does not give Congress the power to declare that one - tenth of a pound shall now be declared a pound , but to take an already - existing standard and codify it .
Every single monetary statute enacted from the ratification of the Constitution until the 1930s understood the congressional power to regulate the " value " of money not in the sense of declaring money to possess some arbitrary value that suits the whims of politicians or central bankers , but in the sense of establishing the relative values of gold and silver coins in terms of the ever - shifting relative values of those metals on the free market .
( Needless to say , the market is perfectly capable of doing this on its own . )
Moreover , the " dollar " was not an arbitrary term at the time the Constitution was drafted .
In the late 18th century , everyone knew what the " dollar " referred to : the silver Spanish milled dollar , which was in widespread use in the United States .
The Constitution twice refers to the dollar — in Article I , Section 9 , Clause 1 ( a clause that everyone understood to involve a tax on the import of slaves ) , and in the Seventh Amendment ( which protected the right to a jury trial in civil cases involving at least twenty dollars ) .
If the dollar had been something that Congress could manipulate at will , or if " dollar " had been merely a generic term to refer to whatever Congress should arbitrarily choose to recognize as currency , the South would never have accepted that clause — or the Constitution itself .
Congress might have manipulated the dollar so as to make the tax on slave imports prohibitively expensive .
It could also have effectively abolished trial by jury in civil cases by making twenty " dollars " an astronomically high amount of money .
The Court never pronounced upon the constitutionality of the gold seizure ( for reasons we speculate on in our book ) , the legality of which it simply took for granted .
The cases it chose to hear involved the cancellation of gold clauses in public and private contracts .
Known as the Gold Clause Cases , Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. , Nortz v. United States , and Perry v. United States were argued in January 1935 and decided the following month .
In each case Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote the opinion for the Court ; Justice McReynolds composed a single dissent that he applied to all three .
The Court declared in the first two cases that the federal government had been entitled to cancel all private contracts in gold .
The perpetuation of gold clauses would have amounted to the " attempted frustration " of " the constitutional power of the Congress over the monetary system of the country … .
[ T ] hese clauses interfere with the exertion of the power granted to the Congress . "
Not a stitch of evidence existed for any aspect of this argument .
Perry , the third case , involved a man who had purchased in gold a US bond that was payable in gold , and was seeking payment either in gold or in the equivalent in paper currency .
Since the government intended to pay in depreciated dollars , he believed he was receiving far less than he was entitled to under the terms of the bond .
The bond 's face value was $ 10,000 in gold .
In the inflated dollars of post - gold - standard America , it would have taken nearly $ 17,000 in paper currency in order to satisfy what the government had contracted to pay him .
The Court declared that the plaintiff was indeed entitled to his gold , since the government had an obligation to live up to its promises .
But in not paying him his gold , the government was n't really wronging him , since gold was now illegal to hold .
In other words , if the government paid him in gold , it would then have to confiscate that gold from him anyway since holding gold was against the law .
Speaking for the minority , Justice McReynolds declared :
Just men regard repudiation and spoliation of citizens by their sovereign with abhorrence ; but we are asked to affirm that the Constitution has granted power to accomplish both .
No definite delegation of such a power exists ; and we cannot believe that the farseeing framers , who labored with hope of establishing justice and securing the blessings of liberty , intended that the expected government should have authority to annihilate its own obligations and destroy the very rights which they were endeavoring to protect .
Not only is there no permission for such actions ; they are inhibited .
And no plenitude of words can conform them to our charter .
To the argument that the bondholder had suffered no damage in being denied payment in gold since it was now illegal for people to own gold , the dissent replied : " Obligations cannot be legally avoided by prohibiting the creditor from receiving the thing promised … .
There would be no serious difficulty in estimating the value of 25.8 grains of gold in the currency now in circulation . "
The contract to pay in gold having been broken , the holder was at least morally entitled to receive in currency not just the nominal amount of the bond but an amount in paper dollars equivalent to what he would have earned if the payment could have been made in gold .
" For the government to say , we have violated our contract but have escaped the consequences through our own statute , would be monstrous .
In matters of contractual obligation the government cannot legislate so as to excuse itself . "
Suppose a private individual tried to do the same thing , " secreting or manipulating his assets with the intent to place them beyond the reach of creditors . "
Any such attempt " would be denounced as fraudulent , wholly ineffective . "
" Loss of reputation for honorable dealing , " the dissent concluded , " will bring us unending humiliation ; the impending legal and moral chaos is appalling . "
By the 1970s the federal government had once again permitted Americans to hold gold coins .
But when it came time to actually mint them again , it made sure that gold coins could never circulate and displace the constantly depreciating paper currency printed by the US government : the law required that such coins could circulate with a face value only a tiny fraction of their market value .
The full story of the gold confiscation is actually much worse than this , and we tell it in Who Killed the Constitution ?
What this episode teaches us is not so much that we need to " return to the Constitution , " though that would be an improvement over what we have now , but rather that pieces of paper that governments themselves interpret cannot be expected to prevent governments from doing what they think they can get away with .
Lysander Spooner once said that he believed " that by false interpretations , and naked usurpations , the government has been made in practice a very widely , and almost wholly , different thing from what the Constitution itself purports to authorize . "
At the same time , he could not exonerate the Constitution , for it " has either authorized such a government as we have had , or has been powerless to prevent it .
In either case , it is unfit to exist . "
It is hard to argue with that .
The idea that warfare helps the economy is a prime example of Bizarro logic , which has pervaded our collective consciousness since the 9/11 terrorist attacks , ideological fallout from the explosion of national hysteria that followed .
In Bizarro World , as we all know , the laws of nature and logic are inverted , so that up is down , freedom is slavery , and ignorance is strength .
In the post - 9/11 era , as I have often pointed out , we have finally arrived in a world where two plus two can and indeed often does equal five  if it suits the purposes of the War Party to deem it so .
Somewhere , George Orwell is n’t smiling .
He ’d no doubt be appalled , and a little nonplused , by the accuracy of his speculations in Nineteen Eighty - Four .
In the novel , you ’ll recall , the deliberate impoverishment of the ordinary “ proles ” and the Outer Party types was a matter of INGSOC policy , a theme underscored by the general shabbiness of Orwell ’s dystopia , what with the constant shortages and the way thing always seemed to be literally and physically falling apart .
Particularly striking is the Orwellian presentiment that the world of the future is bound to be poorer and , simultaneously , engaged in constant warfare .
This prediction seemed , for quite a while , to be one of the few he got wrong .
Yet Orwell , it turns out , was right ; it ’s just that the productive power of capitalism in the U.S. was so great that it coasted along for a long time on sheer momentum .
Our accumulated wealth reflected the dynamism of an earlier era .
This upward spiral of productivity and wealth - generation really crested during the 1950s , a period of unprecedented prosperity and cultural optimism , and the early 1960s  before the Vietnam war and the inflationary policies that financed it ate away at the heart of American prosperity , the necessary prelude to the “ stagflation ” of the Carter years .
Wars are expensive propositions , especially the sort of all - embracing , the - sky ’s - the - limit , multi- generational conflict envisioned by the War Party ‘s editorial board commandos .
Our $ 3 trillion war , as Nobel - prize - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes have dubbed it , is an albatross hung round the neck of the American giant , whose great neck is bowing under its weight .
The unipolar moment the neocons once exulted in will go down in the official record as the briefest incident in human history , albeit not the noblest .
This has n’t always been immediately obvious .
The false prosperity induced by the speeding up of the printing presses over at the Federal Reserve led to what Alan Greenspan once called “ irrational exuberance , ” a delusion created by the very easy money policies he carried out as head of the Fed .
No sooner had certain Beltway sages declared that the age of permanent abundance was upon us  and that this rendered the struggle against the Welfare - Warfare State irrelevant  than their economic cornucopia of limitless wealth went empty .
As banks are bailed out while ordinary Americans are turned out into the streets , the manic hubris of Fukuyama ‘s historical “ endism ” and prophecies of universal prosperity via “ globalization ” stand revealed in all their silliness .
Mania is invariably followed by a massive downward plunge into despair , in economic terms , a deep recession , if not something far worse .
So what has stopped the forward motion of America ’s dash over history ’s finish line ?
As Ron Paul has tirelessly explained , it is the cost of our expanding overseas empire that is driving us into bankruptcy .
We have , as the Old Right seer Garet Garrett put it , an empire of a unique type , one in which “ everything goes out and nothing comes in . ”
The costs of this are ordinarily hidden from sight , as Ron Paul explains , by governmental sleight - of - hand :
“ As the war in Iraq surges forward , and the administration ponders military action against Iran , it ’s important to ask ourselves an overlooked question :
Can we really afford it ?
If every American taxpayer had to submit an extra five or ten thousand dollars to the IRS this April to pay for the war , I ’m quite certain it would end very quickly .
The problem is that government finances war by borrowing and printing money , rather than presenting a bill directly in the form of higher taxes .
When the costs are obscured , the question of whether any war is worth it becomes distorted . ”
Yet there comes a time when the obscuring mists are cleared and the costs of our foreign policy of perpetual war become readily apparent , and surely that time is approaching .
Indeed , it may have already passed .
Garrett dubbed ours ’ “ the empire of the Bottomless Purse , ” yet we are just about scratching bottom about now .
It remains for Paul and the movement he generated to point out how all of this is paid for .
As Paul puts it :
“ Congress and the Federal Reserve Bank have a cozy , unspoken arrangement that makes war easier to finance .
Congress has an insatiable appetite for new spending , but raising taxes is politically unpopular .
The Federal Reserve , however , is happy to accommodate deficit spending by creating new money through the Treasury Department .
In exchange , Congress leaves the Fed alone to operate free of pesky oversight and free of political scrutiny .
Monetary policy is utterly ignored in Washington , even though the Federal Reserve system is a creation of Congress .
“ The result of this arrangement is inflation .
And inflation finances war . ”
When our rulers decide to go to war , they simply step on the gas and flood the engines of inflated expectations , fueled by bank credit expansion .
The results are the decline of the dollar and the current economic crisis , which might be compared to a hangover that follows an extended binge .
Americans are suffering a double - hangover in the sense that they ’re still recovering from the post - Cold War triumphalism that envisioned a unipolar , Washington - centered world .
The idea that the defense of the country requires an overseas empire that surpasses the British imperium at its zenith is a typical neocon fantasy , one that is proving far more costly than advertised .
Yet some are raking it in while others are foreclosed .
Remember how the sale of oil was supposed to pay for the Iraq war ?
A consortium of U.S. and European oil companies have since homesteaded the oil revenues Paul Wolfowitz assured us would be reimbursed to the American taxpayers .
It ’s funny how that works .
War , as the liberal intellectual Randolph Bourne famously explained , is the health of the state .
That is , it benefits state officials and their dependents , clients , and assorted sycophants at the expense of the rest of us .
Many are impoverished by our policies , but a few are enriched .
The beneficiaries are the growing administrative , corporate , and military bureaucracies that oversee our ever expanding global presence , in effect a colonial class .
This class pursues and secures its economic and social interests by means of directly influencing government policy , operating as an organized force on behalf of the policy of imperialism , so far with remarkable success .
When John McCain sneered at Mitt Romney ’s business experience as lacking in honor and the spirit of self - sacrifice , he was expressing the “ noble ” and highly stagy sentiments of this rising class .
Forget the free market fervor of the Reagan era , when entrepreneurs were valorized .
The new Republican hero is the swaggering caesar .
Is the Iraq war good for the economy ?
Well , whose economy ?
Who benefits from this war , and who loses ?
Once the American people realize that they ’re among this war ’s biggest losers  aside from the Iraqi people , and perhaps the Iranians , too  they ’ll turn on the beneficiaries with a vengeance .
As their savings are eaten up by inflation , and the equity they labored to preserve and increase evaporates into thin air , ordinary Americans are likely to be quite interested in the question : who ’s responsible ?
As the Federal Reserve pumps more funny money into circulation , in a desperate and vain attempt to postpone the crisis of the Warfare State , the single biggest winners are the banks , the most government - protected industry of all , who are the first to be bailed out of any crisis .
Oh , perhaps a few will be allowed to go under , but the big ones will be too big to fall , like Bear Stearns .
The economic elite will golden parachute its way out of the crisis .
The main beneficiaries of the present system  what Murray Rothbard , the late libertarian theorist and polemicist , called the Welfare - Warfare State  are the new plutocrats .
Think of what Ayn Rand referred to as “ the aristocracy of pull , ” the principal villains of her famous novel Atlas Shrugged , i.e. , corrupt businessmen who succeeded on account of their political connections rather than their entrepreneurial skill .
Today ’s aristocracy of pull is the militarized sector of the economy , which is completely dependent on government contracts .
Their political Praetorian Guard is represented in Washington by both parties , and , what ’s more , their partisans dominate think - tanks of the ostensible Left as well as the Right .
The task of those who oppose the new colonialism , which masquerades as global altruism of one sort or another , is to unmask the real motives and connections of a self - interested colonial class , which , in spite of its claim to the mantle of honor and duty to country , is supremely successful at promoting its own interests over and above those of the nation .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush condemned the escalated violence between Russia and U.S. - backed Georgia on Sunday , while Vice President Dick Cheney said aggression against Georgia " must not go unanswered . "
President Bush chats with Russian Prime Minister Vladmir Putin at the start of the Olympic opening ceremonies .
" My administration has been engaged with both sides of this trying to get a ceasefire , " Bush told NBC's Bob Costas in an interview in Beijing , China , where the president has attended Olympic events .
Bush was filmed speaking to Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin during Friday 's opening ceremonies and said Sunday that he " was firm with Vladimir Putin " and that " this violence is unacceptable . "
Violence has continued to rage between Russia and the western ally since Thursday , when Georgia launched an operation to crack down on separatists in South Ossetia territory .
Russia said it wanted to protect its peacekeepers already in South Ossetia following ceasefires in years past .
But Georgia called it a full - on invasion .
And while Russia has accused Georgia of a genocidal plot to cleanse the region of ethnic Ossetians loyal to Russia , Georgia accuses Russia of executing a long - planned war with the aim of taking control of the region -- including a key pipeline that carries Asian oil to Black Sea ports .

" I expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of Russia , " Bush said of his talk with Putin .
" We strongly condemn bombing outside of South Ossetia . "
Putin says he 's concerned about the flood of refugees arriving in Russia from South Ossetia .
Russian officials said more than 30,000 refugees have left South Ossetia and crossed into Russia over the past two days , Interfax reported .
" The actions of the Georgian authorities in South Ossetia are a crime , of course , primarily a crime against their own people , " Putin said , according to Russian news agency Interfax .
Meanwhile , Cheney talked to Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili on Sunday , telling him that Russia 's aggression against Georgia " must not go unanswered . "
Cheney 's spokeswoman Lea Ann McBride said the vice president spoke to Saakashvili to express " the United States ' solidarity with the Georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to Georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
Georgia withdrew its forces Sunday and offered a ceasefire , which Russia refused .
" The vice president told President Saakashvili that Russian aggression must not go unanswered , and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the United States , as well as the broader international community , " McBride said .
Saakashvili has called on the United States and the world community to stop the " intervention and invasion of my sovereign country . "
" I think the U.S. is the most powerful country in the world , " he told CNN .
" I think the U.S. has lots of leverage .
And I think there are lots of diplomatic means that it could be done through . "
Two senior officials have told CNN the United States sent envoy Matt Bryza to the region to help with mediation .
PHOENIX , Aug. 30 ( UPI ) --
Airline fares for U.S. holiday travel are soaring and travel consumers are encountering sticker shock , industry observers say .
Record fuel prices and flight cutbacks , coupled with still - high demand , are combining to produce unprecedented hikes in ticket prices , The Arizona Republic reported Saturday .
It said research shows Thanksgiving fares for Phoenix are up an average of 30 percent , or $ 84 , from 2007 levels , while Christmas prices are up 21 percent , or $ 65 per person .

The newspaper said Live Search Farecast , a Microsoft - affiliated company that operates Farecast.com , is reporting the holiday fare increases are the highest it has ever seen .
" This is truly remarkable , " Mike Fridgen , Farecast.com 's director of product management , told the Republic , adding that a reduced supply of seats at a time of high demand is " a recipe for high fares . "
Meanwhile , Don Gleason , vice president of travel for AAA Arizona , said the holiday airfare increases are at about 24 to 30 percent over last year , depending on the route .
" There will be a certain population that 's going to have to swallow hard and call Mom and say , ' I 'm not coming , ' " he told the newspaper .
" That 's the reality . "

Sen . Russ Feingold ( D - Wis. ) has emerged as one of the Senate ’s most outspoken defenders of civil liberties , casting the lone vote against the Patriot Act in 2001 and leading the charge against domestic spying and immunity for the telecom companies that provided customer data to the government under the Bush administration ’s warrantless surveillance program .
His efforts were set back on Tuesday , when the Senate passed the Protect America Act , by a 69 to 28 vote ( with 21 Democrats voting “ aye ” ) .
The bill gives the government expanded authority to monitor domestic communications and grants retroactive immunity .
In a recent interview , Feingold talked to Brian Beutler about the erosion of civil liberties , the Democrats “ constantly pulsating fear ” of being seen as soft on terror , and how an Obama or McCain administration might approach the unprecedented expansion of executive power .
Mother Jones : On FISA ( and the Protect America Act ) , a lot of people were impressed with the House Democrats ’ performance back in February when they refused to advance the Senate bill ( that extended the warrantless wiretapping program ) .
In the interim , what happened ?
Where was the pressure coming from within the Democratic party to revisit this issue and not wait at least until there was a new administration in place ?
Russell Feingold :
This is just really amazing to me , because there ’s always the pressure on this .
There ’s a very interesting thing that happens where people get fired up and people really have good instincts about civil liberties and would really prefer to be on this side .
I think that ’s what they really believe in .
So you get kind of a head of steam , which I noticed happened with the blocking of the reauthorization of the Patriot Act for a while , until people caved .
And it happened for a while even in the Senate on the PAA .
But what was a surprise was what the House did .
I mean that was really impressive that a group of people , including Steny Hoyer and others , stood up and said , “ No , we ’re not gonna do this . ”
But the problem is that there ’s this fear , that sort of grows over time , that somehow Democrats are gonna get hit over the head by claims that they ’re soft on terrorism .
And it always rears its head , especially when we ’re heading into a recess period or an election period .
We were able to make the argument early in the year that the orders were lasting for a year .
So even if the law expired , the orders allowing the surveillance were still in place .
Until August .
But as you get closer to these deadlines , the administration uses these intimidation tactics , and far too many Democrats fall for it .
There is this sort of inertia — if that ’s the right word — that leads to ultimately the caving of very large numbers of Democrats , even voting for an awful piece of legislation like this .
That ’s the only way I know how to describe it .
I do n’t know , the day - to - day pressure — it ’s like this constantly pulsating fear of being accused of being soft on terrorism .
MJ : How , politically , does one change that mindset — that being tough on national security means that the Democratic party has to support the erosion of civil liberties ?
RF : I think you show people that those who stand firm on this do just fine politically .
I like to think of myself as an example of that .
There are many people like that .
The truth is that if you properly articulate that you want to balance national security and make sure we protect civil liberties at the same time .
And take the time to go through the arguments , which are very frankly easy to win — these are not hard arguments .
When anybody really listens to it , they just kinda shake their head .
Then you can prevail and show people that you do n’t need to buckle at the knees on this .
But it requires a little patience .
It requires a little faith in peoples ’ willingness to listen .
And that ’s how in the long run you prevail .
And I ’m hoping that a lot of people who run this time , unlike a lot of people who ran in 2006 , are held accountable .
I ’m sure many of our candidates are gonna say , “ You know , I was against immunity and I do n’t like this bill . ”
Well , they need to be held accountable when they get here .
And that has n’t really happened .
We have a lot of Democrats , even some who voted to get us out of Iraq , who are n’t voting properly on this , in a way that is , frankly , very damaging to our efforts .
MJ : What ’s the fix ?
Is there one ?
And when ?
RF : Hopefully , under President Obama he will acknowledge , as he has in the past , not only how outrageous this immunity is — although that ’s gonna be very hard to deal with because the horse may already be out of the barn — but I think , even more importantly , he will have an opportunity to review these very expanded powers that are given to the government to surveil our international communications .
And to say , look , we need legislation that has some sort of court review and mechanisms for control of this , because it ’s completely lawless .
It ’s much harder to pass something and change it after the fact .
But I ’m hoping we ’ll have both houses ( of Congress ) and I ’m hoping Obama will understand how important this is .
And that will be a golden opportunity for him to correct one of many things that needs to be corrected from this administration .
So I ’m hoping it starts as early as January 20th .
MJ : What would a McCain presidency mean ?
RF : You know , I think McCain would be better on this than the current administration , to be candid with you .
There ’ve been some remarks that he ’s made about — even though he ’s pulled back some on telecom immunity — he ’s said that he would do no signing statements .
I think he knows and his people know that this administration is just out of control and is just really lawless .
But the difference between Obama and McCain on the specifics would be significant .
I think that Obama would be far more likely to insist on some court review and some protections against things like bulk collection of information , reverse targeting of Americans .
There ’s no question he would understand that and I would hope we ’d have a much better shot at him trying to correct those problems than Senator McCain .
MJ : What ’s the most egregious thing that ’s occurred during the Bush administration and what ’s the most important to scale back ?
RF :
It would be , I think , the overall assertion that , under Article II of the Constitution , the president can look at a clear statute that ’s been signed into law and ignore it because of his so - called commander - in - chief powers .
Whether that means a justification for warrantless wiretapping , whether that means saying , “ Look , I can do whatever I want on torture . ”
That overall assertion is the thing that underlies many of the specifics , and that ’s the one that needs to be pushed back to the Youngstown Steel case test articulated by Justice Jackson .
MJ : Assuming that does n’t happen , what is the most odious piece of legislation of the last seven years ?
RF :
The legislation is n’t as much the problem as , for example , the warrantless wiretapping program , which was instituted by executive order … .
This new president , whoever it is , has to renounce these extreme powers , or it ’s going to start getting locked into our constitutional history .
Right now the position of this administration is an outlier in the terms of our constitutional history .
If this new president does n’t renounce it and say , “ Look we ’ve gotta get this back in balance , ” then we will have altered the nature of our very Constitution .

UPDATED on 3/24/09 : After Bill O'Reilly 's despicable attack on fellow blogger Amanda Terkel , I wanted to make sure that the tools for fighting back against this abrogation of the basic rules of civility is available to everyone .
Bill O'Reilly uses typical tabloid journalism tactics to sneak up and sandbag you intentionally , so you will be off guard and a bit unprepared to answer his questions .
Usually one of his minions seeks out people who refuse to appear on his show or are unavailable for commenting on a particular topic that offends O'Reilly .
In many cases O'Reilly is really trying to hound people who call him out for his buffoonery .
So he 'll send his team to your house or apartment -- someplace that used to be off - limits -- so you will be vulnerable .
If you have family members or loved ones nearby , their privacy has been violated too .
O'Reilly catches people unloading their groceries in their driveways in a way that exposes people by publicizing where they live to a potentially lunatic public .
It 's really a nasty tactic .
These are the types of interviews his ambush producers -- including wanker extraordinaire Jesse Watters , aka the Falafel Flunkie -- revel in .
Not many of us would have the grace to handle it the way Bill Moyers does here .
So without any further ado , here 's my simple guide on how to deal with Bill O'Reilly 's level of unprofessionalism :
1 ) When Watters and crew jump out of a bush or from behind a parked car and surprise you , do n't be shocked .
Instead just smile and say , " You must be Jesse Watters from the O'Reilly factor , so nice to see you ... "
This will momentarily knock him off guard because he 's expecting you to cower from the sight of his microphone and cameras .
That 's nonsense .
The microphone and cameras are your friends --- remember that .
Repeat .
The microphone and cameras are " your friends "
2 ) Look directly into the camera and say , " Hi , Bill , how are you ?
I 'm so glad you tracked me down at my super market ( or gas station , bank , local mall , parking garage or front door . ) when I 'm trying to unwind .
3 ) Now comes the critical time .
When he asks you his misleading or false question about a bogus issue that Bill O'Reilly has trumped up to his FOX news audience , say :
" I 'll be happy to answer your questions , Jesse , but can I ask you something first ?
Are you embarrassed to be working for a man who got sued for sexual harassment by Andrea Mackris and lost millions of dollars ?
Jesse will look puzzled at first , so repeat this phrase .
Are n't you embarrassed to be working for a man who got sued for sexual harassment by Andrea Mackris and lost millions of dollars ?
Do n't you have any decency ?
Are n't you ashamed by that ? "
4 ) Watters will try to avoid the question by saying ' I 'm here to ask the questions , ' after he gets over the shock of your initial response to him .
Remember , the camera is your friend .
They can -- and will -- edit out anything they want , so he may hang in there for some time to try and get some usable footage .
Stay strong .
Ask him over and over again the Mackris question until he responds .
He may stop rolling the camera , but you can't trust him , because they may try to make it look like they are n't recording .
That 's dangerous territory , so here 's a basic rule :
Once Jesse Watters jumps into your space , everything is being recorded .
Period .
He may stop and look around and say , " I get it .
You 're trying to play with me . "
Just smile and say that you 're only trying to understand Bill O'Reilly .
Remember , the tape is always rolling .
5 ) If Jesse says he does n't know anything about it and tries to ask you a question again , please tell him to go to this website and see for himself .
There are over 20 pages available for him to get familiar with Bill 's loofah fetish .
Please memorize this URL ( http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/1013043mackris1.html).
After a few repetitions , you 'll know this like the back of your hand .
It 's really easy to do .
The only downside may be that you might hear the website address playing inside your head for a while ; kind of like when a song gets stuck there .
Do n't try and force it out ; silently let the web address finish to completion and then just think about something else .
It will soon disappear from your thoughts .
But if you try to force it away , it will not leave .
6 ) As a follow - up , ask him if he knows how much money Andrea Mackris was awarded to settle the suit out of court .
If he does n't know , say that you 've seen reports that estimate the sum at around 6 million dollars .
Ask him if he thinks that is a lot of money .
7 ) Ask Jesse Watters if he owns a condo in New York City .
Then tell him that Andrea Mackris bought a new condo as soon as she settled the case .
Ask him if that 's cool .
Ask him if he 's jealous and wishes Bill O'Reilly made sexual advances to him so he could sue and buy himself a condo in NYC .
Tell him that you 'd like to buy one across from Central Park ; you just love the view .
8 ) If he continues trying to get you to answer his questions , then pivot off Mackris and say , " OK , let me ask you this one :
" Did you feel bad that Bill O'Reilly blamed a 14 - year - old boy named Shawn Hornbeck for getting himself kidnapped and held in captivity as a sex slave for four years by the deviate Michael Devlin ? "
Use this link for reference .
Ask Jesse if he believes in the Stockholm Syndrome .
If he does n't know what that is --- tell him :
The Stockholm incident compelled journalists and social scientists to research whether the emotional bonding between captors and captives was a " freak " incident or a common occurrence in oppressive situations .
They discovered that it 's such a common phenomenon that it deserves a name .
Thus the label , Stockholm Syndrome , was born .
It has happened to concentration camp prisoners , cult members , civilians in Chinese Communist prisons , pimp - procured prostitutes , incest victims , physically and / or emotionally abused children , battered women , prisoners of war , victims of hijackings , and of course , hostages .
Virtually anyone can get Stockholm Syndrome if the following conditions are met : Perceived threat to survival and the belief that one 's captor is willing to act on that threat ;
The captive 's perception of small kindnesses from the captor within a context of terror ; Isolation from perspectives other than those of the captor ; Perceived inability to escape .
Tell him that Bill O'Reilly does n't believe in the Stockholm syndrome .
Ask him if he'd like to be kidnapped by a pedophile to test its legitimacy .
If he says no , then tell him that you think Shawn Hornbeck probably did n't want to test that theory either , but he had no choice .
Does n't he feel bad that Shawn Hornbeck was kidnapped and molested for four years ?
If he says yes , then say , " Will Bill O'Reilly apologize to Shawn on air ? "
If he says he does n't know , then ask him if he knew that Bill O'Reilly was cancelled from being the main speaker at the Missing Kids dinner in Florida because of his appalling commentary .
9 ) You 'll see Jesse Watters ' face turn red by this time , but he may feel that you 're out of ammo and will still try to get you to say something or do something , even if it 's out of context , so he can bring it back to his boss .
Be strong , you 're almost done .
If he tries again to ask you about whatever nonsensical Factor outrage of the day , just remember : the camera is your friend .
If you get nervous , just repeat your name and where you work .
Then ask him if he was as shocked as O'Reilly was that African Americans did n't say :
" Mother f&^ker , I want more ice tea at Sylvia 's restaurant in Harlem ? "
He may recoil from this or agree with O'Reilly that he too was surprised nobody got shot while they ate the dinner in Harlem .
10 ) Ask Jesse how he likes Michelle Obama .
If he balks and tries to ask you HIS question , just smile and ask if he will join Bill O'Reilly in the lynching party of Michelle Obama ?
In a discussion of recent comments made by Michelle Obama , Bill O'Reilly took a call from a listener who stated that , according to " a friend who had knowledge of her , " Obama " ' is a very angry , ' her word was ' militant woman . ' " O'Reilly later stated : " I do n't want to go on a lynching party against Michelle Obama unless there 's evidence , hard facts , that say this is how the woman really feels .
If that 's how she really feels -- that America is a bad country or a flawed nation , whatever -- then that 's legit .
We 'll track it down . "
Ask Jesse if he prefers to wear white hoods at his lynching parties .
He may have several colors to choose from .
11 ) Jesse probably will either give up or try valiantly one last time .
There 's a wealth of subjects to pull from at a moment 's notice for any sandbagging producer .
Here 's a few :
That should do it .
He 'll be long gone before you can ask him about Rick Santorum 's " man-on - dog " deal ... So , there you go .
A handy step - by - step guide to ward off the mosquito - like Bill O'Reilly camera crews and producers .
After a few minutes of study , you 'll be able to deal with anything that comes your way .
And always remember , the camera is your friend !

Update : The Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security ( CARES )
Act has expanded unemployment benefits by offering an additional $ 600 per week for those put out of work by the coronavirus .
See below for more information .
Unemployment sucks .
I know – I ’ve been there before .
I was unemployed for 6 months after I separated from The USAF .
It was n’t that I did n’t want to work — far from it .
I just had a difficult time finding work .
The fact that I relocated across the country and did n’t have a network to tap into made finding a new job an even more difficult task .
The good news is that unemployment insurance is there to help you bridge the gap between jobs .
Here is what you need to know about unemployment insurance and how to claim unemployment :
Expanded Coronavirus Unemployment Benefits In The CARES Act
Unemployment benefits programs are generally run by individual states .
However , in times of economic uncertainty , the federal government may step in and offer expanded benefits .
We last saw this during the Great Recession in 2008 - 2009 .
The coronavirus crisis is another example of the government stepping in to expend unemployment benefits .
The CARES Act improved unemployment benefits in the following ways :
It provides an additional $ 600 per week in benefits and payments through July 31 , 2020 .
in benefits and payments through July 31 , 2020 .
It adds an additional 13 weeks of benefits through December 31 , 2020 .
Most states currently offer 26 weeks of unemployment benefits ( see the unemployment benefits by state section below ) .
of benefits through December 31 , 2020 .
Most states currently offer 26 weeks of unemployment benefits ( see the unemployment benefits by state section below ) .
it expands benefits for part - time , seasonal , self - employed , and contract workers ( such as those in the gig economy ) .
Offers to reimburse the cost for states that waive the one - week waiting period before paying benefits .
When Will I Receive the Extra $ 600 Per Week in Unemployment Benefits ?
States are rolling this benefit out when the funding is being made available from the federal government .
So far , this benefit has rolled out in waves .
It will likely be staggered and there is no set timeline for all states to begin making the extra $ 600 weekly payments .
However , most estimates are that most states will be paying the extra $ 600 per week by mid- to late - April .
$ 600 weekly payments are retroactive to April 5 , 2020 .
The good news is that even if your state is n’t currently offering the extra $ 600 per week , you will be made whole , retroactive to April 5 , 2020 .
I know this does n’t help you now , but it will be good when it arrives .
Hopefully , you will receive your stimulus check in the meantime to help you bridge this period .
These additional payments will also not impact income - based benefits such as Medicaid .
What is Unemployment Insurance ?
Federal Unemployment
Insurance is a safety net designed to assist workers who are unemployed through no fault of their own .
Federal Unemployment
Insurance is run by your local state government but is funded by federal and state taxes which are paid by employers .
How to Qualify for Unemployment Benefits
Each state has its own requirements regarding unemployment benefits eligibility , so be sure to check with the state in which you are filing .
In general , the following rules will apply :
No fault loss of employment .
Most people who become unemployed through no fault of their own are eligible to file unemployment benefits .
Most people will be eligible for unemployment benefits if they were laid off for lack of work , and sometimes if you are put on a leave of absence , such as a temporary plant closing , or seasonal work .
You may also be eligible for other reasons of unemployment , such as being out of work due to a natural disaster , employer went out of business , job moved overseas , you completed your military obligation or other reasons .
Be sure to check with your state regarding your particular situation .
Must be physically able to work .
You must be physically able to work , available for work , and actively seeking suitable work .
Suitable work is generally considered employment in an occupation in line with your prior training , education , and experience .
Work may not be considered suitable if the wages , hours , or working conditions are not as favorable as most jobs in your occupation in the local labor market or if you are not physically able to perform the work .
Note :
If you are physically unable to perform work due to a disability , you may not be eligible for unemployment benefits .
This is because unemployment benefits and disability benefits come out of different pots of money .
If you are physically unable to perform work , you should look into state disability benefits .
Where to File for Unemployment Benefits
Each state is responsible for running its unemployment office .
A complete list of state unemployment offices can be found at the US Department of Labor Workforce Security site .
When You Should File for Unemployment Benefits
You should file for unemployment benefits as soon as possible because you can only receive benefits in weeks which you file a claim .
Most states have a 1 - 2 week waiting period , but you must still file to get on the books and continue filing each week that you remain unemployed .
Provided that your unemployment benefits claim is approved , you will most likely receive your first unemployment check during your second or third week of unemployment , depending on your state ’s unemployment benefit rules .
How to File for Unemployment Benefits
Gather your information .
You will need to provide your state labor board ( or other governing agency ) with your personal and work information .
Be prepared to provide your SSN , employment history for the previous 2 years ( employer name , location , the position held , etc. ) , the date you last worked , wage history , union information if applicable , DD Form 214 if recently separated from the military , education level , and possibly other information .
Apply online , by phone , or in person .
Different states have different setups , but most states now offer online unemployment benefits application , as well as by telephone or in person .
In some states , it is mandatory to meet with a career assistance advisor at some point .
Delay in approval ?
Keep filing weekly claims .
If your application is not approved right away , that does not mean you are not or will not be eligible for unemployment benefits .
Sometimes an extra form needs filled out of more information about your claim is needed .
Keep filing for unemployment benefits because you may receive benefits in arrears .
If you wait for a decision , you will not receive benefits for weeks in which you did not file a claim .
How Much Money Will You Receive for Unemployment Insurance ?
The amount of money you receive for your weekly unemployment benefit will vary depending on your earning history and the limits of your state .
When I filed for unemployment benefits in Texas I received $ 300 per week .
However , however , this was almost 15 years ago .
At the time , the unemployment benefits in Texas were around the national average .
Unemployment Benefits by State
Here is the state by state break down , as of 2020 :
Unemployment Benefits Are Taxable
Pay attention to the income tax question !
Unemployment benefits are considered taxable income for federal income taxes .
Taxes are not automatically taken out of your check , so if you want to avoid an unexpected surprise when you file taxes the following year , it may be a good idea to have taxes taken out when you receive your benefits .
If you choose to have taxes withdrawn , the IRS will automatically withdraw 10 % of your unemployment benefits .
Receiving Unemployment Benefits
File weekly claims .
Most states require people receiving unemployment benefits to file a weekly claim with their state .
This means you need to call in and verify that your status has not changed .
You can expect to go through an automated phone system that asks whether you are still physically able to perform work , if you are actively seeking work , if you earned any income in the previous week , and if anything about your situation has changed .
Get paid weekly or biweekly .
Each state determines how often they pay unemployment benefit recipients , but its payment is usually weekly or biweekly .
Be sure to check with your state ’s unemployment board .
Keep accurate records !
States require that you maintain a job search while receiving unemployment benefits , and you need to keep records verifying that you are searching for work – you must generally make 3 job searches per week , by either contacting employers , submitting resumes or going to interviews .
Tracking your job search efforts includes maintaining a list of jobs applied for or applications submitted .
Many states give you a Job Search Log to make tracking easier .
Make sure you keep accurate records because they can audit you later and you can lose your benefits if they discover you are not actively seeking new work .
Report any earnings .
You can still take on work while receiving unemployment benefits , but you must report it and your earnings will reduce the number of benefits you receive .
Still , it is better to earn some money through part - time work than to do nothing at all .
If you fail to report any earnings , you will have to pay back any benefits you received , plus interest .
If you knowingly fail to report earnings , you may be charged with fraud , which can result in a denial of benefits and additional penalties .
Receive benefits by check or direct deposit .
Most states offer both options for receiving unemployment benefits .
I recommend receiving your unemployment benefits by direct deposit if you have a bank account – that way you do not have to pay check cashing fees or wait for the mail , which can be unpredictable .
Direct deposit means you will receive your benefits more quickly .
If you need access to a good online bank , I recommend Capital One 360 or another free high - interest savings account that offers easy access .
How Long Can You Claim Unemployment Benefits ?
Time limits of unemployment benefits .
The length of time that benefits are available is determined by the State in which you file an unemployment insurance claim .
Benefits can be paid for a maximum of 26 weeks in most states , however , due to the current global economic crisis and mass layoffs in the United States , the US government and many states recently approved emergency unemployment compensation ( EUC ) , which extended unemployment benefits for certain individuals .
Unemployment Insurance Extended Benefits .
The basic Extended Benefits program provides up to 13 additional weeks of benefits when a State is experiencing high unemployment ( usually over 6 % , but check with your state ) .
Some States have also enacted a voluntary program to pay up to 7 additional weeks ( 20 weeks maximum ) of Extended Benefits during periods of extremely high unemployment .
Not everyone who qualified for regular benefits qualifies for Extended Benefits .
The State agency will advise you of your eligibility for Extended Benefits .
Can Seasonal Employees Claim Unemployment Benefits ?
Seasonal employees can collect unemployment benefits , with some exclusions or limitations .
It varies by state , and you should research the laws and rules in your state to verify the current status and your ability to file for unemployment benefits .
Exclusions : Federal law already prohibits professional athletes from collecting unemployment benefits between seasons , and teachers from collecting unemployment benefits during the summer .
After that , the federal law leaves most eligibility rules up to the states .
Some states are moving away from allowing seasonal unemployment benefits .
Several years ago , CNN Money reported that some states are limiting the unemployment benefits they pay to seasonal workers .
Until recently , most states allowed seasonal employees to collect unemployment benefits during the months when they were unemployed .
For example , school bus drivers , cafeteria workers , janitors , and many other school employees know they will be unemployed during the summer months .
This extends into the arts as well ; many actors , stagehands , musicians , and similar entertainment professions are routinely out of work between seasons .
Other examples of seasonal workers include construction , hospitality and tourism industries , etc .
There are currently 15 states that limit unemployment benefits to seasonal workers , and several more states have legislation in work to limit benefits or have commissioned studies to determine the impact this would have .
Is it Fair to Cut Unemployment for Seasonal Workers ?
Before we answer this question , it will be helpful to take a look at what unemployment insurance is , what it is designed to do , and who pays for it .
Then we can better answer the question .
Let ’s start at the source :
Contrary to popular belief , individuals do n’t pay unemployment insurance taxes .
Employers and the federal government pay into the unemployment system , and the states handle the distributions ( which is why they often have a little more say on who is eligible ) .
Unemployment benefits are more or less a safety net – they exist to help people through tough times when they lose their job .
Workers are usually eligible to receive unemployment benefits when they lose their job through no fault of their own ( there are some rules regarding eligibility , such as those listed for teachers , professional athletes , and some other cases ) .
These benefits are n’t designed to replace full - time income ( most benefits are capped at a few hundred dollars per week , depending on your income going into unemployment ) .
Instead , they are designed to help people get by until they can find another source of income .
There is also a time limit – usually 26 weeks , depending on the state ( some states have extensions depending on how high their unemployment rate is ) .
To continue receiving unemployment insurance benefits , recipients must be able to prove they are actively seeking employment .
This is usually done by sending in a list of jobs they have applied to , or places where they have submitted their resume .
Other Possible Benefits
One of the major concerns many people have when they become unemployed is losing their health insurance .
Along with unemployment benefits , you may be eligible to claim COBRA insurance coverage through your former employer .
Be sure to contact your former employer or health insurance provider for more details .

Do You Have To Pay Taxes On Unemployment Benefits ?
It may not seem very logical , but did you know if you are out of work and receiving unemployment benefits , you have to pay taxes on the money you are receiving while out of work ?
Sadly , it ’s true .
But many unemployed have no idea they are responsible for taxes on unemployment benefits and as a result , they get socked with a large tax bill in the new year .
It almost goes without saying that if you are out of work , you probably wo n’t have the extra cash to give to the IRS .
As with most forms of income , the IRS is ready to collect on the revenue you are receiving even if you are out of work .
The same is true on the amount of money you receive as part of a severance package or from accumulated vacation / sick pay once you leave a job .
How to Prepare for an Unemployment Income Tax Bill
The only way to avoid a hefty tax bill is to get prepared for the upcoming tax season .
Many people do not realize that taxes on unemployment checks are not withheld and it is the responsibility of the recipient to account for these taxes .
Last year the IRS recommended to all taxpayers to start withholding tax amounts from unemployment checks should they lose their jobs .
Much like those who are employed , those receiving unemployment could opt to have 10 % of their income withheld by completing Voluntary Withholding Request , Form W - 4V .
The request to withhold money should take into consideration of the $ 2,400 tax exemption .
Form 1099 - G will be sent out from organizations or governmental entities that issued unemployment benefits to recipients .
The 1099 - G will show the number of benefits that should be reported for the purpose of income taxes on the taxpayer ’s 1040 return .
Start Saving Now
If you have not been withholding your own funds or have not requested monies be withheld , start saving now .
Contact a licensed tax preparation professional to discuss the estimate of taxes owed .
Once you know about how much you ’ll have to owe , you can implement a savings plan to ensure you have enough money to cover the tax bill if you do n’t believe you are covered , especially if you have been out of work and receiving benefits for an extended period of time .
If you anticipate a future layoff , then it is a good idea to have taxes withheld if you begin receiving unemployment benefits .
It is also good to have an unemployment plan in place if you believe you may be in danger of facing a layoff .
Unemployment Benefits are There for you
Losing your job is a difficult experience , but thankfully we have unemployment insurance to fall back on .
With a positive attitude and a little luck , hopefully , you wo n’t need to claim unemployment very long .

A record 1.6 million barrels a day in U.S. refined petroleum products were exported during the first four months of this year , up 33 percent from 1.2 million barrels a day over the same period in 2007 .
Shipments this February topped 1.8 million barrels a day for the first time during any month , according to final numbers from the Energy Department .
The surge in exports appears to contradict the pleas from the U.S. oil industry and the Bush administration for Congress to open more offshore waters and Alaska 's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling .
" We can help alleviate shortages by drilling for oil and gas in our own country , " President Bush told reporters this week .
" We have got the opportunity to find more crude oil here at home . "
" As a nation , we can have more control over our energy destiny by supplying more of the oil and natural gas we 'll be consuming from resources here at home , " Red Cavaney , president of the American Petroleum Institute , said in a letter last week to U.S. lawmakers .
But environmentalists and other opponents to expanding drilling areas could seize on the record exports to argue Congress should not open more acres if U.S. refineries are churning crude oil into petroleum products that are sent out of the American market .
" It does n't look good to say : ' We need more oil . '
But then export the refined products that you 're getting .
It does n't seem to be consistent , " said Jim Presswood , energy lobbyist for the Natural Resources Defense Council .
But many energy experts say oil and petroleum products are traded globally , and it may make economic sense to export gasoline refined along the U.S. Gulf Coast to Latin America and import European - refined gasoline to U.S. East Coast markets .
" The fact is that the ( United States ) participates in global markets for both crude and refined products , and there are any number of variables that impact supply and prices in those markets , " said Bill Holbrook , spokesman for the National Petrochemicals and Refiners Association .
The White House said it was against requiring U.S. oil products to stay at home .
" Forbidding exports of U.S. petroleum reduces the incentive for domestic suppliers to produce , and could potentially lead to higher prices if U.S. production or refining declined , " said White House spokesman Scott Stanzel .
The 1.6 million barrels a day in record petroleum exports represented 9 percent of total U.S. refining capacity of 17.6 million barrels a day .
However , with refiners operating at 85 percent of capacity during the January - April period , the shipments represented a much a larger share of total U.S. oil products produced .
The exports were also equal to half the 3.2 million barrels of gasoline , diesel fuel and other petroleum products the United States imported each day over the 4 - month period .
The biggest share of U.S. oil products exported went to Mexico , Canada , Chile , Singapore and Brazil .
U.S. consumers are paying record prices for gasoline and diesel fuel , which the Bush administration blames in part on tight supplies .
While the administration argues that more supplies would help to bring down prices , U.S exports of diesel fuel in April averaged 387,000 barrels per day , up almost seven - fold from 59,000 barrels a day in the same month a year earlier .
U.S. gasoline shipments in April averaged 202,000 barrels a day , the most for the month since 1945 , when America was sending fuel overseas to ease supply shortages in other countries during World War II .
Gasoline exports in April 2007 were almost half at 116,000 barrels per day .
Residual fuel exports in April were 377,000 barrels per day , the fourth highest level for any month , and up 10 percent from 344,000 barrels per day a year earlier .
John Felmy , the chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute , said a portion of the oil products exported , especially diesel , was fuel that did not meet U.S. clean air requirements and therefore could not be sold in America .
" You may have some that you 're not able to use , " he said .
Also , while U.S. gasoline demand is down due to high prices and a weak American economy , there is " strong economic growth outside the United States " where fuel is often subsidized and demand is high , said John Cook , director of EIA 's Petroleum Division .
However , both the EIA and API admitted they did not know why daily U.S. gasoline exports to Canada skyrocketed to 41,000 barrels in January - April this year from 9,000 barrels in 2007 .
The EIA said more U.S. diesel is going to Latin American to fuel power plants because of a shortage of natural gas in the region , and China has switched to diesel from coal to run some of its generating facilities in order to reduce smog ahead of the summer Olympics next month in Beijing .
It may never garner quite the same broad appeal among DIYers as the incredibly versatile Wiimote , but it looks like the Wii Balance Board is nonetheless spurring on some hackery of its own , including being used as a navigation device for Google Earth and World of Warcraft .
While those hacks are certainly impressive enough , the board has only just recently fully earned its DIY cred by being used to control a robot , which you can see in action after the break .
What 's more , the man responsible for that hack , Juan González , is n't about to rest on his laurels , with him now promising to create a Segway - like device that 's controlled simply using the Wii Balance Board .
Needless to say , we 'll be keeping an eye out for any progress on that one .

My apologies to Neil Armstrong ... What is getting me so excited ?
This piece of news here : Dell announces Ubuntu 7.10 PCs with DVD playback
What 's so exciting about this ?
And besides , other operating systems , such as Windows , can play DVDs out of the box anyway , right ?
Well , no .
Wrong .
Sorry .
Ok , I do n't know what they have done with Vista now , but look at your recovery CDs for Windows XP .
Notice something ?
If you install from that recovery CD , Windows will not know how to play DVDs at all .
In fact , that 's exactly the reason why a commercial DVD player software is normally part of any Windows PC shipment .
The DVD player software comes on an extra CD and has all the right codecs .
It is of course pre-installed by the OEM ahead of time ( with the OEM probably paying the license fee for the DVD codecs , not Microsoft ) , so when you unpack your PC at home , it can play DVDs out of the box .
Very convenient , and makes it look as if Windows can do that .
But once you have to do an install from a recovery disk you realise that the DVD player install is actually an extra step .
Anyway , anyway .
People have used Linux for the longest time to view DVDs as well .
It just took some extra manual steps to get all the right codecs installed .
Without paying some fees somewhere , you can't get those codecs legally , which is why completely free Linux distros usually cannot include them .
You were always able to download the codecs ( more or less legally , depending on where in the world you are ) , but it was always that one additional manual step .
Now , with Dell stepping up and paying some small license fee to include the commercial LinDVD player software with each shipment of its Ubuntu PCs ( just like what they are already doing for their Windows shipments ) , users will get to enjoy exactly the same experience as the Windows customers : DVD playing abilities out of the box .
No extra steps required .
The fact that out - of - the - box DVD playing abilities were a much demanded feature for their Ubuntu PCs is a tell - tale sign that the Dell Ubuntu PCs have also been bought by people not overly familiar with Linux .
People who just want everything to work out of the box , not just long - time Linux fans or enthusiasts .
Installing the DVD codecs has been very easy on Ubuntu for a long time already .
Easy , if you know your way around a little bit , and know where to ask ( in the forums ) or which software to install ( Automatix , for example ) .
But with this now , Ubuntu PCs clearly have become one step closer to be readily usable by mainstream users .
And that is a giant leap for Linux .

The Bank of England is having problems controlling inflation Consumers will be " crucified " unless the government changes its inflation target , a leading economist has warned .
Peter Spencer from the influential Ernst & Young Item Club is urging ministers to change the 2 % inflation target used by the Bank of England .
He warned that interest rates would have to stay at 5 % if inflation is to be brought down to 2 % .
He added that keeping interest rates at their current level would hurt hard - pressed households .
With annual inflation at 3 % , the Bank has little room to cut borrowing .
March 's 0.8 % monthly rise in consumer prices was the steepest for nearly seven years .
Moving targets Bank of England Governor Mervyn King has said its rate - setting body , the Monetary Policy Committee , is facing its " most difficult challenge " with inflation rising and growth weakening .
It is required by government to focus on stopping inflation getting more than one percentage point above or below its 2 % target , but Mr King has warned that this condition is unlikely to be met for the foreseeable future .
The Chancellor should have a very good look at the specification of monetary policy
Peter Spencer , chief economic adviser , Ernst & Young Item Club Professor Spencer said consumers were paying the price for an inflation target that had become unrealistic given the volatility of oil and food prices .
" The consumer will have to be crucified in order to meet the inflation target as it stands at the moment , " Professor Spencer , who sits on a panel of economists known as the " Shadow MPC " , told the Daily Telegraph .
" If we stick with the current remit we will need to keep interest rates at or about 5 % for a good 12 months to get inflation back on track . "
" There is a very big ' if ' there .
The chancellor should have a very good look at the specification of monetary policy . "
Since 2003 the government has used the consumer price index ( CPI ) as its inflation benchmark that , in turn , is used by the MPC .
Leaving rates where they are now for the foreseeable future would further squeeze household incomes and force companies to cut jobs , Professor Spencer warned .
He called for the Bank of England 's remit to change so it focused on " core inflation " , a measure that excludes food and energy prices and is used in the US .
" The point is to nail your colours to a mast that you can actually control rather than house and energy prices which you cannot . "
Critics of this approach say excluding food and fuel costs from calculations would be absurd since they account for such a large slice of household budgets .
Mr King has warned that the economy is facing a " bumpy " period over the next year during which growth will slow markedly yet inflation remain well above target .

A debate has been raging for some time among those in the finance industry about whether the United States is currently experiencing inflation , deflation , stagflation , reflation , hyperinflation , or maybe even some other sort of " - flation " that only Dr. Seuss could imagine .
Unfortunately , much of this debate is unproductive because the participants use varying definitions of these terms , and even when they use the same ones , deciding on one simple label might not be sufficient to describe the deeper economic forces at work and what their effects are likely to be .
Given the confusion , this article will add some color to the debate by offering usable definitions of the terms inflation and deflation and then attempt to show what is occurring in today 's economy .
What Is Inflation ?
The most commonly used definition of inflation — a general increase in the prices of goods and services — is probably the least descriptive , and it is certainly the most misleading .
By no coincidence , this is the definition used by politicians , major financial newspaper columnists , and CNBC pundits ; and it is the one taught in public high schools and colleges .
The reason that this definition is misleading is because , as described in a recent article , it detaches the cause of the phenomenon ( an increase in the money supply ) from its eventual effects ( an increase in the prices of goods and services ) .
Furthermore , use of this definition also leads to such ridiculous terms as " food inflation " to describe price increases in a few specific agricultural commodities .
The absurdity of this notion can be seen when one realizes that nobody ever complains of " stock inflation " or " housing inflation " and that no economics textbook contains a case study that explains how monetary policy caused " Beanie Baby inflation " from 1995 to 1999 .
If we agree with Milton Friedman 's famous dictum that " inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon , " then we should adopt a definition that explicitly acknowledges this point .
Prominent Austrian economists such as Ludwig von Mises , Henry Hazlitt , and Murray Rothbard have presented definitions that vary slightly from one another , but one aspect common to all of them is an increase in the money supply .
[ 1 ]
Accordingly , I will adopt that simple definition .
Deflation will be defined conversely as a decrease in the money supply .
In order for these definitions to be meaningful , however , one must also have a precise definition of money .
What Is Money ?
Money , as Frank Shostak succinctly explains , is " that for which all other goods and services are traded . "
In practice , money is typically a homogenous and durable good that is universally recognized as something of value and which people are willing to accept in exchange for goods and services .
It might be gold or pieces of paper physically exchanged in transactions , or it might be such items stored in institutions like banks and drawn upon by checks , debit cards , or other means .
Complications arise in applying this definition , however , due to practices such as fractional - reserve banking .
When a depositor places a sum of money in a checking account at a fractional - reserve bank , the bank may loan out 90 % of his deposit to another person with the assumption that the depositor will not withdraw all of his funds .
When the bank extends such a loan , the depositor has effectively loaned his money to the borrower , but without his knowledge .
In fact , both the depositor and the lender will have legal title to the same sum of money at the same time .
Insofar as the depositor believes he can withdraw his money from the bank at any time , he perceives that he still possesses 100 % of his deposit .
As a result , the money supply has effectively become 190 % of what it was originally .
But this is just the first step .
As the new money is deposited in turn , it generates yet more new money , which can also be deposited , on and on through the banking system until the money supply grows to as much as 1,000 % of what it was originally .
While loans like the one above , which Ludwig von Mises referred to as " circulation credit , " have the effect of increasing the money supply , they lie in stark contrast to loans in which the lender temporarily gives up the right to his money , as happens when a depositor purchases a certificate of deposit from a bank .
During the term of the CD , the depositor presumably understands that he cannot withdraw his money , and he adjusts his behavior and use of money based on that understanding .
To underscore the point , a loan that involves a temporary transfer of money from one party to another does not increase the money supply .
A loan in which the lender somehow retains full title and use of the lent funds does increase the money supply .
Inflation or Deflation ?
In order to determine whether inflation or deflation is occurring , it then becomes a simple matter of measuring the money supply .
Conveniently , the Ludwig von Mises Institute recently began publishing True Money Supply ( TMS ) data .
Unlike the various " M " monetary aggregates published by the Federal Reserve , the TMS properly includes those accounts that are money and excludes forms of credit that resemble money but are not ( e.g. , money market mutual funds ) .
A graph of the TMS for the past five years is shown below :
While there are slight downward movements in the TMS from time to time , it has generally been increasing , and has continued to do so through its most recent measurement in April 2008 .
Accordingly , using my definition , we are experiencing inflation .
While that much is perfectly clear , one must be careful not to draw certain conclusions based on that observation .
Bad Inflation , Not -Bad Inflation
One reason that Austrian economists place so much emphasis on the phenomenon of inflation is that it often causes boom - bust cycles .
It is a specific type of inflation , however , that causes unsustainable booms , which I term " bad inflation . "
This is the type of inflation that occurs in fractional - reserve banking , where money that is intended to be used for current consumption is loaned out to businesses , sending false signals about people 's preferences for current vs. future consumption , which makes it impossible for businesses to properly allocate resources .
To the extent that market participants are not aware of the money creation or are not able to determine its rate or otherwise adjust for it , they will undertake business ventures and adopt consumption patterns that are unsustainable .
In precisely the same way that Ponzi schemes can operate seemingly healthily for years or more before collapsing , the unsustainable booms caused by " bad inflation " might persist for a while , but will eventually go bust when reality surfaces , prices adjust , and previously profitable enterprises go out of business .
The other type of inflation that can occur I term " not - bad inflation . "
This type of inflation does not lead to harmful booms and busts , but it 's not necessarily " good " in any sense either .
Rather , it is a natural occurrence in a truly free market .
An example of this type of inflation would be found in a society where gold is used as money .
In such a society , it would be expected that some amount of gold would be mined from the earth and added to the money supply each year .
As long as the rate of this dilutive increase in the money supply was acceptable to the populace ( if it were not , a different commodity would be selected to function as money ) , entrepreneurs would adjust their calculations and business plans based on this dilution .
If the growth in production of goods and services was faster than the growth in the money supply , the economy would experience gradually falling prices .
Goods and services would go down in price vis -à - vis gold , and everyone would adjust his or her expectations to these falling prices and behave accordingly , exactly as people in modern society must adjust their behavior to rising prices .
To provide further illustration of why " bad inflation " leads to errors in decision making , consider the example of a valet parking service in an office building .
Every morning when you arrive at work , you leave your car with the valet .
In the evening , you retrieve your car and leave .
Now assume that the valet has surreptitiously opened a side business where he loans your car to a taxi driver for a few hours during the day ( much like a fractional - reserve bank ) .
As long as you never leave during the day , no problems will occur .
However , if you make the assumption that you can retrieve your car any time you want , and you attempt to do so one day based on that assumption , you will discover that your car is missing and you will not be able to honor the lunch commitment you made earlier in the day . [ 2 ]
Now consider the above scenario with one small change : the valet has disclosed his side business to you .
Assuming that you consent to it ( perhaps he reduces your parking fee ) , you will not assume that your car is available to you during the business day .
You will therefore plan accordingly and avoid the errors that would be inevitable in the first scenario .
Unsustainable Booms
As noted above , the United States is undergoing inflation , and under the Federal Reserve System ( FRS ) , inflation is primarily driven by the extension of circulation credit by private banks that are members of the FRS .
As such , it is " bad inflation . "
Those familiar with the Austrian theory of the business cycle might therefore hastily conclude that the United States will continue to experience an unsustainable boom and that prices of commodities will continue to rise , just as they have been for the past few months .
However , drawing such a conclusion would be premature .
Widespread business failures and cutbacks in consumption are threatening the solvency of the banks that are responsible for creating money .
As these banks discontinue loans to capitalize their losses , the amount of money in circulation will tend to decrease .
This pressure could eventually overwhelm whatever new money the FRS is creating elsewhere and lead to deflation .
Those who insist that Federal Reserve policymakers have the ability to simply print up as much money as they want are completely right in one sense , but they perhaps fail to realize that the bulk of the money supply is in the form of circulation credit , which banks , rather than the Fed , produce .
The Fed directly controls only the monetary base , which is basically comprised of physical currency and bank reserves .
When the Fed purchases securities through its open - market operations , the monetary base increases by a corresponding amount , but it is ultimately the banks and their customers who determine the amount of circulation credit built on top of the monetary base .
This is where the idea of the Fed " pushing on a string " takes its meaning .
The Fed can let out slack to the banks by buying securities from them to increase their reserves , but it cannot force them to take up that slack by loaning those reserves to businesses .
To see the size of the monetary base relative to the overall money supply , consider the graph below :
As the graph shows , the monetary base is roughly $ 850 billion , compared to the TMS , which is about $ 5.4 trillion .
The Fed therefore directly controls only about 15 % of the money supply .
It should be noted that despite many people 's claims that the Fed has been inflating tremendously in the last year , the monetary base remains relatively flat .
Therefore , the Fed is not " printing , " but is instead relying on banks to expand the remainder of the money supply .
And as long as they continue to experience losses ( perhaps due to holdings of subprime securities or other impaired investments ) , their ability to extend new loans will be reduced , and there will be downward pressure on the money supply and potentially deflation .
The Fed's Response
Most people are led to believe that deflation is a bad thing , but it is not .
In fact , it is precisely what the economy requires to eliminate the malinvestment created by the Fed 's inflationary policies .
Unfortunately , deflation tends to be politically unpalatable because it causes , among other things , a temporary increase in unemployment as capital resources are reallocated to more productive sectors .
Accordingly , it can be expected that the Fed will do anything it can to avoid deflation , not to mention the fact that its chairman , Ben Bernanke , has gone on record discussing the importance of preventing " deflation " ( he uses a definition of falling prices ) .
Given the goal of avoiding deflation ( using my definition ) , the Fed can go one of two routes .
It can " print " large amounts of money and inject it into the economy by various means , but this runs the risk of leading to hyperinflation [ 3 ] due to the " multiplier effect " : if reserve requirements for banks remain constant , any addition to the monetary base could result in an increase of up to 10 times that amount in the overall money supply .
So if the Fed increases the monetary base too quickly , the very potential for further explosive growth in the money supply could lead to an utter loss of faith in the dollar and its abandonment by foreign central banks and other large holders of dollars .
And for the government , to destroy a fiat currency system such as the dollar is to kill the goose that laid the golden egg .
Despite any disagreements one may have with Ben Bernanke on economic theory , he is no fool .
So far he has been supportive of mild forms of Keynesian deficit spending , but he has not yet resorted to printing .
I find it doubtful that he will pursue any policy in earnest that he believes will cause hyperinflation .
Instead of printing , the Fed 's second option is to try somehow to convince banks to extend more loans , businesses to borrow and expand , and consumers to continue to consume .
This is quite a challenge indeed , given the general negative sentiment in the business world .
The housing bust has led to the laying off of many workers and the realization by homeowners that they are n't as wealthy as they thought they were .
Automakers and other retailers are struggling , and other problems continue to plague nearly all areas of the economy .
The Fed 's challenge is compounded by the fact that its lowering of interest rates has led to the dollar 's weakening significantly against foreign currencies , which has had the effect of increasing the prices of imports , leading to further cutbacks in consumption and investment .
In order to combat the deflationary forces affecting banks , we see the Fed doing everything in its power short of printing money to prevent them from experiencing losses .
This is why we have seen the Fed take actions that , as former Fed chairman Paul Volcker has said , " extend to the very edge of its lawful and implied powers . "
When the Fed provided $ 30 billion in financing for J.P. Morgan to acquire Bear Stearns , it bailed out not Bear but Bear 's credit counterparties .
If it had allowed Bear to go bankrupt , the banks that had loaned Bear money would have had to take losses , thereby reducing their reserves and their ability to extend credit elsewhere .
It is even possible that Bear 's bankruptcy would have caused other large firms to become insolvent and declare bankruptcy as well .
In other attempts to encourage banks to create money , we have also seen the Fed create three new lending facilities ( the TAF , the TSLF , and the PDCF ) — in succession , in the hope that the additional liquidity they provide would induce banks to extend more credit .
While each of them might have achieved limited success in doing so , there is no telling what other sorts of imaginative creations the Fed will reveal next if banks continue to experience losses and reduce the amount of circulation credit .
Conclusion
Ultimately , the debate over whether we are experiencing inflation or deflation is a simple one if it is only a matter of observing the change in the money supply .
The debate becomes far more complex , however , if its purpose is to predict what will happen in the future .
While measures of the money supply might provide some indication of where things are headed , one must also have a thorough understanding of the workings of the banking system and the role of businesses and consumers in the creation and destruction of money .
The Fed has already taken several drastic actions in an attempt to prevent deflation , but it remains to be seen whether it is even possible for it to achieve such a goal without destroying the dollar and the entire financial system .

The shocking death of a Bountiful man was witnessed by his former girlfriend hundreds of miles away today .
Twenty - four - year - old Brent MacMillan died from a single , self - inflicted gun shot wound to the chest .
His death was witnessed by his ex-girlfriend in California , who watched it via a webcam .
When you think of webcams , you think of them being used by soldiers overseas or during business conferences , not so people can witness a suicide .
But this is n't an isolated case ; it 's happened several times before .
When police surrounded the Bountiful home following a call about a suicidal man , they thought things could turn out well .
Lt. Randy Pickett , with the Bountiful Police Department , said , " We had a negotiator present who tried to make contact with the person inside .
He was able to do so they talk for a minute . "
Not only did the negotiator talk to MacMillan , police say he agreed to give himself up and come out peacefully .
Instead , " About two or three minutes later , the officers heard a shot , " Pickett said .
MacMillan shot himself in the chest with a hunting rifle .
The entire event was broadcast live on a web camera watched by his former girlfriend in California .
" She saw what happened .
She saw him shoot himself , " Pickett said .
It 's a disturbing use of technology , and it's not the first time it 's happened .
In Britian , 42 - year - old Kevin Whitrick committed suicide by hanging himself in front of his webcam .
A chatroom user alerted police .
And in India , a dental student hung himself with his web camera focused on his body .
In both cases , officials said there were signs leading up to the deaths .
In Bountiful police are still gathering information about MacMillan 's state of mind but say he had recently broken up with his girlfriend , moved to Utah and was struggling to get on his feet .

Calculating the true cost of downtime is almost impossible .
There 's not only the obvious loss of labor to consider , but all sorts of indirect losses like missed opportunity , repair expenses , customer frustration and so on .
Fortunately for Eric M.'s company , the management knows exactly how many real dollars it will cost them when their system -- " MCL , " as I 'll call it -- goes down .
Eric 's employer is a logistics service provider with a sole customer : a major U.S. automaker .
His company is primarily responsible for getting the right auto parts to the right areas in the right plants , on time .
Any unexpected delay or shipment error and the entire assembly line can shut down -- and when that happens , the service provider gets to foot the bill to the tune of $ 5,000 per minute .
To manage this mission - critical distribution operation , the logistics service provider trusts MCL .
The MCL system is also responsible for running the rest of the company 's mission - critical operations .
As each of the 500 - per - day trucks pull up to the company 's massive warehouse with inbound material , MCL tracks and directs them to one of the 200 or so loading docks .
Similarly , when the 300 or so crates on the trucks come in , their order number is scanned and the contents moved .
When the thousands of daily parts requests come in from the automaker , warehouse workers fill up hundreds of labeled containers and place them on one of the 200 or so daily outbound trucks .
All in all , MCL handles hundreds of thousands of requests from users throughout the company , and is absolutely critical to the operation .
So for such an important application , with such an expensive rate of failure , what highly reliable application platform did the software developers choose ?
Microsoft Access .
Running the System
Though generally slow , incredibly clunky and very confusing to use , MCL actually manages to work .
Most of the time , at least .
When it does n't work , however , all hell breaks loose .
If the automaker 's incoming orders can't be added in MCL , the receiving server does the only logical thing : it sends the incoming datastream to large , continuous - feed printers .
From there , the IT staff - Eric included - has to manually do all of the error checking , organizing and coordinating , and literally run the orders to the right area in the 45 - acre warehouse .
While the occasional hiccup is n't too bad , if all of the incoming orders are dumped to the printer , as has occasionally happened , the IT staff can process them for all of 15 minutes before getting completely overwhelmed with a never - ending stream of paper .
Learning the Hard Way
Of course , as a new developer , Eric had not been apprised of the criticality and sensitivity of MCL .
With no development , testing or QA environment for MCL in sight , Eric did the most sensible thing he could think of before developing some minor changes to a report : he exported a table from the live database to his local workstation .
That way , he would n't have to risk impacting the live system with his report development .
As it turned out , that was n't such a good idea .
After a few minutes of watching the " Exporting Table ... " dialog , Eric 's screen flashed and a lock icon appeared in the upper - right corner .
Windows Task Manager opened up and , unable to move the cursor himself , Eric watched the ghost in his machine click on one program after another , terminating each one .
Shortly thereafter , Notepad opened up and the following came in , letter after letter :
DO NOT DO WHATEVER YOU WERE DOING !!
YOU DEADLOCKED -- MCL CRASHED !!!!!
- THANK YOU , IT / MCL SUPPORT
Consequences
Though Eric did n't get in any trouble for single - handedly crashing the company 's mission - critical system , he did learn how painful it was to manually process the 17 orders that did n't make it into MCL while he had inadvertently deadlocked it .
He was lucky , though .
The last deadlock brought the entire operation to its knees , requiring a few hundred orders to be manually entered .
This , in turn , caused the warehouse workers to not only pack the wrong items , but get them out after deadline .
All told , the production line had to be shut down , leaving Eric 's company with a $ 285,000 bill .
Not too bad for an hour 's worth of work .
