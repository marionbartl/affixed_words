Editor 's Note :
This article has been edited to further clarify that the RIAA 's complaint in the Arizona case focuses on files the defendant allegedly placed in a shared music folder .
You buy a CD .
You rip a digital copy so you can put it on your Apple ( Nasdaq : AAPL ) iPod or Microsoft ( Nasdaq : MSFT ) Zune .
You 're not worried ; you paid premium price for the CD .
You 're not some lawless pirate .
You would n't dream of sharing your music on a P2P network .
Well , you may be walking a fine line toward thiefdom in the eyes of the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , the industry trade association that includes heavyweights like Sony ( NYSE : SNE ) BMG , Warner Music Group ( NYSE : WMG ) , Vivendi Universal , and EMI .
Current litigation against Jeffrey Howell of Arizona shows that while the industry 's gone after him for file - sharing , not ripping , MP3s , it 's also taking exception to recordings on his computer that he copied from CDs he purchased , with the outlook that Howell is also liable for the " unauthorized copies " he allegedly placed on his PC in a shared folder , which can be used to distribute to P2P networks .
Although there 's a lot of clarification going on over the Internet now -- pointing out that the RIAA can't specifically target ripping CDs for personal use , since that falls within " fair use " -- the RIAA has n't lent much reason to give it the benefit of the doubt as a reasonable entity here lately .
After all , a lawyer for Sony BMG said during a recent high - profile file - sharing trial that making one measly copy was , " a nice way of saying ' steals just one copy ' . "
I joked at the time that maybe they 'll come after us for singing tunes in the shower , but at this point , maybe that thought is n't funny so much as scary .
I 'd think companies like Apple , Microsoft , and Amazon.com ( Nasdaq : AMZN ) might start to get uncomfortable , since their participation in the varying channels of the digital music business rely on content that can be used with electronic devices in a way consumers can accept .
If the RIAA does start targeting personal use , it certainly could spur a newfound revolution away from legit services ( or even to new , more innovative solutions ) .
As it stands , the industry already seems almost hell - bent on creating plenty of disgruntled customers who do n't particularly want to do business with it anymore ... and then suing them for it .
As I 've said before , a good sign of a dying industry that investors might want to avoid is when it would rather litigate than innovate , signaling a potential destroyer of value .
If it starts to pursue paying customers -- which does n't seem that outlandish at this point -- then I guess we 'll all know the extent of the desperation .
Investor , beware .

WASHINGTON —
There is no set piece more emblematic of the tragic farce that is the American involvement in Iraq than the grotesque episode of Blackwater USA and the killing of civilians in Baghdad — at least nine and as many as 28 — on Sunday .
Everyone has reacted on cue with the usual expressions of outrage or , at minimum , grave diplomatic concern over the fusillade of gunfire that was unleashed against Iraqis who apparently were bystanders to the passing of an American convoy that was being escorted by heavily armed Blackwater security guards .
The Iraqi government said it was pulling the private security firm ’s license to operate in the country , and has asked that its contract be severed .
But it seems there may not be a license , or if there was , it would have been granted by that wonderment of bureaucratic dysfunction and sectarian passion , the Iraqi Interior Ministry .
The U.S. State Department , meanwhile , says it has n’t been informed that Iraq has “ lifted , suspended or terminated ” any permit .
No matter .
American diplomats now are sequestered in their Green Zone fortress , unable to motor around Iraq without their mercenary guards who have , in the interest of cooling tempers , been temporarily sidelined as investigations proceed .
Yet it ’s almost without question that , soon enough , some private security contractors will be back in action .
They are as crucial to sustaining the American military occupation of Iraq as is the president ’s unrepentant refusal to end it .
All the essential elements of governance in the Bush era come together in the Blackwater episode .
The heavy use of private armies — “ corporate warriors ” is the term used by Brookings Institution expert Peter Singer — helps to hide the initial and catastrophic decision to limit the number of American troops deployed far below what many military experts said was necessary to pacify post- invasion Iraq .
Secrecy , another administration hallmark , prevented even the Congressional Research Service from getting a definitive count of the number of private contractors taxpayers support .
“ The executive branch either has not kept sufficient records to produce or has been unwilling to present basic , accurate information on the companies employed under U.S. government contracts and subcontracts in Iraq , ” the researchers reported in July .
Add the odor of political cronyism : Blackwater ’s founder , Erik Prince , has deep ties to the Republican Party and conservative religious organizations .
He was a Republican congressional aide and briefly an intern in the White House of President George H.W. Bush , according to The News & Observer in Raleigh , N.C.
When four Blackwater employees were murdered in Fallujah in 2004 , the company turned for public relations and lobbying advice to the Alexander Strategy Group , a now - defunct Republican lobbying firm that was closely linked to former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay .
Meanwhile , the zone of lawlessness the Bush administration created for detainees at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , for its global network of secret prisons and in its domestic surveillance program extended , as well , to private contractors .
Under an order issued by the Coalition Provisional Authority , the American occupation bureaucracy that governed Iraq in the initial months after the invasion , private security contractors are immune from any legal action , including prosecution , that arises from their work .
Nor are they subject to U.S. military law as are regular American forces .
A law enacted in 2000 that conceivably could cover them has n’t been tested .
Nor , Singer says , has a 2006 effort to bring the private forces under the military justice system been implemented .
And no one — not the White House nor the Pentagon nor , apparently , the State Department — heeded repeated reports of abuse and flagrant violence against Iraqis that have dogged the private security guards for years .
“ Everybody has known about these problems , ” Singer told me in an interview .
“ They ’ve been widely reported . ”
The Army ’s investigation of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal identified private contractors as responsible for more than a third of abuses and identified six employees as culpable , Singer says .
Yet , unlike soldiers who were court - martialed for their crimes at Abu Ghraib , no private contractor has been prosecuted .
There even was a “ trophy video ” — of contractors for one security company shooting at Iraqi civilians — that the guards themselves posted on the Internet .
We have reached the inevitable moment of anger and recrimination .
In keeping with the administration ’s overarching philosophy that private business is always better — at everything — than government , we have privatized the most elemental government function of waging war .
Now we will pay dearly for this folly .

The Game of the Century : IVAW vs. the Neocons >>
War Supporters " Spit " on Iraq War Vets in DC By Ward Reilly [ Printer - Friendly Version ] IVAW in DC , September 15 , 2007 Fifty Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans , members of Iraq Veterans Against the War , led 100,000 other American citizens in a huge demonstration and march in Washington DC on September 15 .
They were exercising the Rights that they thought they had just earned on the battlefield .
Behind them , thousands of other military veterans , including many members of VVAW and VFP followed .
IVAW marched as in a military company , in formation , with a 7 man honor guard front and center , all in their military uniforms .
They carried the US flag , as did many of the vets and citizens , in the position of " distress . "
ALL of them were called " cowards , " " traitors " or " disgraces " ... there were hundreds of " fuck you 's " screamed at them , and there were even screams of " we 'll kill YOU later " coming from the pathetic group of 1,000 pro war citizens that formed a thin line in a few small areas along the route of the march , and the pro-war group ALL claimed that they " supported the troops . "
Does any else see the extreme irony here ?
This " proud " group of fanatics even took the time to stomp on the father of an Iraq war KIA , as he was walking back to his car after the march had ended .
They kicked him a dozen times when he was down on the ground , and shredded the picture of his son that he carries on top of the coffin that he was pulling .
I guess the " Eagles " support " Gold Star " family 's too .
And not a cop in sight .
The police were all waiting for us at the Capitol I guess , protecting an empty building against the petition to end the war that was signed by about 1,000,000 people , that we wanted to leave there .
Apparently " spitting on the troops , " as it were , equates to " supporting the troops , " at least if you are a so - called " Gathering of Eagles " or " Move America Forward " member , which are pro-neocon , pro-war groups .
This gang is given support by the national media , in the form of Michele Malkin and Rush Limbaugh , among others ... 2 more military experts that blindly suck Dick Cheney 's ass .
Two more war freaks that never served a second in the military .
The " Eagles " even had bright red arm bands , just like the nazis used to wear , except with black eagles instead of swastikas .
I swear .
The Cheney and Bush fan club .
They are more like the " Gathering of Vultures , " if you ask me .
They support the genocidal slaughter of innocent people .
They support killing kids and torturing innocent humans .
They support the sending of our children into an unjust occupation , where they are hated for being occupiers , so their minds will be screwed forever .
You know , troop and flag support .
But the troops know the truth .
This is one group of eagles that is fortunately on the endangered list , and becoming extinct soon .
In that there were 1,000 of them , vs. 100,000 anti-war attendees at the march , you can get a true representation of the percentage of the nation that still supports having troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
99 % against the occupation , and 1 % for the occupation .
The majority rules here , right ?
I love it when these folks show up to scream and hate .
I 'm from south Louisiana , and they give any protest march sort of an Mardi Gras feel .
Anti Mardi Gras that is .
I felt like throwing them something ... doubloons , beads , or maybe my old military medals or awards .
I want to tell them " thanks for your support , " you know ?
Can you even imagine standing on the side of the road for 5 hours so that you can scream " fuck you traitors " to a bunch of military veterans as they walk by ?
How sick is that ?
All that troop support is going to give those eagles a heart attack someday , and it can't be soon enough .
What they have done by spitting on the troops , especially by hating the Iraq and Afghan vets , is simply traitorous .
Just like their heroes are .
And the way that they conduct themselves represents the Bush administrations policies perfectly .
Thanks for showing up , Eagles , the anti-war movement needs your type of " support " to stop the wars .
Keep it up , FOX is watching you .
And you taught these newly returned vets , and thousands of our new radical youth , who really spits on the troops , and who really supports the troops .

The Game of the Century : IVAW vs. the Neocons >>
An MIT materials scientist 's research on sea snails has helped transform battery technology and may end the era when cell phones die if they 're dropped and PDAs must be replaced if they get dunked in the tub .
Thanks to those sea snails and a eureka moment , Angela Belcher , Germeshausen Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and Biological Engineering , is developing smart nano - materials -- hybrids of organic and inorganic components -- beginning with a rechargeable , biologically based battery that looks like plastic food wrap .
Belcher 's eureka moment occurred 10 years ago ; it arose from her long , delighted fascination with abalone , the sea snail , and from her willingness to ask a wide - open question , " What if ? "
Holding up an abalone shell before a visitor , Belcher describes the moment when the two threads -- persistent interest and sudden insight -- came together , forming the basis of her current research , which spans inorganic chemistry , materials chemistry , biochemistry , molecular biology and electrical engineering .
A seventh - generation Texan , Belcher began studying abalone when she entered the University of California , Santa Barbara , as a graduate student .
( Abalone cling to California 's coastal rocks . )
Intrigued since childhood by pearls and pearl - making mollusks , she was impressed by the abalone 's shell : it 's 98 percent calcium carbonate -- what we call chalk , only 3,000 times stronger .
" The abalone makes this amazing material out of a common mineral , " she says .
As a doctoral student at Santa Barbara , Belcher had an office with an ocean view .
Working on her dissertation , a study of how the abalone produces both its rough outer shell and its opalescent interior simultaneously , she could see whales and dolphins in the Pacific .
On the wall opposite her desk hung a huge periodic table .
" Suddenly , I wondered , what if we could assemble materials like the abalone does -- but not be limited to one element ?
What if we could bond protein to other elements in the periodic table and grow new materials ? " she says .
Belcher recalls she stood on her desk to get closer to the chart of 110 elements , and that she felt like running down the hall in excitement .
" It seemed so logical and easy .
Shells had been self - assembling , manufacturing amazing materials for 500 million years , " she says .
Belcher received her PhD in 1997 and came to MIT in 2002 .
She won a MacArthur " Genius " award in 2004 and was named Researcher of the Year by Scientific American in 2006 .
Her eureka moment has launched a new chapter in bio-engineering ; it has led to the development of smart new nano - materials , essential to advances in optics and electronics .
With MIT colleagues Paula Hammond , Bayer Professor of Chemical Engineering , and Yet - Ming Chiang , professor of materials science and engineering , Belcher grew the first biologically based , nano - scale rechargeable battery -- the one that may end short - lived cell phones .
Belcher 's MIT battery is comprised of a virus she and her colleagues engineered to latch itself to cobalt oxide .
It does look like a clear film .
Transparent , efficient , it could one day be poured onto the object it 's powering , like a coat of energizing paint .
Fabricating viral films , Belcher says , may provide new pathways for organizing molecules to help create electronic , optical and magnetic materials .
And she keeps studying the ancient abalone for clues to those new pathways .
She keeps a cache of abalone shells on her MIT desk .
" It builds exquisite materials .
It 's a very nice animal , " vegetarian Belcher notes , offering a shell to a guest .
( In her research , Belcher is careful to avoid harming or killing her subjects , who live in abalone condominiums .
To get samples of their secretions to study , she inserts glass slides beneath their shells , rather than endanger them . )
Belcher still enjoys heady moments like the one in her oceanfront office , when delight makes her feel like running down the hall outside her lab in Building 16 .
But her work at MIT is driven by a different question than the one that arose when she stood on her desk , scanning the periodic table , abalone shell in hand .
" Back then , I asked , ' What if ?
Would n't it be interesting if ? ' " she says .
" Now , the questions are more like , ' What 's the most efficient , useful material we could make ? ' "
Ultra -tiny computer chips , fuel cells , " smart " nanocrystal sensors -- anything is possible with hybrid materials , she says .
" Abalone shells are self - assembling .
What if we could make a material that is self - re- assembling ?
What if iPods and Blackberrys could genetically mend their own cracks ?
These devices get dropped ; they break ; what material can we make so they fix themselves ? "

I keep hearing supporters of Obama and Clinton say that if their candidate does not win the primary , that they will vote for John McCain in the fall .
I have been harboring similar thoughts in recent weeks , but no more .
Let me say unequivocally : this vote would be a profound mistake for the nation .
The focus should be on the issues that matter : the war in Iraq , and the economy .
We now have lost 4,000 Americans in a war that should never have been engaged in the first place .
John McCain ’s party ( who are n’t happy about him as their nominee ) try to paint Democrats as weak by arguing that they are against a successful surge .
Do n’t forget that the surge is merely a tactic , not a strategy for winning the war in Iraq .
Of course sending more troops to kill Iraqis will tamp down on violence .
They are the best trained in the world .
However , the strategy itself is fatally flawed .
John McCain supports this strategy without much hesitation .
We would support him to this nation ’s detriment .
This is why Democrats must come together in the fall .
Voting for John McCain is to ratify this flawed strategic thinking .
A vote for him means prolonging our presence in Iraq , seeing the number of American deaths swell past 4,000 , allowing the Iraqi government to continue avoiding responsibility for their own governance , and seeing billions of American dollars sent to Iraq , when the money is clearly needed at home during these rough economic times .
In other words , a vote for McCain is a vote for war , and a vote to keep the American economy in its current dire straights .
He wants to keep us there for years , while cutting taxes , and spending more than we are committing to Iraq now .
No wonder why he said he does n’t really understand the economy .
These positions make no economic or rational sense .
Any objective economist would argue against tax cuts ( which drain the government of revenue ) when the economy is slowing down , and the country is fighting two wars .
Clinton and Obama are similar on almost every position .
We are in a battle over personalities and each candidate ’s personal narrative .
This all matters somewhat , but at the end of the day , what matters are the policies that the President executes .
People credit Clinton for his economic policies , but had they failed , Democrats would not have rallied to him during the impeachment stage of his Presidency .
Democrats should back off from the obsession of nitpicking over each personality difference .
When 20 % of Clinton voters say they ca n’t vote for Obama , and the same for Obama voters , this shows a very short - sighted view of the election .

Politics as she is Played with 3d6
The recent death of Gary Gygax , who together with Dave Arneson invented Dungeons and Dragons , coincides with a most interesting period in the American Presidential primary season , as three hopeful monsters slouch towards an appointment with the polls in October or November or sometime around then .
( You can tell how much attention I pay to US politics . )
Anyway , in an attempt to correct my woeful ignorance of the state of play , I decided to turn to AD&D as the analysis tool du jour , and consulted my battered copy of the Monster Manual in hope of shedding some light on the crypt .
After all , as Douglas Adams remarked , the whole point of voting for flesh - eating lizards in any election is that if you do n't vote , the wrong lizard might get in .
( Never mind the fact that , as one of those furrin people , I do n't get a vote . )
Here 's what my Monster Manual had to say on the matter : ( NB : it 's a 1st edition AD&D Monster Manual ; I never could get the hang of those new - fangled 2nd edition rules . )

Nevertheless he can breathe fire and threaten to stomp flat the capital city of any country that Fox News disapproves of with the best of them .
The biggest danger in facing off against a McCain is that he might be under the mind control of the Svengali - like Cheney , Prince of Darkness .
In this case , he is likely to be lethally aggressive and even more unpredictable than usual .

Arden turns Shakespeare 's works into a persistent game world
Usually it is only actors that play Shakespeare but now gamers are getting the chance to go adventuring in a virtual world built around the Bard 's plays .
Called Arden , the virtual world is the creation of Professor Edward Castronova and colleagues in the Synthetic Worlds Institute at the University of Indiana .
An economist by training , Prof Castronova has led attempts to quantify the economic activity and impact of virtual worlds - be that in the games themselves or in the real world when people pay cold cash for virtual goods .
Arden , said Prof Castronova , was an attempt to go much further than this after the fact analysis .
It will give social scientists an entire populated world on which to perform experiments - something always lacking in the real world .
" We 're interested in social dynamics and economics , " he said .
Pocket world
Social scientists would perform experiments on the thriving world by fiddling with its defining characteristics .
Some of the changes could be obvious , such as the rate of inflation , or more subtle .
But , said Prof Castronova , the results should be instructive - even for the real world .
" I have seen nothing in virtual worlds that violates any social theory I know about , " he added .
" A market is a market whether it is in ancient Athens , Shakespeare 's London or Azeroth . "
" If you have a theory about human society and it does not survive the transition across the membrane to a virtual world then it's not a very interesting theory , " he said .
Familiar characters appear in the Arden world
The first public version of Arden is now available for anyone to visit - provided they have an up to date copy of the NeverWinter Nights game and have installed the Arden add - on produced by Mr Castronova and his colleagues .
Anyone expecting a gritty recreation of Elizabethan life might be surprised by what they find in Arden , said Dr Castronova .
" Shakespeare has a very rich lore and fantasy environment second only to Tolkien , " he said .
" Both have elves . "
" We felt that it should not be historical but like Shakespeare 's dream so you could have Rome next to Bohemia or the Forest of Arden , " he said .
Adventuring in the world involves carrying out quests for familiar Shakespearian characters such as John Falstaff .
While the characters in the game speak authentic Shakespeare something else vital , admits Dr Castronova , got lost while it was being created .
You can live out your own history or tragedy in Arden
" Most people that play will go in and poke around and if they are not immediately engaged they will just quit , " he added .
" The over - arching objective is to make a social lab and we cannot do that without having people in it . "
Dr Castronova and his colleagues are now working on Arden II which will be set in London and will emphasise the fun that can be had playing Shakespeare and , by the by , learn something about him and his works .
Victorian tales
London is also the setting for a virtual world under development by Lee Sheldon - a game designer and lecturer at Indiana .
Set in Victorian times the London Town virtual world will meld together the fictional , such as Dracula , with real world figures such as Jack the Ripper .
It will be a timeless place , said Mr Sheldon , where Queen Victoria never dies .
The idea behind the setting , said Mr Sheldon , was to let people discover the period by playing and being entertained .
London
Town turns the city into a Victorian - themed game
" It 's an idealised society so it 's as much fun to play the lower classes as the upper , " said Mr Sheldon .
To prove the concept a prototype is being built of the Crystal Palace and Hyde Park to show people what it might look like .
Mr Sheldon is now looking for help to fund the creation of London Town .
The impetus for the Victorian game also has a pedagogical element , said Mr Sheldon , but he added this would be concealed beneath a thick layer of fun .
" It 's all about letting people experience some rich story telling , " he said , " to re-introduce them to the whole period . "
Non-business bankruptcy filings in the United States quintupled during the 1980s and 1990s , to over 1.5 million annually by 2004 from 300,000 in 1980 .
To address the problem of soaring bankruptcy filings during this period of unprecedented prosperity , two years ago Congress enacted comprehensive , bipartisan bankruptcy reform legislation .
The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection
Act of 2005 tightened bankruptcy laws to weed out chronic problems of fraud and abuse -- and to restore public confidence in the integrity ...

Top Bush aides approved interrogation tactics : report
WASHINGTON - President George W. Bush 's most senior advisers approved " enhanced interrogation techniques " of top al - Qaeda suspects by the Central Intelligence Agency , ABC News reported on Wednesday ( see video below ) , citing sources it did not name .
ABC reported that the so - called " principals " discussed interrogation details in dozens of top - secret talks and meetings in the White House .
Then -national security adviser Condoleezza Rice chaired the meetings , which took place in the White House Situation Room and were typically attended by a select group of senior officials or their deputies , ABC said .
" Highly placed sources said a handful of top advisers signed off on how the CIA would interrogate top al Qaeda suspects -- whether they would be slapped , pushed , deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning , called waterboarding , " ABC reported .
In addition to Rice , the principals at the time included Vice President Cheney , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell , CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft , the report said .
There was no immediate comment from the White House on the ABC report .
Waterboarding has been condemned by many members of Congress , human rights groups and other countries as a form of illegal torture .
Bush and administration officials have said repeatedly that the United States does not use or condone torture .
ABC News said spokesmen for Tenet , Rumsfeld and Powell declined to comment about the interrogation program or their private discussions in the principals meetings .
The White House also declined comment on behalf of Rice and Cheney and Ashcroft could not be reached for comment on Wednesday , ABC said .
Citing sources , ABC said Ashcroft agreed with the policy decision to allow aggressive interrogation tactics and advised that they were legal but was troubled by the discussions .
Ashcroft argued that senior White House advisers should not be involved in the grim details of interrogations , sources were cited as saying .
ABC cited a top official as saying that Ashcroft asked aloud after one meeting : " Why are we talking about this in the White House ?
History will not judge this kindly . "
The following video is from ABC's World News , broadcast 9 April 2008 .
With wire services .
Jet engines operate at temperatures of thousands of degrees Fahrenheit and blades in the most advanced aircraft engines are coated with a thin layer of temperature - resistant , thermally - insulating ceramic to protect the metal .
The coating -- referred to as a thermal - barrier coating -- is designed like an accordion to expand and contract with the metal .
The problem :
When sand hits the hot engine blade it melts -- and becomes glass .
“ Molten glass is one of the nastiest substances around .
It will dissolve anything , ” says Nitin Padture , professor of materials science and engineering at Ohio State .
Conventional ceramic coating destroyed by molten glass .
The field of view is about half a millimeter .

Ohio State University engineers are developing a technology to coat jet engine turbine blades with zirconium dioxide -- commonly called zirconia , the stuff of synthetic diamonds -- to combat high - temperature corrosion .
The zirconia chemically converts sand and other corrosive particles that build up on the blade into a new , protective outer coating .
In effect , the surface of the engine blade constantly renews itself .
Ultimately , the technology could enable manufacturers to use new kinds of heat - resistant materials in engine blades , so that engines will be able to run hotter and more efficiently .
Padture said that he had military aircraft in mind when he began the project .
“ In the desert , sand is sucked into the engines during takeoffs and landings , and then you have dust storms , ” he said .
“ But even commercial aircraft and power turbines encounter small bits of sand or other particles , and those particles damage turbine blades . ”
The hot glass chews into the ceramic coating .
But the real damage happens after the engine cools , and the glass solidifies into an inflexible glaze on top of the ceramic .
When the engine heats up again and the metal blades expand , the ceramic coating can’t expand , because the glaze has locked it in place .
The ceramic breaks off , shortening the life of the engine blades .
In a recent issue of the journal Acta Materialia , Padture and his colleagues described how the new coating forces the glass to absorb chemicals that will convert it into a harmless -- and even helpful -- ceramic .
The key , Padture said , is that the coating contains aluminum and titanium atoms hidden inside zirconia crystals .
When the glass consumes the zirconia , it also consumes the aluminum and titanium .
Once the glass accumulates enough of these elements , it changes from a molten material into a stable crystal , and it stops eating the ceramic .
“ The glass literally becomes a new ceramic coating on top of the old one .
Then , when new glass comes in , the same thing will happen again .
It ’s like it ’s constantly renewing the coating on the surface of the turbine , ” Padture said .

Padture ’s former university has applied for a patent on the technique that he devised for embedding the aluminum and titanium into the zirconia .
He ’s partnering with Inframat Corp. , a nanotechnology company in Connecticut , to further develop the technology .
Padture stressed that the technology is in its infancy .
He has yet to apply the coatings to complex shapes , and cost is a barrier as well : the process is energy - consuming .
But if that cost eventually came down and the technology matured , the payoff could be hotter engines that burn fuel more efficiently and create less pollution .
Manufacturers would be able to use more sophisticated ceramics that boost the heat - resistance of engines .
Eventually , technology could go beyond aircraft and power - generator turbines and extend to automobiles as well , Padture said .
His coauthors on the Acta Materialia paper included Ohio State doctoral student Aysegul Aygun , who is doing this work for her dissertation ; former postdoctoral researcher Alexander Vasiliev , who is now at the Russian Academy of Sciences ; and Xinqing Ma , a scientist at Inframat Corp .
This research was funded by the Office of Naval Research and Naval Air Systems Command .

Digg founder Kevin Rose kicked off this week 's Apple rumors by claiming a 3 - G iPhone was only a few months away and would feature not one , but two cameras for the purposes of video chat .
Now Gartner analyst Ken Dulaney has joined in the rumor - mongering , saying that Apple has in fact already placed an order for 10 million of these second - generation iPhones .
That 's in addition to the 10 million v.1 iPhones Apple has ordered , he says .
While Dulaney does n't give a specific timeframe for its release , he does claim Apple moved up its iPhone v.2 release mainly to help spur on iPhone uptake in places like Europe , where slow sales have been attributed to the phone 's distinct lack of 3 - Gness .
As it stands , Delaney 's claim is also in keeping with another rumor .
Last November , tech blog Sevenclick
spoke to a manager at Spain 's Telefonica , who said , among things , that while Telefonica and Apple had yet to reach an official agreement , the carrier expected to release a 3 - G iPhone by May .
Here in U.S. , AT&T has all but confirmed a speedier version of the iPhone will drop sometime this year and , for now , the main point of contention among analysts is simply when this will happen .
Two camps have emerged :
One that thinks the second iteration of the phone will debut sometime around the holiday season .
Another believes May or June is the most likely date .
What say you , dear readers ?

BBC environment analyst
Markets need to be pointed in the right direction , Sir Mark says
Sir Mark Moody - Stuart told BBC
News the motor industry would adapt to cope with stricter environmental rules .
The UK Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders opposes the idea , saying drivers of the most polluting cars pay extra through road tax and petrol duty .
But Sir Mark said this simply let rich people avoid taking responsibility for tackling climate change .
Expanding on the views he expressed in a BBC News website Green Room opinion column , Sir Mark said : " Nobody needs a car that does 10 - 15 mpg .
" We need very tough regulation saying that you can't drive or build something less than a certain standard .
You would be allowed to drive an Aston Martin - but only if it did 50 - 60 mpg . "
Sir Mark 's rule would apply only to new cars .
Eventually , old polluting cars would die quietly of their own accord .
While car - makers could improve the efficiency of many sports cars to meet such a target , they would struggle to get some heavy , luxury cars to qualify .
The UK Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders spokesman Nigel Wonnacott said drivers of polluting cars already paid extra through VED ( road tax ) and petrol duty .
That was enough .
Sir Mark said that , in addition to addressing inefficient cars , he also wanted very tough efficiency standards applied to other sectors , such as buildings and lighting .
He added that the rich should not escape their responsibility to tackle climate change : " It is a social thing .
We do n't say the wealthy can avoid doing what is needed by society .
" When we eliminated coal fires in London we did n't say to people in Chelsea you can pay a bit more and toast your crumpets in front of an open fire - we said nobody , but nobody , could have an open fire .
" When we introduced catalytic converters the car - makers said it would put the price of cars through the roof - but it did n't .
Now we all have to have catalytic converters - that 's only right . "
Sir Mark - currently chairman of the mining group Anglo American - said his years in industry had taught him that the market would provide solutions if governments demanded them with enough conviction .
Battle for opinion
" Government 's job is to set the framework in which industry can compete , " he added .
" The market is a magical thing - it will meet people 's convenience but it needs guiding . "
He said the EU was far too lax with motor manufacturers .
Such comments from a leading industrialist will make an impact on the current European debate in which German car - makers are fighting to avoid being punished for continuing to build heavy cars .
They say jobs are at risk if they have to change their models .
Sir Mark says that with a growing world demand for cars , jobs lost in one polluting part of the industry will be more than replaced by jobs in a newer , cleaner part of industry .
His remarks may chime well with many of the public .
Opinion polls consistently show that people are prepared to change their ways to tackle climate change - but only if their neighbours are forced to do the same .
This fact is regularly ignored by politicians fearing a potential backlash .
They may find in future that it is less controversial for them to impose tough rules on everyone rather than to seek compromises to accommodate minorities .
Nigel Case , director of The Classic Car Club in London , said he supported Sir Mark 's comments , in theory  but said that currently car - makers were not producing clean vehicles attractive to drivers .
He noted that the Tesla electric sports car was capable of 60 mph in around 4 seconds , and a top speed of 130 mph .
" It sounds great , " he said .
" But we just ca n't get hold of one .
If there were more cars like this available , it would make drivers feel good driving them . "

This is a preliminary patch to speedup for and while loops ( it will also be able to speedup list comps and gen comps , if I get to do it ) .
The patch works by putting the loop condition test at the end of loop , which allows removing one JUMP_ABSOLUTE byte code out of the critical path .
For this two new opcodes are introduced : - FOR_ITER2 is the same as FOR_ITER except that it does an / absolute / jump if the iterator is / not / exhausted ( when other uses of FOR_ITER are replaced with FOR_ITER2 , we can of course restore the original naming ) - JUMP_ABS_IF_TRUE
/ pops / the top of the stack and does an absolute jump if its value is true Some micro- benchmarks : ./ python -m timeit " for x in xrange ( 10000 ) : pass " Before : 1000 loops , best of 3 : 782 usec per loop After : 1000 loops , best of 3 : 412 usec per loop ./ python -m timeit " x=100 " " while x : x -= 1 " Before : 10000 loops , best of 3 : 22.1 usec per loop After : 100000 loops , best of 3 : 16.6 usec per loop ./ python Tools / pybench/pybench.py -t ForLoops Before : 365 ms per round After : 234ms per round Also , pystone gets 5 % faster ( from 43300 to 45800 ) .
Now for the less shiny things :
1 . I 'm having problems modifying the pure Python compiler module .
For some reasons it seems to have stricter requirements than compile .c itself does ( ! ) ; I get some assertion error in compiler .
pyassem .FlowGraph.fixupOrderHonorNext as soon as a loop gets non-trivial .
2 . Line numbers probably need to be fixed .
The lnotab format may even have to be adapted in order to accomodate non-monotonically increasing line numbers .
Is there some interest in this patch ?
If yes , I 'd like to have your input on the two bullet points above :)
msg64359 - ( view ) Author : Antoine Pitrou ( pitrou ) * Date : 2008-03-23 14:18
This new patch includes surgery to the compiler package ( especially flowgraph trickery ) in order to make it work with the new opcodes .
I think my changes are sane but since the package seems basically untested , unmaintained and almost unused , there may be some glitches .
However , test_compiler passes .
( test_dis will need to be updated for the new opcodes , not a big deal )

This new patch should be ok .

msg64383 - ( view ) Author : Antoine Pitrou ( pitrou ) * Date : 2008-03-23 23:02
loops4.patch adds a mechanism to avoid blocking signal catching in empty loops ( such as " for x in it : pass " or " while x : pass " ) .
Much of the speedup is still retained .
./ python -m timeit " for x in xrange ( 10000 ) : pass " Before : 1000 loops , best of 3 : 737 usec per loop After : 1000 loops , best of 3 : 438 usec per loop ./ python -m timeit " x=100 " " while x : x -= 1 " Before : 10000 loops , best of 3 : 21.7 usec per loop After : 100000 loops , best of 3 : 16.6 usec per loop ./ python Tools / pybench/pybench.py -t ForLoops Before : 364ms per round After : 242 ms per round

By the way , the compiler package fix has been isolated and cleaned up as part of # 2472 .
Maybe it would be nice to start with that one .

This new patch also updates the code generation for list comprehensions .
Here are some micro-benchmarks : ./ python -m timeit -s " l = range ( 100 ) " " [ x for x in l ] " Before : 100000 loops , best of 3 : 14.9 usec per loop After : 100000 loops , best of 3 : 12.5 usec per loop ./ python -m timeit -s " l = range ( 100 ) " " [ x for x in l if x ] "
Before : 10000 loops , best of 3 : 24.1 usec per loop After : 100000 loops , best of 3 : 18.8 usec per loop ./ python -m timeit -s " l = range ( 100 ) " " [ x for x in l if not x ] "
Before : 100000 loops , best of 3 : 15.5 usec per loop After : 100000 loops , best of 3 : 11.9 usec per loop Please note that this patch is orthogonal with Neal 's patch in # 2183 , so the two combined should be quite interesting for the list comprehensions bytecode .
msg64572 - ( view ) Author : Antoine Pitrou ( pitrou ) * Date : 2008-03-26 23:09
This new patch completes the bytecode modifications .
For / while loops as well as list comprehensions and generator expressions are a bit faster now .
Also , as a side effect I 've introduced a speed improvement for " if " statements and expressions ...
Some micro-benchmarks ( completing the ones already given above ) : ./ python Tools / pybench/pybench.py -t IfThenElse Before : 167ms per round After : 136 ms per round ./ python -m timeit -s " y=range ( 100 ) " " sum ( x for x in y ) " Before : 10000 loops , best of 3 : 20.4 usec per loop After : 100000 loops , best of 3 : 17.9 usec per loop ./ python -m timeit -s " y=range ( 100 ) " " sum ( x for x in y if x ) " Before : 10000 loops , best of 3 : 28.5 usec per loop After : 10000 loops , best of 3 : 23.3 usec per loop ./ python -m timeit -s " y=range ( 100 ) " " sum ( x for x in y if not x ) "
Before : 100000 loops , best of 3 : 16.4 usec per loop After : 100000 loops , best of 3 : 12.1 usec per loop ./ python -m timeit -s " x , y , z= 1, 2,3 " " x if y else z " Before : 1000000 loops , best of 3 : 0.218 usec per loop After : 10000000 loops , best of 3 : 0.159 usec per loop A couple of tests seem to be failing in obscure ways in the test suite , I 'll try to examine them .
Most of the test suite runs fine though .
msg64573 - ( view ) Author : Antoine Pitrou ( pitrou ) * Date : 2008-03-26 23:43
Ok , the fix for the bizarre failures was really simple .
Now the only failing tests are in test_trace ( because it makes assumptions regarding the bytecode that are n't true anymore , I 'll have to adapt the tests ) .
msg64577 - ( view ) Author : Neal Norwitz ( nnorwitz ) * Date : 2008-03-27 05:04
Antoine , I hope to look at this patch eventually .
Unfortunately , there are too many build / test problems that need to be resolved before the next release .
If you can help out with those , I will be able to review this patch sooner .

Can you see if this simpler patch also gives speed - ups ? ( predict_loop.diff )
msg64603 - ( view ) Author : Antoine Pitrou ( pitrou ) * Date : 2008-03-27 16:56
Armin , your patch gives a speed - up for " for " loops and comprehensions , although a bit less .
Also , it does n't speed up " while " loops and " if " statements at all .
For some reasons it also appears to make pystone a bit slower .
Here are some micro-benchmarks : ./ python -m timeit " for x in xrange ( 10000 ) : pass " Before : 1000 loops , best of 3 : 758 usec per loop After : 1000 loops , best of 3 : 483 usec per loop ./ python -m timeit " x=100 " " while x : x -= 1 " Before : 10000 loops , best of 3 : 21.8 usec per loop After : 10000 loops , best of 3 : 21.6 usec per loop ./ python -m timeit -s " l = range ( 100 ) " " [ x for x in l ] " Before : 100000 loops , best of 3 : 14.9 usec per loop After : 100000 loops , best of 3 : 13.3 usec per loop ./ python -m timeit -s " l = range ( 100 ) " " [ x for x in l if x ] "

msg66027 - ( view ) Author : Antoine Pitrou ( pitrou ) * Date : 2008-04-30 21:46
Finally I had to slightly change the lnotab format to have the right tracing semantics : the change is that line number increments are now signed bytes rather than unsigned .
Still , there is a small change in tracing behaviour ( see test_trace.py ) : the for statement is traced twice in the first loop iteration , that 's because the iterator object is retrieved ( GET_ITER ) at the beginning of the loop while the next iterator value is fetched ( FOR_ITER ) at the end of the loop .
I do n't believe this is very painful .
All in all , the whole test suite now passes fine .
The performance numbers are the same as before .

Here is an updated patch against trunk .
To be honest I do n't think it has a lot of future : - it changes the lnotab format ( to allow negative offsets ) - it rewrites the buggy block reordering code in the pure Python compiler package , but nobody seems interested in maintaining that package ( see # 2472 ) .
Perhaps we should just declare the experiment failed and switch to something else .

I do n't see the changes to the lnotab format being a roadblock ; just mention it in NEWS .
Likewise , the pure - Python compiler package should n't be a high priority ; your changes to that package look good enough .
I 'm seeing encouraging speed - ups out of this ( with gcc 4.3.1 x86_64 , compiling Python as 64 - bit ) : Django templates ( render a 150x150 table 100 times ) : Min : 0.595 -> 0.589 : 0.94 % faster Avg : 0.599 -> 0.591 : 1.30 % faster Spitfire templates ( render a 1000x1000 table 100 times ) : Min : 0.751 -> 0.729 : 2.98 % faster Avg : 0.753 -> 0.730 : 3.09 % faster None of the apps I 've benchmarked are negatively impacted .
I only have two minor comments .
Please commit this .
Review comments : - The changes to Python / compile.c:compiler_if( ) , compiler_for ( ) , compiler_while ( ) have some indentation issues ( tabs and such ) .
- Functions like def foo( ) : while True : pass have a useless JUMP_FORWARD 0 instruction , but I do n't think it 's worth teaching the peepholer to remove them since it does n't happen in other circumstances ( that I can tell ) .

Before committing I want to know what to do with the new jump opcodes , with respect to the alternative proposal I 've made in # 4715 .
Ideally , I should fold the # 4715 patch back into the present patch , since I think the # 4715 approach is more thought out .

Well , Spitfire and Django represent very different ways of implementing a template system , so I like to measure both when doing application benchmarks .
Template systems tend to be heavy CPU consumers for webapps , which is why I include them . >>

Thanks a lot !
By the way , why do you bench cPickle ?
Does your test call Python code significantly ?
Overall , the results look positive although not overwhelming .
msg83022 - ( view ) Author : Jeffrey Yasskin ( jyasskin ) * Date : 2009-03-02 16:24
No particular reason for cPickle .
It sometimes shows when we 've caused problems by increasing the code size , and shows the size of any random effects that the compiler causes by moving code around .
Could you double - check the patch to see if I did anything dumb ?
msg83088 - ( view ) Author : Jeffrey Yasskin ( jyasskin ) * Date : 2009-03-03 19:45
Hold off on reviewing this .
There 's one bug around the peepholer not turning itself off when line numbers skip by more than 127 , and another around the traceback generator still assuming line numbers are unsigned .
I 'll post another patch when those are fixed and tested .
I may not get to it for a day or two , so someone else is welcome to update the patch instead . :)

WASHINGTON 
The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee hinted Sunday that a battle over an expired eavesdropping law might be moving toward a conclusion that gave phone companies the retroactive legal protections long sought by President Bush .
The chairman , Representative Silvestre Reyes , Democrat of Texas , said in an interview on CNN that the committee had been talking to the companies “ because if we ’re going to give them blanket immunity , we want to know and understand what it is we ’re giving immunity for . ”
Mr. Reyes did not specify what provisions a House bill might contain .
But his use of the words “ blanket immunity ” suggested that he might be moving toward a Senate bill , backed by Mr. Bush , that would protect phone companies that assisted in a federal program of wiretapping without warrants after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
“ I have an open mind about that , ” Mr. Reyes said .
“ We ’re very close , ” he added .
“ Probably within the next week , we ’ll be able to move hopefully to bring it to a vote . ”
Great reasoning from the British government on this one :
In turning down Ms Emambakhsh and Mr Kazemi ’s asylum applications , the Home Office has said that , provided Iranians are discreet about their homosexuality , they will not be persecuted .
Did you get that ?
The British government says it ’s the gays fault if they get executed by the Iranian government for being gay .
If the gays were simply more “ discrete ” no one would want to execute them .
( I can imagine the British Home Office circa 1943 : “ If European Jews would only stop acting so Jewish … ” )
Absolutely astounding .
SACRAMENTO 
Where did they go ?
The Chinook salmon that swim upstream to spawn in the fall , the most robust run in the Sacramento River , have disappeared .
The almost complete collapse of the richest and most dependable source of Chinook salmon south of Alaska left gloomy fisheries experts struggling for reliable explanations  and coming up dry .
Whatever the cause , there was widespread agreement among those attending a five - day meeting of the Pacific Fisheries Management Council here last week that the regional $ 150 million fishery , which usually opens for the four - month season on May 1 , is almost certain to remain closed this year from northern Oregon to the Mexican border .
A final decision on salmon fishing in the area is expected next month .
As a result , Chinook , or king salmon , the most prized species of Pacific wild salmon , will be hard to come by until the Alaskan season opens in July .
Even then , wild Chinook are likely to be very expensive in markets and restaurants nationwide .
“ It ’s unprecedented that this fishery is in this kind of shape , ” said Donald McIsaac , executive director of the council , which is organized under the auspices of the Commerce Department .
Court Ruling Denies EMI Access to Millions of Personal MP3 Files A New York Judge has denied a request by EMI to force MP3tunes to turn over all music files for its 125,000 users .
For now , this means the contents of personal music Lockers will remain private .
In court EMI v MP3tunes , EMI demanded that MP3tunes provide copies of the more than 100 million songs in their subscribers ' personal music Lockers .
MP3tunes offers a free and paid service for people to store their music files digitally so customer or music fans can both keep them backed - up and listen to them anywhere through a Net radio , like those from Logitech , Reciva or Terratec , or from any Net connected device , such as a Wii or PC .
The newest feature allows subscribers to automatically sync their music files to a device of their choosing so all their music is where they want it to be , without the hassles of running software and plugging devices in via USB cables .
All access to a music Locker requires a unique username and password , and there is absolutely no sharing between Lockers .
MP3tunes strongly objected to EMI 's request , because it was both an invasion of user 's personal storage , and because it would create a huge technical and financial burden , with more than 300 terabytes of files in personal Lockers .
Files are not MP3tunes ' possessions any more than the contents of a safety deposit box are owned by the bank that houses them .
The storage provided by MP3tunes is the user 's own space .
A Locker is empty when someone opens an account and that customer decides what files are placed into their Locker .
All files are stored at the request of the user .
People who choose to utilize remote storage should be guaranteed the same level of privacy they have for the files stored on their local hard disk .
No corporation should have the right to demand the content of tens of thousands of personal accounts be turned over to them .
There 's no reason to suggest that the users are doing anything but listening to their own music collections in a modern manner .
There are millions of Gmail accounts that have MP3 files stored in them – same with Yahoo , AOL and Microsoft 's email and hosting services .
If EMI can gain unfettered access to wantonly look through personal accounts on MP3tunes those services will be next .
EMI is trying to eliminate online storage and take people back to a prehistoric time before Internet services existed .
I 'm not sure the Judge saw this as a privacy issue , but he got it right when he rejected EMI 's demands to turn over personal files for thousands of unsuspecting people .
It is an early , but very important , ruling in our battle with EMI .
This fight will likely prove to be a long one , because some record labels would rather spend millions in attorney fees trying to outlaw all new technologies , like online storage and web hosting , rather than figure out how to use them to grow their business .
At stake is personal ownership and privacy in the digital era – both issues worth fighting for .

Angelina Jolie Pregnant With Twins ( Photos )
Here we go again .
Reports are popping up everywhere that the recently glowingis in fact pregnant with twins .
E! Online , X17 , Bauer Griffin and Star magazine are all reporting the news .
Angie andwere photographed at the Critic 's Choice Awards recently , looking quite pleased with themselves .
Remember back when Angie was pregnant with Shiloh , she confessed to NBC's Ann Currey that pregnancy brought a certain giddiness to her normally stoic personality .
She could n't explain it but it caused her to giggle and smile all the time .
If you think back to all of the photos that are taken of the actress when she is not pregnant , her face is usually not adorned with upturned lips .
Angelina was looking a little rounder and filled out at Critic 's Choice .
The actress lost considerable weight last year after the death of her beloved mother .
The latest photos are n't showing that stark gauntness that was so apparent in 2007 .
If the twin rumor is true , that will bring the size of their ever increasing child count to 6 .
The Jolie - Pitt clan includes Maddox , Pax , Zahara and Shiloh .

With the American presidential campaign in full swing , the obvious way to change the world might seem to be through politics .
But growing numbers of young people are leaping into the fray and doing the job themselves .
These are the social entrepreneurs , the 21st - century answer to the student protesters of the 1960s , and they are some of the most interesting people here at the World Economic Forum ( not only because they ’re half the age of everyone else ) .
Andrew Klaber , a 26 - year - old playing hooky from Harvard Business School to come here ( do n’t tell his professors ! ) , is an example of the social entrepreneur .
He spent the summer after his sophomore year in college in Thailand and was aghast to see teenage girls being forced into prostitution after their parents had died of AIDS .
So he started Orphans Against AIDS ( www.orphansagainstaids.org), which pays school - related expenses for hundreds of children who have been orphaned or otherwise affected by AIDS in poor countries .
He and his friends volunteer their time and pay administrative costs out of their own pockets so that every penny goes to the children .

Watch rooks team up to win a food reward doing tasks they could n’t complete on their own
Who ever heard of birds cooperating on a project together ?
Sure , a pair may build a nest together , but cooperating on a single task to get food is something only primates have been thought capable of .
Now it turns out that rooks , like chimps , can cooperate with each other – although they may lack the competitive edge needed understand teamwork properly .
Amanda Seed at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , and colleagues tested cooperation between pairs of rooks .
They placed a 60 centimetre - long tray laden with food just out of the reach of two rooks placed inside a box .
The rooks could see the food through a slit but had to use string thread through eyeholes at the back of the tray to drag it through the slit towards them .
To get their meal , however , the rooks were also forced to team up .
Pulling just one end of the string simply unthreaded it without moving the tray .
Only when the birds each pulled one end of the string simultaneously did the tray move .
Advertisement
Early bird
Seed ’s team found that , with very limited training , all eight birds they studied mastered this act of cooperation – a specialisation previously thought unique to primates .
But the rooks came unstuck when Seed ’s team tested the birds ’ understanding of cooperation in more depth .
In a second experiment , they presented one rook with an out - of - reach tray but placed the second rook in an adjoining room .
The second rook had to scrabble through a hatch before getting into a position where it could pull on the string .
However , the first rook almost invariably pulled its own end of string instead of waiting for its partner to arrive .
Similar studies have shown that chimps will wait for their partner before acting .
Paradoxically , says Seed , rooks may fail to fully grasp the benefits of cooperation because individuals rarely compete .
In polygamous chimp society , an individual interacts with others chimps and so has to quickly learn about cooperation as a “ commodity ” on the “ biological market ” , she says .
If a chimp never cooperates , it simply loses out .
Competitive cooperation
By contrast , Rooks form monogamous relationships and seldom interact with other individuals , so they never learn the true value of cooperation , says Seed .
“ It may be that the sort of cooperation we see in humans [ and chimps ] could only evolve in response to a very particular combination of pressures that lead to an awareness of when cooperation is worthwhile , ” she adds .
Alicia Melis , also at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology but not involved in the study , thinks the results tie in with previous studies .
“ The idea that competition might also promote cooperation has been out there for a while , ” she says .
“ In fact , many of the cooperative interactions among chimps take place to outwit others . ”
But Ronald Noë of the University Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg , France , is more cautious .
“ We are talking about a comparison of only two species , [ chimps and rooks ] , that are distantly related , ” he says .
“ And in both cases , few subjects were used in the experiments . ”
Unknown interactions
No ë thinks that rook pair bonds might not preclude interaction with other birds – and those interactions could open up a market for cooperation as a commodity .
“ Rooks go out and forage in different size flocks , ” he says .
“ Nobody really knows to what level they live in societies comparable to chimps – mainly because it ’s damn hard to follow hundreds or even thousands of birds simultaneously . ”
Seed thinks a better test of the competition - cooperation theory might be to compare chimps with Bonobos – a more peaceable ape that lives in egalitarian societies .
Because competition may be less important in Bonobo societies , they may lack a strong understanding of cooperation , he suggests .
But Melis is not convinced .
“ I ’m not sure I would expect Bonobos to show less understanding than chimps in this type of task , since so far there is n’t any evidence for cognitive differences between the two species , ” she says .
“ But I agree with the authors – more comparative studies are necessary . ”

Of the prisoners who have been through the makeshift Afghan court , 65 have been convicted and 17 acquitted , according to a report on the prosecutions by Human Rights
First that is to be made public on Thursday .
A draft copy of the report was provided to The New York Times .
United States officials defended their role in providing information for the Afghan trials as a legitimate way to try to contain the threats that some of the more dangerous detainees would pose if they were released outright .
“ These are not prosecutions that are being done at the request or behest of the United States government , ” said Sandra L. Hodgkinson , the deputy assistant secretary of defense for detention policy .
“ These are prosecutions that are being done by Afghans for crimes committed on their territory by their nationals . ”
Ms. Hodgkinson said the United States had pressed the Afghan authorities “ to conduct the trials in a fair manner , ” and had insisted that lawyers be provided for the prisoners after the first 10 of them were convicted without legal representation .
But she did not directly reject the criticisms raised in the Human Rights First report , adding , “ These trials are much more consistent with the traditional Afghan justice process than they are with ours . ”
The new court is located on the ground floor of a new high - security Afghan prison that was built by the United States at Pul - i - Charki , on the outskirts of Kabul .
Although Afghan officials say the trials there are not officially secret , they have allowed only three outside observers  two human rights investigators and a representative of a local United Nations office .
The human rights investigators were permitted to see two trials in February , review some trial documents and interview judges , prosecutors and defense lawyers for the court .
Gen. Safiullah Safi , the Afghan Army officer who runs the prison where the trials are being held , told a reporter that permission to view the trials could be granted only by Mr. Karzai ’s office .
But that office referred the request to Abdul Jabar Sabit , the Afghan attorney general .
Mr. Sabit ’s office finally said he was too busy to meet with a journalist .

In the miasma ( here and here ) of people explaining why they got the war wrong here is Jim Henley explaining why he got it right .
I was n’t born yesterday .
I had heard of the Middle East before
September 12 , 2001 .
I knew that many of the loudest advocates for war with Iraq
were so - called national - greatness conservatives who spent the 1990s arguing that
war was good for the soul .
I remembered Elliott Abrams and John Poindexter and
Michael Ledeen as the knaves and fools of Iran - Contra , and drew the appropriate
conclusions about the Bush Administration wanting to employ them : it was an
administration of knaves and fools …
Libertarianism .
As a libertarian , I was primed to react
skeptically to official pronouncements .
“ Hayek does n’t stop at the water ’s
edge ! ” I coined that one .
Not bad , huh ?
I could tell the difference between
the government and the country .
People who could n’t make this
distinction could not rationally cope with the idea that American foreign policy
was the largest driver of anti-American terrorism because it sounded to them too
much like “ The American people deserve to be victims of terrorism . ”
I
could see the self - interest of the officials pushing for war – how war would
benefit their political party , their department within the government , enhance
their own status at the expense of rivals .
Libertarianism made it clear how
absurd the idealistic case was .
Supposedly , wise , firm and just American
guidance would usher Iraq into a new era of liberalism and comity .
But none of
that was going to work unless real American officials embedded in American
political institutions were unusually selfless and astute , with a lofty and
omniscient devotion to Iraqi welfare .
And , you know , they were n’t going to be
that ….
What all of us had in common is probably a simple recognition :
War is a big
deal .
It is n’t normal .
It ’s not something to take up casually .
Any war you can
describe as “ a war of choice ” is a crime .
War feeds on and feeds the negative
passions .
It is to be shunned where possible and regretted when not .
Various
hawks occasionally protested that “ of course ” they did n’t enjoy war ,
but they were almost always lying .
Anyone who saw invading foreign lands and
ruling other countries by force as extraordinary was forearmed against the lies
and delusions of the time .
NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) --
An Indian woman accused of being a witch was tied to a tree and beaten by a mob , with television footage of the incident aired in India on Friday .
Villagers tied the woman to a tree after a man accused her of practicing black magic .
Nishant Tiwari , a police official in northeastern India , said a journalist who filmed the beating called him Thursday to report the incident , which took place in the village of Dumaria in central eastern Bihar state .
He arrived to find the woman tied to a tree , her hair partially cut and her complexion ruddy from being slapped .
She had no serious injuries .
" I was appalled at what I saw because people should be more socially responsible than to do this , " Tiwari said .
Authorities arrested six people , including the man who admitted to hiring her services as a witch .
They were due to appear before a magistrate on Friday .
Ram Ayodhya , who could face up to seven years in prison for his role in the attack , told police he was justified in beating the woman , Tiwari said .

Ayodhya said he paid her to use magic and prayer to improve his wife 's health .

When his wife 's condition deteriorated , Ayodhya accused her of performing black magic , Tiwari said , and a crowd soon gathered and tied her to the tree .
The woman seen being attacked is expected to testify when the suspects appear before the magistrate .
Tiwari said he was disturbed by the fact that a journalist filmed the incident before contacting authorities .
" The media filmed the incident , then called the police -- instead of the police first , " Tiwari said .
CNN 's partner network , CNN - IBN , reported that the incident took place close to the local police station .
It reported that there had been other such occurrences of mob justice in the state .
In Bhagalpur district in August 2007 , a man caught trying to snatch a woman 's chain was beaten up , with police looking on , and later tied to a motorcycle and dragged around by a police officer .
In September , in Lucknow 's Wazirganj area , an angry mob beat a man to death after a 2 ½ - year old girl was allegedly found sexually assaulted and murdered in his house .

Dorgan announced his support in a Wednesday afternoon conference call , where he praised Obama 's record on trade and labor and called Obama the best chance for Democrats to expand their appeal across the country .
" Obama has done well in red states , bringing new people into this campaign , " Dorgan said .
" One reason we 've lost so many states is because candidates have given up on these states before the campaign begins .
Sen . Obama is not going to do that . "
Dorgan is the 10th senator to endorse Obama , following former presidential candidate Chris Dodd giving Obama his support Tuesday .
Clinton has been endorsed by 13 senators , while 24 Democrats in the chamber are still on the sidelines of the presidential race .
Although North Dakota 's other senator , Kent Conrad , and its lone representative , Earl Pomeroy , also are Democrats , the state has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 , Dorgan said .
He noted that the only other Democratic president the state supported was Franklin Delano Roosevelt , who served from 1933 to 1945 .
The two most recent Democratic contenders , John Kerry and Al Gore , lost the state by 30 and 28 points , he said .
" I and others in our part of the country are really interested in having a candidate at the top of the ticket who is n't going to give up on these states before the campaign begins , " Dorgan said .
Obama is that candidate , he said , recounting the results of North Dakota 's Super Tuesday caucus .
Obama won with 61 percent of the vote in that caucus , which drew twice as many Democrats as Republicans out to vote .
" That has really inspired me , " Dorgan said .
" And I realize that he 's running the type of campaign that 's making a real difference . "

My previous post provoked an outpouring of suggestions of people to interview for my book Coders at Work , to have approximately three to four binary orders of magnitude more than I can possibly interview for the book .
So I put together a web page with a bit of Javascript on it to help me sort through the names and build a short list of ( for now ) sixteen names .
Since it ’s a sort of an interesting exercise , and because I ’m curious what other people think , I ’ve put the page up on the Coders at Work website .
If you want to try your hand at picking sixteen names out of the almost 256 nominees I ’ve got , go for it1 .
I ’ve also put up a comments page so people can submit suggestions and flames about the book in a more public forum than my email inbox .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A man sprinted onto a runway at Heathrow airport on Thursday , the day before the Queen was due to open its giant new Terminal Five , the second major security breach in less than a month .

Police arrested the man and blew up his bag in a controlled explosion but found no bomb .
A spokeswoman said police did not believe the incident was terrorism - related , although they were still not certain of the man ’s motive .
The world ’s busiest international airport has been the target of protests from environmentalists angered at both the opening of the new terminal and further plans to boost traffic with the addition of a third runway and a sixth terminal .
“ I can confirm that at approximately 2:05 p.m. a man was seen airside at Heathrow airport on the northern runway .
He ’s been arrested by police and he ’s currently in custody , ” a police spokesman said .
Last month protesters opposing the expansion plans breached the airport ’s security to unveil a banner on top of a parked passenger jet .
Others chained themselves to the roof of parliament .
Organisers have threatened more action .
Television pictures showed several emergency cars with flashing lights parked on the airport runway .
About two hours after the incident airport operator BAA said both runways had reopened .
“ Some short delays have occurred but we are expecting to return to normal later this afternoon , ” said a spokeswoman for BAA , which is owned by Spanish firm Ferrovial .
A spokesman for the Queen said there were no plans to cancel her appearance at Friday ’s opening ceremony for the new Terminal Five .
“ At this stage there ’s no reason to expect that it will not go ahead as planned , ” a spokesman for the queen said .
Security at the airport has also been a high - profile issue since 2006 when authorities said they had thwarted a plot to smuggle explosives onto trans -Atlantic flights .
“ The important thing about the Heathrow incident is that the person was detained , that all the security precautions went quickly into action , that he ’s now being interviewed and that all possible steps were taken , ” Prime Minister Gordon Brown told reporters at a European summit in Brussels .
Operation " Warm Winter " has finished its first stage – targeting terror infrastructure in the Gaza Strip neighborhoods of Sajaiya and Jabalya , the IDF said Saturday .
The operation 's first stage also targeted ditches and similar places used as firing grounds by launchers , which were blown up .
The second stage of the operation includes patrolling urban areas on a search - and - destroy mission – a hunt for hidden weapons .
Military Might 70 Palestinians killed in IDF operation in Gaza Hanan Greenberg Israeli forces launch military operation Friday night near town of Sajaiya in northern Strip .
Some 70 Palestinians killed in heavy exchanges of fire with soldiers , dozens of casualties reported 70 Palestinians killed in IDF operation in Gaza
Warm Winter 's weekend resulted in dozens of Palestinian fatalities ; as the Israeli side suffered two fatalities , and seven casualties .
" The military operation against all ranks responsible for Qassams will continue .
The gloves are off and we have no intention of sitting on the sidelines while rockets are being fired , " said a security source .
The massive strikes , he added , will continue and may even increase .
IDF forces in the field reported most of the Palestinian casualties were affiliated with Hamas .
The IDF denied the Palestinians ' claims of mass casualties among innocent residents , citing only a few such incidents were known .
Hamas , said the IDF , often states false casualty claims in order to generate sympathy in the international community .
Senior defense establishment officials held a security briefing Saturday night in which it was decided that the IDF will continue its operation , as means to foil Hamas ' plan to have a large - scale ground incursion claim many innocent lives in the Strip .
Defense Minister Ehud Barak , IDF Chief of Staff Lieutenant - General Gabi Ashkenazi , Shin Bet Chief Yuval Diskin , Israel 's military intelligence chief , Major - General Amos Yadlin and other officials attended the briefing .
" The operation in Gaza is ongoing , " said Barak .
" Hamas will be held responsible … we are not happy Gaza residents are hurt , but the responsibility lies with Hamas and those firing rockets .
Our responsibility is to keep the residents of Sderot , Ashkelon and the Gaza vicinity communities safe , and that we will do . "
The IDF 's main concern continues to be Warm Winter 's final price tag : Hamas has fortified its strongholds and has snipers war - ready .
" Overall , our forces are doing admirable work , " said the officers present at the briefing .
The IDF operation in Gaza is currently engaging combatants from the Givati Brigade , the Ninth Armor Battalion , IAF forces and Engineers Corps ' combatants ; and while no large - scale operation was launched during the weekend , a lot depends on the coming developments .
IDF officials did not rule out a possibility of the operation leading to yet another escalation , which in turn lead to a large - scale operation ; but some believe several in - depth pinpoint operations may cause Hamas to rethink the ceasefire .
According to the IDF , some 130 have been fired at Israel since Wednesday .
The neoconservatives , who have never been right about anything , have lately suffered more knockdowns than " The Bull of the Pampas , " Luis Firpo , did in his first round with Jack Dempsey in 1923 , but hopes for their demise as a political force have unfortunately proven to be premature .
Part of the problem is that the blog and counterculture world where the neocons have been eviscerated is not the world of the New York Times , the Washington Post , Fox News , or the Wall Street Journal , where they continue to set the pace on the editorial and opinion pages .
The presence of two neoconservatives , William Kristol and David Brooks , at the ostensibly liberal New York Times is a testimony to their resiliency , as is the Times ’ endorsement of John McCain as the Republican presidential nominee .
Beyond the media , the neocons have deeply embedded themselves in the political system and continue to play a major role in the campaigns of the various presidential candidates of both parties , frequently as foreign policy advisers .
With the withdrawal of Romney , Washington pundits unanimously agree that John McCain will defeat Huckabee to become the Republican nominee .
McCain is the neocons ’ anointed choice for president of the United States , and has been so for many years .
He was their candidate when he ran against George Bush in the primaries in 2000 and again when he announced his candidacy for 2008 .
When McCain ’s campaign underachieved last summer and it appeared that Rudy Giuliani would be the Republican candidate , many leading neocons , including Norman Podhoretz and Daniel Pipes , joined the New Yorker ’s campaign .
Now that Giuliani has withdrawn , they will presumably return home again , rejoining Robert Kagan and James Woolsey , both of whom have been with McCain since early 2007 .
That McCain is no traditional conservative if measured by his views on cultural and fiscal issues matters not at all , because the Israel - and - empire - fixated neocons consider such issues unimportant .
Nor is there any concern for McCain ’s hypocrisy on other issues , such as torture , where he publicly opposed the administration before agreeing to a White House - supported bill that permitted waterboarding and other practices .
With McCain as their nominee , the Republicans will be running on a " fear " platform , emphasizing the threat posed by terrorism .
Mitt Romney withdrew citing the necessity of winning in Iraq and not surrendering to the terrorists , implying that such pusillanimity is precisely what one might expect from the Democrats if the Republicans do not present a united front .
McCain ’s subsequent speech at the American Conservative Union ( ACU ) convention provided more of the same , calling for action against Iran and victory over Islamic extremists .
On the following day , President Bush called for Republican unity and made essentially the same points about terrorists .
It is clear that the Republicans will be the party of war and that they will emphasize their ability to deal with international threats better than the Democrats .
The neocons and McCain do not disguise their belief that Iran must be dealt with by military means because diplomacy has failed .
Indeed , one might well regard de-fanging Iran as their principal foreign policy objective , one that they share with the White House and the Israeli government .
John McCain ’s sentiment toward Iran is unrelentingly belligerent .
One only has to recall his rendition of the Beach Boys ’ song " Barbara Ann " substituting the words " Bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb Iran " to realize that the ideologically driven Arizona Republican is not interested in talk if cruise missiles are available .
McCain ’s version of " straight talk " on Iran suggests that he lacks the basic good judgment the American public would presumably like to see in a president .
McCain ’s speech before the ACU revealed that he supports the U.S. presence in Iraq until there is a " victory , " that he will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon , and that he is committed to fighting against " Islamic extremists " for as long as it takes to defeat them .
In an earlier speech in New Hampshire he stated that it would be fine with him if the U.S. were to remain in Iraq for one hundred years .
In Florida , shortly before that state ’s primary , McCain declared that there would be " other wars " in America ’s future , but that " we will never surrender . "
There should be no confusion about McCain ’s intentions , which are basically all war all the time .
He has also declared that the United States has a right to deal with " rogue states " as it sees fit , and he has thrown down a challenge to Russia , insisting that Moscow should be expelled from the G - 8 group of industrialized nations and that NATO should be expanded to include the Ukraine and Georgia , which the Kremlin would see as a direct threat .
Ronald Reagan , who won the first Cold War , would undoubtedly be horrified by McCain ’s intention to start a second one .
Many observers in Washington believe that McCain intends to pull a shrewd maneuver to enhance his electability by packaging himself as someone who can end the partisan divide in Congress .
McCain knows that the Republican Party ’s conservative base , which mistrusts him , has nowhere else to go in national elections .
Able to take them for granted , he is already speaking of reaching out to moderates , liberals , and traditional Democrats .
He has worked closely with the Democrats on many occasions , and his voting record on many issues is decidedly non-Republican .
He co-sponsored the McCain - Feingold legislation on political contributions and collaborated on the stillborn McCain - Kennedy amnesty plan for illegal immigrants , both of which were opposed by the Republican Party ’s conservative base .
To turn himself into a one - man bridge over troubled political waters , McCain will reportedly insist that his vice president be Sen.
Joseph Lieberman , a lifelong Democrat who currently calls himself an independent .
Lieberman endorsed McCain at the end of December and campaigned actively on his behalf in New Hampshire , Michigan , South Carolina , and Florida .
In Florida he spoke to numerous Jewish groups around Miami , emphasizing McCain ’s support for Israel .
Photos of McCain campaigning frequently feature Lieberman standing in the background .
Joe Lieberman is also no social conservative , so he and McCain should get along just fine on most issues .
Sources in Washington believe that Lieberman will conveniently become a Republican to gain the GOP ’s acceptance .
Joe Lieberman denies that he would even consider the position of vice president with his friend McCain , but one should note that an initial denial of one ’s true intentions has become routine in American politics .
As the self - described " conscience of the Senate , " Lieberman has voted a straight Democratic Party line on most issues , though he is most definitely a hard - liner when it comes to Israel and the Middle East .
When he ran against Ned Lamont for the Senate in Connecticut in 2006 he denounced the latter as weak on Israeli security , saying that Lamont had surrounded himself with " people who were explicitly against Israel . "
Lieberman , like McCain , would like to attack Iran .
He was the co-sponsor of the Kyl - Lieberman amendment that passed Congress in September 2007 .
Kyl - Lieberman declared that Iran is killing American soldiers and led to the naming of part of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist group , which would permit military action against it without any deliberation by Congress .
Lieberman is opposed to negotiating with the Iranians , claiming that it is akin to a firefighter negotiating with an arsonist .
He favors military action to prevent an Iranian nuclear weapons program and asserts that Iran is already at war with the U.S .
Americans who have opposed the Iraq war and who are against another war with Iran should begin to worry , because a McCain - Lieberman ticket would be very electable .
It would be promoted as a demonstration that bipartisanship can work in Washington , and it would draw support from many independents and from a Democratic base that would welcome its relatively moderate positions on social issues and immigration .
Many would be attracted by its lack of close ties to the religious Right .
McCain - Lieberman would also play the fear card extremely well , rallying both the Republican base , which is largely willing to ignore social issues when it comes to national security , and conservative Democrats .
This would likely complete America ’s transition to a militarized state and would empower terrorists everywhere , resulting in constant warfare and bankrupting the United States in fairly short order .
Such is the price of the neocon new world order .

Researchers have identified a gene linked to hair loss that could lead to new drugs to treat baldness .
REUTERS / Laszlo Balogh
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Researchers have identified a gene linked to hair loss that could lead to new drugs to treat baldness .
The gene is responsible for a rare hereditary form of hair loss known as Hypotrichosis simplex , a condition affecting 1 in 200,000 people , in which people begin going bald in childhood , the researchers reported in the journal Nature Genetics .
“ There is a very good chance of developing a therapy to treat hair loss based on this finding , ” the study ’s leader Regina Betz , a researcher at the Institute of Human Genetics , said in a telephone interview on Monday .
Currently , Merck and Co’s Propecia and Pfizer Inc ’s Rogaine are drugs sold to stop baldness , but they help people maintain their hair rather than grow new follicles .
Using DNA samples from 11 members of a Saudi Arabian family that had inherited the rare condition , the researchers found that a mutation in the P2Y5 gene prevented proteins called growth receptors on hair follicle cells from forming properly .
This meant a substance needed to stimulate hair growth could not attach to the defective receptors and may help explain hair loss , the researchers said .
The finding could lead to drugs that target these proteins to boost hair growth , they added .
“ We can now search selectively for related substances that may be used in therapies for hair loss , ” Ivon von Kugelgen , a researcher who worked on the study at the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology in Bonn , said in a statement .
“ The exciting possibility here is that such medicines will be able to benefit patients suffering from very different types of hair loss . ”
Pat Robertson Still Silly and Overblown by the Press
by Lewis Loflin
Update 2018 .
My prediction that Pat Robertson was overblown by the press has proven correct .
He has done nothing in 2 decades .
L. Loflin
When Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson blamed God and America for the attacks on 9/11 , it only proved how silly they really are .
This was aired only 48 hours after the attacks on New York and Washington .
Ralph Reed already bailed out of the Christian Coalition , Pat Robertson finally resigned in December 2001 .
Pat 's failure to get Early elected as governor of Virginia and the shambles of the Gilmore Governorship ( Pat claims " some credit " for his election ) may have marked the end of Robertson in VA and national politics .
In 2005 Pat Robertson is going more silly than ever , and some are claiming his influence is declining .
Is it perhaps the Christian Right in general , that drives the Liberal Left into hysteria , really is n't as powerful as we think ?
The Christian Coalition is a shell of its former self , Jerry Falwell 's Moral Majority is gone , and the Republican Party is as disunited as the Democratic Party .
The reality is Pat Robertson 's irrationality and paranoia is often shared by his Leftist - Liberal rivals .
It seems that Pat Robertson and the Religious Right , like the irreligious Left , are given more credit than they deserve .
Pat has never held public office and the Religious Right in general has gotten very little of their core agenda into law .
I also think the mostly Liberal press singles Robertson out to discredit Christianity in general .
Even here in a conservative Republican state like Virginia and Pat Robertson 's home base , most do n't identify with his agenda .
Many of Pat Robertson's " Christian " beliefs have nothing to do with the Bible or Christian anything .
If we are to believe the teachings of Jesus , the Christian Right often runs counter to it .
They alienate many moderate and liberal Christians .
These Pat Robertson types worship an abstract idol in Paul 's Gnostic Christ , not the Jesus of the Galilee .
Pat Robertson is clearly a racist and anti-Semitic bigot .
He and other Bible - thumpers may support Israel , they do not support Jews or Judaism .
To these folks Israel is part of some second - coming of Christ prophecy , despite the fact the Bible proves this failed in the First Century .
Pat Robertson is another conspiracy theorist .
Pat Robertson often uses terms such as " New World Order " or " New York bankers " etc. often codewords for Jews or the Freemasons .
But if Pat Robertson is a conspiracy theorist , so is the Liberal Left .
I tracked the hysteria of the Religious Right during the Clinton years of the 1990s , today the Left is equally hysterical with Bush .
What is new , however , is the infiltration of anti-Semitic references .
To quote " these media people speaking in their own code language .
A case in point is their use of the term ' neoconservative . '
Whether they choose to hyphenate the label or not , it 's a pejorative code word for ' Jews . '
( They ) are just trying to support Israel at the USA 's expense .
This is total nonsense .
See Questions on Christian Anti-Semitism by Lewis Loflin .
Pat Robertson has hinted in his books such as The Rising Tide at the armed overthrow of the country to impose a " Christian Nation " as he defines it .
This was part of the general Christian Right hysteria of the 1990s ( along with Y2K ) believing President Clinton was going to turn the country over to the UN and the usual conspiracy theories and end - times Christian nonsense .
The rise and peak of militia movements and murderers like Tim McVeigh ( Oklahoma City ) no doubt influenced by people like Pat Robertson and his 700 Club .
See the following : Randy " Ruby Ridge " Weaver in Sullivan County , Willie Martin and Christian Identity on Trial , Militias Take Aim in Virginia , and Tim McVeigh , an Angry Young Man
Today the militia movement is a wreck , most of its leaders dead or in jail .
But Pat Robertson and his type just keep on inciting attacks with his conspiracy nonsense on judges and the Supreme Court .
( See below . )

Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad hailed Venezuela 's " brave and judicious " vote against the EU - proposed resolution passed by the International Atomic Energy Agency 's Board of Governors .
On this assassination of Hugo Chavez flap , a Christian had this to say :
Pat ,
God help you soul because of a statement you are making under the name of religion .
You are not God and who are you to say that anyone should be assassinated .
You men or women in the name of religion who make such statements are not of God .
I am a child of God and I know that you opinion should be trying to lead people to God not putting hate in their heart .
I watched the clip on this myself and wondered what all the fuss is about .
Pat spoke as a citizen in regards to this mess in Iraq .
The press should stop promoting this man to something he is not .
Racists such as Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton can say anything they want attacking whites and Jews , the press is silent .
Looking for anything to attack Christians or conservatives in general , the liberal press blows it out of proportion .
Here is what he said from the August 22 2005 broadcast of The 700 Club :
...he's going to make that a launching pad for communist infiltration and Muslim extremism all over the continent .
You know , I do n't know about this doctrine of assassination , but if he thinks we 're trying to assassinate him , I think that we really ought to go ahead and do it .
It 's a whole lot cheaper than starting a war .
And I do n't think any oil shipments will stop .
But this man is a terrific danger and the United ...
This is in our sphere of influence , so we can't let this happen .
We have the Monroe Doctrine , we have other doctrines that we have announced .
And without question , this is a dangerous enemy to our south , controlling a huge pool of oil , that could hurt us very badly .
We have the ability to take him out , and I think the time has come that we exercise that ability .
We do n't need another $ 200 billion war to get rid of one , you know , strong - arm dictator .
It 's a whole lot easier to have some of the covert operatives do the job and then get it over with .
The political left went into hysterics over this , then Pat tried to backpedal claiming " take him out " did n't always mean assassination .
But here is what the Left forgets and why Pat is right :
( AP June 30 , 2005 ) - Iran awarded Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez its highest state medal ...
The leftist Venezuelan leader also condemned Israel for what he called the " terrorism " and " madness " of its attacks in Lebanon ..
" Let 's save the human race , let 's finish off the U.S. empire , " Chavez said .
" This ( task ) must be assumed with strength by the majority of the peoples of the world ... The award was to show Iran 's gratitude for his " support for Iran 's stance on the international scene , especially its opposition to a resolution by the International Atomic Energy Agency ..
He is the one who has resisted imperialism for years ...
ADL Outrage at Pat Robertson Over Sharon's Illness
Again , who decided Pat represented all Evangelicals ?
He was involved in a private business venture and represents no church I know of .
While his statements are stupid , he is entitled to his stupid opinions .
But what about the ADL ?
According to Don Feder in Falwell , Farrakhan , and the ADL's Selective Outrage ,
The Anti-Defamation League ostensibly exists to oppose anti-Semitism .
And it does - on occasion - when it is n't too busy bashing evangelicals , fighting Christianity and creating double standards .
Despite its reputation , the ADL is not a Jewish organization .
There 's nothing distinctly Jewish ( i.e. , grounded in Jewish law ) about its operations .
It 's really just another left - wing group , with a leftist agenda .
Politically , it is virtually indistinguishable from the American Civil Liberties Union , People for the American Way , or Americans United for the ( so - called ) Separation of Church and State ...
When it comes to exposing anti-Semitism , the ADL is highly selective .
While the right is a frequent target , the Left ( including Islam ) often gets a pass .
Minister Louis Farrakhan , fuhrer of the Nation of Islam , is the most influential anti-Semite in America .
He makes David Duke look like a member of Hadassah .
In October , Farrakhan is having a reprise of his Million Moron March .
In a May interview with the Amsterdam News , former President Bill Clinton endorsed the rally ( describing it as a " very positive idea " ) .
The ADL decided to simply ignore this aid and comfort to a notorious hate - monger by an ex-president .
Its leadership would never countenance criticism of a man beloved of the Jewish establishment .
I believe Feder is correct as we shall see .
Robertson : Judges worse than Al Qaeda
BY DEREK ROSE
DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER
Federal judges are a more serious threat to America than Al Qaeda and the Sept. 11 terrorists , the Rev. Pat Robertson claimed yesterday .
" Over 100 years , I think the gradual erosion of the consensus that 's held our country together is probably more serious than a few bearded terrorists who fly into buildings , " Robertson said on ABC's " This Week with George Stephanopoulos . "
" I think we have controlled Al Qaeda , " the 700 Club host said , but warned of " erosion at home " and said judges were creating a " tyranny of oligarchy . "
Confronted by Stephanopoulos on his claims that an out - of - control liberal judiciary is the worst threat America has faced in 400 years - worse than Nazi Germany , Japan and the Civil War - Robertson did n't back down .
" Yes , I really believe that , " he said .
" I think they are destroying the fabric that holds our nation together . "
Robertson 's comments came with a showdown looming in the Senate over seven of President Bush 's conservative judicial nominees who have been blocked by Democrat filibusters .
Republicans have threatened a " nuclear option " to pass the judges by rewriting Senate rules to stop the filibusters .
Sources told the Daily News that Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist lacks the 50 votes he needs , which could be a blow to his presidential hopes .
" I do n't think Frist has the votes , " a GOP aide said .
" He 's now in his own corner .
If he does n't have the votes , he 's really screwed . "
Robertson echoed that sentiment .
" I just do n't see him as a future President , " Robertson said . "
Recent stuff is at the top .

While it hardly comes as much of a surprise , Ericsson Chief Marketing Officer Johan Bergendahl is now predicting nothing short of the demise of WiFi hotspots , and he 's saying that they 'll be replaced by -- you guessed it -- mobile broadband .
Speaking at a conference in Stockholm , Bergendahl said that " hot spots at places like Starbucks are becoming the telephone boxes of the broadband era , " and that " in a few years , [ HSPA ] will be as common as Wi-Fi is today . "
Leading to that widespread use , he says , is ever - decreasing prices for mobile broadband subscriptions , and the fact that HSPA is being built into more and more laptops .
Of course , if other companies have their way , WiFi hotspots could become a thing of the past simply because entire cities would effectively be one huge hotspot , although we 'd gladly take both options .

Other People Often Are n't As Shallow As They Seem
People who are n't doing well socially sometimes feel they can't relate to anyone .
One common complaint that flows from this is that they feel other people are dumb and shallow .
If they see themselves as deep and intelligent in comparison , they naturally feel a little alienated .
Some people are irredeemably superficial and vacuous .
I 'm not going to argue that .
Not everyone is though , and in my experience a lot fewer than you 'd think .
This article will offer a little defense of seemingly shallow people , and the supposedly vapid things they do .
There are many superficial traits that can make people seem more shallow than they are
I think a big problem with the " Everyone sucks , I have nothing in common with them " attitude is that you can end up writing off lots of people before you even give them a chance .
Many people who seem superficial do have ' deep ' interests or tendencies .
The problem is that their more surface features are easy to see , while their more substantial traits are hidden .
There are guys who seem like meathead jocks at a glance , but who read constantly and can easily hold their own in a discussion about economics or the Western Canon .
There are women who seem like all they care about is make - up and clubbing , but who are interested in philosophy and history .
The thing is these people also do have more ' shallow ' traits and hobbies , and they 're the first thing you notice .
If you never spoke to them in depth and just went on the stereotype their appearance conjured up , you 'd never know it .
Shallowness is n't an All - or - Nothing thing either .
Someone could spend the day reading about soil erosion in third world countries then go out at night and get drunk with their friends .
So be open - minded , do n't be too quick to judge people , squawk , squawk , squawk .
Here are some things that may make layered , intelligent people come off as dumbasses at a glance :
Personality
Some people are quite smart , but they have naturally scatterbrained , happy - go - lucky , or short - attention - span personalities and can come off as seeming less together than they are .
Accent and style of speaking
Many accents have negative stereotypes associated with them .
Someone could be a physics professor , but have an accent that instantly makes people think , " Wow , what a hick " .
In terms of speaking style some people have a fast , ditzy " Like , OhMyGod ! No Way ! " way of talking that can hide their intelligence .
Or a person could come off as dopey by over doing it with a stoned , laid - back surfer inflection .
Even the fairly common habit of using conversational filler such as ' like ' and ' you know ? ' can make a bad impression .
Writing style
Similarly , sum ppl naturllly write lke this lololol !!!1 ! , whether through email or text messages .
And it 's often not that they can't use proper spelling and punctuation when they want to , they just do n't think it 's important .
Their mentality is more to fire off what they want to say and not worry about how it looks , since they figure it 's still understandable .
If writing correctly is important to us we can't help but see a poorly constructed sentence as reflecting a lesser intellect .
More often it just indicates someone who 's not as worried about that stuff .
The way they act when they 're having a good time
The way people act when they 're excitable and having fun can make them seem dumb and shallow as well .
Guys can get loud and crude .
Women can get shrill and hyper .
Those are pretty natural ways to behave when people are in ' fun mode ' .
They may still be able to have a calm , rational discussion when they 're in a different mood , and under different conditions .
Place in life
Many intelligent , complicated people go through phases in their lives where they enjoy going out and partying a lot , and generally come across as shallow .
Eventually they grow out of it and start to enjoy things that are more toned down .
Their social circle 's shared style or interests
Social circles can have a few common denominators that apply to every member .
Maybe they all like X , Y , Z and their friendship revolves around that .
Each individual member also has their own unique , more esoteric interests .
However , since the rest of the group does n't share these hobbies they may not feel any need to bring them up .
It 's not that they'd be ostracized , just that the other members would n't be that interested or be able to have a good conversation about it .
It 's easier to stick to the topics everyone has in common .
A group of friends could all seem uniform on the surface , but deeper down there 's a range of less obvious world views and pastimes .
This effect also works in reverse and can apply to things that are n't traditionally considered ' deep ' .
In a group that is n't particularly interested in sports , a member may be a really good athlete , but not feel the need to mention it or draw attention to it through their appearance .
Acceptable topics
Lots of people have certain heavy , cerebral topics they 'd love to discuss with everyone ( e.g. , political and social issues ) , but they 've learned that doing so can get everyone riled up and lead to arguments .
They decided a while ago that it was better to resist the urge to talk about things like religion 's negative influence on the world because it's not worth the bad vibes that it can cause .
They save those conversations the right time and place .
Not wanting to talk about certain topics in certain places
Similarly , someone may be fully capable of talking about a subject , but not feel it 's appropriate given the circumstances .
Like if you 're at a wedding and try to talk to another guest about whether Communism is a viable model for society , they may give you a bunch of one - word responses and then change the subject .
It 's not that they 're too shallow to be able to have that discussion , they just want to keep it light and fun at the reception .
Style of their intelligence
Lots of people are smart and interesting , but they come across as pretty regular people , not as refined intellectuals .
I think some people can make the mistake of thinking someone is only smart if they like to discuss topics like logical fallacies and Game Theory .
Not every brainy person is like that .
Their looks and fashion sense
Another thing that can hide someone 's deepness is their appearance .
Someone may accidentally fall into dressing or grooming a certain way , because they like a particular look ( though they do n't necessarily identify with the subculture that look is associated with ) , because they have to , or because that 's how their friends dress .

On the link below you 'll find a training series focused on how to feel at ease socially , even if you tend to overthink today .
It also covers how to avoid awkward silence , attract amazing friends , and why you do n't need an " interesting life " to make interesting conversation .
Click here to go to the free training .
Their thoughts are concealed
It 's easy to think other people are less deep than you because you only see their surface behaviors .
You , on the other hand , have access to all your hidden inner thoughts , many of which are profound and insightful .
Could n't other people have just as rich a mental life as you ?
And could n't people look at you under some situations and conclude there is n't much going on in your head ?
If someone just saw you going about your weekly routine from a distance , how much would they really know about you ?
They seem pretty content
Do n't think you have to be angsty , cynical , and preoccupied with existential questions to be deep , or that anyone who is happy , care - free , and fun is shallow , in an " ignorance is bliss " kind of way .
A lot of people go through a phase where they 're bummed out and ponder the meaning of life , but they work through it , find answers that satisfy them for the time being , and become more cheerful again .
That they 're happy now does n't mean they 're a peasant who never thinks about bigger issues .
They have good social skills
Some people go so far as to think anyone who seems comfortable with social interaction , and who is happy in a group , is automatically a brainless sheep .
They think deep people can only be wretched social outcasts .
I think it 's always good to be able to get along with others .
Even if you 're super complicated and hardly anyone can converse on your level , it does n't hurt .
In moderation shallowness is n't inherently bad
If you 're vapid to your core that 's no good .
But in reasonable doses , shallow things are fine :
Shallowness is part of the lighter side of socializing
There are different modes people can socialize under .
Some forms of supposed shallowness are part of that fun , silly side of being with people .
It is n't better or worse than being reflective and serious , just different .
You can't operate in one social style all the time , just like you 're not always in the mood to watch an intense , draining 3 - hour drama when you pick a movie .
If you lean a little too much towards your logical , serious side consider adding some lighter elements to your personality to balance things out .
Shallow things can be fun
Lots of people love cheesy , gratuitously violent video games , empty , shiny action movies , or websites full of throwaway , puddle - deep humor .
They 're seriously lacking in substance , but they 're fun .
Nothing wrong with having fun .
Shallow things can be a guilty pleasure
Lots of people realize that some of the things they like are fluffy and trashy , but they 're a guilty pleasure , so why not ?
People will listen to disposable bubble - gum pop because it 's catchy .
They 'll watch reality TV or daytime talk shows because of the train wreck appeal of the people on them .
In the same vein , some people do things that they acknowledge are an illogical waste of money on one level , but do them anyway because they like it and get some payoff .
Some women completely realize they spend too much on make - up or purses , but that 's their thing and they feel it makes them look good .
Maybe you 've bought a high - end action figure , neat sculpture , or a sword to put in your room .
Some people probably did n't see the point of those purchases , but you bought them because they appealed to you .
Shallow people can be fun
Even if you may never want to have a long , involved discussion with them , more vacuous people can still be entertaining enough to idly chat to , or to keep you company when you go out .
Some shallow things are n't really shallow at all
Some things that you may label as shallow and mindless are actually quite complicated .
Sports and video games often get written off , but they 're full of nuance and strategy .
Some TV shows or comics can have deeper plots than many people give them credit for at a glance .
Some shallow things have positive benefits
A guy who works out just to look better is still staying in great shape .
A woman who cares a little too much about clothes and her appearance still looks good .
A guy who plays too many MMORPG's is still probably honing a broader life skill or two , like learning how to coordinate a team effort .
Some shallow things work for other people
Sometimes we can look down on the ' shallow ' lifestyle or life path other people take .
Just because it may not appeal you , it does n't mean it is n't rewarding to someone else .
For example , you may think a 9 - 5 job , a house in the suburbs , and 2.2 kids is soul sucking , but other people may find it fulfilling .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - The Tibetan capital Lhasa braced for more possible confrontation on Saturday after independence protesters challenged China ’s rule in the fiercest protests to have rocked the region in two decades .
China accused followers of the Dalai Lama of “ masterminding ” the uprising , which shatters its carefully - cultivated image of national harmony in the build - up to the Beijing Olympic Games .
Angry crowds in the remote mountain city on Friday attacked government offices , burned vehicles and shops and threw stones at police in bloody confrontations that left many injured , according to Chinese state media reports .
China has said that Tibet ’s exiled spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , engineered what were the biggest protests in disputed region since 1989 , a claim he quickly denied .
But while it was unclear whether the clashes would flare or even escalate over the weekend , Beijing has already made it clear that it saw no reason to change its policies in Tibet , where many locals resent a growing Han Chinese presence , especially in Lhasa .
“ We are fully capable of maintaining the social stability of Tibet , ” the Xinhua news agency quoted an official as saying in a statement repeated across Chinese state media on Saturday .
“ The plots by the very few people against the stability and harmony of Tibet run counter to the will of the people and are doomed to fail . ”
Chinese authorities were nonetheless also bracing for more possible unrest in Lhasa on Saturday .
“ Police cordoned off a few downtown sections and are on close lookout for comeback of violence , ” the official Xinhua agency said .

OLYMPIC SHADOW
Already the eruption of popular anger at China ’s presence in Tibet has become an international issue likely to shadow Beijing ’s preparations for the Olympic Games in August .
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour urged China “ to allow demonstrators to exercise their right to freedom of expression and assembly , to refrain from any excessive use of force while maintaining order and to ensure that those arrested are not ill - treated ” .

U.S. ambassador to Beijing Clark Randt told senior Chinese officials on Friday of Washington ’s concern .
“ He took the opportunity , because of what was going on in Lhasa , to urge restraint on the part of the Chinese officials and Chinese security forces , ” a U.S. spokesman told reporters .
The demonstrators attacked the office of the region ’s official Communist Party - run newspaper and the Xinhua office , the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po reported .
“ The Tibet People ’s Armed Police Hospital received many injured officers , ” it said .
Chinese state media has not reported any deaths , but overseas groups with contacts in Tibet say several people may have died .
A spokesman for the Dalai Lama , contacted in the Indian town of Dharamsala , a centre for Tibetan exiles , said of the Chinese allegation against “ the Dalai clique ” : “ This is absolutely baseless and his holiness has made his stand very clear . ”
The Dalai Lama has in recent years called for limited autonomy for Tibet , but some Tibetans demand full independence .
Observers say Kosovo appears set to declare independence in 10 days ' time , just ahead of a meeting of European Union ( EU ) foreign ministers .
The authorities were " awaiting the green light from the West and consider the weekend before the EU meeting as the most probable date , " a source close to the Kosovo Government said .
The EU meeting on February 18 could approve the start of the deployment of a mission charged with supervising the initial phase of independence for the Albanian - majority southern province of Serbia .
" We are assuming [ February ] 17th or 18th , " said a source close to the United Nations , which has run Kosovo since the end of its 1998 - 1999 war .
A US diplomat said independence was likely to be proclaimed on a Sunday , when the UN Security Council does not meet .
Russia is a permanent member of the Security Council , where it has warned it will use its veto powers to block any such declaration in support of its ally Serbia , which staunchly opposes Kosovo independence .

When Alison Garcia , 16 , announced that she was leaving home to be with her 36 - year - old lover , her parents could have been forgiven for hitting the roof .
Instead , Sheila and Paul Garcia did something most other parents would find unthinkable .
Last month , they invited divorced double - glazing fitter and father - of - one Craig Wright into their home , where he now shares a bedroom with their daughter .
According to 51 - year - old Sheila , of Northfleet , Kent , who runs a yachting business with her 56 - year - old husband , they had no choice in the matter .

Puppy love : But Alison Garcia insists her romance with Craig Wright will last
" What I did n't want was to back her into a corner by laying down the law and forcing her to choose between me and him , " she says .
" She 's always been a headstrong girl , and the more I say ' no ' , the more she 'll say ' yes ' . "
Of course , most parents would find it hard to stomach the idea that their 16 - year - old daughter was having a sexual relationship with a 36 - year - old man under their roof .
And Sheila is no different .
" I hate the thought of her sleeping with any man , because I think she is too young to understand the implications of a sexual relationship , " she says .
" But I know she is 16 and I can't stop her .
If I do n't take the softer approach I fear she will take off with Craig and cut ties with us .
" If I forbid it or attempt to ban her from seeing him , I risk losing my precious child .
" Paul has managed to accept the situation far better than I have , because he believes we should let her make her own mistakes . "
Unsurprisingly , Alison is adamant that she knows best .
Having got her own way with her parents , she is already dreaming of marriage and babies with her boyfriend of four months , despite being a drama student and also harbouring ambitions to travel the world as an actress .
Alison claims to be " very mature for my age " - something she says her lover told her not long after they met last October .
" I 'm not stupid , " she says stubbornly .
" I know to the outside world such a huge age difference must seem weird and unnatural .
" My mum keeps saying it 's a ridiculous phase and I 'll grow out of it , but I won't .
" My dad is much more laid - back .
He takes the view that it 's my life and I have to do what I want .
" After all , I 'm 16 and can make up my own mind .
He recognises that I 'm not a child any more , but my mum does n't . "
Sheila , for her part , blames the situation on " society " and " the premature ageing and sexualisation of young people " .
Rather more enlightening is her admission : " We took the liberal approach to bringing up our child .
" We treated her like a mini- adult all along , never taking the attitude that because she was a child we should treat her as less of an equal . "

Sheila Garcia with Alison before Craig moved in
But if anything , the experience of the Garcia family is a depressing reminder of the perils of modern parenting , where boundaries and guidelines are so often thrown out of the window and where allowing a child to do whatever they want is somehow seen as the action of a loving , trusting parent .
Alison met her middle - aged lover in a pub - despite being two years below the legal age for drinking alcohol .
Her mother appears unaware that Craig was not her first , but her fourth lover .
" We do n't talk about sex as such , " says Sheila .
" I know she 's had sex education at school - but to my knowledge she was n't sexually active before she met Craig .
" I do n't know what she gets up to in that respect now .
I do n't ask because I do n't want to know the details . "
And the details of Alison 's relationship with the man 20 years her senior certainly make uncomfortable reading .
She met him at a Halloween party and " fell head over heels for him " .
Her clichéd recollections are typical of any romantic teen : " I thought he was gorgeous - tall , dark and handsome .
" We started chatting and there was an instant chemistry between us .
He made me feel like I was the only person in the room . "
Alison admits she knew he was much older than her .
" The stubble on his chin made him look very different to the baby - faced school boys I 'm used to - but I assumed he was about 25 , " she says .
" He was funny and charming - a far cry from the boys my age I 'd been used to dating .
" Your average 16 or 17 - year - old boy is awkward , immature and only interested in impressing his mates , whereas Craig was n't showing off or being silly .
" It was such a nice change .
I thought : ' If this is what older men are like then I want to date one ' . "
The evening ended with what Alison describes as a " really special " kiss .
She gave him her mobile number and left at 1 am - a rather late hour , it could be argued , for one so young .
The following night , they met up in another local pub - again it seems that the youngster was entirely unsupervised by her parents .
Wright bought her drinks , apparently unaware that he was breaking the law by doing so .
" I 've been going to pubs for about a year now , even though my parents do n't know about it , " claims Alison .
" I did n't want to tell Craig how young I was at first and blow my chances , so when he bought the drinks I did n't say anything . "
In fact , thanks to her heavily applied make - up and dressy clothes , Alison had fooled him .
" Craig did n't even think to question if I was under -age .
I was worried that he might not want to go out with a girl who had just left school .
I tried really hard to be mature . "
On their second date - again in the pub - Alison became " tipsy " and blurted out the truth .
She recalls : " Craig looked very shocked .
He said : ' You 're kidding .
I thought you were at least 18 . '
" Then he told me he was 36 and I just fell off my chair . "
If Wright was shocked , he was not worried enough to call a halt to the relationship .
" Neither of us cared about the 20 - year age gap , " gushes Alison .
" He just leaned in to give me another kiss .
That night we sat down and told each other everything about our lives .
" He told me he was divorced and had a two - year - old daughter , but that did n't put me off at all .
" I thought it was so sweet that he was being so honest with me . "
Of course , having discovered she was only 16 , most men would have walked away .
Instead , the relationship became sexual a few days later .
Alison 's description is heartbreakingly naive .
" He 's the fourth guy I 've been with , but the others were all inexperienced teenagers - boys I 'd been going out with for a few months .
" It was very different with Craig .
He knew exactly what he was doing .
He told me how beautiful I was and made me feel really special and cared for . "
A few weeks later , Alison introduced Wright to her parents , and told them they wanted to rent a place together .
In January , she asked them if her lover could move into the family home while they save up .
Not surprisingly , Sheila was initially horrified at the prospect .
" My mum told me in no uncertain terms there was no way , because she 's dead against us being together .
" But my dad managed to convince her that it was better for us to live there with them than move out into a flat that was not decent .
" I think they both want the best for me , so eventually Mum agreed . "
Sheila says : " When Alison first told us , I was shocked and obviously concerned , but I thought it was just a fling and had no future .
" But as time has gone on , I realise it 's not going to fizzle out so quickly . "
She describes Wright as a " perfectly decent guy " , but adds : " What I can't understand is what a man of Craig 's age sees in a girl who is so young .
She can't possibly fulfil his emotional needs .
" He has had so much more life experience than Alison .
She is just a child really , even if the law does n't see it that way , and should n't be in a permanent relationship , let alone with a man of his age .
" Even though they are talking about getting a flat and she 's mentioned her wish to marry him , I think , or at least fervently hope , that once the novelty wears off and she realises that committing to him will probably mean giving up her dreams of becoming an actress and travelling the world , she 'll call it off . "
For the time being , while Alison 's parents are too afraid to take her in hand , the tension in the Garcia household continues .
" When Craig 's not at work we spend most of our time in my room , " says Alison .
" When he does speak to my mum they are both civil , which makes things easier .
" But it is a bit awkward when he bumps into my mum en route to the shower or when he 's making a cup of tea .
" I wish my mum was more accepting of our relationship .
I love her and do n't want to alienate her , but she has to understand I 'm with Craig now , and that 's not going to change .
" I do n't feel Craig and I are doing anything wrong . "
As for marriage , Alison appears set on pursuing the very path her mother is dreading .
" I think my mum worries that I 'm settling down too early and wasting my life , " says the teenager .
" That will inevitably happen , because I do want to marry Craig and have kids , and he is n't getting any younger .
" I know this means I 'll have to become a mum a bit earlier than most of my friends , but I do n't think I 'm throwing my life away because of it .
" I have n't met Craig 's daughter yet , because she lives with her mother in Nottingham , but I 'm sure I 'll be a good stepmum . "
On the one hand , it is hard not to feel sorry for the Garcias , who have somehow become caught in this terrible situation , terrified of losing their only child .
But on the other , the couple seem strangely reluctant to accept any responsibility for what is happening to their daughter , blaming " society " instead .
According to Sheila : " Girls no longer get a childhood past about the age of ten when they are asked to make choices on what lipstick to wear or what jeans to buy .
" It 's a sad state of affairs , and one from which I fear there is no way back .
" It seems we have raised a generation of children who believe they can do whatever the hell they like , without worrying about the consequences . "
A critic might counter that it is often parents themselves who pass on such values to their children and then react with horror at the resulting behaviour .
But Sheila insists : " For now , all I can do is bite my tongue and hope I 'm right about what I think the outcome of this will be . "
The problem is , of course , that there could be any number of outcomes - not least that her daughter could become pregnant .
" When it does end in tears , I 'll be here to pick up the pieces .
That 's what mums do , " says Sheila .
" I want her to be able to come to me for support and advice .
" I do n't want to take away that option by throwing her out or refusing to speak to her .
I want to be able to communicate with Alison in the hope that if I do it subtly , eventually the message will get through . "
They are fine words indeed , but probably of little use to Alison , caught up in a world beyond her age and experience .
In years to come , when she looks back on the events of the past few months , will she really thank her parents for giving her such a liberal upbringing ?
Mozilla has just launched their new Firefox Add - ons site that shows off a sparkling and freshly revamped interface .
Back in February we took a glimpse at what a preview of the new add - ons site had to offer , and overall I would say that it is a really nice improvement over the prior version .
The thing that I like the most is that the add-ons in the Sandbox are actually shown with the search results regardless of whether you are logged in .
They are labeled as “ experimental ” add - ons if they are in the Sandbox , and if you want to install them you ’ll still need to login .
At least users will know that the add - ons exist which was a big complaint of the extension developers that I had talked to before .
It was almost discouraging for developers to create extensions since they were n’t widely available to the public right away .
There are two things that I do n’t like though .
The first is that there is still no way to customize the sort order of your search results .
I ’m sure this has to do with performance issues , but I hate not being able to see my search results according to popularity or most recently released .
The second thing that I do n’t like , and this is quite a doozy for me , is that the site now checks what version of Firefox you ’re running .
And guess what , it wo n’t let you install an extension that does n’t meet the version requirements specified by the developer .
If an extension is compatible with your Firefox you ’ll see the typical button on the pictured on the left side below , otherwise it will be replaced with the button on the right :
I looked around and I saw no place where I could change this setting , and seeing that I ’m the type of person who likes to test out pre-release versions of Firefox this can cause a lot of headaches .
I ’m currently running Firefox 3 Beta 4 , and many of the extensions are disabled for me since the developers have n’t gotten around to updating them .
Sure this is nice so that people do n’t think an extension will work with their version of Firefox , but what about people who want to try them anyway ?
Check it out and let us know what you think about the new site .

Both killers were convicted with compelling DNA evidence
A senior police officer has argued for a universal register , after two killers were convicted on DNA evidence .
Sally Anne Bowman 's killer , Mark Dixie , and Suffolk serial murderer Steve Wright were both captured because their DNA was taken after unrelated offences .
But the Home Office said a mandatory database " would raise significant practical and ethical issues " .
The DNA database , which covers England and Wales , currently contains around 4.5 m profiles - routinely taken from criminal suspects after most arrests .
It is already the largest of its kind in the world but is controversial .
Since 2004 , the data of everyone arrested for a recordable offence - all but the most minor offences - has remained on the system regardless of their age , the seriousness of their alleged offence , and whether or not they were prosecuted .
' Reasonable and proportionate '
Steve Wright was on the system after being convicted of theft in 2003 , and when police found his DNA on the bodies of some of his victims they matched it with his profile .
It is my opinion that a national DNA register - with all its appropriate safeguards - could have identified Sally Anne 's murderer within 24 hours
Det Supt Stuart Cundy
Send us your comments
But Mark Dixie was not on the system at the time of Sally Anne Bowman 's murder in 2005 .
It was only when Dixie was arrested for assault after a fight in a bar that his DNA was taken and he was linked to the murder .
He was arrested within five hours .
Det Supt Stuart Cundy , who led the murder hunt which led to Dixie 's conviction , said : " It is my opinion that a national DNA register - with all its appropriate safeguards - could have identified Sally Anne 's murderer within 24 hours .
" Instead it took nearly nine months before Mark Dixie was identified , and almost two - and - a - half years for justice to be done . "
The Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) is also calling for a debate on the issue .
How to maintain the security of a database with 4.5 m people on it is one thing .
Doing that for 60 m people is another
Tony McNulty , Home Office minister
Lincolnshire 's Chief Constable , Tony Lake , who speaks for the association on DNA , said he was not convinced by the need for a universal database , but recognised the arguments on both sides .
He said : " If there was a national database of everybody then we would solve more crime , of that there is absolutely no doubt ...
" But any database that we hold has to be reasonable and proportionate in the eyes of the public . "
No ' silver bullet '
Home Office minister Tony McNulty said a national database was not a " silver bullet " and it would raise practical as well as civil liberties issues .
The proposal is for all DNA samples to be kept on police databases
" How to maintain the security of a database with 4.5 m people on it is one thing , " he said .
" Doing that for 60 m people is another . "
Shadow home secretary David Davis said the debate about a DNA database should be put on a " statutory footing " .
" Only then can we address anomalies like the fact that database contains details of hundreds of thousands of innocent people ...
" But does not hold the details of every serious offender . "
The Liberal Democrats said the party was opposed to the idea of a national system saying it did not " stack up on practical grounds " .
Home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne told the BBC it would involve " a massive intrusion into civil liberties " .
He said there would be " a real question mark over potential abuse if DNA samples and details were lost " .
Human rights
In September 2007 , Lord Justice Sedley - one of England 's most experienced appeal court judges - called for the register to be made universal .
DNA PROFILING Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) is found in virtually all cells
Only a tiny sample of saliva , blood , semen , etc , is needed for testing
At the molecule 's core is a long sequence of chemical units , which is checked for a gender and 10 other ' markers '
Probability of a chance match is less than one in one billion A match may be with a specific individual or hint at a relative Profiles can provide indications of ethnic origin
They do not point to genetic disorders or susceptibilities
He condemned the existing system as " indefensible " , said it was biased against ethnic minorities , and it would be fairer to include everyone , guilty or innocent .
Human rights organisation Liberty said a universal database could be open to abuse .
But law reform group Justice said a national database should either list those guilty of a crime or everybody in the country .
Meanwhile , the existing register could be threatened when the European Court of Human Rights is asked to rule next week on a test case of two Britons who want their details removed from the database .
The pair , from Sheffield , had their DNA taken after they were arrested in 2001 , but charges were not pressed .
The applicants say their human rights have been infringed by the decision to leave their details on the database , despite the fact that they had never been found guilty of a crime .

Subway in Dubai : most beautiful of the world ?
As with everything in Dubai , even the underground is extravagant .
If you ever think about travel to Russia and visit Moscow , you might like visit Moscow subway .
Itâ€™s definetely worth looking .
First of all architecture of Moscow subway is astonishing , I think Iâ€™ll make a separate post about architecture of Moscow subway , because each stop , each station is so nice .
During Soviet era amounts worth of millions dollars were invested in the construction of Moscow subway .
Each station is like museum , with huge patchworks occupying some walls , high ceilings and antique type chandeliers .

One of the challenges you 'll face when deploying an application in Seaside , especially if you 're running headless on a Linux box somewhere , is how to upgrade your production application to the latest version of your code .
For the longest time , I 've done this the easy way , upgrade the production image off - line , upload it , and restart the services .
It 's simple and straight forward , but it blows away all active sessions and kicks off any users currently online .
There are other more interesting ways .
Some people use VNC to connect to their production image , fire up Monticello , and hot upgrade the code .
Personally , I 've never been able to get a stable version of VNC going , there are always issues , the latest being that the client is messed up by the nice Squeak UI Enhancements hiding the menus .
Too much hassle , I gave up , I do n't trust VNC at all .
There 's a simple web based method within Seaside under / tools / versionuploader , you can use the web version of Monticello to load packages into the running image and then save the image from there .
It 's simple and effective , if not a bit clunky , but it works great if you 're willing to expose that to the internet wrapped with just basic http authentication .
I 've been using this , but I thought I could have a little fun hacking up something a little more interesting .
So what are we talking about here , just loading a few Monticello packages and saving the image , how hard could that be to automate ?
Turns out , not so hard if I use the Installer that comes in Damien 's dev image ( that my image is based upon ) .
I decide to make my images upgrade themselves from a staging directory where I can just secure copy or ftp up the new versions plus an empty trigger file named " load " to kick the process off .
I 've been playing with it a few days now , seems to work pretty well .
Here 's what it takes to make a self upgrading image ( assuming you use Monticello to package all your code , as I do ) .
It 's just two methods really , one to load all the packages deleting them after each one is installed , assuming the load file exists ...
loadChanges | dir | dir := ( FileDirectory default directoryNamed : ' load - package ' ) assureExistence .
dir fileNames select : [ : ea | ea endsWith : '.mcz ' ] thenDo : [ : fileName | ( ( dir fileExists : fileName ) and : [ dir fileExists : # load ] ) ifTrue : [ Transcript show : ( fileName , ' : ' ) .
Installer installFile : ( dir fullNameFor : fileName ) .
Transcript cr. dir deleteFileNamed : fileName ] ]. ( dir fileExists : # load ) ifTrue : [ dir deleteFileNamed : #load .
SmalltalkImage current saveSession ]
And a second to kick off a background process that runs continually , say every few seconds , that kicks off #loadChanges .
watchForChanges [ [ ( Delay forSeconds : 5 ) wait .
[ self loadChanges ] on : Error do : [ : error |
Transcript show : error ] ] repeat ] forkAt : Processor userBackgroundPriority + 1 named : ' code loader '
Then I call watchForChanges in a class side #initialize somewhere on a utility class so the background process is kicked off automatically in any image I load my code into .
Seems pretty slick so far , just upload the new packages , upload an empty file named load , the image upgrades itself , deletes all the files in the staging directory , saves itself , and chugs along like nothing happened at all .
No session are lost , no users booted , if anything they might notice a slight pause for a bigger package loading .
This all of course assumes your production image is basically read only , i.e. has no code changes in it , as mine are .
Enjoy !
A photo from Japan 's Kaguya / SELENE moon probe shortly after jettisoning one of two mini-satellites .
The western rim Oceanus Procellarum is clearly visible in the image , which was taken on Oct. 5 about 497 miles ( 800 kilometers ) from the Moon .
Almost onemonth after Japan 's successful launch of the Kaguya lunar probe , the unmannedobservatory has begun its first major activities in orbit around the moon .
In additionto snapping its first lunar images , the probe jettisoned one of two 110 - pound ( 50 - kilogram ) " baby " satellites thatwill help create a detailed gravity map of the moon .
Theseparation of the miniature satellite , called Rstar , occurred on Oct. 8 at 8:36 p.m. EDT ( 0036 GMT Oct. 9 ) .
Mission managers expect Japan Aerospace ExplorationAgency 's Kaguya tojettison its second 3.3 - foot - diameter ( 1 - meter - diameter ) mini-satellite called VRADon Oct. 14 .
The 55 billion yen ( $ 480 million ) Kaguya spacecraft , formally known as the SELenological and ENgineeringExplorer ( SELENE ) , is named after a moon princess in Japanese folklore .
Thespacecraft successfully was launched on Sept. 14 from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan and enteredlunar orbit on Oct. 5 .
Kaguya willconduct detailedstudies of the moon using 14 different science instruments from a height ofabout 62 miles ( 100 kilometers ) above the lunar surface during its mission .
Japanese engineers and scientists designed the spacecraft to producehigh - resolution surface and gravity maps , observe the moon 's magnetic fieldsand even search for water ice , among otherscience objectives , during the one - year mission .
China plansto launch the next moon - bound spacecraft , called the Chang 'e - 1 , by the end ofthe year , followed by NASA 's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and India 'sChandrayaan - 1 spacecraftin 2008 .

It was n't a full day , just a couple of hours really , but his early - morning shift Wednesday to serve breakfast , mop and clean bathrooms for an elderly man in a clapboard East Oakland house delivered Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama a refreshing moment in the 2008 presidential campaign : a chance to be a candidate without a script .
Escaping what he termed the " bubble " of staged events and fancy fundraisers , the Illinois senator tentatively but earnestly smoothed the white chenille bedspread of John Thornton , 86 , a disabled and housebound former concrete mason who needs round - the - clock home health care .
" My wife says my making the bed is a little shaky , " Obama sighed , as he wrestled with the wrinkles .
" The laundry and the breakfast , I can handle . "
Obama 's Oakland stint was part of a creative campaign by the Service Employees International Union to focus the presidential campaign on the issues of working people .
On Wednesday , he became the fourth Democratic presidential candidate to " walk a day " in a service worker 's shoes - a scripted event of a different kind that highlighted the power of one of the Democratic Party 's strongest constituencies , organized labor .
Obama was led through his 6 - 9 a.m. shift in Alameda County , a stronghold of the service workers union , by a smiling , energetic home health care worker named Pauline Beck , 61 .
Beck bathes , dresses , feeds and cares for Thornton for $ 10.50 an hour .
While Beck 's life - struggling to make ends meet with two jobs and regular visits to the food bank - could n't be more different than the 46 - year - old Democratic presidential candidate 's , she came away feeling " he just cares about people .
...
He wanted to know about me , yes , he did .
He really wanted to feel what I did . "
Obama , surrounded by reporters , photographers and television cameras , arrived at dawn in a black polo shirt and khakis to say grace and have breakfast with Beck 's family in Alameda .
Almost immediately , he began drawing out the life story and experiences of the mother of three adult children and foster mother of three kids , ages 2 to 17 .
He was concerned that she did n't get sick leave , vacation time or even overtime , even though " you 're supposed to be off at 11 - but sometime you do n't get off until 1 ? "
Seeing Beck 's bubbly 2 - year - old great - grandnephew , Damion , Obama talked about his own home .
" The hardest thing about running for president is being away from your family , " said Obama , the father of two young girls .
" My wife , she just holds it all together , " he said .
As Beck nodded sympathetically , he said , " Sometimes I think I miss them more than they miss me . "
Beck , escorting him to the Oakland home of her elderly charge , then put Obama to work , a cheery taskmaster .
" I got the mop , the bleach and the washing powder , " she said , tossing her jaunty gray curls , and showing the presidential candidate some new moves .
She instructed him how to lift , dress and bathe a much bigger body without breaking your back ( " know how to brace yourself " ) ; she showed the senator how to fold clothes ( " shake 'em out , then they do n't get wrinkled " ) ; and she occasionally reminded him of the to - do list ( " there ai n't no standing around " ) .
Obama gave it back to her .
" My wife 's going to see all this and say , ' How come you do n't do this at home ? ' " he said , grabbing a green dustpan and getting ready to clean the bathroom .
" I 'm going to tell her I 'm running for president . "
Beck laughed as he added mischievously : " She 's too smart to run for president .
...
She just wants to tell the president what to do . "
The two , from such different worlds , seemed to bond : Beck , one of the 14,000 home health care workers in the county , and Obama , the presidential hopeful who had to relearn the fine art of making a turkey , mustard and mayo sandwich .
By the end of the day , the candidate said the visit provided him a look at important issues that presidential campaigns just do n't seem to find time for anymore .
" Talking to someone like Pauline reminds me why I got into politics in the first place , " Obama said , as he sat down after his cleaning chores to make the man Beck calls Mr. John his turkey sandwich and wrap it in a Glad bag with some chips .
" Because I think there 's a real tendency during the course of a campaign , especially a high - profile , high - pressure campaign , to start worrying about the tactics and the strategies and the competition ... instead of worrying about whether Mr. John gets his sandwich .
And that Pauline is getting paid for the wonderful work that she does . "
" It gives me , also , a lot of confidence about the American people , " he said .
" People joke about how I talk about hope a lot .
The reason I 'm hopeful is people like Pauline . "
" There 's a lot of good people like Pauline who are n't asking for much .
They just want a living wage .
They want health care , so they are n't bankrupt when they get sick .
They want a good education for their children and their grandchildren .
They want to be able to retire with a little dignity and respect .
That 's not too much to ask for in a country as wealthy as ours . "
While Obama 's stint underscored the value of an endorsement from the SEIU , the country 's fastest - growing union , it also served to provide an up - close - and - personal look at just why he connects with so many people on such a visceral level .
Beck said that she , too , got what she wanted out of the day : someone to listen .
When the day began , she said , she was unsure whether any of the candidates for president really cared how she lived .
By day 's end , she said she believed that Obama " will be a president that cares about labor .
" What he did is really genuine , " Beck said .
And she gave him the highest compliment she could think of :
She called him " my co-worker , Sen. Obama . "
Obama 's Bay Area visit
Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , after his stint as a home health care worker , answered questions from reporters about a variety of issues .
The Democratic presidential candidate :
-- Urged his supporters not to contribute to independent political groups - particularly so - called 527 organizations that have no individual donation limits - that are currently raising money to aid his cause .
" My recommendation to people who are interested in supporting me is to support me through our campaign - the way over 250,000 donors have supported us , the way hundreds of thousands of volunteers have supported us .
Get involved in the campaign that we 've set up , that is above board , that is transparent , that is legal .
And I think if people channel their energies in that way , we 'll all be better off .
-- Said if he were president he would " probably " invite Giants slugger Barry Bonds to the White House to recognize the outfielder 's career home run record as " a remarkable achievement . "
But Obama said the use of performance - enhancing drugs is a " cloud " over baseball and other sports .
" I would like to see our sports leagues recognize that children look up to sports stars more than probably any other individuals ... and right now , I 'm not sure our kids are learning the right lessons . "
New Times submitted a formal Notice of Claim on Wednesday , February 20 , against the public officials responsible for a fiasco in October that saw the attempted trampling of the First Amendment rights of this newspaper and its readers , and culminated in the jailing of its founders , Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin .
The notice , required under Arizona law before government officials can be sued , paints a political landscape gone awry , with public servants turning taxpayer - supported institutions on end in defiance of the U.S. Constitution , due process , and the right of a free press to operate without intimidation .
" This is not a decision undertaken lightly , " said Michael Lacey , executive editor of Village Voice Media , which owns New Times , and who , along with CEO Larkin , founded the paper .
" We are not an organization , and Larkin and I are not individuals , that sue people .
It 's just not what we do .
But I feel like if we do n't do something , it 's an invitation for this kind of behavior to continue . "
The " behavior " to which Lacey referred was particularly chilling : a special prosecutor running amok , issuing overbroad and unconstitutional subpoenas aimed at the reading and browsing habits of citizens ; a vendetta by Sheriff Joe Arpaio against New Times and its staff , the arrests of the paper 's executives on petty charges in the middle of the night by members of the sheriff 's clandestine Selective Enforcement Unit .
" What emerges is one of the most nakedly oppressive , conscience - shocking assaults on a free press by police and prosecutors in U.S. history , " observes New Times lawyer Michael Manning in the Notice of Claim .
By law , the notice had to be filed within 180 days of the culmination of the events described here and had to contain a damages amount .
New Times is asking for $ 15 million in damages if the matter is settled before April 15 , the end of a 60 - day period in which the defendants — Arpaio , Thomas and Wilenchik — must reply .
" If New Times is required to pursue litigation , the settlement demand will increase , " the notice warns .
Earlier in the day on which Lacey and Larkin were arrested at their homes and bundled off to jail , County Attorney Andrew Thomas ' handpicked special prosecutor Dennis Wilenchik essentially demanded that New Times be bankrupted .
Wilenchik had asked Superior Court Judge Anna Baca to impose crushing fines against the paper for daring to publish an October 18 story ( " Breathtaking Abuse of the Constitution " ) about his grand jury subpoenas seeking vast , detailed information about New Times ' readers .
For this misdemeanor , Wilenchik not only wanted the story 's authors , Lacey and Larkin , and their lawyers arrested , he wanted Baca to assess fines of $ 10,000 for every hour that New Times refused to take the grand jury story off newspaper racks and the Internet .
In the course of a year , the fines would have totaled about $ 90 million .
To get a better handle on the enormity of Wilenchik 's demand , consider that New Times bills about $ 14 million annually , out of which printing , rent , supplies , salaries , benefits , and taxes must be paid .
Wilenchik 's gambit was not an aberration .
After his appointment as special prosecutor , he continually upped the ante in his extra-constitutional game of brinkmanship .
No grand jury was ever impaneled during the affair .
Rather , as Lacey observed in a subsequent column ( " He Just Does n't Get It , " November 1 , 2007 ) , Wilenchik " anointed " himself the grand jury in power - mad defiance of state law .
The law holds that a prosecutor must notify the grand jury foreman and the presiding judge within 10 days of issuing any subpoenas .
" Wilenchik did neither , " New Times ' Notice of Claim states .
" The grand jury was nothing more than an empty prop to Wilenchik . "
Accordingly , it was not the legal system that put the brakes on this rogue prosecutor ; it was a public incensed over the news of the Lacey - Larkin arrests .
County Attorney Thomas , Wilenchik 's former employee at the law firm of Wilenchik & Bartness , grudgingly called a press conference at his office on October 19 , the day after the arrests , and fired Wilenchik as special prosecutor .
" We are not going to proceed with this investigation , " stated Thomas , before a packed room of reporters .
" There is a right way and a wrong way to bring a prosecution and to hold people accountable for their offenses .
And what happened here was the wrong way .
I do not condone it .
I do not defend it .
And so it ends today . "
Thomas nervously hedged his mea culpa .
He would not apologize to New Times , instead insisting that the newspaper apologize to Arpaio for publishing his home address online , even though Arpaio 's address remains readily available on government Web sites , such as those of the Maricopa County Recorder 's Office and the Arizona Corporation Commission .
Though Thomas fired Wilenchik from handling future criminal matters for the County Attorney 's Office , he retained him as counsel in civil matters .
As a result , Wilenchik & Bartness continues to rack up county money .
As the notice against Wilenchik and the others explains , Wilenchik 's lucrative stint representing the county appears to be quid pro quo .
Wilenchik employed Thomas at his law firm during the time Thomas was first running for county attorney in 2004 .
Yet there 's no proof available that Thomas ever billed legal work for the firm .
Since Thomas took office , Wilenchik 's firm has banked $ 2.4 million — and counting — for legal work for the county .
Speaking to the New York Times , ASU legal scholar James Weinstein labeled Wilenchik 's subpoenas seeking information on New Times ' readers " grossly , shockingly , breathtakingly overbroad " and " a case of harassment of the press . "
The path to the issuance of these subpoenas was a lengthy and circuitous one .
In mid-2004 , Arpaio was in the midst of a pitched and ugly primary against challenger Dan Saban , whom MCSO officers smeared with the ugly and untrue allegation that he had raped his adoptive mother , Ruby Norman .
Meanwhile , New Times writer John Dougherty was making serious inquiries into various aspects of Arpaio 's rule in Maricopa County .
He sought public records on the Saban investigation , information on inmate deaths , personnel files on certain sheriff 's deputies , and information on the sheriff 's personal real estate investments .
In a July 1 , 2004 column , " Sheriff Joe 's Real Estate Game , " Dougherty revealed that Arpaio had invested $ 690,000 in cash in two real estate holdings in Scottsdale and Fountain Hills .
Dougherty wondered if Arpaio was hiding ill - gotten gains , because information about this commercial property was redacted under a state law aimed at protecting law enforcement officials from harm .
The law was meant to allow police officers to keep their home addresses out of the public eye for obvious reasons , but Arpaio misused the statute so that it hid most information about his commercial real estate .
At the same time , Arpaio 's Fountain Hills home address was available on myriad public and private Internet sites .
Dougherty noted that $ 690,000 in cash was a lot for a public official to invest , considering that Arpaio made about $ 78,000 a year , along with federal Drug Enforcement Agency civil service retirement pay of about $ 65,000 .
A week later , Dougherty wrote in another column about the real estate ventures again ( " Stick It to ' Em ! " ) .
At the column 's conclusion , he listed Arpaio 's home address to illustrate the irony of its being so readily available while his commercial property information was hidden .
Months later , New Times learned that the sheriff was seeking to have New Times prosecuted under another state law that made it unlawful to publish a law enforcement official 's home address on the World Wide Web .
The law was a throwback to a time when the Internet was considered newfangled technology .
While making it a Class 5 felony to reproduce such a home address on the Web , the law made no sanctions against such publication in newspapers and magazines or on TV and radio .
Indeed , even putting a law officer 's address on a billboard near his neighborhood would be perfectly legal .
A required element of the Internet law was that the publication of an officer 's address must cause " an imminent and serious threat " that was " reasonably apparent " to the publisher .
When Arpaio first sought New Times ' prosecution under the arcane statute , then - County Attorney Rick Romley declined to prosecute .
There seemed to be no real threat to the sheriff — though his top deputies have been fixated on the notion that " America 's toughest sheriff " could easily be the target of assassination .
It 's been as though his staff believes that , without anybody trying to kill the sheriff , Arpaio 's hard - on - crime policies lose credibility .
So the MCSO has n't been above manufacturing a plot to make the boss look like a tough guy .
In 1999 , Arpaio and his chief deputy , David Hendershott , attempted to frame 18 - year - old James Saville in a phony bomb plot supposedly aimed at Arpaio ( " The Plot to Assassinate Arpaio , " August 5 , 1999 ) .
TV reporters were called ahead of time to chronicle the teenager 's arrest outside an Italian restaurant where Arpaio was dining .
Saville 's lawyer noted the obvious entrapment , and Saville was unanimously acquitted by a jury after the MCSO 's unscrupulous antics were aired in court .
Last year , the Sheriff 's Office revealed that it had spent an estimated $ 500,000 investigating a bogus death threat that involved such highly improbable co-conspirators as the Minutemen , immigrants rights activist Elias Bermudez , and hit men working for the Mexican mafia .
On the word of a confidential informant who failed a key question on a lie - detector test about whether or not he was telling the truth about the alleged conspiracy , the sheriff 's Selective Enforcement Unit ( the same group that nabbed Lacey and Larkin ) staked out a dairy in Tolleson and flew to Connecticut to interrogate a teenage girl whose e-mail was linked to the pseudo - scheme .
Most recently , the MCSO trumpeted the conviction of Matthew Carl Sanderson , a native of Canada , for making an Internet threat against Arpaio .
The sheriff flew to Toronto for the three - day trial .
In the end , Sanderson received just three months of incarceration .
" There has never been any credible evidence of death threats against our Sheriff , " attorney Manning states in New Times ' notice .
" Indeed , the only ' death threats ' to Sheriff Arpaio have been made - for - TV productions procured or created by the Sheriff 's sizable PR staff . "
Arpaio 's obsession with such dubious threats would be comic if not for their dire , costly , and time - consuming consequences .
Though Romley would not touch the sheriff 's desired prosecution of New Times , Arpaio refused to let the matter drop .
When County Attorney Thomas took office , he had a political ally , and again he asked for the legal action .
Thomas , however , had already borne the brunt of critical articles in New Times by the time the complaint reached his desk so he handed it off to Pinal County , citing a conflict of interest .
After two years , Pinal County returned the matter to Thomas last spring .
As Manning put it in New Times ' notice , " the Pinal County Attorney 's Office did not share the Defendants ' passion for political revenge . "
This time , despite Thomas ' already - declared conflict , he appointed his friend Dennis Wilenchik as special prosecutor in the New Times matter .
A lawyer who had made his name in toxic - mold litigation , Wilenchik was known for his bull - in - a - china shop approach to civil law .
He used the same tactics against the new objects of his prosecutorial zeal .
As Lacey and Larkin revealed in the grand jury subpoena article , Wilenchik demanded " every note , tape , and record from every story written about Sheriff Arpaio by every [ New Times ] reporter over a period of years . "
Acting on his own ( remember , no grand jury ever existed in the matter ) , Wilenchik hit New Times , as well as reporters John Dougherty and Paul Rubin individually , with subpoenas .
Rubin 's personal subpoena was especially egregious , as it sought everything Rubin had used to write his cover story " Below the Belt " ( September 20 , 2007 ) , which documented Buckeye Police Chief Dan Saban 's failed lawsuit against Arpaio for the 2004 smear involving his adoptive mother .
Wilenchik defended Arpaio in the case , and his unsavory out - of - court activities were criticized in the article .
The Rubin subpoena , sent the day after New Times published the article , sought records that had nothing to do with the home - address matter .
" Rubin 's only ' misstep ' was in criticizing Arpaio and Wilenchik , " reads New Times ' notice .
" His story was not even remotely relevant to the matter Wilenchik had been hired to pursue ( a 2004 story Rubin did not author ) .
" In the column disclosing the profound corruption of the investigation that led to their arrest , Lacey and Larkin succinctly summarized what was all too clear : ' It is impossible to view Rubin 's subpoena as anything other than what it was : an act of vengeance . ' "
Wilenchik also demanded in overarching subpoenas sent to New Times and to Dougherty all information on New Times ' online readers from 2004 to 2007 , including IP addresses , browsing habits , cookies , and domain names .
Wilenchik had cast a wide , unprecedented dragnet .
The targets were not just journalists and publishers , but readers and anyone who had pointed their Web browser toward New Times '
Web site .
But it took something else to push Lacey and Larkin to write " Breathtaking Abuse of the Constitution . "
It took Wilenchik 's attempt to establish ex parte communications with Judge Anna Baca , who presides over county grand juries .
Wilenchik telephoned political fixer Carol Turoff , a recent two - term member of the Commission on Appellate Court Appointments , and asked her to set up a meeting with the judge , a close friend .
Turoff 's spouse , Larry Turoff , is a senior member of County Attorney Thomas ' management team .
Carol Turoff 's late - night call to Baca did not sit well with the judge .
She called the stab at a behind - the scenes conversation " absolutely inappropriate . "
But the mold - litigation specialist was unbowed by even a presiding judge 's admonition .
After all , he had just emerged from a battle with another powerful Superior Court judge .
He had publicly attacked Judge Timothy Ryan , an associate presiding criminal judge , as part of Andy Thomas ' assault on the local judiciary .
Thomas was annoyed over certain judges ' failure to deny bail to illegal aliens in Proposition 100 cases .
He was particularly miffed at Judge Ryan , whom Wilenchik termed a " danger to public safety . "
Incredibly , Wilenchik asked Ryan to recuse himself from all cases brought by Thomas ' office .
Also , he sought the recusal of all 93 Superior Court judges on the question of whether Ryan should step aside .
The move failed , but Wilenchik was emboldened .
So much so that he asked for the secret meeting with Baca while the New Times case was pending .
Lacey and Larkin felt that the pugnacious lawyer 's flagrant disregard of the rules left them no choice but to engage in their act of civil disobedience .
" Publishing the terms of a grand jury subpoena is a minor misdemeanor , " observes Manning in the notice , referring to Lacey and Larkin 's article on the subpoenas .
" The statute was designed primarily to [ protect ] witnesses , targets of investigation and others from negative publicity . '
It was not designed to insulate from public disclosure by a newspaper [ the ] unethical and unlawful behavior of a prosecutor who is misusing the grand jury to attack the newspaper , its reporters , and its readers ' right to privacy . "
The retort of Wilenchik and the MCSO was swift .
The same day that Lacey and Larkin dropped their bombshell , Wilenchik filed an Application for Order to Show Cause , demanding that the two New Times executives and their lawyers be placed in custody , and that New Times be slapped with the staggering fines mentioned above .
The MCSO and Wilenchik 's office collaborated on the evening arrests of the paper 's founders for writing " Breathtaking Abuse of the Constitution . "
Larkin got the worst of it .
With his children in the house , he was hauled away in handcuffs in an unmarked car bearing Sonoran plates .
The Selective Enforcement Unit even threatened to arrest Larkin 's wife when she demanded that they show proper identification .
Lacey was collared in front of his girlfriend and taken to the Fourth Avenue Jail .
He was released at 4 the next morning .
Before a gaggle of television , radio , and print reporters , Lacey said after his release , " We 're being arrested for raising hell .
It 's sort of a tradition journalism has . "
A tsunami of public outrage followed .
Outlets as varied as slate.com , the New York Times , Reason magazine , the Washington Post , and gawker .com reported on the arrests .
The Arizona Republic 's Laurie Roberts weighed in on the side of the arrestees , as did the Goldwater Institute 's Clint Bolick , who wrote , " Regardless of one 's ordinary proclivities regarding the players involved , there is only one place for friends of freedom to stand at the moment : shoulder - to - shoulder with the New Times . "
In County Attorney Thomas ' capitulation 10 hours after Lacey 's release , he claimed to have had no prior knowledge of the arrests .
After firing Wilenchik as special prosecutor for criminal matters , he quashed the subpoenas and ended the investigation of New Times .
So who did order the arrests ?
When asked that question , Wilenchik wrote in an e-mail to New Times , " Do n't know .
If I find out , will be back . "
But MCSO public information officer Paul Chagolla told the Associated Press that " the arrests came at the requests of the prosecutor . "
Confronted with Wilenchik 's slippery e-mail , Chagolla got more specific , informing New Times that MCSO detectives worked with attorneys William French and Rob Somers of Wilenchik 's firm .
French , a former prosecutor and judge , later resigned after the fallout from the arrests ( " Dennis the Menace , " December 27 , 2007 ) .
In subsequent interviews , French pinned the responsibility for the arrests on Wilenchik .
" Somers told me that Wilenchik said , ' No more Mr. Nice Guy .
We 're going to arrest them . '
That 's what happened , " French intoned to the Arizona Republic .
In New Times ' notice , Manning puts the arrests into their legal context :
" Misdemeanor violations that do not threaten lives are usually handled by the issuance of citations , not by [ Selective Enforcement Unit ] raids , arrests , handcuffs , and jail cells in the dead of night .
Responsible prosecutors know these circumstances would never justify such conduct . "
Sheriff Arpaio's office has never expressed any misgivings about its dealings with New Times , much less over the arrests of Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin .
The outright obstinacy of the MCSO in providing public information has forced New Times to do battle with Arpaio and his officers for the past 15 years .
Time - consuming legal remedies , such as New Times ' current notice , seem the only possible remedy when dealing with a Sheriff 's Office bent on keeping information that might reflect badly on Arpaio secret from the public .
This newspaper 's recent appellate court win regarding numerous public - records requests submitted by writer John Dougherty to the MCSO in 2004 illustrates the MCSO 's hostility in dealing with not just New Times but any news media outlet that criticizes Arpaio or the actions of his office .
This publication was forced to sue in 2004 because the Sheriff 's Office refused to comply with Arizona 's public - records law and release the information that Dougherty had requested .
The MCSO forked over the documents only after the suit was filed .
New Times then sought legal fees from Arpaio 's office .
Though a Superior Court judge denied the request in 2005 , New Times appealed .
On February 5 , the three - judge Arizona Court of Appeals assessed nine of Dougherty 's requests individually , finding in all but one that New Times was wrongfully denied access to public records .
In eight instances , the appeals court found the excuses of MCSO public information officers Lisa Allen MacPherson and Paul Chagolla to be unconvincing .
Take for instance a request by Dougherty for the personnel file for MCSO Sergeant Leo Driving Hawk .
The MCSO acknowledged that it had the documents when Dougherty made the request , but MacPherson said she did n't read the request very carefully , and offered that as an excuse for not providing the documents promptly , as well as the fact that she was angry with Dougherty .
The appeals court 's response to MacPherson 's evasions was stinging .
" If mere inattention by the employee of a public body could meet that body 's burden of establishing that it promptly provided documents , and thus that a request was not wrongfully delayed or denied , it would turn on its head the core purpose of the public - records law , " wrote the court , adding , " If public entities could be excused from providing public records merely by being inattentive to requests , then access to the records would be easily frustrated . "
Ultimately , the appeals court vacated the lower court 's judgment and remanded the case back to it for a decision on whether New Times is entitled to recover the attorneys ' fees .
This ruling is significant because the MCSO obstructed New Times every step of the way .
It refused to comply with the state public - records law , treated reporter Dougherty and other New Times journalists with contempt , and forced New Times to go to court to get the records to which it is entitled .
In addition , the MCSO continues to bar New Times from attending press conferences and continues to prohibit its reporters from going to the Sheriff 's Office to pick up public records .
Dougherty made several public - records requests to the MCSO in 2004 .
They included requests for documents on the smear Arpaio 's officers perpetrated against Dan Saban , Arpaio 's rival for the 2004 Republican nomination ; for records on a proposed fish pond to be constructed near Tent City ; for MCSO financial records from the jail canteen and vending machines ; for personnel files on certain MCSO employees and for records on deceased inmates .
But in defiance of the public - records law — which plainly states that the custodians of public records must " promptly furnish such copies , printouts or photographs " to all citizens who ask for them — the sheriff 's media machine stonewalled Dougherty .
That resulted in the reporter 's confronting Arpaio during a public post- election event , asking when the sheriff would turn over the lawfully requested information .
Arpaio had Dougherty dragged away by Selective Enforcement Unit deputies , suggesting to one of his men that the writer 's mere question could be considered a threat .
Days before this incident , Dougherty ran into MCSO spokeswoman MacPherson outside a downtown rally for Arpaio opponent Saban .
He queried her as to when New Times might get the records .
" Never , " MacPherson told Dougherty .
When Dougherty asked why , she informed him that the MCSO did not regard New Times as a legitimate newspaper .
Dougherty replied that under the state public - records law , any citizen can request such records from the MCSO .
" So sue us ! " MacPherson challenged .
New Times had no choice but to go to court .
Three years later , the appeals court 's February 5 ruling revealed the MCSO 's pattern of obstructing news organizations critical of Arpaio from obtaining public information .
It was mentioned in the appellate court 's decision that MacPherson admitted it took her 108 days to produce 11 pages of documents , and that when Dougherty requested information on an inmate death in the jails , she misinformed him there had been no death on the date and that she never bothered to clear up the confusion when she learned otherwise .
In a recent item on New Times ' appellate court win in the Arizona Republic , Jack MacIntyre , another of Arpaio 's flacks , was quoted as saying that MacPherson had acted the way she did because of a personality conflict with Dougherty .
He said certain " steps " were taken to avoid such future conflicts .
In light of this statement , New Times put in a public - records request with MCSO flack Chagolla , asking for documentation of the " steps " mentioned by MacIntyre .
Chagolla advised that no such public records existed .
He then warned ominously that the MCSO might be contemplating charging John Dougherty with a crime .
" I will forward a document detailing two assaults committed upon me by former New Times reporter John Dougherty , " stated Chagolla in an e-mail .
( Dougherty left the paper in August 2006 . )
" I am aware that the New Times knows of these assaults , as they were brought up in deposition .
I will also seek out the Channel 3 televised coverage of Dougherty poking me with his recorder during the second incident .
Please note the statute of limitations has not expired on the assault . "
Chagolla is referring to the night that Arpaio had Dougherty thrown out of his political event because the reporter asked him a question .
Chagolla is alleging that a reporter holding up a tape recorder to a public servant constitutes an " assault . "
In the past , Chagolla has said there would be " legal consequences " if New Times reporters dared to pick up public documents at MCSO offices in the Wells Fargo building downtown .
When reporter Ray Stern disagreed with MCSO lawyer Michelle Iafrate in her law offices over whether he could photograph public records , Iafrate complained to the MCSO .
This sparked a " disorderly conduct " citation getting delivered to Stern by the Selective Enforcement Unit in the same nighttime spree that netted Lacey and Larkin .
Other reporters also have been bullied by MCSO deputies , as have Arpaio 's political rivals and citizens daring to oppose him or his officers .
The history of this ongoing abuse of power is detailed in Sarah Fenske 's " Enemies List " ( November 29 , 2007 ) segment of New Times ' " Target Practice " series .
In that article , Fenske described how anyone who crosses the sheriff , or even happens to work for someone who opposes Arpaio , could find themselves the subject of an unwarranted investigation , have their assets and computers seized , and even be arrested on trumped - up charges that never go to trial .
Anyone from a politician aiming to replace Arpaio as sheriff ( like Dan Saban ) to a graphic designer working for local Democrats to a tow - truck operator loyal to the GOP could find themselves in the MCSO 's crosshairs .
Raids can be timed to slander an enemy and his business , as happened with erstwhile Arpaio - supporter Lee Watkins .
Watkins backed local radio personality W. Steven Martin over Arpaio in the 2004 general election .
Then , his business , Cactus Towing , was raided in 2005 , with computers , cell phones , and records seized as evidence .
The raid came at the end of the month , when Watkins ' business normally billed expenses .
Watkins was ruined .
No charges were ever filed .
In 2000 , Jim Cozzolino managed the campaign of an Arpaio opponent .
Arpaio 's deputies sorted through his trash and tapped his phone , but nothing came of it .
Still Arpaio held his grudge , and in 2003 , when Cozzolino stepped in to protect a woman who was being assaulted at the bowling alley Cozzolino operated , deputies popped him for attempted murder and seized his car .
Cozzolino plea - bargained , pleaded guilty to illegal discharge of a firearm , and got four months in jail .
Deputies set up Cozzolino on a drug charge while he was incarcerated .
He beat that rap and ended up suing Arpaio , who later settled for an undisclosed amount .
Or take the case of Nick Tarr , falsely arrested in 2002 while portraying " Joe Arizona " in a lighthearted spoof of the sheriff sponsored by backers of a ballot initiative opposed by Arpaio .
Tarr had the bad luck to walk into a restaurant where Chief Deputy David Hendershott was eating .
Hendershott wanted to charge him with impersonating a DPS officer .
The DPS wanted no part of it , but Hendershott had his men hold Tarr and cite him .
The MCSO dropped the complaint against Tarr , whose lawsuit against the Sheriff 's Office is scheduled to go to trial this year .
The list goes on .
" These and many other incidents show that the Defendants ' actions against the New Times in this case were more than the aberrational consequence of simple neglect , " Manning observes in the notice .
" They were the product of a long - standing pattern and practice of the abuse of power against dissenting voices — of intentional , punitive and retaliatory conduct against the New Times , its reporters , and its readers . "
This is the same sheriff 's administration that has cost the county $ 43.4 million in lawsuit payouts and insurance premiums because of wrongful deaths and injuries in Arpaio 's jails .
Yet the sheriff and his underlings appear indifferent to atrocities in MCSO jails , to the financial burden they impose on county taxpayers , and to the international embarrassment they cause Maricopa County .
Amnesty International , which usually chastises Third World dictatorships , cited deplorable conditions in Arpaio 's lockups after a 1997 investigation .
As New Times writer John Dickerson reported in " Inhumanity Has a Price " ( December 20 , 2007 ) , " With a fraction of the inmate population , Arpaio has had 50 times as many lawsuits as the New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , and Houston jail systems combined . "
Since Dickerson wrote the article — which warns of MRSA staph infections in Arpaio 's jails and describes the horror of a pregnant mother bleeding incessantly and losing her child while one of Arpaio 's prisoners — the payout figure ( which was $ 41.4 million ) has climbed another $ 2 million .
In the face of such persistent , institutionalized cruelty and spitefulness toward anyone who disagrees with the MCSO , Michael Lacey believes New Times ' notice is also about preservation of the Fourth Estate .
He argues that not just New Times , but all Maricopa County media , are threatened by Arpaio 's administration — particularly because the County Attorney 's Office provides no check on the sheriff 's power .
" These people just do n't understand boundaries , " Lacey said of Arpaio and his officers .
" They do n't understand the Constitution .
It 's a fine comment on where we 've come in the community when this sort of action on our part is necessary .
But we actually believe it is necessary . "
Lacey added : " I hope it keeps [ the MCSO ] off our throats .
And I hope it keeps it off the backs of the media , in general . "
Michael Manning offers an eloquent appraisal of New Times ' case against Wilenchik , Arpaio , and Thomas in the claim notice :
" The facts known , thus far , demonstrate a disturbing picture of muscle - bound police and prosecutorial abuse .
The corrupt perversion of the law to attack a newspaper , its reporters , and the privacy rights of thousands of its readers .
When fair criticism of these public officials became too piercing for them to tolerate , they flexed their political muscle in the form of a conspiracy .
" They abused their governmental authority by attacking the press , punishing free speech , demeaning the role and function of an impartial prosecutor and an independent judiciary , perverting the grand jury function , and serving notice to citizens who read news online that neither their identities nor their reading habits are safe from the reach of a vindictive government .

Kratom Talk
The latest news and information about kratom .
It can be confusing but we try and make it simple .
To get the Argo Tunnel working in Kubernetes , we need to first install helm on the computer we run kubectl from .
I use a debian based system for this , so these commands are the appropriate ones for a recent debian that has snap .
Part [ 1 2 3 ] of a series of more .
I do n’t know how much more yet as this is primarily written to document my setup so I can refer to it later when I wonder why / how I did something .
After restoring this from the backup I made of my old unifi video controller , I logged in , selected the camera , and under Manage I changed its reporting IP to the new container IP .
I ’m using the / mnt / data directory that is the second SATA SSD drive for these containers to store their data on .
On the old Unifi controller , I went to Settings ->
Site and clicked the Export Site button .
You can download a backup file here , but the more important step is to migrate the devices to the new controller by providing the new IP for them to inform .
Once this step is done , the devices should show up in the new controller shortly .
This can take a few minutes to come - up , it has to play with ARP responses and such .
Once the new Unifi controller was up , I restored the backup and logged in .
None of the devices will show up .... yet !
First , login to existing controller , and download a full backup .
Then setup the new controller , my unifi-controller .
yaml looks like this :
I ’m changing the IP of where the existing Unifi controller runs , which comes with an interesting drawback .
All the existing Unifi devices need to start reporting to the new controller .
To allocate LAN IP addresses for containers in Kubernetes I use MetalLB .
I installed it using kubectl ( Rancher makes it easy to download the kube config file ) .
When running containers that I want available on my LAN , it ’s handy to expose them under their own LAN IP .
To do this I set my DHCP server to stop allocating addresses past .189 , and will reserve the remaining IP addresses for container use .
Part [ 1 2 3 ] of a series of more .
I do n’t know how much more yet as this is primarily written to document my setup so I can refer to it later when I wonder why / how I did something .
That ’s it for a first day of configuring things .
Next up I ’ll need to setup MetalLB so that my Kubernetes containers I start with Rancher get LAN IP ’s rather than shuttling everything through the default nginx ingress .
Mapping port 80/443 to different local ports is to avoid intereference from the ingress proxy which will be running on this same node .
With RancherOS running happilly , its time to install Rancher on the VM .
This is relatively easy , from the RancherOS VM shell , just run :
I followed these directions to install RancherOS under ProxMox VE .
Reproduced here with a fix to the cloud - config.yml as the example did n’t validate .
Finish setup in the AWS Console for the Storage Gateway , your computer will need to be able to talk directly to the VM running the appliance VM .
You will be asked to set a cache drive , select the additiona 150 Gb drive .
Look at the console in proxmox to determine the IP , and change it as desired for a static IP .
Determine the location of the LVM disk used by the new VM ( something like / dev / pve / vm - 100 - disk - 0 ) .
Provision a Proxmox VM with the given size disk , using an IDE disk emulation target .
I gave my VM 16GB of memory , as I was n’t sure how much it would want .
The first thing I wanted to try was utilizing hybrid storage in AWS with their Storage Appliance .
Unfortunately AWS only provides a VMWare image .
I found a few articles online that indicated this was rather easy to convert to a raw disk image for use in Proxmox , and got it working rather quickly .
I have set all the VM hard drives under the default lvm-thin pool which is on the NVMe SSD for performance .
The SATA SSD is to be used for persistent data volumes for containers .
I grabbed the ISO for installing ProxMox 6.0 , based on a buster debian distro .
Using the ISO directly from my computer was rather easy from the Supermicro IPMI Java interface .
While the ikvm HTML5 interface is more convenient , the Java - based console makes it a breeze to attach local .iso files as a CD / DVD drive to the server .
I ’ve been reading a lot of Serve the Home , and their glowing review of Proxmox VE convinced me to give it a try .
I ’ve been enjoying it so far and it ’s easy to get started with and makes running KVM a breeze .
If I really go nuts with VM ’s and containers I still have 2 DIMM slots free for another 128 GB of memory .
I ’ve found that for personal use containers usually run into RAM pressure much earlier than CPU pressure .
In the event an SSD fails , I ’m only a 10 min drive from a Best Buy where I got both the SSD’s .
I consider this a more likely failure scenario than the PSU , CPU , memory , or motherboard failing in my experience ( I already ran a memtest suite against the memory before installing proxmox , which comes with memtest on their live ISO ) .
This is a bit more than the last buuild , but is 100 % SSD storage without any redundancy .
I ’m relying on cloud backups and accepting that I will have some downtime if a part fails .
I consider this an acceptable trade - off to keep costs lower with the hope that once a SSD has proven itself for a few months it should last much longer than a spinning platter drive as I do n’t anticipate heavy read / write loads that would wear out the drives .
It took awhile before Epyc embedded processors and vendors 1U systems started to hit the market , but the 8 - core / 16 - thread Epyc 3251 in a nice half - length 1U is now widely available .
Serve The Home did a great review of this system which helped convince me to purchase one .
Given my Internet connectivity and increased focus in my spare time on containerized applications using Kubernetes , I figured it might be a good time to ‘ downsize ’ in power consumption while increasing my virtualization capabilities .
The new server configuration I ended up with is a fraction of the size ( half - length 1U vs full - length 2U ) and power ( 190w idle vs 40w idle ) , while having 4 x the cores and over 8 x the memory capacity .
7 years has definitely helped on what you get for the same price !
A few years ago I built a home NAS and virtualization server .
While I moved past SmartOS after a year or two to FreeNAS , the hard drives are aging and I realized it is n’t very efficient compared to what ’s available now .
From my prior post , the hard drives were replaced with 6 4TB drives in a ZRAID - 2 .
This ended up giving me vastly more space than I had any need for and as I now have a 1 G bps fiber line I do n’t feel the need to store 16 TB locally .
Part [ 1 2 3 ] of a series of more .
I do n’t know how much more yet as this is primarily written to document my setup so I can refer to it later when I wonder why / how I did something .
After building my new server capable of running SmartOS , it was time to give it a spin !
If you ’ve only built desktop machines , its hard to express how awesome IPMI KVM is .
No longer do you need to grab another keyboard / video monitor / mouse ( the KVM ) , you just plug in the IPMI Ethernet port on the motherboard to your switch and hit the web - server its running .
It then lets you remotely access the machine as if you had it hooked up directly .
You can get into the BIOS , boot from ISO ’s on your local machine , hard reset , power down , power up , etc .
It ’s very slick and means I can stick the computer in the rack without needing to go near it to do everything that used to require a portable set of additional physical hardware .
Note
This post assumes some basic knowledge of OS virtualization .
In this case QEMU , KVM ( which was ported by Joyent to run on SmartOS ) , and Zones .
I generally refer to them as VM’s and will differentiate when I add a Zone vs. a KVM instance .
First Go at SmartOS
Installation is ridiculously easy , there is none .
You download SmartOS , put it on a USB stick or CD - ROM , and boot the computer from it .
I was feeling especially lazy and used the motherboards IPMI KVM interface to remotely mount the ISO image directly from my Mac .
Once SmartOS booted , it asked me to setup the main ZFS pool , and it was done .
SmartOS runs a lot like a VMWare ESXI hyper-visor , with the assumption that the machine will only be booting VM’s .
So the entire ZFS pool is just for your VM ’s , which I appreciate greatly .
After playing with it a little bit , it almost felt .... too easy .
I had really allocated at least a week or two of my spare time to fiddle around with the OS before I wanted it to just work , and having it running so quickly was almost disappointing .
The only bit that was slightly annoying was that retaining settings in the GZ ( Global Zone ) is kind of a pain .
You have to drop in a service file ( which is XML , joy ! ) on a path which SmartOS will then load and run on startup .
This was mildly annoying , and some folks on the IRC channel suggested I give OpenIndiana a spin , which is aimed more at a home server / desktop scenario .
There was also a suggestion that I give Sophos UTM a spin instead of pfsense for the firewall / router VM .
OpenIndiana Since OpenIndiana has SmartOS‘s QEMU / KVM functionality ( needed to run other OS ’s like Linux / BSD / Windows under an illumos based distro ) , it seemed worth giving a go .
It actually installs itself on the system unlike SmartOS , so I figured it ’d take a little more space .
No big deal .
Until I installed it .
Then I saw that the ZFS boot pool ca n’t have disks in it larger than 2TB ( well , it can , but it only lets you use 2 TB of the space ) .
Doh .
After chatting with some IRC folks again , its common to use two small disks in a mirror as a ZFS boot pool and then have the much larger storage pool .
Luckily I had a 250 GB drive around so I could give this a spin , though I was bummed to have to use one of my drive bays just for a boot disk .
Installation went smoothly , but upon trying to fire up a KVM instance I was struck by how clunky it is in comparison to SmartOS .
Again , this difference comes down to SmartOS optimizing the heck out of its major use - case .... virtualizing in the data - center .
In SmartOS there ’s a handy imgadm tool to manage available images , and vmadm to manage VM’s .
These do n’t seem to exist for OpenIndiana ( maybe as an add - on package ? ) , so you have to use the less friendly QEMU / KVM tools directly .
Then the KVM failed to start .
Apparently the QEMU / KVM support in OpenIndiana ( at least for my Sandy Bridge based motherboard ) has been broken in the latest 3 OpenIndiana releases for the past 5 months .
There ’s a work - around to install a specific set of packages , but to claim QEMU / KVM support with such a glaring bug in a fairly prominent motherboard chip - set is n’t a good first start .
My first try to install the specific packages failed as my server kernel - panicked halfway through the QEMU / KVM package installation .
Upon restarting , the package index was apparently corrupted .
The only way to fix it is to re-install OpenIndiana ... or rollback the boot environment ( a feature utilizing ZFS thus including snapshots ) .
Boot environments and the beadm tool to manage them are a bit beyond the scope of this entry , but the short version is that it let me roll - back the boot file - system including the package index to a non-mangled state ( Very cool ! ) .
With QEMU / KVM finally installed and working , I installed and configured Sophos UTM in a KVM and was off and running .
Except it seemed to run abysmally slow ... oh well , I was about to go on vacation anyways .
I set the KVM to load at boot - time and restarted .
Upon loading the KVM at boot , the machine halted .
This issue is apparently related to the broken QEMU / KVM packages .
It was about time for my vacation , and I had now played with an OS with some rather rough edges in my spare time for a week .
So I powered it off , took out the boot drive , and went on my vacation .
Back to SmartOS
When I got back from my vacation , I was no longer in the mood to deal with failures in the OS distribution .
I rather like the OpenIndiana community , but now I just wanted my server to work .
SmartOS fit the bill , and did n’t require boot drives which was greatly appreciated .
It also has a working QEMU / KVM , since its rather important to Joyent . :)
In just a day , I went from a blank slate to a smoothly running SmartOS machine .
As before , installation was dead simple , and my main ZFS pool zones ( named as such by SmartOS ) was ready for VM’s .
Before I added a VM I figured I should have an easy way to access the ZFS file - system .
I turned on NFS for the file - systems I wanted to access and gave my computer ’s IP write privilege and the rest of the LAN read - only .
This is insanely easy in ZFS : zfs set sharenfs = rw = MYIP , ro = 192.168.2.0 zones/media/Audio
To say the least , I love ZFS .
Every other file - system / volume manager feels like a relic of the past in comparison .
Mounting NFS file - systems on OSX used to suck , but now its a breeze .
They work fast and reliably ( thus far at least ) .
Setting Up the Router KVM First , I needed my router / firewall KVM .
I have a DSL connection , so I figured I ’d wire that into one NIC , and have the other NIC on the motherboard go to the LAN .
SmartOS virtualizes these so that each VM gets its own Virtual NIC ( VNIC ) , this is part of the Solaris feature - set called Crossbow .
Setting up the new KVM instance for Sophos UTM was simple , I gave it a VNIC on the physical interface connected to the DSL modem and another on the physical interface connected to my switch .
Besides for the fact that the VM was working without any issues like I had in OpenIndiana , I noticed it was much faster as well .
Unfortunately for some reason it was n’t actually routing my traffic .
It took me about an hour ( and clearing the head while walking the dog ) to see that I was missing several important VNIC config options , such as dhcp_server , allow_ip_spoofing , allow_dhcp_spoofing , and allow_restricted_traffic .
These settings are needed for a VM that intends to act as a router so that it can move the packets and NAT them as appropriate across the VNICs .
Once I set those everything ran smoothly .
So far , this only took me about 3 hours and was rather simple so I decided to keep going and get a nice network backup for the two OSX machines in the house .
Setting Up Network Backups
After some research I found out the latest version of netatalk would work quite nicely for network Time Machine backups .
I created a zones / tmbackups ZFS file - system , and two nested file - systems under that for my wifes ’
Macbook and my own Mac Mini .
Then I told ZFS that zones / tmbackups should have compression enabled ( Time Machine does n’t actually compress its backups , transparent ZFS file compression FTW ! ) and I set quota ’s on each nested file - system to prevent Time Machine from expanding forever .
Next I created a Zone with a SmartOS Standard dataset .
Technically , the KVM instances run in a Zone for additional resource constraints and security , while I wanted to use just a plain Zone for the network backups .
This was mainly because I wanted to make the zones / tmbackups file - system directly available to it without having to NFS mount it into a KVM .
If you ’ve ever compiled anything from source in Solaris , you ’re probably thinking about how many days I spent to get netatalk running in a Zone right now .
Thankfully Joyent has done an awesome job bringing a lot of the common GNU compiler toolchain to SmartOS .
It only took me about an hour to get netatalk running and recognized by both macs as a valid network Time Machine backup volume .
Unfortunately I can’t remember how exactly I set it up , but here are the pages that gave me the guidance I needed : http://www.trollop.org/2011/07/23/os-x-10-7-lion-time-machine-netatalk-2-2/
http://wiki.openindiana.org/oi/Netatalk
http://marcoschuh.de/wp/?p=839
I ’ve heard that netatalk 3.x is faster , and will likely upgrade that one of these days .
Setting Up the Media Server KVM
One of the physical machines I wanted to get rid of was the home theater PC I had built a few years back .
It was rarely used , not very energy efficient , and XBMC was nowhere near spouse - friendly enough for my wife .
We have an AppleTV and Roku , and I figured I ’d give Plex a try on the Roku since the UI was so simple .
I setup a KVM instance and installed Ubuntu 12.04 server on it .
Then I added the Plex repo’s and installed their Media Server packages .
Fired it up and pointed Plex at my Video folders and it was ready to go .
The Roku interface is slick and makes it a breeze to navigate .
Being based on XBMC means that it can play all the same media and trans - codes it as necessary for the other network devices that want to play it .
At first Plex ran into CPU problems in the KVM ... which I quickly realized was because I had n’t changed the default resource constraints .
The poor thing only had a single virtual CPU ... after giving it a few more it easily had enough CPU allocated to do the video trans -coding .
While KVM runs CPU - bound tasks at bare - metal speed , disk I/O is virtualized .
To reduce this problem I have Plex writing its trans - coded files to the ZFS file - system directly via an NFS mount .
The media folders are also NFS mounted into the Media Server KVM .
I threw some other useful apps onto this KVM that I was running on the home theater PC and left it alone .
‘ You ’re nothing but a self - hating Jew , and your boss is an anti-Semite . ”
It was the spring of 1990 .
I was an advisor to then - Secretary of State James Baker , and I was briefing a Jewish group from Atlanta -- and I could n’t believe what I was hearing .
Baker was tough on Israel when he needed to be , but he was no anti-Semite .
I told Mr. Atlanta that if he wanted to argue about policy , fine ; otherwise , we should keep the ad hominem out of it .
Almost 20 years later , here we go again .
This time , a Democratic candidate for president , not even the official nominee of his party , is under attack from some deeply confused and ill - informed American Jews .
Again , the charges of hostility toward Israel are being irresponsibly bandied about .
Some of this , to be sure , is the seasonal silliness associated with political campaigns .
But the persistent attacks on Sen. Barack Obama -- and especially on former Clinton administration official Robert Malley , one of his many informal advisors -- should n’t be casually dismissed as crackpot commentary .
They reflect two troubling reactions , or , more precisely , overreactions , within the American Jewish community that undermine its credibility and harm American interests in the process .
First , some full disclosure .
I ’m not associated with any political campaign and am not running for anything .
For nearly 20 years , I worked at the Department of State , under Republican and Democratic secretaries of State , on the Arab - Israeli peace negotiations .
Advertisement
What ’s more , I am a close friend of Malley , who served as special assistant to President Clinton for Arab - Israeli affairs between 1998 and 2001 .
Malley and I continue to collaborate on Op - Ed articles and conferences .
In recent weeks , I ’ve been extremely disturbed to see him attacked as an enemy of Israel and as an apologist for the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat .
Perhaps most offensive , several publications have run personal attacks on Malley because his father , in the 1960s , founded and edited a left - wing magazine called Afrique - Asie , which was friendly toward the Palestine Liberation Organization and other Third World movements .
But so what ?
These charges are ridiculous .
There ’s no question that Malley has been critical of certain Israeli actions and behavior ( as have I ) .
He was criticized , for instance , for an article he wrote in the New York Review of Books that took issue with the notion that Arafat was solely responsible for the failure of the Oslo peace process .
But he is not “ anti- Israel , ” let alone the Israel hater his critics portray him to be .
He is well - respected by Arabs and Israelis alike , and he believes deeply in the idea and the reality of Israel ’s right to exist as a sovereign and secure Jewish state .
He would never do anything to jeopardize that .
In a joint letter last month , five of his longtime colleagues ( former Clinton national security advisor Samuel R. Berger ; former U.S. ambassadors to Israel Martin Indyk and Daniel Kurtzer ; former U.S. peace negotiator Dennis Ross ; and myself ) made Malley ’s commitment to Israel unmistakably clear .
As for the mean - spirited guilt - by - association charges having to do with his family , Malley told the Forward , a Jewish newspaper , that while he loved and respected his father -- who died in 2006 -- he did not agree with him on everything .
Advertisement
The attacks on Malley ( which are , of course , really attacks on Obama ) do n’t merely reflect concerns about the views of a single mid-level advisor ; they flow from a deeper dysfunction .
The first piece of that dysfunction is what you might call the “ cosmic oy vey ” -- the tendency of many American Jews active in pro-Israeli causes to worry about everything , without a capacity to identify what is important and what is n’t .
Do n’t get me wrong .
Jews -- and yes , I am one of them -- worry for a living .
Their history compels them to and to be always vigilant .
Yet in America , where they have achieved a level of security , acceptance and power unparalleled in their history , their existential worries paradoxically seem to have grown even greater .
When Jimmy Carter writes a book -- a bad book , incidentally -- comparing Zionism to apartheid , many American Jews go crazy .
When two university professors , Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer , write another bad book -- about what they call “ the Israel lobby ” -- many Jews react as if the sky is falling .
The fact is ( and many American Jews are reluctant to accept it ) , the conflict in the United States between Israel ’s supporters and its detractors is over .
And the pro-Israel community has won .
No figure in American mainstream politics can be viable without being firmly supportive of Israel .
Americans overwhelmingly back Israel ’s right to exist safely and securely as a Jewish state .
For reasons of shared values , as well as strong domestic political support , Israel has become an organic part of American culture , religion , politics and foreign policy for Jews and non-Jews alike .
Our most recent presidents , Clinton and George W. Bush , have been the most pro-Israel presidents -- ever .
For too many American Jews , these successes have n’t created a greater sense of security ; they have only persuaded them to keep up the fight to ensure their good fortune continues .
Too often this means stigmatizing people who criticize , or even question , particular Israeli policies as detrimental to U.S. interests or to the peace process or to Israel ’s security itself .
There is a strong tendency even in parts of the mainstream American Jewish community to interpret any such questioning -- of the type that occurs every day in Israel itself -- as outright hostility .

I ’ve lost count of the number of times Jewish activists or friends have said to me that this official or that journalist or this academic must be anti-Semitic .
On other occasions , I have been told that I myself should not to be so publicly critical of Israel , lest we give our enemies grist for their propaganda mills .
This “ us versus them ” mentality still runs deep , and it is particularly harmful when it comes to the Arab - Israeli issue .
That conflict is not some kind of morality play in which the forces of evil do battle against the forces of light .
It is a conflict in which both sides have legitimate needs and requirements and do both good and bad things in pursuit of them .
To be called an Israel hater for speaking out against Israeli actions when they are wrong and counterproductive -- actions such as building settlements and bypass roads or confiscating land -- or to be called an anti-Semite for suggesting alternative ways of thinking when the status quo is leading nowhere is not only absurd , it ’s dangerous .
In the end , American Jews who impose a litmus test of boundless commitment to every single Israeli action hurt not only their community but the United States as well .
Israel is a tiny country living in a dangerous neighborhood .
The U.S. and Israel need a special relationship based on confidence and trust to further their mutual interests -- but that does not mean we need an exclusive relationship in which America acquiesces to everything that Israel or its supporters in the United States think is wise .
This is a critical distinction .
One can only hope that , next time around , we are fortunate enough to get a president and Middle East advisors who understand it .
Even though the majority of New Jersey ’s registered voters are not affiliated with any political party , state election guidelines allow them to participate in the presidential primaries on Tuesday .
Elections officials say New Jersey has 4.8 million registered voters , including 1,170,644 Democrats and 874,752 Republicans .
Another 1,634 voters are members of the Green , Libertarian , Natural Law , Reform or U.S. Constitution parties ; they are not eligible to vote Tuesday .
The majority of New Jersey ’s electorate  nearly 2.8 million people  are classified as unaffiliated , but state election rules allow unaffiliated voters to visit their local polling place and ask for the ballot of their preferred party .
Those registered as unaffiliated will be permitted to cast ballots .
But once an unaffiliated voter casts a ballot for a candidate in one of the major political parties , the affiliation on voter rolls automatically changes to the party for which the vote was cast .
Bear Stearns marks the moment when the global financial crisis went critical .
Up until last Friday , it had been possible - just about - to believe that the worst was over and that things were about to get better .
That pretence was stripped away when JP Morgan , at the behest of the Federal Reserve , stepped in when the hedge funds pulled the plug on the fifth - biggest US investment bank .
It is now clear that no end is in sight to the turmoil , and the reason for that is that the Fed and the US treasury are no closer to solving the underlying problem than they were eight months ago .
The crisis will only end when house prices stop falling and banks stop racking up huge losses on their loans .
Doing that , however , will require the US government to intervene directly in the real estate market to end the wave of foreclosures .
Ideologically , it is ill - equipped to take that step and , as a result , property prices will fall and the financial meltdown will go on and on .
Ultimately , though , action will be taken because there will be political pressure for it .
Indeed , it is somewhat surprising that there is not already rioting in the streets , given the gigantic fraud perpetrated by the financial elite at the expense of ordinary Americans .
The US has just had its weakest period of expansion since the 1950s .
Consumption growth has been poor .
Investment growth has been modest .
Exports have been sluggish .
But if you are at the top of the tree , the years since the last recession in 2001 has been a veritable golden age .
Salaries for executives have rocketed and profits have soared , because the productivity gains from a growing economy have been disproportionately skewed towards capital .
Patriotic
For ordinary Americans , though , it has been a different story .
Real wages have been growing slowly ; at just 1.6 % a year on average over the latest upswing , well down on the experience of earlier decades .
Business , of course , needs consumers to carry on spending in order to make money , so a way had to be found to persuade households to do their patriotic duty .
The method chosen was simple .
Whip up a colossal housing bubble , convince consumers that it makes sense to borrow money against the rising value of their homes to supplement their meagre real wage growth and watch the profits roll in .
As they did - for a while .
Now it 's payback time and the mood could get very ugly .
Americans , to put it bluntly , have been conned .
They have been duped by a bunch of serpent - tongued hucksters who packed up the wagon and made it across the county line before a lynch mob could be formed .
The debate now is not about whether the US is in recession but how deep and long that recession will be .
Super - bears have started to say that this is perhaps " The Big One " , by which they mean the onset of a new Great Depression .
The need to rescue Bear Stearns has done little to still those voices .
As the economics team at HSBC recently pointed out , there has been a " catastrophic breakdown " of trust , and when that has happened in the past - the US in the 1930s , Japan in the 1990s - chucking extra money at the banks in the hope that they will start lending again proves ineffective .
It 's not hard to see why trust has become such a rare commodity : Wall Street at the height of the securitisation mania had , in effect , become London at the time of the South Sea Bubble crisis in 1720 .
Vast quantities of funny paper were changing hands even though those involved in the deals had no idea of their true worth .
Nor did they care .
Inevitably , now the bubble has burst and the huge Ponzi securitisation scam has been exposed , there has been a reaction .
The securitisation market is dead , there is less money sloshing round the system , banks are hoarding their cash .
Having allowed the housing boom to rage out of control for too long and then delaying cuts in interest rates until the housing market was gripped by recessionary forces , the Fed is now trying to make up for lost time with a burst of hyperactivity .
It will cut interest rates on Wednesday and keep cutting them : financial markets expect the Fed funds rate to be 1 % by the summer , and they are probably right .
In most downturns , easier monetary policy does the trick .
Lower interest rates make it cheaper to borrow and also change the trade - off between saving and spending .
This may not be the usual sort of downturn , however , with consumers going through a period of debt revulsion after the excesses of recent years , even so the consensus is that after two or three quarters of falling output , a slow and sluggish recovery will be under way .
Deflation
These hopes are likely to be dashed , unless there is intervention at home and internationally to tackle the crisis .
Domestically , the priority should be to stop homes that have been foreclosed being auctioned on the open market , since by selling them at a 50 % discount property prices are driven down .
The US does not seem to have learned the lessons from Japan , which encouraged a fire sale of property in the 1990s and was sucked into a classic debt deflation trap as a result .
Those who argue , with some force , that it would be counter - productive to intervene in the market because the US needs to work the rottenness out of its system must recognise that the cold turkey option will be very long and painful .
The second form of intervention should be to shore up the dollar , the collapse of which is worrying countries that rely heavily on exports and is the main reason for the surge in commodity prices .
Co-ordinated intervention by the major central banks needs to be at the top of the agenda at next month 's G7 meeting in Washington , and there could be action even sooner if the dollar continues to tank .
In the longer term , lessons must be learnt from the turmoil .
One is that you do n't solve the problems of a collapsing bubble by blowing up another , which is what Alan Greenspan did after the dotcom fiasco in 2001 - the most irresponsible behaviour of any central banker in living memory .
The second lesson is that there has to be far stricter regulation not just of the US real estate market but of Wall Street , to prevent the return of irresponsible lending as soon as the recovery is firmly under way .
If this is , heaven help us , The Big One , one of the only consolations will be that the repugnance at the orgy of speculation that has sapped the strength of the US economy will put a new New Deal on the political agenda .
But for this to happen there has to be a political response and even though this year 's presidential election will be held in the shadow of recession , there appears not to be a potential FDR among the contenders for the White House .
Yet if this crisis really does get as bad as some are forecasting , the public will rightly demand more than a slap on the wrist for Wall Street .

A national poll released Friday showed that voters who had heard or read about Senator Barack Obama ’s speech this week on race relations and on his relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. broadly approved of it .
Seven in 10 said Mr. Obama , Democrat of Illinois , did a good job talking about race relations , and as many said he did a good job explaining his relationship with Mr. Wright , according to the CBS News poll .
More than 6 in 10 said they mostly agreed with what he said about race relations in the United States , including a broad majority of Democrats and independents .
Fewer Republicans  4 in 10  agreed with the message .
Still , the poll showed some erosion for Mr. Obama .
Just over half of registered voters now say he would be a president who is able to unite the country , down from two - thirds a month ago .
Anonymous trolls on the Internet are allowed to remain anonymous , a judge in a California appeals court ruled yesterday .
Not only that , but they 're allowed to exercise their First Amendment rights and speak their minds , no matter how scathing their comments may be .
The court opinion reversed a previous decision that would have allowed Lisa Krinsky , COO of a Florida - based drug service company , to subpoena 10 anonymous Yahoo message board posters ' real names .
The story starts out like this .
10 anonymous individuals posted on Yahoo's message boards in 2005 about Krinsky , her company ( SFBC ) , and two other officers at her company .
These posters regularly made what the judge described as " scathing verbal
attacks " against these officers .
This included referring to the trio as " a management consisting of boobs , losers and crooks , " and with one poster ( Doe 6 ) describing Krinsky when he said " I will reciprocate felatoin [ sic ] with Lisa even though she has fat thighs , a fake medical degree , ' queefs ' and has poor feminine hygiene . "
Krinsky left SFBC in December of 2005 and filed the lawsuit in January of 2006 , which Doe 6 attempted to quash .
In April of 2006 , a superior court judge said that Doe 6 was " trying to drive down the price of [ plaintiff 's ] company to manipulate the stock
price , sell it short and so forth , " according to court documents seen by Ars .
The court also suggested that " [ a ] ccusing a woman of unchastity [...] calling somebody a crook . . . saying that they have a fake medical degree , accusing someone of a criminal act , accusing someone — impinging [ sic ] their integrity to practice in their chosen profession historically have been libel per se . "
The court then denied Doe 6's motion to quash .
The appeals court acknowledged that the Wild West of the Internet is still bound by rules about libel , and that especially in the corporate and financial arena , people 's reputations and entire companies can suffer damages as rumors spread over the ' Net .
Still , the judge ruled that what Doe 6 had posted were not assertions of " actual fact " and therefore not actionable under Florida 's defamation law , despite being " unquestionably offensive and demeaning . "
Therefore , Doe 6's statements are still protected under the First Amendment , and he is entitled to all costs involved in his appeal .
The decision comes just weeks after two Yale law students were dealt a similar blow in their own case against anonymous forum bashers .
They had filed a lawsuit against a number of anonymous posters on AutoAdmit.com who were advocating that others physically assault , rape , and sodomize them if at all possible .
The two plaintiffs , however , were unable to get the IP addresses of these posters and have therefore been largely unsuccessful in identifying them .
While the attacks made by the AutoAdmit posters may or may not be legally protected ( they are threats , after all ) , we will likely never find out thanks to vigorous data deletion policies .

But for the most part , Dr. Dean was alone as he defended his position and scolded his opponents for promising voters all kinds of programs along with a tax cut .
'' What John just said is hogwash , '' said Dr. Dean .
'' You can not promise people tax cuts , college education , health care and whatever else you want , and say , ' Oh , it 'll all be fine , ' '' Dr. Dean said .
'' That 's what George Bush is doing .
I want fiscal responsibility in this country , but I want to help middle - class people send their kids to college .
You cannot have tax cuts and help people send their kids to college at the same time . ''
The debate was unusual even in a year where there have been , by some counts , more than 30 debates , that have left the candidates numb and familiar with each other 's positions .
It was , according to National Public Radio , the first radio - only presidential debate since Harold Stassen and Thomas E. Dewey competed for the Republican nomination in 1948 .
The candidates were seated in a room without an audience to applaud or heckle them .
At one point , Representative Dennis A. Kucinich of Ohio used a prop more suited for a television venue as a way demonstrating to Dr. Dean that he could not reduce the deficit without cutting Pentagon spending , drawing an incredulous if helpful bit of narration from the host .
'' Congressman Kucinich is holding up a pie chart , which is not truly effective on the radio , '' said Neal Conan , the host of '' Talk of the Nation ' ' and the moderator of the debate .
'' Well , it 's effective if Howard can see it , '' Mr. Kucinich said .
Mr. Gephardt argued that that the repeal of the tax cut was an appropriate trade - off to finance the national health care plan he has made a central part of his campaign .
' ' I think that we need to help everybody with health care insurance , '' he said .
Of the remaining candidates , General Wesley K. Clark has decided not to compete in Iowa after concluding he would fare poorly here , and thus skipped the debate .
On Monday he issued a tax proposal that would cut taxes on the poor and middle class , while substantially raising the burden on millionaires .
The Chief Pleas will become an elected chamber for the first time The UK Privy Council has approved proposed changes to the governing body of a Channel Island which still operates a feudal system of government .
Sark 's ruling body , the Chief Pleas , breaches the European Convention of Human Rights because landowners have got a seat automatically for 450 years .
The Chief Pleas had already approved new reforms for an elected chamber .
A lawyer for millionaires Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay , who own nearby Brecqhou island , said they will appeal .
Advocate Gordon Dawes said the approval will be disputed in the High Court in London as the reforms do not address the role of the seigneur and seneschal .
The seigneur is the head of the Chief Pleas and retains feudal rights and the seneschal is president of the Chief Pleas and head of the judiciary .
The Barclay brothers say their roles are incompatible with the reforms .
But Sark 's Seneschal , Reg Guille , said the decision to change the system of government reflected the wishes of most of the island 's people .
' Huge changes '
Sark has been governed by a mix of landowners and elected people 's deputies since the 1600s .
Owners of the island 's 40 tenements ( divisions of land ) currently have an automatic seat in the Chief Pleas , with islanders choosing 12 deputies .
They will be replaced by the new 28 - member chamber , which was approved following a referendum for islanders voting for democracy .
The Privy Council 's approval enables Sark 's judiciary and parliament to be significantly modernised .
We just like to get on with life away from the public eye
Lt Col Reginald Guille , Seneschal of Sark A spokeswoman for the Privy Council said : " The meeting has concluded and the Sark laws have been approved . "
The move comes following pressure on Sark to change its feudal system to comply with European human rights laws and other international obligations .
The presiding officer of the Chief Pleas , Lt Col Reginald Guille , the Seneschal of Sark , said the changes would help bring the island 's judiciary and government in line with the 21st Century .
He said : " These moves are intended to be a step away from a feudalist system , but at the same time still keeping some aspects of that system in place .
" It will see huge changes to our judiciary and government , making both more modern . "
' Close - knit community '
The self - sufficient , car - free island is just 3 miles ( 4.8 km ) long and 1.5 miles ( 2.4 km ) wide and has a resident population of about 600 .
The only forms of transport permitted are horse - drawn vehicles , bicycles , tractors and battery - powered buggies .
Lt Col Guille described life on the island as " idyllic " , saying : " It 's a very quiet and peaceful place .
" We are a self - sufficient , close - knit little community and we just like to get on with life away from the public eye . "
The government there can directly trace its roots back to Queen Elizabeth I , who once granted the ruling " Seigner " a fief on the tiny Channel Island .
The unelected descendents of 40 families brought in to colonise Sark , after the French abandoned it in 1553 , have governed life on the island ever since .
But its feudal system of government started coming under pressure in 2000 in the light of human rights laws .
Two proposals for reform were rejected in 2005 and 2007 until the island 's historic referendum .

Yes You Can Rescue A Rainforest
by Staff Writers
Ithaca NY ( SPX ) Mar 28 , 2008
Half a century after most of Costa Rica 's rainforests were cut down , researchers from the Boyce Thompson Institute took on a project that many thought was impossible - restoring a tropical rainforest ecosystem .
When the researchers planted worn - out cattle fields in Costa Rica with a sampling of local trees , native species began to move in and flourish , raising the hope that destroyed rainforests can one day be replaced .
Carl Leopold and his partners in the Tropical Forestry Initiative began planting trees on worn - out pasture land in Costa Rica in 1992 .
For 50 years the soil was compacted under countless hooves , and its nutrients washed away .
When it rained , Leopold says , red soil appeared to bleed from the hillsides .
The group chose local rainforest trees , collecting seeds from native trees in the community .
" You ca n't buy seeds , " Leopold says .
" So we passed the word around among the neighbors . "
When a farmer would notice a tree producing seeds , Leopold and his wife would ride out on horses to find the tree before hungry monkeys beat them to it .
The group planted mixtures of local species , trimming away the pasture grasses until the trees could take care of themselves .
This was the opposite of what commercial companies have done for decades , planting entire fields of a single type of tree to harvest for wood or paper pulp .
The trees the group planted were fast - growing , sun-loving species .
After just five years those first trees formed a canopy of leaves , shading out the grasses underneath .
" One of the really amazing things is that our fast - growing tree species are averaging two meters of growth per year , " Leopold says .
How could soil so long removed from a fertile rainforest support that much growth ?
Leopold says that may be because of mycorrhizae , microscopic fungi that form a symbiosis with tree roots .
Research at Cornell and BTI shows that without them , many plants can't grow as well .
After 50 years , the fungi seem to still be alive in the soil , able to help new trees grow .
Another success came when Cornell student Jackeline Salazar did a survey of the plants that moved into the planted areas .
She counted understory species , plants that took up residence in the shade of the new trees .
Most plots had over a hundred of these species , and many of the new species are ones that also live in nearby remnants of the original forests .
Together , these results mean that mixed - species plantings can help to jump - start a rainforest .
Local farmers who use the same approach will control erosion of their land while creating a forest that can be harvested sustainably , a few trees at a time .
" By restoring forests we 're helping to control erosion , restore quality forests that belong there , and help the quality of life of the local people , " says Leopold .
That quality - of - life issue is drinking water .
It 's in scarce supply where forests have been destroyed , since without tree roots to act as a sort of sponge , rain water runs off the hillsides and drains away .
Erosion is also out of control .
" You might drive on a dirt road one year , and then come back the next to find it 's a gully over six feet deep , " says Leopold .
" It 's a very serious problem . "
Does the experiment 's success mean that rainforests will one day flourish again ?
Fully rescuing a rainforest may take hundreds of years , if it can be done at all .
" The potential for the forest being able to come back is debatable , " Leopold says , but the results are promising .
" I 'm surprised , " he said .
" We 're getting an impressive growth of new forest species . "
After only ten years , plots that began with a few species are now lush forests of hundreds .
Who knows what the next few decades - or centuries - might bring ?
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Jamiel
Shaw was just three doors from his house on March 2 .
His father told the 17 - year - old high school football star to be home before dark .
That is exactly what he was trying to do when , just before dusk , gunshots rang out .
Gang members pulled up in a car and asked Shaw if he was in a gang .
Shaw did n't have time to tell them " no . "
He was mowed down before he could answer , police say .
His dad heard the shots from inside his house and immediately called his son's cell phone to warn him to stay away .
But within seconds , the father realized what had happened .
" I just ran down there , " Jamiel Shaw Sr. told CNN .
Watch dad describe hearing " pow , pow " »
His son was wearing the same shirt his dad had pressed for him that morning .
" He was laying on the ground and his face was so peaceful .
I knew he was dead . "
" For three hours , I was just completely blacked out walking . "
More than 7,500 miles away , Army Sgt. Anita Shaw was serving her second tour in Iraq .
Her commanding officer called her into his office and told her to sit down next to the chaplain .
He then informed her that her son had been killed on the streets of Los Angeles .
" I freaked out , " she said .
" I wanted to run out of the room .
I was screaming and kicking .
I was shouting , ' No . ' "
Anita Shaw is now back in Los Angeles to bury her son .
Police announced Tuesday that an arrest had been made in the shooting .
Pedro Espinoza , a 19 - year - old member of the Hispanic 18th Street Gang , was charged in the killing and could face the death penalty if convicted , the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's Office said .
Espinoza is scheduled to be arraigned March 25 .
Espinoza was released from jail -- where he was held on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon -- one day before the incident .
Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton Tuesday called on the community to help police locate a second suspect who was with Espinoza at the time of the shooting .
Hundreds of family members and friends gathered Tuesday at West Los Angeles Cathedral to remember Shaw , a standout running back and sprinter at Los Angeles High School who had good grades and stayed out of trouble despite his rough neighborhood .
Among the schools recruiting him was Stanford University .
Watch as family , friends remember Shaw »
Blue - and - white flowers -- his school colors -- adorned his casket , and photos of Shaw over the years were displayed at the service .
Eric Clapton 's " Tears in Heaven " played as mourners entered the church .
" He was a Christian and I thank God for that because I know he 's in a better place , " his mom said , trembling as she sobbed .
" He 'd just try all the time to do the right thing .
He was so good . "
Shaw is one of several innocent victims in a horrifying three - week spate of gang - related shootings around Los Angeles .
A man was gunned down as he held a 2 - year - old baby in his arms .
A 13 - year - old boy was shot to death last week as he went to pick lemons from a tree .
In another incident , a 6 - year - old boy was critically wounded when he was shot in the head while riding in the car with his family ; two gang members have been arrested in connection with that shooting , according to police .
" I think what is particularly unnerving for all of us is just the random nature of these shootings , " Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said last week .
Bratton and Deputy Chief Kenneth Garner met with community members from the South Side of Los Angeles over the weekend to try to calm tensions between black and Hispanic communities .
Among those in attendance were Shaw 's parents and his younger brother .
Bratton acknowledged some neighborhoods are rife with underlying racial tensions that have " taken too many young lives . "
He said he is in the process of hiring 1,000 new police officers to help combat inner city gang violence .
Watch Bratton describe an " always underlying tension " »
" There 's no denying that some of the crime in this city is a direct result of hatred , animosity , racial animosity , ethnic differences , " Bratton said .
" We must all work to the best of our ability to try to prevent that . "
" None of it is right , " said Garner .
" We ca n't get so incensed that we lose focus that it 's going on on both sides . "
He added , " Wrong is wrong . "
The killing of Shaw has rallied his neighborhood .
Dozens of people gathered outside his home for a vigil last week and placed candles , flowers and blue - and - white balloons at a makeshift memorial .
One sign read , " We love you !
Jamiel Shaw . "
On the online social networking site Facebook , more than 100 people have joined a page called " Good people live in our hearts forever RIP Jamiel Shaw . "
" Loved you lots babyboi !
Still do !
I know many , many , many people who are missing you right NOW !!! " wrote Christina Stewart on the Facebook wall .
Another person , Harley Lally , wrote , " Football will never be the same without you .
I miss you every Sunday , and every time I step on that field . "
Shaw , a junior , carried the ball 74 times for 1,052 yards this season , with an average of 14.2 yards per carry , according to MaxPreps Web site .
The longest of his 10 touchdowns went for 75 yards .
He passed the ball one time all year in the last game of the season -- the last game of his career .
It was a 60 - yard touchdown strike .

All About Los Angeles • Gang Violence • Murder and Homicide
Often viewed as a hindrance , having a quirky or sociallyawkward approach to lifemay be the key to becoming a great artist , composer or inventor .
New research on individuals withschizotypal personalities – people characterized by odd behavior andlanguage but who are not psychotic or schizophrenic – offers the firstneurological evidence that they are more creative than either normal orfully schizophrenic individuals , and rely more heavily on the rightsides of their brains than the general population to access theircreativity .
The work by Vanderbilt psychologists Brad Folley and Sohee Park was published online last week by the journal SchizophreniaResearch .
Psychologists believe that a number of famous creativeluminaries , including Vincent Van Gogh , Albert Einstein , EmilyDickinson and Isaac Newton , had schizotypal personalities .
" Theidea that schizotypes have enhanced creativity has been out there for along time but no one has investigated the behavioral manifestations andtheir neural correlates experimentally , " Folley says .
" Our paper isunique because we investigated the creative process experimentally andwe also looked at the blood flow in the brain while research subjectswere undergoing creative tasks . "
Folley and Park conducted twoexperiments to compare the creative thinking processes of schizotypes , schizophrenics and normal control subjects .
In the first experiment , the researchers showed research subjects a variety of household objectsand asked them to make up new functions for them .
The results showedthat the schizotypes were better able to creatively suggest new usesfor the objects , while the schizophrenics and average subjectsperformed similarly to one another .

" Thought processes forindividuals with schizophrenia are often very disorganized , almost tothe point where they can’t really be creative because they cannot getall of their thoughts coherent enough to do that , " Folley observes .
" Schizotypes , on the other hand , are free from the severe , debilitatingsymptoms surrounding schizophrenia and also have an enhanced creativeability . "
In the second experiment , the three groups again wereasked to identify new uses for everyday objects as well as to perform abasic control task while the activity in their prefrontal lobes wasmonitored using a brain scanning techniques called near - infraredoptical spectroscopy .
The brain scans showed that all groups used bothbrain hemispheres for creative tasks , but that the activation of theright hemispheres of the schizotypes was dramatically greater than thatof the schizophrenic and average subjects , suggesting a positivebenefit of schizotypy .
" In the scientific community , the popularidea that creativity exists in the right side of the brain is thoughtto be ridiculous , because you need both hemispheres of your brain tomake novel associations and to perform other creative tasks , " Folleysays .
" We found that all three groups , schizotypes , schizophrenics andnormal controls , did use both hemispheres when performing creativetasks .
But the brain scans of the schizotypes showed a hugely increasedactivation of the right hemisphere compared to the schizophrenics and the normal controls . "
The researchers believe that the resultsoffer support for the idea that schizotypes and other psychoses - pronepopulations draw on the left and right sides of their brainsdifferently than the average population , and that this bilateral use ofthe brain for a variety of tasks may be related to their enhancedcreativity .
In support of this theory , Folley points to researchby Swiss neuroscientist Peter Brugger who found that everydayassociations , such as recognizing the car key on your keychain , andverbal abilities are controlled by the left hemisphere while novelassociations , such as finding a new use for a object or navigating anew place , are controlled by the right hemisphere .
Bruggerhypothesized that schizotypes should make novel associations fasterbecause they are better at accessing both hemispheres – a predictionthat was verified in a subsequent study .
His theory can also explainresearch which shows that a disproportional number of schizotypes andschizophrenics are neither right nor left hand dominant , but insteaduse both hands for a variety of tasks , suggesting that they recruitboth sides of their brains for a variety of tasks more so than theaverage person .
" The lack of specialization for certain tasks inbrain hemispheres could be seen as a liability , but the increasedcommunication between the hemispheres actually could provide addedcreativity , " Folley says .
Folley , who is in the process ofcompleting his dissertation at Vanderbilt , is currently pursuing aclinical internship and research at the University of California LosAngeles .
Park is an associate professor of psychology and aninvestigator in the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center for Research on HumanDevelopment .
The work was supported by grants from the NationalInstitute of Mental Health and the National Institute of Child Healthand Human Development .
NEW DELHI 
The latest bane of office productivity is Scrabulous , a virtual knockoff of the Scrabble board game , with over 700,000 players a day and nearly three million registered users .
Fans of the game are obsessive .
They play against friends , co-workers , family members and strangers , and many have several games going at once .
Everyone seems to love the online game  everyone , that is , except the companies that own the rights to Scrabble : Hasbro , which sells it in North America , and Mattel , which markets it everywhere else .
In January , they denounced Scrabulous as piracy and threatened legal action against its creators , two brothers in Calcutta named Rajat and Jayant Agarwalla who run a software development company .
Both Hasbro and Mattel said they were hoping for a solution that would not force them to shut down the game .
( CNN ) -- Florida and Michigan could go from having no say in the Democratic nominating process to deciding the nominee if their states ' political leaders succeed in getting their delegates seated .
Florida Gov. Charlie Crist says " common sense would dictate that every vote should count . "
The Democratic National Committee stripped both states of their delegates for violating party rules by scheduling their primaries too early .
But Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are running such a tight race that it looks like neither candidate will get the 2,024 delegates needed to clinch the nomination .
If Florida and Michigan count , their delegates could put either candidate over the top .
The states have 366 pledged delegates and superdelegates between them .
Allocate delegates and see what happens »
Florida Gov. Charlie Crist says " common sense would dictate that every vote should count .
" The argument that we are making is that the people of our respective states voted .
They cast that precious right .
They made their voice heard , and those delegates who represent them should be seated at both conventions , " Crist said on CNN's " American Morning . "
Watch Florida 's mounting frustration »
Crist , who is a Republican , says he wants the votes that were already cast to be counted because the " people should be heard and not party bosses in Washington . "
He and Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm , a Democrat , on Wednesday called on the Democratic National Committee to seat their states ' delegates .
They accused the party of silencing " the voices of 5,163,271 Americans " who voted in their primaries .
" It is intolerable that the national political parties have denied the citizens of Michigan and Florida their votes and voices at their respective national conventions , " they said in a statement .
Clinton on Thursday said she thinks " it would be a grave disservice to the voters of Florida and Michigan to adopt any process that would disenfranchise anyone . "
" I 'm still committed to seating their delegations , and I know that they 're working with the Democratic party to determine how best to proceed , " she said .
But DNC Chairman Howard Dean points out -- Florida and Michigan both knew the rules and agreed to them .
" The rules were set a year and a half ago .
Florida and Michigan voted for them and then decided that they did n't need to abide by the rules .
When you 're in a contest you do need to abide by the rules , " he said on " American Morning . "
Watch Dean explain what Florida , Michigan can do »
" You can not violate the rules of the process and then expect to get forgiven for it , " he said .
Dean says he has to run a process that yields an honest result , and , " The only way to do that is to stick to the rules that were agreed to by everybody at the beginning . "
But if the party decides the votes should count , the next question is how to count them .
The Democratic candidates agreed not to campaign in either state , and Clinton , who won both states , was the only top - tier candidate on the ballot in Michigan .
E-mails have poured in to CNN from people who say they decided not to vote because they knew their vote would n't count .
A complete primary do - over is another option , but no one wants to foot the bill .
Another contest in Florida could cost as much as $ 25 million , and the taxpayers have already paid for one primary .
Dean says having the DNC pay for a new primary is not an option because they have to focus their resources on the general election against presumptive Republican nominee John McCain .
The states have two options , Dean said .
" They can come back to the DNC with a set of delegate selection procedures that do comply with the rules of the 48 other states , or they can appeal to the credentials committee at the Democratic National Convention , " he said .
" It 's not the voters ' fault in Florida and Michigan that they did n't get included , so we think it 's a good thing to have these discussions going on . "
Democratic House members from Florida and Michigan met for about an hour in Washington Wednesday night to discuss ways to handle the delegate dilemma .
" Both delegations feel very , very strongly -- adamantly -- that our delegations be seated at the national conventions , " said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Shultz of Florida .
Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan said he 's not sure of the best way to resolve the dispute .
" I think the key is the voice of Michigan and Florida is heard and there 's a procedure that is fair to the residents and fair to the two candidates , " he said .
Sen . Carl Levin of Michigan suggested Wednesday that his state could hold caucuses to select its delegates .
Participants declined to say whether there is general agreement on a way forward -- for example , whether the two states should redo the votes there or use results from the previous primaries .
They pledged to continue discussions , though no formal meeting has been scheduled .
The national Republican Party also penalized Florida and Michigan , but cut each state 's allocation in half rather than stripping them entirely .
Because McCain clinched the GOP nomination Tuesday night , any fight over seating Florida and Michigan 's delegates will matter little in the GOP race .

The gas field is so huge it could in theory make Brazil self - sufficient
The disappearance of four laptops and two hard drives is being treated as a case of industrial espionage .
Brazil 's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has referred to the stolen material as a " state secret " .
The investigation into this mysterious and high - profile theft , which happened late last month , is continuing .
The laptops and hard drives were stolen as they were being transported from an offshore rig to offices belonging to Petrobras .
Espionage theory
Police were working on a theory that the crime was industrial espionage , but they have now said they are not totally discounting the possibility that it was a common theft , Brazil 's TV Globo reported .
Detectives had earlier highlighted that other valuable equipment was left behind by the thieves , but it appears more items were stolen than had been originally mentioned at police briefings , including a printer and a DVD recorder .
President Lula says the theft is a very serious matter
Detectives say there was a flaw in the security surrounding the delivery , and they have been trying to retrace the container 's route to establish where and how the robbery took place .
Police now say the stolen material related to a recent significant discovery of gas off the Brazilian coast , near Rio de Janeiro .
Petrobras revealed details of the Jupiter gas field in January , and while the company did not give precise information , the find was hailed at the time as having the potential to make the country self - sufficient in natural gas .
President Lula has described the theft as a serious matter and has referred to the stolen material as a " state secret " .
Police have interviewed at least 17 people who came into contact with the information , or who were involved in its transportation .

A dead fox has just been removed from a community well in southern Sudan .
Unaware of the danger from contamination , the villagers continue to drink the water .
They do n’t realize they ’re risking their lives .
“ This water is killing the people , ” says John Mamer , a UNICEF water specialist who has taken samples from the polluted well .
“ But they do n’t know , when they are dying , that it is through this water . ”
Four thousand children die every day from diseases caused by bad water and sanitation .
Some 1.8 million people , mostly children , are killed by diarrhea alone each year .
An understanding of basic hygiene would cut the number of these deaths by almost half .
In another village nearby , women and children scrape away sand to collect water from a puddle .
In many poor and remote areas , there are no alternative sources of fresh water .
UNICEF is working with local communities to install and maintain wells across the region .
Keeping them free from contamination is vital – and so is education .
UNICEF Sanitation Officer Christine Ochieng explains : “ Within our system we have a trained number of hygiene promoters within the community .
The hygiene promoters move from house to house , educating the mothers about the importance of clean water and also telling them that when they get water from the river , they need to boil and filter it .
But in most cases we find that at the end of the day only very few really follow that kind of method . ”
Those who do follow the advice reap the benefits .
One woman in the village tells Christine how there have been no cases of diarrhea in her community since latrines were built .
Without latrines water supplies can become more easily contaminated .
Safe water and good hygiene are the best defense against diarrhea and other water - related diseases .

EXPERT ADVICE EXPERT ADVICE
If you have n't yet felt the impact of the nation 's credit crisis , just wait .
Chances are , you wo n't have to wait long .
So far , the turmoil may feel a bit remote for average people : Failed mortgage lenders .
Gargantuan write - downs by banks .
Foreclosures for people who could n't really afford the mortgages they got .
STORY : Pain is n't restricted to struggling homeowners
What about the rest of us ?
Are we in danger ?
No one knows for sure , but quite likely , yes .
As the credit crisis seeps into farther - flung corners of the economy , more of us will find it harder — and costlier — to borrow money .
The value of the funds in our retirement accounts could shrink .
People with subpar credit will likely find it more difficult to qualify for auto and home - equity loans .
Even consumers who make the cut may need higher credit scores and more documentation .
With loans harder to get , people will hesitate to buy cars , boats and other big - ticket items .
The gravest fear ?
That weak consumer spending — along with surging energy prices , a long housing slump and sluggish job growth — will plunge the economy into a recession .
Even if a recession does n't occur , " We 're going to be in for a rough ride , " says Robert Kuttner , a senior fellow at Demos , a New York policy organization .
" With job creation slowing down , credit standards being tightened and housing values not going up anymore , the consumer is under pressure to tighten his or her belt . "
Becki Carr , 28 , of Detroit , says she 's growing gloomier about the economy .
Her reasons : rising home foreclosures in Detroit , rising heating and gasoline prices and a cloud of insecurity over the area 's job market .
As a result , Carr says , she 's watching her money more closely .
" Pretty much everyone around me is unemployed or they are having to travel down South to do contract work , " she says .
And " Every other house on our street is for sale , and they 've been for sale for the last year and a half .
…
It makes me double - check my costs and things . "
Tighter credit and falling home prices top the reasons why the economy could slip into a recession , according to 50 economists surveyed in late October and early November by the National Association for Business Economics .
Most economists still do n't foresee a recession .
But the risk of a downturn is growing with each bout of bleak news .
About 18 % of economists who responded to NABE 's survey put the probability of a recession starting within the next 12 months at 50 % or greater .
That 's up sharply from the 11 % of economists who said so in August .
A recession would inflict pain on a majority of Americans as unemployment rose and the stock market sank further .
In a recession , " Investors have to be prepared to absorb a 20 % - plus decline in the value of their portfolios , " says Ed Yardeni , president of Yardeni Research , an investment research firm in Great Neck , N.Y .
The benchmark Standard & Poor 's 500 - stock index hit an all - time high of 1565.
15 on Oct. 9 , but since then , it 's fallen nearly 8 % to 1440.70 .
The S&P index , which tracks large - company stocks and accounts for about 75 % of the market 's value , is up 1.6 % for the year .
What 's managed to help prop up the stock market so far is the sinking dollar , which has nourished companies that depend on foreign sales , says Gregory Peters , chief credit strategist at Morgan Stanley .
Peters says the indicator he 's watching most closely , to gauge the likelihood of further economic deterioration , is the labor market .
Job growth has clearly slowed but has still held up " reasonably well , " he says .
U.S. employers created an average 118,000 jobs in the three months through October , down from 142,000 during the first three months of 2007 , the Labor Department says .
The jobless rate last month was 4.7 % , up slightly from the recent low of 4.5 % in June but far below the 6.3 % of June 2003 .
Still , what began as a housing industry downturn more than a year ago has widened into a broader financial industry crisis .
Too many risky mortgages were made to people who eventually could n't afford their payments .
Many such mortgages were bundled into securities that were sold to investors who were often unaware of the risk they were absorbing .
Every week , more bad news
The initial low rates on adjustable - rate mortgages are resetting to higher rates .
And with housing prices in many markets falling , overextended buyers can't refinance .
Delinquencies and foreclosures are rising .
Banks and other investors holding downgraded securities tied to risky mortgages are writing down their values billions of dollars at a time .
Each week brings fresh evidence of how the credit crisis is causing damage .
Last week , for example , the stock market fell after Goldman Sachs downgraded the nation 's largest bank , Citigroup , to a sell .
Goldman said the bank would likely have to write down $ 15 billion over the next two quarters , mainly because of its exposure to risky mortgage securities .
And darker days probably lie ahead : Mortgage - related losses industrywide are likely to mount through 2009 and further bruise financial institutions , says Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody's Economy.com .
Such losses eat away at banks ' capital reserves .
That means they can't lend as much money .
Goldman Sachs analysts predict that , overall , banks ' exposure to risky mortgages could reduce the credit available to consumers and businesses by a staggering $ 2 trillion .
Even the $ 2.5 trillion muni bond market has n't escaped the credit crunch 's damage .
Muni bonds are issued by cities and states to raise money for projects such as schools , highways and airports .
Historically , they 've been relatively safe investments because it's rare that governments default on their debts .
But worries about the companies that insure hundreds of billions of dollars in muni bonds are rippling through to muni bonds and rattling investors .
The insurers , which have exposure to risky mortgages , could see their credit ratings reduced .
If that happened , the muni bonds they guarantee would be downgraded , too .
Cities and states would find it harder to raise money .
Projects would be delayed .
Taxpayers could face higher taxes .
Miami -Dade County and Puerto Rico have postponed bond issues totaling $ 1.5 billion in recent weeks because of credit concerns .
In the housing market , tightening credit has shrunk the pool of potential buyers for homeowners such as Glynnis Fairbanks , who wants to sell her four - bedroom home in Broward County , Fla .
Fairbanks had a deal to sell her home in May ; she thought the sale would be finished by August .
But the buyers , she says , had to back out because their lender , Countrywide , tightened its standards on their subprime loan .
She 's cut her price to $ 325,000 from $ 348,000 .
But only one other potential buyer has peeked at the house .
By the end of 2008 , more than 1 million homeowners with adjustable - rate mortgages will see their rates reset higher .
Meantime , many people who want to refinance can't because they lack the credit scores or the home equity to meet lenders ' tighter standards .
This is especially true in neighborhoods where prices are falling .
Some people who bought homes with little or no down payment now owe more than their homes are worth .
Investors , too , have been unnerved by the turmoil .
Take Doug Breitenbach , 63 , who pared back on his investments in financial services this month because of banks ' exposure to risky loans .
Since June , " I have lost on paper about $ 18,000 in my 401 ( k ) fund , " says Breitenbach , a retiree in Silver Spring , Md. Though his portfolio is still up for the year , " I 'm quite concerned about future drops . "
As mortgage - related distress spooks the markets , lenders are becoming " more sensitive " to the risks of other loans , says James Chessen , chief economist of the American Bankers Association .
Banks may require higher credit scores now to qualify for loans , he notes .
At the moment , though , many businesses say the credit crunch still feels a little remote .
In an October survey of small - business owners , only 6 % said loans had become harder to get , in line with survey results over the past two years , according to the National Federation of Independent Business .
Only 3 % said credit availability and interest rates were their top concerns .
A Federal Reserve survey last month showed little change in banks ' lending standards for small businesses .
But the same survey also detected a more ominous sign :
On most consumer loans , 14 of the 50 banks surveyed had tightened their standards by October .
That was up sharply from six out of 50 banks in July .
Banks are starting to do the same with credit cards .
Gary Perlin , Capital
One 's chief financial officer , said at an analysts ' conference this month that the company has become more selective about granting credit cards and auto loans .
And JPMorgan
Chase says it 's being more careful about issuing home - equity credit lines and auto loans , mainly for consumers with poor credit .
" When there 's less credit extended , " says Jack Malvey , chief global fixed - income strategist at Lehman Bros. , " it reduces world economic growth and puts the U.S. at risk of recession .
The real damage of that could be measured in hundreds of billions of dollars and , depending on what happens to the world economy , it could be $ 1 trillion . "
Discover Financial has jacked up the rate it charges to risky new credit card customers and has raised late fees for all customers .
Some banks are likely to consider raising fees or rates on credit cards — one of their most profitable products — because they 're under " that much more pressure " in an uncertain economy to recoup mortgage losses , says Edward Woods , senior analyst at Celent , a market research firm .
That means that even those with pristine credit are n't likely to escape the spreading credit crisis .
Curtis Arnold , founder of CardRatings.com , says he 's seeing more credit card issuers shrinking consumers ' credit lines .
" They try to lower it typically where it 's within $ 100 or $ 200 of your balance , " Arnold says .
" If you 're revolving a balance , you 're vulnerable .
Just because you have a good credit score , you 're not out of the woods . "
Eddie Ward of North Little Rock worries that any change in his credit card terms would make it harder for him to pay back $ 20,000 in debt .
" I have n't seen much change yet , but I 'm sure there will be over the next few years , " says Ward , 31 .
Credit bureau TransUnion 's TrueCredit.com division has begun recommending that consumers maintain a credit score of at least 680 to qualify for prime rates .
For years , TransUnion had recommended a score of only 650 or above .
Its rival Equifax has introduced a service to analyze a lender 's portfolio to figure out the probability that existing customers or new applicants have adjustable - rate mortgages .
Based partly on this factor , lenders could decide to withhold , or to increase , credit to certain consumers .
That service helps lenders " understand where the ( potential ) problem is , " says Dann Adams , president of Equifax Consumer Information Solutions .
As credit tightens , " The most overextended borrowers are going to be affected the most , and the hardest , then people on the cusp , " says Peters , the Morgan Stanley credit strategist .
But even low - risk borrowers face " tougher times , " he says .
In recent years , consumers have borrowed record - high amounts from credit cards .
Revolving balances on credit cards are at an all - time peak , with U.S. households owing a monthly average of $ 6,960 in the year that ended in September 2007 , up 41 % from four years ago , according to Synovate , a research firm in New York .
The danger is that households that rely heavily on credit " could get into trouble " as the economy slows , says Andrew Davidson , a vice president at Synovate .
" Their incomes are low on average , and they 're more likely to get hit with late and over - the - limit fees . "
' Wages are squeezed '
Consumers who pulled money out of their homes as the market soared in recent years will also be in for a shock as home prices fall during the worst real estate recession since the Great Depression .
Kuttner says he believes that consumers ' recent " reliance on home equity and credit card loans is n't because middle - income people are going on shopping sprees , but because wages are squeezed . "
Home - equity withdrawals accounted for up to $ 324 billion a year in consumer spending from 2004 to 2006 , according to estimates from Federal Reserve economist James Kennedy , based on a paper he wrote with former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan .
These withdrawals and related consumer spending plunged in the first half of this year as the housing market weakened , according to updated estimates from Kennedy .
In many parts of the country , home prices are expected to drop through next year , with the biggest discounts in Florida , California , Nevada and Arizona .
Those declines will curb consumer spending .
By the time the housing slump bottoms out , $ 1.7 trillion in housing wealth will have been lost , economic consulting firm Global Insight estimates .
For each dollar that a home falls in value , consumer spending falls by 4 cents to 9 cents , Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke recently told Congress .
That could lead to a drop in consumer spending of as much as $ 153 billion over several years .
While that 's no pittance , it 's only a fraction of the $ 9.2 trillion that consumers spent in 2006 .
Consumers , in turn , are likely to have difficulty gaining access to money .
Peters , the Morgan Stanley credit strategist , says the " virtuous cycle of packaging and selling credit has turned vicious . "
" The impact on the economy and consumers has yet to fully play out , " he says .
" We 're still in the early stages . "

Iraqi Power Struggles The Big Prize of Basra
Iraq had been enjoying a period of relative peace .
But the spate of violence in Basra last week showed that dangerous divisions remain in the war - torn country .
And everyone has their eye on the same oil - rich prize .
What is all this nonsense about us electing a " commander in chief " ?
Okay , I mean we all know it 's President Bush 's favorite title .
He thrills to being a " war president , " and loves strutting around in front of guys in uniform and getting saluted .
But really , what is this all about ?
The Constitution says that the President is the commander in chief of the army and the navy , and of the militia if it is called to national service .
But that is really just for the sake of having a civilian at the top of the food chain .
President cum commander in chiefs do not actually run the military .
They are n't trained to do that any more than they run education , or run the weather service or NASA .
Running the military , like running any federal agency , is what the head of that agency does , and in the case of the military , that 's what the Joint Chiefs of Staff do .
A president certainly makes critical decisions in choosing who heads each agency , and in broad policy matters by discussing options with department leaders .
The same is true in the case of the military with regard to the Joint Chiefs .
But presidents decidedly do not act as top generals .
The idea that Americans , when they go to the polls , whether in a primary or in a general election , are choosing a commander in chief , as our feckless media pundits are wont to tell us , or as candidates running for president are fond of saying in these trying times , is not only overwrought rhetoric -- it is downright dangerous , and idiotic too .
What voters are electing is the leader of the country -- the person who is responsible for administering the federal bureaucracy that protects our environment , regulates our commerce , funds our education system , builds our roads , and , oh yes , chooses the top brass that runs our military .
Great presidents in wartime -- Abraham Lincoln , Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt - - were great not because they were generals .
Certainly Lincoln and Wilson had no significant military experience , and Roosevelt 's military experience was limited .
And generals who have been presidents have been a mixed bag .
General Grant was by all accounts a poor president ; Eisenhower a good one .
Our current commander in chief , because he is obsessed with this one little aspect of his job description , has plunged the country in to the most disastrous war of its history - - a war fought entirely on borrowed funds .
Faced with a handful of rag - tag terrorists , he has bloated the military with 30 percent more money over the course of his tenure , so that today , the American military budget , in inflation - adjusted dollars , is about to equal the amount the government spent on the military in World War II , when the entire nation was mobilized to confront two powerful adversaries in a global conflict involving millions of American troops .
What a pathetic picture !
America does n't need a commander in chief .
It needs a wise , level - headed leader who has the courage to acknowledge that you can't solve problems by throwing ordnance at them , the courage to tell the citizens of the country that we do n't need to spend $ 1 trillion a year on war and preparations for war , and that in fact , if we cut that spending by two - thirds or three - fourths , we 'd still have the mightiest military in the world -- and more importantly , a much stronger society and economy .
What America needs is a president who sees the military as an option of last resort , not an option of first resort .
Let 's banish this commander in chief nonsense from the campaign .
Bush has already made the title laughable .
That is the response we should have when we hear someone say that title in public /
A guffaw .

An Iraqi engineer who provided the information that became one of the key planks in the Bush administration 's case justifying the invasion of Iraq has been tracked down by undercover reporters to a drab residential block in southern Germany .
Rafid Ahmed Alwan , code - named Curveball ( a baseball term for deception ) , has been in hiding since the invasion five years ago , and lives under an assumed name .
He was questioned by German intelligence in the late 1990s when seeking asylum in Germany and told them that he had witnessed a biological weapons programme in Iraq .
His " evidence " was made public in a compelling speech to the UN security council by US secretary of state , Colin Powell on 5 February 2003 , when he said that Iraq possessed stockpiles of biological weapons that threatened the world and the mobile weapons laboratories to produce them .
Although German intelligence officials had warned the CIA that Curveball 's claims were unreliable , and UN inspectors had failed to corroborate them , the Bush administration promoted the existence of such mobile labs for months after the invasion .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Now Curveball denies having made the claims in the first place .
The BBC 2 programme Newsnight broadcast last night secretly filmed footage of the discredited agent who was approached by Der Spiegel magazine in his German hideout where he declined to give a formal interview .
His face was blanked out in the footage in which a reporter asked him on his doorstep whether he had ever spoken about Iraq 's biological weapons .
Curveball replied " No . "
Der Spiegel , describing the stocky man with a full shock of black hair and a stubbly beard shown for the first time on television since the war , said it is clear that Curveball " is an impostor , a fabulist . "
However the magazine also criticised German intelligence for remaining loyal to its source , despite the " serious doubts " over his information .
Stewart : Giuliani was ' successful ' but still ' disturbing ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday January 9 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This On Tuesday night 's writer - free version of Comedy Central 's Daily Show , Jon Stewart interviewed Rudy Giuliani adviser David Frum and seemed to agree that the former New York mayor was the best public executive in three decades just after joking about Giuliani's " disturbing ... personality . "
After Stewart credited Ron Paul , who nearly beat Giuliani in Tuesday 's New Hampshire Primary , with being the most conservative running , Frum blasted the Texas congressman as offering " terrible answers . "
" He 's one of those people the more you learn about him ... the more disturbing a personality he becomes , " Frum charged .
" You should check into your guy , " Stewart joked .
As the audience roared , he added , " My brain 's not on strike , brother . "
Frum was quick to defend Giuliani as the " most successful public sector executive in the last 30 years . "
Stewart agreed , " That is true . "
Earlier in the show , Stewart panned Giuliani 's obsession with Sept. 11 .
" You 've got to forgive candidates their omissions , their errors , their complete reversals , their total falsities -- and , of course , their delusions , " said Stewart .
He then played a clip of Giuliani claiming , " We do n't mention September 11 nearly as much as people think . "
" I have to say that is true , " Stewart agreed , " because I was under the illusion he used it every single word , " Stewart has skewered Giuliani in the past over his - what the Comedy Central faux host calls - " 9/11 Tourettes , " and last August , as reported by Crooks and Liars , laid into the former mayor for his " evasive non-answer to a question about his biggest personal failing during " an ABC debate .
" Heres a hint :
It starts with annulling my first marriage to my second cousin , and it ends with my kids from my second marriage supporting Barack Obama because they hate my third wife , " he joked in August .
" Ba Boom ! "
Stewart asked next about Huckabee , and Frum answered , " He has been incredibly astute about speaking to the concerns that people have .
... He does n't offer real answers . "
Stewart suggested the attitude of the Republican Party to Huckabee and the evangelical voters could be compared to the Simpsons , where Ned Flanders is " a great next - door neighbor ... because he 'll do all the legwork , but when it comes down to it , you want President Homer . "
" I do n't think we want President Homer , " said Frum .
" We have President Homer , " Stewart insisted .
" But much skinnier , " was Frum 's comeback .

Status : True .
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , March 2008 ]
Dear Abby , Dear Abby , A couple of women moved in across the hall from me .
One is a middle - aged gym teacher and the other is a social worker in her mid-twenties .
These two women go everywhere together and I ’ve never seen a man go into or leave their apartment .
Do you think they could be Lebanese ?
Dear Abby ,

Dear Abby , I have a man I ca n’t trust .
He cheats so much , I ’m not even sure the baby I ’m carrying is his .
Dear Abby , I am a twenty - three year old liberated woman who has been on the pill for two years .
It ’s getting expensive and I think my boyfriend should share half the cost , but I do n’t know him well enough to discuss money with him .
Dear Abby , I ’ve suspected that my husband has been fooling around , and when confronted with the evidence , he denied everything – and said it would never happen again .
Dear Abby ,

Origins :
The above - quoted
list is one of the Internet ’s perennials :
While it does at times recede into periods of relative dormancy , it always emerges from such to make yet another round of people ’s inboxes .
We ’ve seen versions of it circulating in the online world as far back as 1997 , yet it is far older even than that .
With only one exception ( “ What can I do about all the Sex , Nudity , Fowl Language and Violence On My VCR ? ” ) , each of the compilation ’s clueless queries can be found in The Best of Dear Abby , a 1981 offering of memorable letters from her readers .
( We note the fact that the appearance of these letters in Abby ’s compilation only validates that she actually received them ; it does n’t rule out the possibility that some of them may have been written by correspondents who were deliberately trying to appear clueless . )
Other versions of the e-mail include these additional entries , all also drawn from that same book :
DEAR ABBY : I ’ve been going steady with this man for six years .

Proving Termination with ( Boolean ) Satisfaction Michael Codish The 17th International Symposium on Logic - Based Program Synthesis and Transformation ( LOPSTR 2007 ) ; 2008
Abstract :
At some point there was the Davis - Putnam - Logemann - Loveland ( DPLL ) algorithm~ite {DPLL62} .
Forty five years later , research on Boolean satisfiability ( SAT ) is still ceaselessly generating even better SAT solvers capable of handling even larger SAT instances .
Remarkably , the majority of these tools still bear the hallmark of the DPLL algorithm .
%
In sync with the availability of progressively stronger SAT solvers is an accumulating number of applications which demonstrate that real world problems can often be solved by encoding them into SAT .
When successful , this circumvents the need to redevelop complex search algorithms from scratch .
This presentation is about the application of Boolean SAT solvers to the problem of determining program termination .
Proving termination is all about the search for suitable ranking functions .
The key idea in this work is to encode the search for particular forms of ranking functions to Boolean statements which are satisfiable if and only if such ranking functions exist .
In this way , proving termination can be performed using a state - of - the - art Boolean satisfaction solver .

Below is a picture of Surround Video , an idea being developed by technologists at BBC Research & Innovation .
Graham Thomas of BBC R&I kindly sent me this explanation :
Surround Video is a means of visually immersing the viewer into a TV programme .
It is like surround sound , an optional extra that enhances viewing on a normal display .
The idea is to use a wide angle ( or fisheye ) camera fixed rigidly alongside the normal camera shooting the programme , and to project the image onto the walls , ceiling and floor of the viewer 's room .
The image is scaled and positioned to ensure that it aligns up with the existing TV , and warped to compensate for the distortion effects that come from the wide - angle lens and projection system .
Although the projected image will be dimmer and of lower resolution than the main image , it nevertheless gives a strong feeling of immersion , particularly with motion cues being visible in the viewer 's peripheral vision .
The effect is enhanced if the walls are light - coloured and relatively uncluttered , but it still works even if there are bookshelves and pictures .
Currently , the system is just a research prototype , but it shows one way that TV viewing could develop in the future .
Thanks to Sarah Mines for the picture .
Surround video is mentioned in this recent article about the work of BBC R&I from The Independent .

Ever see the famous " Apache vs. Yaws " graphs and wonder whether you , too , should be using Yaws ?
The graphs show what at first seems to be an unbelievably huge scalability advantage for Yaws , with its ability to scale to over 80000 parallel connections while Apache keels over at only 4000 .
Reactions to these graphs tend to be quite polarized , typically either one of " there 's no way these graphs are accurate " or " they must have misconfigured Apache " , to the opposite reaction of " Wow , I need to try using Yaws ! "
Regardless of whether you believe the Yaws comparison graphs or not , Yaws is a solid web server for serving dynamic content .
Claes Wikström wrote Yaws - " Yet Another Web Server " - in Erlang , a programming language created specifically to support long - running , concurrent , highly reliable distributed systems .
( To learn more about Erlang , get a copy of the wonderful book Programming Erlang , written by the language 's creator , Joe Armstrong . )
The flexibility of Yaws combined with several unique features of Erlang makes them a compelling combination for a RESTful web services platform .
If you 're serving static pages , grab lighttpd or nginx instead , but if you 're writing dynamic RESTful web services , then Yaws is definitely worth exploring .
In this article , I 'll relate some of my experiences with using Yaws and Erlang for web services development .
Yaws Basics
Yaws provides several ways of serving dynamic web content and supporting RESTful web services :
Related Sponsored Content From Docker to Kubernetes : Container Networking 101 ( By O’Reilly ) Embedding Erlang code within static pages .
With this approach , you embed Erlang code within a function named out / 1 within < erl > ...</ erl > tags directly into static content .
Files of this nature have a . yaws extension , by which Yaws knows to process the file and replace the < erl >...</ erl > tags with the result of executing the out / 1 function they 're expected to contain .
In Erlang terms , out / 1 is a function of arity 1 , i.e. , a function taking one argument .
Its argument is expected to be a Yaws arg record , which is a data structure that Yaws uses to communicate details for incoming requests to the code handling them .
For example , an arg record supplies information such as the request URI , incoming headers , POST data , etc .
Application Modules ( appmods ) .
The Yaws appmod facility lets application code take control of URIs .
In the approach described above , Erlang code is embedded within static files whose URIs are determined by their pathnames relative to the web server 's document root .
With an appmod , however , the application controls the meaning of URIs , and such URIs usually do not correspond to any file system artifacts .
Appmods are basically Erlang modules that export an out / 1 function .
Such modules are configured in the Yaws configuration file to correspond to a URI path element .
When a request is made containing a path element associated with a registered appmod , Yaws invokes that module 's out / 1 function , passing it an arg record .
The appmod 's out / 1 function can then examine the rest of the URI to determine the precise resource that is the target of the incoming request , and respond accordingly .
Yaws applications ( yapps ) .
Unlike appmods which are usually just single Erlang modules , Yaws yapps are full - fledged applications .
Each yapp has its own document root , and each can have its own set of appmods .
Specifically , yapps are Erlang / OTP applications .
OTP , which stands for " Open Telecom Platform , " is a set of well - proven libraries and frameworks that provide Erlang applications with powerful capabilities .
OTP encapsulates idioms and approaches for achieving distribution , event handling , and high reliability , among many other things .
Erlang / OTP has been proven in real - world field usage within a variety of telecom systems , for example , some of which mark their downtime in just a few milliseconds per year .
All three of these approaches , which are detailed at the Yaws website , can be usefully applied within a RESTful web service , depending on the specific nature of the service itself .
However , in my experience , yapps and appmods work the best , because they provide the most control to the web application .
RESTful Design
Since we want to develop RESTful web services , let 's look at some details of REST , which stands for " Representational State Transfer . "
Roy T. Fielding coined the term " REST " in his doctoral thesis to describe an architectural style suitable for large - scale distributed systems like the web .
HTTP is essentially an implementation of REST .
The term " representational state transfer " refers to the fact that RESTful systems operate via the exchange of representations of resource state in requests and replies .
For example , the typical web page retrieved with an HTTP GET is an HTML representation of the web resource identified by the URI targeted by the GET .
When developing a RESTful web service , these are the key areas to pay attention to :
Resources and resource identifiers
Methods supported by each resource
Formats of data interchanged between client and server
Status codes
Applicable HTTP headers for each request and response
Let 's consider each of these areas in the context of Yaws and Erlang .
Resource Identifiers
Designing a RESTful web service requires you to think about what resources comprise your service , how to best identify them , and how they relate to one another .
RESTful resources are identified by URIs .
Normally , related resources have URIs that are themselves related , sharing common path elements .
For example , in a web - based bug tracking system , all the bugs for imaginary project " Phoenix " might be found under the URI http://www.example.com/projects/Phoenix/bugs/ , whereas the specific bug numbered 12345 might be under http://www.example.com/projects/Phoenix/bugs/12345/ .
RESTful resources also tend to provide URIs for other resources within their own state representations .
This allows clients retrieving a particular resource 's state to use the URIs returned within the state representation to navigate to other portions of the overall web application .
In Yaws , the arg record indicates the request URI , and the yaws_api module provides the request_url function to easily retrieve it :
out ( Arg ) -> Uri = yaws_api:request_url ( Arg ) , Path = string : tokens ( Uri#url.path , " / " ) ,
Once you have the request URI , I 've found that it 's handy to tokenize the request path as shown above , by splitting it on its forward slashes .
The result is a list of path elements that begin at the URI point where you 've tied your appmod .
For example , let 's assume we 've tied an appmod onto the " projects " path element in the URI http://www.example.com/projects/ .
If a request is made on any URI containing this URI as its prefix , the appmod 's out / 1 function will wind up with a list of separated path elements indicating the target resource of the request .
For example , a request for URI http://www.example.com/projects/Phoenix/bugs/ will result in the following Erlang list of path elements in the Path variable after executing the code shown above :
[ " projects " , " Phoenix " , " bugs " ]
The utility of splitting the URI is that it makes further dispatching quite simple , thanks to Erlang 's pattern matching .
For example , we can write a separate function , let 's call it out / 2 , to handle this specific URI by defining the function head like this :
out ( Arg , [ " projects " , Project , " bugs " ] ) -> % code to handle this URI goes here .
This out / 2 function will handle all requests for bug lists for all projects we know about , with the variable Project , which is available to the function body , being set to the specific project name being requested .
Supporting additional URIs is equally as simple : just add more variants of the out / 2 function .
You can also feel free to use a name other than out for these functions if you wish , since they are not invoked directly by the Yaws framework .
Note that properly defining your resource URIs yields significant benefits .
With appmods and yapps , having a rich URI space is quite simple because of the simplicity of tying different appmods onto different URI path elements , and the ease of dispatching .
Erlang pattern matching makes handling requests for different URIs trivial .
Contrast this with the poor style traditionally used for defining non-RESTful services , where all services are given the same URI .
This URI typically points to a script that uses information provided within the request body or through URI query strings to determine where to actually dispatch the request .
The URIs that result from the Erlang / Yaws dispatching technique shown above are far cleaner than the overloaded URIs with seemingly endless parameter lists that result from the traditional approach .
Resource Methods
The methods that web clients can invoke on a web resource are defined by HTTP 's verbs , primarily GET , PUT , POST , and DELETE .
However , individual resources tend to support only a subset of those verbs .
When you design your web service , you need to determine what methods each of your resources supports , bearing in mind the semantics expected for each HTTP verb as defined in RFC 2616 .
In Yaws , the request method is found in the http_request record , accessible via the arg record :
Method = ( Arg#arg.req ) #http_request.method
This returns an Erlang atom representing the request method , which can then be added into our pattern - matching dispatching approach .
We can add a new parameter to our out function , turning it into out / 3 , to include the request method :
out ( Arg , ' GET ' , [ " projects " , Project , " bugs " ] ) -> % code to handle GET for this URI goes here .
This variant of the out function handles only GET requests for bug lists for each of our projects .
Another variant might handle a POST , presumably to add a new bug to the list .
To allow only GET and POST but disallow all other verbs , you 'd simply write a catch - all function for the same URI :
out ( Arg , ' GET ' , [ " projects " , Project , " bugs " ] ) -> % code to handle GET for this URI goes here ; out ( Arg , ' POST ' , [ " projects " , Project , " bugs " ] ) -> % code to handle POST for this URI goes here ; out ( Arg , _ Method , [ " projects " , _Project , " bugs " ] ) -> [ {status , 405} ] .
Here , methods other than GET and POST will match the third variant , which returns HTTP status 405 , which means " method not allowed . "
The leading underscores on the Method and Project variables quiet compiler warnings about them being unused .
Just as with URI dispatching , Erlang pattern matching makes dispatching to separate functions to handle separate HTTP verbs trivial .
Representation Formats
When designing a RESTful web service , you need to consider what representation ( s ) each resource supports .
Web service resources often support XML or JSON representations , for example .
Erlang supplies the xmerl library for creating and reading XML , and Yaws provides a straightforward JSON module .
Both work quite well .
You can access an incoming request 's Accept header to determine what representation ( s ) the client prefers .
This header is available in a headers record , also available through the arg record :
Accept_hdr = ( Arg#arg.headers ) #headers.accept
If your resource supports multiple representations , you can check this header to see if the client indicated which representation it prefers .
If the client did not send an Accept header , the Accept_hdr variable shown above will be set to the atom undefined , and your resource can supply whatever representation it deems best .
Otherwise , your service can parse the Accept_hdr value to determine which representation to send .
If the client requests representations that your resource cannot fulfill , it can return HTTP status 406 , which means " not acceptable , " along with a body indicating what formats are acceptable :
case Accept_hdr of undefined -> % return default representation ; " application / xml " -> % return XML representation ; " application / json " -> % return JSON representation ; ?
_ Other ->
Msg = " Accept : application / xml , application / json " , Error = " Error 406 " , [ {status , 406} , {header , {content_type , " text / html " }} , {ehtml , [ {head , [ ] , [ {title , [ ] , Error} ]} , {body , [ ] , [ {h1 , [ ] , Error} , {p , [ ] , Msg} ] } ]} ] end .
The Erlang code above checks the Accept_hdr value to see if it 's either application / xml or application / json .
If it 's either of those , the resource returns a suitable representation , but if not , the code returns an HTTP status 406 along with an HTML document indicating the representations the resource is willing to provide .
Another way of handling the desired representation is - you guessed it - adding it as another parameter to our out handler function .
This way , Erlang pattern matching ensures that our request gets dispatched to the right handler for the requested URI / method / representation combination .
This avoids cluttering handlers with case statements like the one above .
By the way , this example also shows the Yaws ehtml type , which is a way of representing HTML as a series of Erlang terms .
I find ehtml quite intuitive to write because it directly follows the structure of HTML , but is far more compact and eliminates the tedium and errors of matching tags that you face when writing literal HTML .
Status Codes
RESTful web services must return proper HTTP status codes , as indicated by RFC 2616 .
Returning the right status is easy with Yaws : simply include a status tuple in the result of your out / 1 function .
See the case statement above for an example of returning the appropriate status code .
If your code does not explicitly set a status , Yaws will set a status 200 for you , indicating success .
HTTP Headers
Retrieving request headers and setting reply headers with Yaws is straightforward , too .
We 've already seen an example of retrieving the Accept header from the headers record ; other request headers can be retrieved in the same fashion .
Setting reply headers simply requires putting a header tuple in the outgoing reply , like this :
{header , {content_type , " text / html"}}
This sets the Content - type header to " text / html , " for example .
Similarly , in our previous example where we returned status 405 to indicate a " method not allowed " error , we should have also included the following header :
{header , { " Allow " , " GET , POST" }}
Appmods or Yapps ?
So far we 've seen how Yaws and Erlang make it almost trivial to handle many of the most important concerns for RESTful web services .
One remaining question is about choosing appmods vs. yapps , and the answer depends on what your services do .
If you 're writing web services that have to interact with other back - end services , then yapps are probably your best bet .
Since they 're full - blown Erlang / OTP applications , they typically have initialization and termination functions where connections to the back end can be created and shut down .
If your yapp is an Erlang / OTP gen_server , for example , your init / 1 function can establish state that the gen_server framework will provide to you , and allow you to modify , every time it calls you back due to an incoming call to your server .
Besides , using yapps also means you can use appmods as well , so it 's not really a matter of choosing one over the other .
Finally , yapps can participate in Erlang / OTP supervision trees , where supervisor processes can monitor your yapps and restart them if they should fail .
Supervisor trees play a significant role in the reliability of long - running Erlang systems .
This article is geared toward RESTful web services based on back ends other than relational databases .
If you 're writing a traditional web server on top of a relational database , you should check out Erlyweb , a framework for such web services , which is also based on Yaws and Erlang .
Conclusion
A significant aspect of writing RESTful web services is choosing the right programming language .
We 've seen numerous service frameworks in a variety of programming languages come and go over the years , and most were failures simply because they were a poor match to the problem .
Yaws and Erlang do not specifically provide a RESTful web services framework , yet the facilities they provide are a better match for RESTful development than many other language frameworks that were built specifically for that purpose .
While an article of this nature necessarily can't dive deeply into the details of Yaws , Erlang , and RESTful web services , it has hopefully touched on the important topics and provided , through its minimal code examples , an idea of how to address them .
In my experience , building RESTful web applications with Yaws and Erlang is very straightforward , and the resulting code is easy to read , easy to maintain , and easy to extend .

Embedding a scripting language inside your C/C++ code
Posted by Steve on Tue 4 Oct 2005 at 11:07
There are many scripting languages which may be embedded into applications .
Some languages have evolved this ability over time , and others have been designed from the ground up as embedded languages .
One of the languages specifically designed for embedded use is Lua .
Here we 're going to examine using the Lua Scripting Language and embedding it inside a C application .
One of my recent hobbies has been the creation of simple games , reminiscent of those I used to play upon my first computer .
Whilst writing games is n't something that will appeal to all Debian users , or sysadmins , there are a lot of uses to which a program can put an embedded scripting language - so that is the motivation for posting this here .
To start with you 'll need to install the libraries .
That can easily be done with :
apt - get install liblua50 - dev
This will give you a set of development libraries , header files , and other things required to build lua scripted applications .
Once installed you can compile and link your applications using the lua -config helper .
This will allow you to generate the compiler flags necessary :
skx@vilya :~$ lua-config -- include -- libs - I/usr / include / lua50 - L/usr / include - llualib50 - llua50
Once installed you will want your C , or C++ , code to do three things :
Initialise Lua
Call from C into a Lua script .
Call from Lua into your C application .
Each of these jobs will be demonstrated with a small example .
The most simple example we 'll look at involves initialising the lua scripting engine , after it has been linked into your application .
The code would look like this : # include < stdio.h > # include " lua.h " # include " lualib.h " # include " lauxlib. h " /* the Lua interpreter */ lua_State * L ; int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { /* initialize Lua */ L = lua_open ( ) ; /* load various Lua libraries */ lua_baselibopen( L ) ; luaopen_table ( L ) ; luaopen_io( L ) ; luaopen_string ( L ) ; luaopen_math ( L ) ; /* cleanup Lua */ lua_close ( L ) ; return 0 ; } ( You may download this file . )
Once you 've saved this as init .c you can compile it and build it like so : skx@vilya : ~$ gcc -o init - Wall `lua - config -- include -- libs` init. c skx@vilya : ~$
Executing the code , predictably , does nothing : skx@vilya : ~$ ./init skx@vilya :~$
This is because we 've written no real code .
We merely initialise an interpreter instance and then immediately clean it up .
The various luaopen_ functions are worthy of note , they perform a job equivilent to loading some standard libraries .
If you do n't include them you will be unable to use some of the standard functions - by ommitting them you can " sandbox " your scripts a little .
To do something useful we must move on .
Loading and calling into Lua scripts from your C code is the whole point of the lua language .
So there are several ways you can do this .
The most basic is to load a single source file and execute it in its entirety - much like running system ( " perl someScript.pl " ) ; .
The more general purpose way of calling Lua code from C is to push arguments to the function upon the stack and then make a call .
We will show an example of both kinds of code .
The first is the simplest .
Imagine we have a lua script , called do - me.lua with the following contents : print " Start " for i=1,10 do print ( i ) end print " End " ( This script merely executes a loop - printing the numbers 1 through 10 . )
We can load and execute this script by the following code : #include < stdio.h > # include " lua.h " # include " lualib.h " # include " lauxlib. h " /* the Lua interpreter */ lua_State * L ; int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { /* initialize Lua */ L = lua_open ( ) ; /* load Lua base libraries */ lua_baselibopen( L ) ; /* run the script */ lua_dofile ( L , " do- me.lua " ) ; /* cleanup Lua */ lua_close ( L ) ; return 0 ; } ( This file is available for download . )
Compiling this code is a simple process , similar to the last one : skx@vilya : ~$ gcc -o do -me - Wall `lua - config -- include -- libs` do - me .c
Once we have the compiled C program we can execute it to see the Lua script do - me.lua executed : skx@vilya : ~$ ./do-me Start 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 End
That was a useful enough example .
But it is n't great .
Instead if you 're building your extensible application you 'll want to call specific user defined functions - allowing users to override basic operations , etc .
For the next example we 'll write a lua function which will calculate the sum of two numbers .
Then call it from C .
The process will look like this :
Find the function .
Push the arguments onto the stack .
Call the function , specifying the arguments we 've pushed .
Get the return value .
This code , saved in the file add.c , looks like this : # include < stdio.h > # include " lua.h " # include " lualib.h " # include " lauxlib. h " /* the Lua interpreter */ lua_State * L ; int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { int sum ; /* initialize Lua */ L = lua_open ( ) ; /* load Lua base libraries */ lua_baselibopen( L ) ; /* load the script */ lua_dofile ( L , " add.lua " ) ; /* the function name */ lua_getglobal ( L , " add " ) ; /* the first argument */ lua_pushnumber(L , 41 ) ; /* the second argument */ lua_pushnumber(L , 22 ) ; /* call the function with 2 arguments , return 1 result */ lua_call( L , 2 , 1 ) ; /* get the result */ sum = ( int)lua_tonumber ( L , - 1 ) ; lua_pop ( L , 1 ) ; /* print the result */ printf (
" The result is %d
" , sum ) ; /* cleanup Lua */ lua_close ( L ) ; return 0 ; } ( This file is available for download . )
Compiling is as before : skx@vilya : ~$ gcc -o add - Wall `lua - config -- include -- libs` add.c skx@vilya : ~$
With the proper lua script file , add.lua : function add ( x , y ) return x + y end
We can now run the program : skx@vilya : ~$ ./ add
The result is 63 skx@vilya : ~$
The most interesting aspect of writing scriptable applications is to allow the script to contain your logic , calling into your application for the " hard " work .
In my terms that involves writing a simple piece of C to display the sprites upon the screen - then having the lua application make calls such as " moveLeft " , " moveRight " , " isDead " etc .
To call from Lua to your C functions you must first register them .
Then when they are called you have to do a couple of extra things from your C code : Fetch the arguments .
Do whatever you wish with them .
Push the results upon the stack .
Return the number of results .
In this next example we 'll write a C function " average " which will average a list of numbers .
We will call this from the lua script " average.lua " .
The calling script will look like this : avg , sum = average ( 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 ) print ( " The average is " , avg ) print ( " The sum is " , sum )
The corresponding C code looks like this : # include < stdio.h > # include " lua.h " # include " lualib.h " # include " lauxlib. h " /* the Lua interpreter */ lua_State * L ; /*
The function we 'll call from the lua script */ static int average ( lua_State * L ) { /* get number of arguments */ int n = lua_gettop ( L ) ; double sum = 0 ; int i ; /* loop through each argument */ for ( i = 1 ; i <= n ; i++ ) { if ( ! lua_isnumber ( L , i ) ) { lua_pushstring ( L , " Incorrect argument to ' average ' " ) ; lua_error ( L ) ; } /* total the arguments */ sum += lua_tonumber ( L , i ) ; } /* push the average */ lua_pushnumber ( L , sum / n ) ; /* push the sum */ lua_pushnumber ( L , sum ) ; /* return the number of results */ return 2 ; } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { /* initialize Lua */ L = lua_open ( ) ; /* load Lua base libraries */ lua_baselibopen( L ) ; /* register our function */ lua_register ( L , " average " , average ) ; /* run the script */ lua_dofile ( L , " average.lua " ) ; /* cleanup Lua */ lua_close ( L ) ; return 0 ; } ( You may download these files too . )
Compiling this and running it shows that we've : Loaded the script average.lua .
. Called from that script back into our C application .
Compilation and execution look like this : skx@vilya : ~$ gcc -o average - Wall `lua - config -- include -- libs` average .c skx@vilya : ~$ ./ average
The average is 30 The sum is 150
It is possible that you will want to setup some global variables from your C code which you wish the script to be able to use .
A good example of this is a version number .
You can do that with the following code : # define VERSION " 0.7 " lua_pushstring ( L , " VERSION " ) ; lua_pushstring ( L , VERSION ) ; lua_settable (L , LUA_GLOBALSINDEX ) ;
This allows your Lua code to do something like this : print ( " Version " .. VERSION ) ;
If you 've followed along you should be capable of embedding simple functions into external script .
Or writing main loops entirely in Lua .
The online Programming Lua book contains a wealth of information about using the language , including :
Ralph Nader : George Bush a ' recidivist war criminal '
Mike Sheehan
Published : Monday March 17 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader , reflecting on the quick exit of former New York governor Eliot Spitzer , wonders aloud in a new essay how President George W. Bush has escaped the same fate despite Bush 's role in considerably more damning and damaging crimes .
In the piece entitled " Country of Laws , " Nader blasts Bush for fictionalizing his Iraq war actions and for saying that he 'll leave office with no regrets .
While Spitzer resigned within days of his admission to indiscretions , " Bush remains , " writes Nader , " disgracing his office for longtime repeated violations of the Constitution , federal laws and international treaties to which the U.S. is a solemn signatory . "
Nader contrasts Spitzer 's legal and personal transgressions , and the price the now ex-governor is rapidly paying for them , with Bush , who " violated federal laws against torture , against spying on Americans without judicial approval , against due process of law and habeas corpus in arresting Americans without charges , imprisoning them and limited their access to attorneys . "
He adds that Bush has " committed a massive war of aggression , under false pretenses , violating again and again treaties such as the Geneva Conventions , the UN Charter , federal statutes and the Constitution . "
Despite this , and the human , financial and infrastructural cost of the war , Bush is , as Nader writes , " effectively immune from federal criminal and civil laws because no American has standing to sue him and the Attorney General , who does , is his handpicked cabinet member .
" Moreover , " continues Nader , " the courts have consistently refused to take cases involving the conduct of foreign and military policy by the president and the Vice President regardless of the seriousness of the violation . "
Nader says that judges readily and repeatedly dismiss such cases as " political " and say Congress is the way to pursue grievances , specifically via its authority to impeach .
Yet only Rep. Kucinich ( D - OH ) has publicly called for impeachment , Nader notes .
( Nader curiously fails to acknowledge that in December 2006 , now - former Rep. Cynthia McKinney - - a rival 2008 White House candidate running on the Green Party ticket -- introduced articles of impeachment against President Bush as one of her final legislative acts before leaving Congress . )
Meanwhile , rues Nader , " the American people have no authority to challenge [ Bush 's ] governmental crimes , which are committed in their name , and are rendered defenseless except for elections , which the two Party duopoly has rigged , commercialized , and trivialized .
Even in this electoral arena , a collective vote of ouster of the incumbents does not bring public officials to justice , just to another position usually in the high paying corporate world . "
Nader says that Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney will leave office as " fugitives from justice without any sheriffs , prosecutors or courts willing to uphold the rule of law . "
What lessons are to be learned from the differential treatment of Spitzer , asks Nader , and Bush , " a president who behaves like King George III did in 1776 and commits the exact kinds of multiple violations that Thomas Jefferson , James Madison , and other founders of our Republic envisioned for invoking the impeachment provision of their carefully crafted checks and balances in the Constitution ? "
Nader mockingly says that Bush and Cheney only need to stay out of a few towns in Vermont and avoid shoe - tapping in airport men's rooms .
Concludes Nader , " We certainly can do better as a country of laws , not men . "
The complete post by Nader can be seen at his official website .

Most consumer Internet sites today have an inherent tax of about 25 % on them due to scamming , phishing , hacking , and government requests .
That 25 % is based on time and mind - share .
And the 25 % is only going to get worse .
This is troubling .
I 'm calling it the Black Hat Tax .
And we ’re certainly facing it at Rapleaf .
Since james and I spoke I spent some time talking to a bunch of consumer internet sites -- from start - ups to establish companies .
these companies , especially those in the dating or social networks space , are increasingly spending their time thwarting bad guys .
A great example is PayPal .
The book PayPal Wars details an intense battle the engineering team and even the CEO fought against fraud .
This was one of the consuming issues of the company .
Now PayPal is a financial institution , so you would expect lots of fraud .
But dating ?
After surveying most of the dating sites , I have found that one of their top three issues is fraud .
A frequent scam is to contact an unsuspecting middle - age man from a profile of a good looking woman saying " my husband is beating me here in Moscow , please send $ 2000 so I can buy a plane ticket and escape . "
The unsuspecting chap sends the money only to never hear from the person again .
Apparently there are scam factories in the Philippines and other places that have thousands of people , paid on 50 % commission , working to scam unsuspecting dupes in this way .
And one success a month is $ 1000 / mo which compares well to many countries where the avg salary might only be $ 200 / mo .
And this is in addition to people actually hacking into your site .
That is a whole other cat - and - mouse game .
James thinks the Black Hat Tax is 25 % for most consumer Internet companies right now ( with some approaching 40 % ) .
I think that is a fair assessment .
That means that 25 % of your engineering time and 25 % of your management team is about preventing fraud .
That is a really onerous tax .
And James believes this is even getting worse .
Another strain on time is government requests .
I talked to an IT person at a social network that was consumed for three days with a government request for information on someone promoting pedophilia .
Not only did this person have to get a bunch of information to the federal authorities , but then he had to ensure that the information was backed - up and cannot be erased for at least three years .
not to mention that the work was disgusting as the person had to sift through some horrible pictures .
The nefarious characters are getting more sophisticated too .
And while thousands of sites are working feverishly to implement best security practices , the bad guys only need to find one hole .
So while my originally point ( that launching a consumer internet company is really easy ) is still correct , maintaining that site over time is becoming increasingly difficult .
More and more mind - share from the engineering team and the executives are going to thwart the bad guys than to actually improve the offering .
This is a really big problem .
Really big .
The Black Hat Tax is costing consumer Internet companies Billions and billions of dollars .
And it is a much higher percentage tax than off - line brick - and - mortar shops invest in security and anti-fraud matters .
The Transport Workers Union , which represents 140,000 active workers , is expected to announce Friday that it will become the first union that had backed John Edwards to switch its endorsement to Barack Obama , one union adviser said Thursday night .
The union , which endorsed Mr. Edwards , last September represents transit workers in New York City , flight attendants at Southwest Airlines and ground crew for American Airlines .
The Transport Workers Union is especially strong in New York State because the union ’s New York City branch , Local 100 , with more than 30,000 members , is one of the city ’s largest and most vocal unions .
The union , which is based in Manhattan also claims 60,000 retirees nationwide as members .
Labor leaders say many of the unions that had endorsed Mr. Edwards , including the United Steelworkers and the United Mine Workers , are waiting for the race to clarify before they decide on another endorsement .
Union leaders say that it is awkward to endorse one candidate who falls by the wayside , and even more embarrassing to endorse a second candidate , and that
have that candidate also fail to get the nomination .
Richard Trumka , the A.F.L. - C.I.O. ’s secretary - treasurer , said on Thursday that he did not see the labor federation–a grouping of 55 unions representing 10 million workers– making an endorsement in the near future .
He said that at the moment neither Hillary Rodham Clinton nor Barack Obama is in a position to muster the necessary two - thirds support to secure an endorsement .
“ We think they ’re both very good candidates , ” he said .
“ They ’d both be a vast improvement over the person now in the White House . ”
Union leaders say that if Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Obama develop a commanding lead in the delegate count , the A.F.L. - C.I.O. might seek to move soon afterward to endorse the front - runner .

Pity America ’s poor civil libertarians .
In recent weeks , the papers have been full of stories about the warehousing of information on Americans by the National Security Agency , the interception of financial information by the CIA , the stripping of authority from a civilian intelligence oversight board by the White House , and the compilation of suspicious activity reports from banks by the Treasury Department .
On Thursday , Justice Department Inspector General Glenn Fine released a report documenting continuing misuse of Patriot Act powers by the FBI .
And to judge from the reaction in the country , nobody cares .
A quick tally of the record of civil liberties erosion in the United States since 9/11 suggests that the majority of Americans are ready to trade diminished privacy , and protection from search and seizure , in exchange for the promise of increased protection of their physical security .
Polling consistently supports that conclusion , and Congress has largely behaved accordingly , granting increased leeway to law enforcement and the intelligence community to spy and collect data on Americans .
Even when the White House , the FBI or the intelligence agencies have acted outside of laws protecting those rights — such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act — the public has by and large shrugged and , through their elected representatives , suggested changing the laws to accommodate activities that may be in breach of them .

You ’re pounding the keyboard , double - clicking away , sighing and grumbling , but to no avail :
That devilish little hourglass icon refuses to give way to the Web site you ’re trying to reach .
Most Internet users have encountered trouble reaching online destinations , but they often attribute the problem to their wireless network cutting out or a server momentarily going down .
Sometimes , though , the problem is more mysterious .
At any given moment , messages throughout the world are lost to cyber black holes , according to new computer science research .
Ethan Katz - Bassett , a graduate student in computer science at the University of Washington , and his advisor , Arvind Krishnamurthy , designed a program to continuously search for these strange internet gaps , when a request to visit a Web site or an outgoing e-mail gets lost along a pathway that was known to be working before .
To make sure the black holes they detect are not simply due to a problem with the end user or the host server , they look for computers that can be reached from some , but not all , of the Internet , meaning the issue must be occurring en route .
" We were astounded when we did an initial four - month study and we saw how many problems there were , " Katz - Bassett told LiveScience .
" It seemed infeasible that this could be happening so often .
They ’re definitely more common than we thought . "
Now the team constantly monitors the Web for black holes and posts a map of where the problems are around the world at any given moment .
They hope their data will help Internet service providers track down the route of problems experienced on their networks .
" Network administers are definitely interested in it , " Katz - Bassett said .
" I think we need to do more analysis of the data and see where exactly these problems are occurring .
It would be interesting to come up with predictions about where problems were most likely to occur . "
The scientists named their monitoring system Hubble after the Hubble Space Telescope , which can also detect black holes , albeit the astrophysical kind .
They hope their data will help improve the consistency of the Internet , where we increasingly entrust vital information .
" I think we would like it to be more reliable , " Katz - Bassett said .
" It ’s orders of magnitude less reliable than the telephone network right now .
I think it should be pretty possible to get it closer . "
The researchers will present their findings at the Usenix Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation being held next week in San Francisco .
The project was funded by the National Science Foundation .

Outbursts on the Sun set the whole star shaking .
The quakes caused by flares should be visible on other stars .
Solar flares make the Sun ring like a bell , researchers in Denmark have found .
Christoffer Karoff and Hans Kjeldsen of the University of Aarhus say that these outbursts in the Sun ’s outer layers drive oscillations throughout the Sun “ in the same way that the entire Earth is set ringing for several weeks after a major earthquake . ”
This possibility was first proposed in the 1970s , but has not been demonstrated until now .
“ It ’s the first observational evidence of this that I ’m aware of , ” says Günter Houdek , a solar physicist at the University of Cambridge in England who was not involved with the work .
The Danish researchers think that not only could their finding help us understand the physics of the Sun , but it might also provide a way of probing cycles of activity in other stars .
They will present their work in a forthcoming paper in Astrophysical Journal Letters1 .
Solar seismology
Monitoring oscillations in the Sun — a discipline called helioseismology — is now a well established technique for studying the Sun ’s physical structure , such as its division into distinct layers of hot gas and plasma .
In general , these oscillations are though to be caused by turbulent convection near the solar surface , as hot material rises from deeper down and sinks again as it cools .
This motion sets up a kind of noisy background shaking over a wide range of frequencies .
That has tended to obscure any oscillations caused by local , specific events such as solar flares — vast eruptions of hot plasma created by sudden changes in the Sun ’s magnetic field .
These release immense amounts of energy , and are known to excite ripples like those on the surface of a pond when a pebble falls in .
“ If we can see the same kind of signal in other stars , it will suggest that they have flares too . ”
Christoffer Karoff
Solar flares are particularly common around sunspots , and show a cycle of activity that mirrors the sunspot cycle , peaking every 11 years or so .
When Karoff and Kjeldsen studied data from two Sun-watching satellites ( the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite ) , they found that whole - star high - frequency oscillations are more prominent when solar flares are more active , implying a connection between them .
The oscillations are observed indirectly : shifts in the frequency of light being emitted by the Sun , caused by movements of the solar surface , can be picked up by these satellites and translated into the shakes that caused them .
“ This is just a first observation , ” says Karoff .
“ Now the real work starts .
We need to figure out how the energy from the flares is delivered into the oscillations . ”
Throwing light on the Sun
Working this out will entail devising a detailed model of the Sun ’s structure in the region where flares and sunspots form .
Houdek thinks that such follow - up work could shed light on the solar cycle , which is not fully understood .
“ We still do n’t know where the ‘ seat ’ of the solar cycle is , ” he says .
It might also reveal a feedback loop between sunquakes and flares : while the oscillations the team spotted are thought to be a response to flare activity , Houdek thinks the vibrations might also alter the Sun 's structure and thus affect the flare - forming process .
ADVERTISEMENT
Karoff is also excited by what this finding might do for our understanding of other stars .
It has been very difficult to study whether other stars have a cycle of flares and spots comparable to that of our Sun , simply because they are too far away to see .
But now , by unpicking the signal of oscillations from starlight , one might be able to infer cycles of flare activity on distant stars .
“ If we can see the same kind of signal in other stars , it will suggest that they have flares too , ” says Karoff .
Such data might be provided by astronomical satellites such as NASA ’s Kepler telescope , scheduled for launch early next year .
Karl Rove 's next move : A million - dollar home on Florida 's Emerald Coast Lindsay Beyerstein and Larisa Alexandrovna

Only the carriage house is visible from the street ; the house proper lies behind it .
Click here to see more photos of the house ROSEMARY BEACH , FL - The abrupt resignation of President Bush 's top adviser and long - time mentor , Karl Rove , in August 2007 raised many eyebrows inside the beltway and as many questions .
Rove had been a fixture in the political life of George W. Bush for decades and had weathered innumerable political scandals .
Rove was tight - lipped at the time of his resignation about his reasons for leaving the White House , telling reporters simply that it was to start thinking about the next chapter in our family 's life .
Whatever the next chapter of Rove 's life has in store , some of the action will probably take place in Rosemary Beach , Florida , where he bought land in 2002 .
A $ 165,000 lot becomes a $ 1 million home According to political journalist Jim Moore , many factors probably influenced the timing of Rove 's resignation -- including the desire to cash in on lucrative speaker 's fees and the prospect of reinventing himself as a political pundit on the national stage .
" Ultimately , though , what probably appeals to Karl the most is being a sort of freelance Dr. Evil , " Moore -- a Rove critic -- explained in an email to RAW STORY .
" He can do his work now for hire under the guise of any organization that wants to hire him or he can do it for fun and generally avoid the restraint of party or candidate .
Have darkness .
Will travel . "
Rosemary Beach , Florida bills itself as a vacation community , but Rove 's home is no beach bungalow .
His Dill Lane pad is a 2,578 - square - foot cedar and white stucco structure with a stoop , 4 bedrooms , 3 baths , and an outdoor shower .
Opposite the main house , separated by a small walled courtyard , is a two - story carriage house with a two - car garage on the ground floor .

The setting is equally upscale .
Rosemary Beach is a 107 - acre development along a stretch of County Road 30A , between Destin and Panama City , Florida .
The centrally planned community bills itself as a town .
In fact it 's an exclusive real estate development in an unincorporated part of Walton County -- although the developers have erected a " Town Hall . "
All homes and businesses in Rosemary Beach are designed and laid out according to a master Town Plan .
Marketing materials describe the architecture as " Pan-Caribbean . "
" Residents of Rosemary Beach are lucky to not only live and work here , but also to have the opportunity to play here .
When work is finished and the rest of the errands can wait , Rosemary Beach is the perfect location for a vacation , " the official website proclaims .
RAW STORY spotted Rove in Rosemary Beach in February on two occasions .
During our trip , the house looked lived in -- bikes cluttered the stoop and cloth cushions graced outdoor furniture .
Rove has been easing his way into the small community of Rosemary Beach for some time .
According to public documents , Rove and his wife Darby , a graphic designer , purchased an empty lot from the Rosemary Beach Land Co. for $ 165,000 in November 2002 .
Three months later , they paid off the mortgage in full .
A house would not be built on the Dill Lane property for another two years .
In early 2004 the Roves took out a $ 412,000 construction loan , and by August , the house was finally built .
Today , Walton County tax assessors value the home at $ 866,403 .
Rove 's Public Financial Disclosure Report , filed with the Office of Government Ethics , estimates the value of the home at over $ 1 million .
Rove 's mortgage is somewhere between $ 250,001 and $ 500,000 , according to the same report .
( That 's a 7 - year mortgage from Wells Fargo at 4.625 % interest . )

Rosemary Beach is one of a string of planned communities along Florida 's northwest panhandle that cater to elites from Alabama and Georgia as well as Florida .
Nearby Seaside even has its own think tank , the Seaside Institute , dedicated to the study principles of New Urbanism .
Once known as the " Redneck Riviera , " this strip of land along the Gulf of Mexico has been rebranded as " Florida 's Emerald Coast . "
Politicians and civic leaders from Alabama , Florida , and Georgia now flock to its white sandy beaches .
Although the home appears to have been initially purchased as vacation property , Rove seems to be spending an increasing amount of time there , leading some to speculate that the Dill Lane home is the controversial political advisors new base of operations .
Rove still owns a home in DC and two small cottages in Ingram , Texas , according to public records .
Interestingly , he does not claim a homestead property tax deduction on any of these properties -- which he would be entitled to do if he were to claim one of these as his primary residence .
Rove is registered to vote in Kerr County , Texas .
Rove has deep roots in Alabama .
In 1994 the Business Council of Alabama hired Rove as a consultant for a judicial campaign .
Rove worked alongside Republican activist / lobbyist Bill Canary , now the CEO of the Business Counsel of Alabama , to help deliver Alabama 's Supreme Court to the Republicans .
In 1998 Rove advised William Pryor in his successful bid for Alabama Attorney General .
It was Pryor who would go on to seal the ballots for Baldwin County that would give Bob Riley the margin of victory in his bid to unseat Democratic Governor Don Siegelman .
Siegelman , who was jailed for bribery after a widely criticized political prosecution , was granted bond Thursday and is supposed to be released today .
Rove 's political ties to Alabama did n't end when he joined George W. Bush 's administration as Deputy Chief of Staff .
Rove continued to advise Alabama politicians , including Gov. Bob Riley , according to a Republican activist who recounted Rove 's four - year covert involvement in a campaign to neutralize Siegelman to Raw Story in November , 2007 .
For the locals , Roves short visits , which are becoming ever more frequent , have already left their mark .
Some point to the increased media interest in the locale and the constant stream of reporters that make their way through the small town looking for information on Rove .
None would give his or her name for the record .
One waitress who works at Bud & Alleys restaurant downtown , said she 's seen Rove and his guests sequestered in the large downstairs area of the popular eatery .
Saying she was happy not to have been his server , she quipped ,  I would have told him what I thought of him and gotten fired . 
Rove has himself left his mark with the local police .
In September of 2007 he was caught speeding in a posted municipal zone .
According to Walton County public records , his fine was $ 83 dollars , which he paid in full , and promptly .

Muriel Kane contributed research for this report .
We attended a special screening last night of In Trial : Prosecuting Music Piracy , the first feature - length film produced by the National District Attorneys Association in collaboration with the Recording Industry Association of America .
Prosecuting Music
Piracy is a sordid tale of drugs , terrorism , and technology that artfully challenges society 's preconceived notions about justice .
This highly entertaining film is n't destined for theaters and was actually intended for use as a training video to familiarize district attorneys with the complexities of anti-piracy enforcement .
The video was leaked and made available on the Internet .
When we saw it for ourselves , we just could n't keep a straight face .
Instead of reporting on the facts surrounding the leak ( first noticed by p2pnet ) , we thought it would be more fun for all involved if we treated it like a theatrical release and reviewed it accordingly .
The movie consists of a series of dialogues interspersed with brief shots that depict alleged music counterfeiters and their wares .
The novel emphasis on music piracy infuses the film with thematic originality that helps to offset the somewhat tedious format .
The highly minimalistic set design and the absence of big - name actors detract from the movie 's mainstream appeal , but add a pastiche of gritty realism that enriches the viewing experience and accentuates the film 's underlying message .
The main characters are Jim Dedman , a tepid district attorney with a submissive attitude ; Deborah Robinson , a smooth - talking lawyer from the RIAA 's anti-piracy division ; and Frank Walters , a former Maryland State Trooper turned RIAA investigator .
The dialogue between these characters is well - crafted and filled with subtlety .
Dedman 's deferential tone contrasts sharply with Robinson 's authoritative confidence , a juxtaposition that is intended to convey to the audience insight into the nature of the relationship between the RIAA and the law .
Although the character Robinson insists that the RIAA 's function in piracy legal proceedings is to serve prosecutors rather than dictate policy , the film 's portrayal of her interaction with the sycophantic Dedman makes a bold subtextual statement about the RIAA 's position of dominance .
Robinson 's implausible denial of the RIAA 's control is a hanging lampshade that mocks the RIAA 's rhetorical style .
In both appearance and demeanor , the character of Frank Walters was very clearly inspired by Walter Sobchak , the high - strung Vietnam War veteran played by John Goodman in the 1998 classic The Big Lebowski .
Note the uncanny resemblance between the characters Sobchak ( left ) and Walters ( right ) .
One of the most poignant moments of the film arrived when Robinson discusses asset forfeiture and the punishments imposed on music pirates .
The revelation that convicted pirates can potentially receive jail time and have their homes and vehicles confiscated for nothing more than selling cheap CD knockoffs causes the film to blur the lines that separate criminal and enforcer , compelling the audience to recognize the inherent injustice of the system .
Although the movie contains some serious themes , I often found myself laughing .
The actors skillfully deadpan several remarkably funny lines during a scene in which the characters attempt to draw a tenuous connection between drug dealing and music piracy — statements that add a high degree of levity to the film .
" What is it that you could bring to the DA 's office that would make them appreciate what music piracy investigations can do for their regular criminal case load ? "
Dedman asked .
" Well , I think that , number one , it has to be stressed that this type of crime affects quality of life in the DAs ' jurisdictions , the cities in which they work and live , but the other thing is that it 's a link to a lot of other crimes , " Robinson replied .
" It also has links to some terrorist organizations , for those federal prosecutors out there , there are a number of cases right now , but what we are seeing is also a link to selling drugs with the CDs and some gun activity as well . "
" There are some sayings in certain parts of the jurisdiction when you buy a CD , ' would you like it with or without ' , " Walters adds .
" The ' with ' is a CD enclosing a piece of crack or whatever the case may be .
We , continually , in working with law enforcement , find that these locations have everything from handguns to large quantities of narcotics . "
Another amusing highlight is the scene in which Walters demonstrates CD burning , noting that spindles of blank CD - Rs are a common indication that piracy is taking place .
Blank CDs are among the tools of piracy used by your friendly neighborhood terrorist
Although Prosecuting Music
Piracy does n't have the trappings of a box office hit , the humorous hyperbole will likely earn this low - budget production a devoted cult following in the same vein as the classic 1938 propaganda film Reefer Madness .
In 2005 , a 27 - year - old Japanese man expired after drinking a mysterious liquid .
Until this year , the exact cause of death was unresolved .
He had purchased the shady solution on the Internet and might have thought it was liquid ecstasy or a similar nightclub drug .
Unfortunately , the careless shopper was not headed for the party of a lifetime .
Instead , thirty minutes after downing the potion , he began vomiting and convulsing .
Before reaching a hospital , his heart stopped .
After two years of investigation , Kei Zaitsu and his colleagues at the
Osaka Prefectural Police Headquarters concluded that the man was killed by PMEA — a new hallucinogen similar to PMA , which is five times more potent than mescaline .
Their report will appear in an upcoming issue of Forensic Science International , but it is already available online .
Using two different instruments , Zaitsu searched for drugs in the dead man ’s blood and urine .
He was particularly keen on finding byproducts of PMEA — which were formed in the dead man ’s liver .
Traces of those chemicals would prove that the young man had ingested the drug before he died .
Since the illicit substance had never been studied in depth , the forensic scientists had to do a lot of work .
The team made batches of the drugs and their natural byproducts , developed a procedure to find those chemicals in bodily fluids , and then used the new method on the real blood and urine samples .
With a Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometer , the researchers separated out each chemical from a urine sample and identified them individually .
To be even more thorough , they tagged the drugs with a chemical called trifluoroacetic acid and checked for them again .
Finally , they used a second type of mass spectrometer , one that can automatically handle liquid samples , to measure the exact amount of drugs in the dead man ’s fluids .
Their hard work paid off .
Zaitsu and his team found a hefty amount of the hallucinogen in their subject ’s blood .
More important , they gathered information that will make future investigations way easier .
The forensics community now knows exactly what to look for in suspicious urine , how to look for it , and has a sense of what constitutes a deadly dose .

NYT : Stolen oil profits keep Iraq 's insurgency running RAW STORY

While many US officials and politicians routinely point to jihadism or Islamofascism as key motivating factors for Iraq 's insurgency , a growing number of officers on the ground are blaming economic conditions instead , according to an article slated for the front page of Sunday 's New York Times .
Richard A. Oppel Jr. reports that " there are officers in the U.S. military who openly question how much a role jihadism plays in the minds of most people who carry out attacks .
As the U.S. occupation has worn on and unemployment has remained high , these officers say the overwhelming motivation of insurgents is the need to earn a paycheck . "
" Ninety percent of the guys out here who do attacks are just people who want to feed their families , " Maj .
Kelly Kendrick , operations officer for the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 101st Airborne Division in Salahuddin , tells the Times .
Stolen oil profits are helping to keep the insurgency running , according to Sunday 's report .
The Times notes , " The sea of oil under Iraq is supposed to rebuild the nation and then make it prosper .
But at least one - third , and possibly much more , of the fuel from Iraq 's largest refinery here is diverted to the black market , according to U.S. military officials .
Tankers are hijacked , drivers are bribed , papers are forged and meters are manipulated -- and some of the earnings go to insurgents who are still killing more than 100 Iraqis a week . "
" It 's the money pit of the insurgency , " Capt .
Joe Da Silva , a commander of several platoons stationed at the refinery , tells the paper .
Excerpts from article : # Money from swindles in Iraq and from foreign patrons in places like Saudi Arabia allows a disparate , decentralized collection of insurgent cells to hire recruits and pay for large - scale attacks .
But the focus on money is the insurgency 's weakness as well as its strength , and one reason why loyalties can be traded .
For now , at least 91,000 Iraqis , many of them former enemies of the U.S. forces , receive a regular American - paid salary for serving in neighborhood militias .
" It has a great deal more to do with the economy than with ideology , " said one senior U.S. military official , who said that studies of detainees in American custody found that about three - quarters were not committed to the jihadist ideology .
" The vast majority have nothing to do with the caliphate and the central ideology of al - Qaida . " #

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The House of Representatives approved another $ 70 billion in war spending on Wednesday , capping a year of frustration for Democrats who took control of Congress on pledges to end the war in Iraq .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says President Bush is driving allies " over the cliff . "
The money was part of a $ 555 billion measure that funds government agencies for the 2008 budget year .
It passed on a 272 - 142 vote , more than a month after Democratic leaders had refused to approve more money for Iraq without requiring President Bush to begin withdrawing U.S. combat troops from the nearly five - year - old conflict .
Democrats credit their opposition to the widely unpopular war for the 2006 election victories that brought them to power in both houses of Congress .
But their efforts to end the war have foundered all year in the Senate , where Bush 's Republican allies have successfully used filibusters to kill them .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , Democrat from Nevada , said Democrats would continue trying to bring an end to the conflict , and he warned that Bush was driving his GOP allies " over the cliff " by continuing the war .
" I hope this last year of his eight - year reign will be one where he will understand -- and more importantly , the Republican senators will understand -- that they 've got to break away from this , " Reid said .
Rep. David Obey , the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , said Democrats " have tried every way known to man to bring this war to a conclusion . "
" I think it is clear that if the nation wants a change in direction with respect to this war , it has only two options , " said Obey , D - Wisconsin .
" One is to elect more progressive voices in the United States Senate , and second is to elect a president who has a different set of priorities domestically and a different vision for America 's involvement in the Middle East -- and especially in Iraq . "
Most Republicans repeatedly refused to break with the president .
They pointed to reports of declining U.S. military and Iraqi civilian casualties since August as a sign that Bush 's commitment of nearly 30,000 additional troops to Baghdad and its surrounding province was bearing fruit .
" It 's an undeniable fact -- or , should I say , an inconvenient truth -- that things are getting better in Iraq , and I think the American people are noticing , " Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , a Kentucky Republican , said Wednesday .
" I 'm not saying that we 're totally out of the woods .
I do n't think they believe that , " he said .
" But I think the American people are aware that things have improved , and most Americans are not pulling for us to lose . "
Months of upbeat reports from U.S. commanders in Baghdad have failed to improve U.S. public opinion about the war .
A CNN - Opinion Research Corp. poll taken December 6 - 9 found support for the conflict at 31 percent , with 68 percent expressing opposition -- and 69 percent favored withdrawing some or all American troops from Iraq .
The Bush administration has requested about $ 200 billion in war spending for 2008 .
Most of the money would go to Iraq , which the Pentagon says is costing about $ 2 billion a week .
The House had approved about $ 50 billion of that in November , but with demands that the president begin withdrawing troops from Iraq within 30 days .
The White House called that unacceptable , and Pentagon officials warned they would have to shutter U.S. bases and begin laying off as many as 200,000 civilian employees and contractors by March without the funds .
The provision calling for an American pullout stalled in the Senate , which killed two other efforts by Senate Democrats on Tuesday night that would have tied war funding to a plan to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq .

The hardest Mario Bros. level ever
Posted by Pete Berg on Friday , March 28th , 2008 at 6:28 pm
Whoever designed this level was the devil incarnate .
It ’s so difficult that it ’s hilarious .
Definitely worth the 23 minutes it takes to watch the entire thing !
Researchers have unearthed two previously undetected botnets that exhibit sophisticated new capabilities that could significantly advance the dark art of cyber crime .
One of them , dubbed MayDay by security firm Damballa , uses new ways to send and receive instructions to infected machines .
One communication method uses standard HTTP that is sent through an organization 's web proxy .
That allows the malware to circumvent a common security measure employed by many large companies .
Indeed , Tripp
Cox , vice president of engineering and operations at Damballa , says he 's observed MayDay running inside some of the world 's most elite organizations , including Fortune 50 companies , educational institutions and ISPs .
( He declines to identify them by name . )
" Most malware does n't go through the trouble of trying to discover a computer 's web proxy settings and use that as a method for getting onto the internet , " he says .
The botnet also uses two separate peer - to - peer technologies so zombies can stay in touch with each other , presumably as a back - up measure in case the central channel is disconnected .
One protocol communicates using the internet control message protocol ( ICMP ) and the other uses the transmission control protocol .
The ICMP traffic is obfuscated so it 's indecipherable to the human eye .
Damballa researchers are still working to figure out exactly what kind of information is being transported over the channel .
Up until now , the zombie army popularly known as Storm has been the 800 - pound gorilla of the botnet underground .
Having recently marked it 's one - year birthday , it is believed to comprise about 85,000 infected machines .
It was responsible for about 20 percent of the world 's spam over the past six months , according to MessageLabs , which provides email and web filtering services to more than 16,000 business customers .
By comparison , MayDay and another newly discovered botnet called Mega - D have far fewer nodes , but they are worth watching for a couple reasons .
For one , they are likely to get bigger over time .
And for another , their increasing sophistication is a good indicator of the direction professional bot herders are headed .
MayDay has also done a good job of flying under the radar .
Infected machines have a limited amount of time to connect to the command and control channel .
If the time stamp is more than a few hours old , the server returns an error message , making it hard for white - hat researchers and rival bot masters to perform reconnaissance .
And according Cox , the vast majority of the anti-virus products fail to detect at least some of the samples obtained by Damballa researchers .
( Symantec and Sophos , in postings here and here , question Damballa on this issue . )
There 's another reason why MayDay has managed to remain under cover until now : it is still relatively small .
At any given time , there are only " several thousand victims " infected , according to Cox .
[ digg - reddit - me ] I was listening to a podcast this morning and came across some comments that I am surprised have n’t gotten more attention .
Last Friday , March 7 , the Council on Foreign Relations hosted a discussion among top foreign policy advisors to Mr. Obama ( Susan Rice ) , Ms. Clinton ( Mara Rudman ) , and Mr. McCain ( Randy Scheunemann ) .
There ’s audio of the whole event here .
The event was n’t insightful , but the tensions between the campaigns kept it from being boring .
As you can imagine there were a few testy exchanges , including one where after Ms. Rudman told a rather large fib about Mr. Obama and NAFTA .
More on that later .
The most revealing comment was not on foreign policy – a matter on which all of the advisors remained rather bland – but on the Democratic primaries .
Mr. Scheunemann addressed Ms. Rudman :
Well , let me first address what Mara said about the experience and judgment .
Can I just say , please keep running those 3 a.m. phone call ads about who you want to answer the phone – ( laughter ) – because we like those .
That ’s right – a top McCain advisor was thanking a top Clinton advisor for softening up the likely Democratic nominee .
At this point , everyone paying close attention to the Democratic primaries has noticed that short of a huge stumble by Mr. Obama , he will be the Democratic nominee .
His leads in delegates , states , and the popular vote look insurmountable – and in the event he wins all of these categories , it seems extremely unlikely that the superdelegates will impose a different choice on the party .
Even after Ms. Clinton ’s best week in the campaign so far , she lost ground on Mr. Obama .
Yet Ms. Clinton has decided on a strategy which severely undercuts her party ’s nominee against his Republican opponent – and seems extremely unlikely to win her the nomination .
I ’m sure John McCain will call her to thank her after she concedes .
NAFTA
Less exciting , but still interesting is the other exchange I mentioned above was between Ms. Rice and Ms. Rudman .
( Although many people missed it , Ms. Rice refers to this story which broke last week indicating that the comments supposedly made by an Obama aide to the Canadian government were actually made by a Clinton aide .
Of course , Ms. Clinton ’s surrogates have continued to use this story to attack Mr. Obama ’s campaign as disingenuous , despite the fact that the Canadian government now reports that the campaign at fault was the Clinton ’s . )
Rudman :
To me , the bigger question is , again , in how you approach tough situations , how you approach tough issues , how you approach challenging discussions with both friends and adversaries .
And not only how you do it but how , frankly , the people who are working with and for you do it .
And that ’s where , I think , we are particularly dismayed to see what happened within the Obama campaign with their economic adviser because that was an example of just , you know , in however it played out , a perhaps lack of experience and how you communicated with a foreign government on a particularly delicate and sensitive issue … .
( Cross talk . ) Jim Hoagland ( moderator ) :
I ’m going to stop an argument that you two have already had or your candidates have had – ( laughter ) – I ’m going to go to a questioner right here .
Life is not fair .
( Laughter . )
Questioner :
Well , sometimes it is , and I ’d really love to – Hoagland :
If you ’d state your name and any affiliation .
Questioner :
My name is Rebecca Barnard , Goldman Sachs , formerly of Senator Biden ’s office .
I would just be very interested in hearing Senator Obama ’s response to that last point , because it has – ( laughter and applause ) – Hoagland :
The deck was stacked !
Rice :
Thank you , Rebecca .
( Laughter . )
As the Canadian government has repeatedly acknowledged and has now been amply reported in the press , Austan Goolsbee said nothing to the Canadian government that he or Senator Obama have not said many times in public .
And Mara , I think , in all fairness and with due respect , that needs to be clarified and acknowledged .
What he said is exactly what I just said , which is that when we revisit NAFTA , it is with the aim of putting binding labor and environmental standards into the core agreement .
Anybody who wants to see the memo that the Canadian government wrote reporting on their meeting can find it on the Internet .
You will find that that is exactly what Austan Goolsbee said .
You will also find that he made a general statement which was then taken out of context in the press reporting , which was that neither Senator Obama nor Senator Clinton nor the Democratic Party in general is protectionist .
We want to fix certain specific agreements .
What happened was the summary paragraph of the memo is – those of you who have seen cables know – was not reflective of the body of the conversation and indeed , the quotations or the statements , the characterizations of Goolsbee ’s statement in the body of the cable .
So the summary was distorted .
That was what was leaked to the press .
And the Canadian government has said it was n’t accurate and apologized .
And by the way , while we ’re talking about this , now the press is reporting that indeed not only was there a contact which we have now acknowledged and explained from Senator Obama ’s campaign that actually began with the Canadian government , not us , but in fact the Clinton campaign , at least that ’s what the reports are suggesting , initiated a contact with the Canadian embassy or government for the same purpose .
I have no idea if that ’s true .
There ’s been a lot of false reporting on this .
Hoagland :
Well , maybe Mara can respond to that .
Rice :
But let ’s be accurate .
Rudman :
No , I think that ’s been completely denied by the campaign .
There ’s no name – Rice :
Well , then , it ca n’t be true .
Okay .

WASHINGTON
It is a tribute to Hillary Clinton that even though , rationally , political soothsayers think she can no longer win , irrationally , they wonder how she will pull it off .
It ’s impossible to imagine The Terminator , as a former aide calls her , giving up .
Unless every circuit is out , she ’ll regenerate enough to claw her way out of the grave , crawl through the Rezko Memorial Lawn and up Obama ’s wall , hurl her torso into the house and brutally haunt his dreams .
“ It ’s like one of those movies where you think you know the end , but then you watch with your fingers over your eyes , ” said one leading Democrat .
Hillary got a boost from the wackadoodle Jeremiah Wright .
As a top pol noted , the Reverend turned Obama  in the minds of some working - class and crossover white voters  from “ a Harvard law graduate into a South Side Black Panther . ”
There has been a great debate going on in the comment sections these last few days .
I ’m not sure if the coming election is getting everyone fired up or is it the sound of crashing home prices that is getting everyone riled up ?
Regardless of who you are going to vote for the reality is , whoever inherits the Whitehouse come January of 2009 is going to face an economic downturn unlike anything we ’ve seen in multiple decades .
Sure , the politicians keep on smacking their lips saying , “ well , we are n’t sure we ’re actually in a recession ” while everyone with a pair of working eyes is seeing a drastically different reality .
We ’re getting so many mixed messages you ’d think we are living with a bipolar partner telling us they love us today only to smack us upside the head in the morning .
For example , first we get this sloppy across the board stimulus package rammed through with really no thought put into it .
Now , surveys are showing that anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of people are actually going to spend their rebates !
The rest is going to debt reduction and savings .
Great planning here .
$ 145 billion down the drain .
Then this week , we have the Whitehouse threatening to block the ability of judges to rewrite mortgages .
Of course , this has the massive support of lenders because a judge reworking a loan at today ’s current market prices would force a lender to eat their own toxic mortgage crap instead of buying time for a government bailout .
We already have caps being raised , reserve requirements being dropped , and big money lenders begging the government to offer a bailout .
And by the way , the two main players that have any remote chance of bailing out the housing market , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac just posted record quarterly losses .
This before we give them carte blanche and lower their reserves .
More excellent planning .
This higher risk will push up rates even higher !
Why do you think even as the Fed chops rates like Paul Bunyan , 30 year fixed rates are n’t moving ?
How much is this going to help if people do n’t really care and are simply walking away is yet to be seen .
No behavioral economic models factored that variable into equations .
As many of you know , I do pride myself in showing you the excesses of this housing bubble through our Real Homes of Genius series .
In fact , even in the days when the majority were smoking housing peyote , all I had to do was take a weekend drive and realize that something did n’t jive in sunny Southern California .
I do n’t get a kick out of seeing someone who bought within their means , has a modest mortgage ( $ 90,000 to $ 210,000 ) and has lost their job or is now unable to make the house payments .
Yet I do find myself shaking my head when someone purchases a 500 square foot box , slaps a granite countertop , puts on some faux faucets and expects to make a $ 50,000 profit for one month of work .
I have found homes that have fallen from 10 to nearly 50 percent in California when many said this would never be possible .
Well today I have to tip my hat to a keen eyed reader who found the biggest drop I have yet to see in California .
Today we salute you Oakland with the Real Homes of Genius Lifetime Achievement Award .
Real Homes of Genius – Oakland Style
If you have n’t noticed , this blog is niche focused on Southern California when we do our Real Homes of Genius series .
There have been a few issues that focused on the national housing bubble with overpriced homes in Florida and Washington D.C. being highlighted .
Today , our siblings up north show us the true excess of the housing hyperinflation .
This home is nestled in another multi-million dollar city of California , Oakland .
To appreciate the extent of this housing bubble , you really need to do a field trip .
Pack the family in the car and take them on a trip to the inner cities of Los Angeles and you ’ll find yourself realizing that something went completely awry when the median price for this region hit $ 550,000 .
Sure you can be myopic and assume Santa Monica and Brentwood equals all of Los Angeles County but reality is now coming into a collision with fundamentals .
Back to Oakland , this gorgeous 800 square foot home has seen a lot of action in the last few years .
In fact , just like digging up fossils from the past to realize that dinosaurs roamed the Earth , we can now dig up mortgage remains that show us that human nature is capable of unbelievable financial acrobatics .
Let us take a look at the sales history on this home :
Date Sale Price
Sep 03 , 1991 $ 45,000
Jan 20 , 2006 $ 407,500
Jun 26 , 2006 $ 450,000
May 24 , 2007 $ 310,250
You may be asking , so what ’s the big deal here ?
A drop of $ 139,750 is n’t unheard of and we ’ve had other examples that have shown steeper nominal drops .
The shocking part of this place is the current sales price which is , get this , $ 95,000 !
That ’s right folks this place has seen a …
78.9 Percent Loss in California
I have seen 40 and even 60 percent losses but nothing that approaches the 80 percent region .
You may be thinking that this is some sort of pricing gimmick but they did start the place out at $ 109,900 and reduced it shortly .
This by far is the highest percentage drop thus far in the housing bubble burst and playing pricing games in lower to middle income areas especially in California will get you absolutely nowhere in this market .
At the current price , this home might not be such a bad deal .
Local area rents go for $ 1,050 to $ 1,100 so you may even have some cash flow here .
Then again , I ’m not familiar with the details of this particular area of Oakland .
There are places in Detroit selling for the price of used cars but that still does n’t make it a wise deal simply because the local economy is in shambles .
Expect to see the unexpected in the next few years .
Today we salute you Oakland with our Real Homes of Genius Lifetime Achievement Award .

Illinois State Rep. Monique Davis never should have made her incendiary comments against atheists in the first place , but yesterday , she called Rob Sherman and apologized for her remarks .
Says Sherman on his website :
Yesterday , State Representative Monique Davis ( D - Chicago ) called me from the Floor of the Illinois House of Representatives to apologize for what she had said to me at last Wednesday ’s hearing of the House State Government Administration Committee .
Rep .
Davis had said , among other things , that atheism is dangerous to the progression of the State of Illinois , that children should not be allowed to know that my philosophy ( atheism ) exists , and that I had no right to testify to any Illinois legislative committee because the People of Illinois believe in God .
She concluded by ordering me to “ Get out of that seat ! ”
Some bloggers have asked what I said to instigate Rep. Davis ’ comments .
I was testifying about why the Governor ’s proposal to donate one million tax dollars to Pilgrim Baptist Church is unconstitutional .
Specifically , I was reading , in a very calm manner , from my laptop computer , the words in the March 4th “ Latest Update , ” which appear below and which explains why the proposal to give money to the church is unconstitutional .
Rep .
Davis said that she had been upset , earlier in the day , to learn that a twenty - second and twenty - third Chicago Public School student this school year had been shot to death that morning .
She said that it was wrong for her to take out her anger , frustrations and emotions on me , and that she apologized to me .
I told her that her explanation was reasonable and that I forgave her .
I also suggested that if she really was concerned about public school students dying needlessly , she should look into helping me to get passed legislation to get lap and shoulder seat belts on school busses that is pending in the House and in the Senate .
She thanked me for forgiving her and said that she would look into those two pieces of legislation .
Rep. Davis ’ apology was a direct result of the pressure put on her by the thousands of bloggers from around the globe who commented on the various news sites and the hundreds of people from around the world who contacted her office by telephone or e-mail .
Each and every one of you really did make a difference .
Your comments did n’t just go out into thin air and get forgotten about and ignored .
By each one of you taking the time to carefully craft your intelligent message , pressure built up on Rep. Davis .
Meanwhile , more pressure built as additional news outlets picked up the story , including the Countdown show with Keith Olbermann on MSNBC , which gave Rep.
Davis the Worst Person in the World award ; the Capitol Fax in Springfield , Illinois ; and a half - hour appearance on WTDY radio in Madison , Wisconsin .
Blogs and direct contact with the offending party really do make a difference .
They may not get read everywhere , but they are read by people who matter , so I thank each one of you for your efforts .
The reasoning as to why she made her remarks seems very shaky to me ( what do shootings have to do with atheism being a “ dangerous philosophy ” unless she wants to equate the two… which would be an even bigger mistake ) …
But it took a lot for her to apologize , and it was the right thing to do .
Kudos to Rep.
Davis for making the call to Sherman , even if it was about a week overdue .
Let ’s hope she never makes those kinds of attack statements again .
I ’m guessing she ’s learned her lesson .
And Rob is right — this story received plenty of ( well - deserved ) attention because it was spread from blog to blog and from blogosphere to mainstream media .
Remember that the next time you witness a similar incident .
If you raise your voice ( or your typing fingers ) , people will hear about your story .

Robert Fagles , the renowned translator of Latin and Greek whose versions of Homer and Virgil were unlikely best sellers and became fixtures on classroom reading lists , died on Wednesday at his home in Princeton , N.J. , where he was an emeritus professor at Princeton University .
He was 74 .
The cause was prostate cancer , said his wife , Lynne , to whom he had been married for 51 years .
Mr. Fagles translated Aeschylus and Sophocles , among other authors , but he is most famous for his versions of “ The Iliad , ” published in 1990 ; “ The Odyssey , ” in 1996 ; and “ The Aeneid , ” which came out in 2006 .
All were published by Viking .
He is one of very few translators to have taken on all three of the great classical epics  something that not even Pope attempted  and all three have sold millions of copies , both in print and in audio versions narrated by Derek Jacobi , Ian McKellen and Simon Callow .
Their success was due largely to Mr. Fagles ’s gifts as a writer .
He was not an exactingly literal translator but rather one who sought to reinterpret the classics in a contemporary idiom .
He once compared his job to writing Braille for the blind , and said that he imagined in a generation or two that someone would have to come along and re-Braille it .

Lights going out Towns and cities around the world are turning out the lights for an hour to highlight the threat of climate change .
Sydney was the first major city to begin " Earth Hour " , when at 2000 ( 0900 GMT ) , lights went out on landmarks like the Opera House and Harbour Bridge .
Some major Bangkok shopping malls were later plunged into darkness , while street lights in Manila turned off .
Toronto , Chicago , San Francisco and Dublin were among 27 cities due to follow suit at 2000 local time .
Critics have dismissed the event as a gimmick that will have little effect .
Australians marked Earth Hour by holding candle - lit beach parties , dinners and poker games , while traditional Aboriginal torchlight performances were also held .
And in New Zealand , thousands of homes and more than 100 business in Christchurch turned out the lights .
WWF
Thailand said the switch - off in Bangkok saved 73.34 megawatts of electricity , which would have produced 45.8 tonnes of carbon dioxide .
Public pressure
The initiative began in Sydney last year when an estimated two million residents took part , cutting energy usage by more than 10 % for the hour .

Organisers expect hundreds of towns and cities across the world to take part in the event and hope some capitals not officially involved , such as London and Rome , will mark the event by dimming lights on some landmarks .
In its own contribution , the Google web search engine is putting a dark background on its homepage .
Organisers insist the aim of Earth Hour is to show that communities care passionately about climate change and want to keep up the pressure on governments to act decisively .
Andy Ridley of the WWF , which is behind the initiative , says interest has been immense .
" We 're aware of villages in Norfolk in England that are doing Earth Hour and we 're aware of the big cities like Chicago and Sydney that are doing it , " he told the BBC .
Australia is one of the world 's worst per capita emitters of greenhouse gases and many believe recent droughts and floods are the result of man 's destabilising influence on the climate , the BBC's Phil Mercer reports from Sydney .
New Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has made the environment one of his priorities , signing up to the Kyoto Protocol on tackling climate change soon after he took office .

What are these ?
CNN ’s Anderson Cooper has an item about John McCain ’s wife that does n’t sound especially objective or neutral .
The headline reads , “ Can Cindy McCain really be that perfect ? ”
Seriously , that 's the headline .
She ’s always dressed in a killer suit and never has a hair out of place .
We went to Phoenix , where Cindy McCain grew up , to talk with those who know her best .
Good friend Betsy Bayless , a former Arizona secretary of state , says Cindy is a “ fun down to earth person with a great sense of humor . ”
She had a privileged upbringing .
Her father started one of the largest beer distributorships in the country and today Cindy is the Chairman of the Board .
The company is reportedly worth hundreds of millions of dollars .
Cindy graduated from the University of Southern California with a teaching degree and went on to become a teacher , but meeting John McCain changed all that .
They met before he was in politics at a cocktail party in Hawaii .
He is 18 years older than she is .
They apparently had instant chemistry .
John was separated from his first wife at the time .
About a month after his divorce , Cindy and John McCain got married .
Not to be picky , but this is incomplete .
John McCain was , as a factual matter , still married and living with his wife in 1979 while , according to The New York Times , “ aggressively courting a 25 - year - old woman who was as beautiful as she was rich . ”
( McCain then divorced his wife , who had raised their three children while he was imprisoned in Vietnam , and launched his political career with his new wife ’s family money . )
Now , one can certainly argue that McCain ’s infidelity is irrelevant .
One could also argue that McCain ’s adulterous relationship with the woman who ultimately became his second wife is none of the voters ’ business .
But if CNN is going to do a report on this , while touting Ms. McCain ’s “ perfection , ” the network should at least give the public the whole story .
The CNN report also briefly broached another awkward subject .
During that 2000 primary , she was painted as a drug addict .
It was n’t pretty .
Here ’s the back - story :
In 1989 , Cindy had a bad car accident and started taking prescription pain killers for her back injury .
Four years later , she was still addicted to pain killers .
Friends say her mother confronted her and she admitted her addiction , then immediately stopped taking the pills .
To be sure , I really do n’t much care about Cindy McCain ’s difficulties with pain - killer addition .
It ’s a problem that many people go through , and I ’m glad things turned out for the best for her and her family .
But , again , if CNN is going to do a report about Ms. McCain ’s “ perfection , ” and highlight various chapters of her adult life , it should n’t just brush past relevant details that may cast her in a negative light .
Here ’s a report the LA Times ran during the 2000 campaign .
Much has been made of allegations of possible youthful use of illegal drugs by Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush .
Meanwhile , his chief GOP opponent , Arizona Sen .
John McCain , has admitted that his wife not only illegally used drugs but walked away from criminal charges .
The McCains have worked to make Cindy McCain ’s addiction into a political asset–despite the fact that she stole the drugs from a charity she directed and used them while mothering four young children .
In 1994 , Mrs. McCain admitted that she had solicited prescriptions for painkillers from physicians who worked for an international charity that she founded , the American Voluntary Medical Team .
She then filled the prescriptions in the names of her staff .
There are two ways to react to this behavior .
According to the Betty Ford model , people can sympathetically respond to the oppressed and ignored wife of a busy politician who has bravely come forward to admit her overpowering addiction .
Mrs. McCain took this posture when she first tearfully confessed her addiction .
She and her husband repeated this performance in October on the NBC program “ Dateline . ”
The other possible public reaction is one of anger .
Americans are prosecuted every day for such drug use .
While most drug abusers purchase their drugs from street dealers , Mrs. McCain used her status as a charity director and senator ’s wife to cajole the drugs she wanted .
In fact , Mrs. McCain was investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration after the agency was approached by a former staff member of her charity .
The investigation resulted in no charges or prison time for her , and she entered a diversion program .
The CNN report on Ms. McCain being “ perfect ” pretends that this part of her past simply does n’t exist .
Low doses of the toxic gas responsible for the unpleasant odor of rotten eggs can safely and reversibly depress both metabolism and aspects of cardiovascular function in mice , producing a suspended - animation - like state .
In the April 2008 issue of the journal Anesthesiology , Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) reseachers report that effects seen in earlier studies of hydrogen sulfide do not depend on a reduction in body temperature and include a substantial decrease in heart rate without a drop in blood pressure .
" Hydrogen sulfide is the stinky gas that can kill workers who encounter it in sewers ; but when adminstered to mice in small , controlled doses , within minutes it produces what appears to be totally reversible metabolic suppression , " says Warren Zapol , MD , chief of Anesthesia and Critical Care at MGH and senior author of the Anesthesiology study .
" This is as close to instant suspended animation as you can get , and the preservation of cardiac contraction , blood pressure and organ perfusion is remarkable . "
Previous investigations into the effects of low - dose hydrogen sulfide showed that the gas could lower body temperature and metabolic rate and also improved survival of mice whose oxygen supply had been restricted .
But since hypothermia itself cuts metabolic needs , it was unclear whether the reduced body temperature was responsible for the other observed effects .
The current study was designed to investigate both that question and the effects of hydrogen sulfide inhalation on the cardiovascular system .
The researchers measured factors such as heart rate , blood pressure , body temperature , respiration and physical activity in normal mice exposed to low - dose ( 80 ppm ) hydrogen sulfide for several hours .
They analyzed cardiac function with electrocardiograms and echocardiography and measured blood gas levels .
While some mice were studied at room temperature , others were kept in a warm environment - about 98 º F - to prevent their body temperatures from dropping .
In all the mice , metabolic measurements such as consumption of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide dropped in as little as 10 minutes after they began inhaling hydrogen sulfide , remained low as long as the gas was administered , and returned to normal within 30 minutes of the resumption of a normal air supply .
The animals ' heart rate dropped nearly 50 percent during hydrogen sulfide adminstration , but there was no significant change in blood pressure or the strength of the heart beat .
While respiration rate also decreased , there were no changes in blood oxygen levels , suggesting that vital organs were not at risk of oxygen starvation .
The mice kept at room temperature had the same drop in body temperature seen in earlier studies , but those in the warm environment maintained normal body temperatures .
The same metabolic and cardiovascular changes were seen in both groups , indicating that they did not depend on the reduced body temperature , and analyzing the timing of those changes showed that metabolic reduction actually began before body temperature dropped .
" Producing a reversible hypometabolic state could allow organ function to be preserved when oxygen supply is limited , such as after a traumatic injury , " says Gian Paolo Volpato , MD , MGH Anesthesiology research fellow and lead author of the study .
" We do n't know yet if these results will be transferable to humans , so our next step will be to study the use of hydrogen sulfide in larger mammals . "
Zapol adds , " It could be that inhaled hydrogen sulfide will only be useful in small animals and we 'll need to use intravenous drugs that can deliver hydrogen sulfide to vital organs to prevent lung toxicity in larger animals . "
Zapol is the Reginald Jenney Professor of Anaesthesia at Harvard Medical School .

China suffered a propaganda own goal today when a state - organised media trip to Lhasa was interrupted by protesting monks who accused the government of lying to the outside world .
More than 30 monks at Jokhang Temple - the most sacred in Tibetan Buddhism - burst in on a briefing during the first foreign journalists tour since riots erupted in the Tibetan capital on March 14 .
Interrupting a speech about inter-ethnic harmony by the head of the temple 's administrative office , the lamas surrounded the journalists and said , " They are tricking you .
Do n't believe them .
They are lying to you . "
" They want us to crush the Dalai Lama and that is not right , " one monk told the Associated Press news agency , denying that Tibet 's exiled spiritual leader was responsible for the unrest .
The monks , who first spoke Tibetan and then switched to Mandarin so the reporters could understand them , said they were willing to risk arrest to speak out .
" It was an astonishing act of defiance , " said Callum MacLeod of USA Today .
" The monks hijacked the briefing .
They were desperate to get their story out - that they have no freedom , that 120 of them have n't been allowed to leave their dormitories since March 14 . "
Another reporter on the trip , Wang Che-nan , a cameraman for Taiwan 's ETTV , told Reuters that the incident lasted about 15 minutes , after which unarmed police took the Tibetans to another area of the temple .
China 's state - run Xinhua news agency noted that the media tour had been briefly disrupted by monks .
The incident will be an embarrassment to the government , which organised the trip to show that stability had returned to Lhasa and to emphasise the murderous behaviour of some Tibetan rioters .
The reporters have one full day in the city , where they will meet officials and victims of the arson attacks , beatings and other ethnic hate crimes .
According to the authorities , at least 22 people died in Lhasa , most of them Han and Hui Chinese who either burned to death in fires or were killed by members of the indigenous population .
Overseas Tibetan groups say almost 140 people died , many of them shot by the security forces in Lhasa and other areas of unrest in Qinghai , Gansu and Sichuan provinces .
It is impossible to confirm or disprove either figure because of tight media restrictions on the affected areas .
Chinese officials and many bloggers have criticised foreign media organisations for " misrepresenting " the riots as protests , for calling the police response a " crackdown " , for underplaying the ethnic violence , and for wrongly captioning pictures to cast the security forces in a bad light .
Public anger has manifested itself in online denunciations , hate mail and death threats to some organisations .
CNN briefly moved out of its office .
The Sunday Times was criticised in the state - run media for a comment article written by Michael Portillo that compared the Chinese communist party 's use of the Beijing Olympics this year to the German Nazi 's use of the Berlin Games in 1936 .
Sinusitis can be very painful
Around 90 % of people with sinusitis in the UK are prescribed antibiotics .
But an analysis of nine trials published in The Lancet shows the drugs make no difference even if the patient has been ill for more than seven days .
Sinusitis is very common - often occurring after colds or flu - with 1 - 5 % of adults diagnosed every year .
The infection of the sinuses - small air pockets inside the cheekbones and forehead - causes a high temperature , pain and tenderness in the face and forehead , and a blocked or runny nose .
Antibiotics really do n't look as if they work
Dr Ian Williamson
Several guidelines advise doctors to prescribe antibiotics only when the patient has been ill for seven to 10 days .
It has been thought that this length of illness may indicate a bacterial rather than viral infection which would be susceptible to antibiotics .
Not justified
The latest research , which looked at how long 2,600 patients were ill before they received treatment , found time of illness is not a good indicator of whether antibiotics will be effective .
Because of side - effects , costs , and the risk of resistance , antibiotics are not justified even if patients have been ill for longer than a week , the researchers concluded .
The figures showed 15 patients would need to be treated before one would be cured with antibiotics .
Study leader , Dr Jim Young , from the Basel Institute for Clinical Epidemiology in Switzerland , said : " If a patient comes to the GP and says they have had the complaint for seven to 10 days that 's not a good enough reason for giving them the antibiotic . "
He added it would be reasonable for GPs to advise patients to come back if symptoms got worse or went on for another week .
The National Institute for Clinical and health Excellence ( NICE ) published draft guidance this week advising GPs not to prescribe antibiotics or issue delayed prescriptions which patients can use if they do not get better .
Co-author , Dr Ian Williamson , a GP in Southampton and researcher at Southampton University , said sinusitis was a horrible condition and people expected to get antibiotics from their GP to help them .
" Antibiotics really do n't look as if they work .
" We have found that antibiotics are n't effective for sore throats and ear infections but sinusitis , which is similar , is the one that people are slightly more die hard about . "
Professor Steve Field , chair of the Royal College of GPs , said doctors had been working hard to reduce antibiotic use for sinusitis in recent years but there was probably still too many prescribed .
" This gives reassurance to GPs that even if patients have specific symptoms , it 's unlikely antibiotics are going to make a dramatic difference . "
He advised those suffering from the infection to relieve symptoms with steam , paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) and rest .
" You do n't need to see the GP unless you 've been ill for a week . "
One and a half million people die from TB every year
The man who has the XDR - TB strain is reported to have come to the UK from Somalia .
He is now in isolation at the Gartnavel General Hospital .
The " super strength " strain of the disease is extremely resistant to traditional antibiotics and has to be treated with a cocktail of drugs .
Doctors have said there is no risk to the general public .
This is the first case of its kind reported in the UK since the revised definition of XDR - TB was published by the World Health Organization in 2006 .
However , an earlier case in 2003 was retrospectively identified as XDR - TB .
The disease is prevalent in many other countries .
About half of XDR - TB cases are fatal .
It can take up to 18 months for an infected patient to recover .
We have taken very prompt measures to try and manage the chance of this person spreading the infection to others
Dr Jim McMenamen
Health Protection Scotland
XDR - TB needs to be treated with a combination of antibiotics to ensure that the treatment is successful in curing the patient and preventing transmission to others .
Tuberculosis spreads through close and prolonged contact with the infected person .
TB is a disease which usually attacks the lungs , but it can affect almost any part of the body .
A person with TB does not necessarily feel ill but the symptoms can include a cough that will not go away , feeling tired , weight loss , loss of appetite , fever , night sweats and coughing up blood .
Dr Oliver Blatchford , a public health consultant at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde , said XDR - TB is no more infectious that ordinary TB but does require different treatment .
Dr Blatchford added : " The contacts of this case are being screened in the same way as ordinary TB contacts and will be monitored closely to ensure that any further cases are identified early and treated quickly . "
Dr Jim McMenamen , a consultant epidemiologist at Health Protection Scotland , added : " I do n't think that there 's any risk to the general population because we have taken very prompt measures to try and manage the chance of this person spreading the infection to others . "
Nearly nine million people a year fall ill from TB and more than one and a half million die from it .
The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 500,000 people a year become infected with drug- resistant TB .
The housing crash currently in its infancy will soon grow up into an economy killing monster that the Federal Reserve has no weapon strong enough to defeat .
A housing crash is unlike a stock market crash in that there is no easy way out .
Let ’s take a walk back in time to the tech stock crash just 8 years ago and compare it to a housing crash .
Is A Housing Crash Worse Than a Stock Market Crash ?
The tech stock bubble crashed in the spring of 2000 , and the Fed then went on a rate cutting spree ending in June of 2004 .
The Fed dropped rates something like 15 times to stave off recession .
The tech stock bubble and crash could be managed said the Fed with an increase in liquidity to the economy in the form of cheaper money .
The banking industry helped him out by offer anyone with a pulse a mortgage flooding the economy with even more money .
And it worked … or did it ?
Note : Read Our Top Five Mortgage Complaints !
Beginning in 2004 the Fed reversed it ’s position and started raising interest rates leaving in it ’s wake an unprecedented housing bubble .
Home prices around the country rose further and faster than in history between 2000 and 2004 .
In some area , 100 % increases in prices were not unheard of .
For example , by a house in San Fransisco in 2000 for $ 300,000 by 2004 it could sell at $ 600,000 without a problem .
But by any measure , that is the quintessential definition of “ bubble ” .
For every bubble there is a corresponding “ crash ” .
And a crash in the housing market dwarfs a crash in the stock market in both scope and size .
Fast forward to today , January of 2008 , and we find the housing crash in full swing in most of the country … and it ’s still early in the cycle .
Foreclosures are up , existing and new home sales are down , and house inventories are exploding … forecasting that this is only the beginning in what could be the worst housing market since the Great Depression .
What Can Bernanke Really Do To Stem the Housing Crash ?
Unlike his predecessor , Mr. Greenspan , who only had a stock market crash to contend with which is less in scope and does respond to monetary manipulations , Mr. Bernanke has NO effective tool to deal with a housing crash .
Even though we must give Bernanke kudos for inventiveness when he decided to turn the central bank into a hedge fund to support the JP Morgan takeover of Bear Stearns this week ( the first time in history the Fed gave access to an “ investment bank ” rather than a “ depositor bank ” ) , it wo n’t stem the underlying problem of plummeting home prices .
The credit crunch combined with a housing crash is the “ perfect storm ” and Bernanke is no George Clooney .
This combination curtails any borrowing by consumers and since they pulled out of the stock crash by buying big screen TVs with home equity , we are dead in the water .
With consumer sitting on the sidelines , a recession … or dare I say depression is almost a guarantee .
The Housing Crash Domino Effect
The domino effect comes into play … housing bubble leads to housing crash , housing crash leads to credit crunch , credit crunch perpetuates housing crash and leads to lower consumption , lower consumption leads to layoffs , layoffs leads to even lesser consumption and perpetuates housing crash and tightening credit standards equals more credit crunch .
Once the dominoes start to fall … there is nothing anyone can do to stop it …
Not Bush ’s stimulus package and not the Federal Reserve cutting rates since there is no market left to inflate .
Only time will unwind this mess the banks and the Fed put us in .
Remember , it took Japan over 16 years to come out of their housing crash when Japan ’s rates went to zero and yet know one could or would borrow any money .
So the Federal Reserve lowering rates to stop the housing crash is like trying to put out a fire with an eyedropper .
The Fed taking on billions in subprime mortgage risk in the Bear Stearns takeout wo n’t help either …and all of us , including Mr. Bernanke , will soon see that first hand .
Prepare yourself …
Good Luck !

Vatican Says " Pollution " Is Now A Sin Posted by Pile ( 7830 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
In olden days , the deadly sins included lust , gluttony and greed .
Now , the Catholic Church says pollution , mind - damaging drugs and genetic experiments are on its updated thou - shalt - not list .
Also receiving fresh attention by the Vatican was social injustice , along the lines of the age - old maxim : “ The rich get richer while the poor get poorer . ”
In the Vatican ’s latest update on how God ’s law is being violated in today ’s world , Monsignor Gianfranco Girotti , the head of the Apostolic Penitentiary , was asked by the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano what , in his opinion , are the “ new sins . ”
He cited “ violations of the basic rights of human nature ” through genetic manipulation , drugs that “ weaken the mind and cloud intelligence , ” and the imbalance between the rich and the poor .
“ If yesterday sin had a rather individualistic dimension , today it has a weight , a resonance , that ’s especially social , rather than individual , ” said Girotti , whose office deals with matters of conscience and grants absolution .
It ’s not the first time that the Vatican has sought to put a modern spin on sin .
Last year , the Vatican took on the problem of highway accidents , issuing a kind of “ Ten Commandments ” for drivers against the sins of road rage , alcohol abuse and even rudeness behind the wheel .
Vatican officials , however , stressed that Girotti ’s comments broke no new ground on what constitutes sin .
On the environment , both Pope Benedict XVI and the late Pope John Paul II frequently expressed concern about the fate of the Earth .
During Benedict ’s papacy , Vatican engineers have developed plans for some Holy See buildings to use solar energy , including photovoltaic cells on the roof of the auditorium for pilgrims ’ audiences with the pontiff .

Conservatives around Mr. McCain counter that the other side ’s concerns are groundless because Mr. McCain is hardly an empty vessel who might succumb to the views of one group or another .
“ I would say his world view is so established that there is not a real battle going on , ” said Mr. Kagan , a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace .
“ A struggle over individual policies I could imagine , but the broad view , no .
People would agree on what McCain thinks .
This is not one of those situations like Bush all over again , with some titanic struggle going on between different factions . ”
Mr. McCain ’s advisers say he talks to realists like former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and former Secretary of State George P. Shultz .
Mr. Kissinger said in an interview that he had talked with Mr. McCain “ 15 to 20 times in the last year , ” including on a bus ride to a fund - raiser on Long Island .
“ In his speeches and daily pronouncements , I generally have no input , ” Mr. Kissinger said .
“ When we meet for lunch or dinner , or on the one or two occasions he has come to my home , we have had philosophical discussions .
When he calls me now , it will be mostly ‘ this event has happened and what do you think ? ’ ”
Mark Salter , one of Mr. McCain ’s closest advisers , called the concerns of the pragmatists “ utter nonsense ” and added that “ if John McCain on a given issue would talk to Bob Kagan about 30 percent as often as he talks to Henry Kissinger , for some people that is 30 percent too much . ”
Although the concerns at this point are focused more on access to Mr. McCain than on major policy differences , there have been some substantive areas of dispute .
Mr. Kissinger was said to have been disturbed by Mr. McCain ’s hardline attitude on Russia and the Russian president Vladimir Putin in the March 26 speech , viewing it as “ going far beyond anything that is necessary ” and “ something that he has got to be talked out of , ” according to someone who has spoken recently with Mr. Kissinger .
“ I have no comment on that paragraph , ” Mr. Kissinger said when asked directly .
“ You have to take my judgment from what I have written .
But I am a strong supporter of the senator . ”
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Turmoil and uncertainty over some of Wall Street ’s best - known investment banks has left some facing rougher market conditions that price them as riskier than developing countries or banks in volatile areas of the world .
The Wall Street sign is seen in front of the New York Stock Exchange January 22 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Chip East
Seen for decades as the power brokers in emerging market finance , Wall St firms ’ sudden underdog status points to the magnitude of fear surrounding them -- and perhaps a degree of confidence in the longer - term stability of developing countries .
Shortly before it received a Federal Reserve - backed rescue package late last week , the cost of insuring the debt of U.S. bank Bear Stearns BSC.N was higher than that for banks in Kazakhstan , one trader said .
On Monday , Bear Stearns was sold for a fraction of its value last week , further undermining global markets and confidence in what were once seen as some of the world ’s most reliable banks .
Early on Tuesday , before it posted results , the cost of protecting debt at Lehman Brothers was 443 basis points , or $ 443,000 a year for five years , to protect $ 10 million of debt with credit default swaps .
After Lehman Brothers LEH.N announced a fall in revenue but beat fearful expectations , its credit default swaps traded at 330 basis points according to Phoenix Partners .
One analyst said the bank ’s position appeared “ survivable ” -- but protecting its debt is pricier than protecting that of Turkey or Nigeria , traders say .
“ You could say Lehman is riskier than Nigeria , ” one trader said , asking not to be named .
“ But it ’s not a trade or a comparison people often try to make . ”
Turkish credit derivatives swaps were trading at 290/298 despite worries over a wide current account deficit and volatile politics .
Nigeria ’s are relatively illiquid but usually priced in the mid-200s , a trader said .
Goldman Sachs GS.N credit derivative swaps tightened to 160 basis points after the bank said its first - quarter earnings fell by half after recording more than $ 2.5 billion of losses on loans and other assets , but with robust trading helping the bank exceed market expectations .
But liquidity in global debt markets remains poor with the world ’s largest banks suspecting each other of not coming entirely clean on losses in the U.S. mortgage market , and many analysts saying more bad news is to come .
GREAT UNKNOWNS
“ I think with Africa people feel they know what they are dealing with , ” said Razia Khan , head of Africa economics at Standard Chartered in London .
“ In contrast , everything else is a great unknown . ”
That was despite investors being slightly put off by the speed at which Kenya -- a perceived oasis of East African stability -- collapsed into violence after a disputed election in December .
In credit derivative swaps markets , Turkey was trading at the same level as British bank HBOS HBOS.L , while healthy Brazil with credit derivatives swaps at 191/197 basis points was roughly level with Royal Bank of Scotland RBS.L , BB Securities said .
That was despite worries over Turkey ’s wide current account deficit and concerns over an attempt by the country ’s secular prosecutors to ban the ruling party from politics for allegedly trying to build an Islamic state .
“ It gives us some kind of snapshot of relative values , ” said BB Securities emerging markets research head Paul Hollingworth .
“ The fundamentals have become secondary to liquidity and technical factors . ” ”
“ Most banks in the UK and U.S. are trading well below valuations of top emerging markets banks , ” he said .
“ The Brazilian banking system has never had it so good .
It is a stark comparison . ”
The country suffering worst in the credit crisis is not usually seen as a byword for trouble -- Iceland , ranked top in the world according to United Nations human development indicators .
Its highly leveraged banks are laboring under a greater proportion of debt than almost any other bank and this sent the Icelandic crown to all - time lows on Tuesday morning and the credit default swaps of its leading Kaupthing Bank to 864 basis points .

Things were looking good .
My doctor had gone through the test results and told me I was perfectly healthy — except my breathing was a little shallow .
That did n’t surprise me .
I ’d been smoking for twelve of my 32 years , and my father died of lung cancer in his early fifties .
That ’s why I was having my first physical in five years : I ’d decided it was time to stop for good .
I ’d heard about Chantix , a relatively new drug from Pfizer that blocks nicotine from attaching to your brain receptors .
That way , you stop receiving any pleasure from cigarettes at all — even as the drug , snuggling up to those receptors the same way nicotine does , reduces withdrawal cravings and unleashes a happy little wash of dopamine to boot .
Wonderful things they can do nowadays .
My doctor wished me luck as he wrote out the prescription , telling me it was the single most important decision I ’d ever make in my life .
I had the medication that night , 35 minutes after dropping into Duane Reade .
While waiting , I gleefully chain - smoked Parliament Lights .
One of Chantix ’s big perks is that you can smoke for the first seven days you ’re on it ( most people take it for twelve weeks ) — more than enough time , I thought , to say good - bye to an old friend .
I swallowed my first pill the next day before work .
It was a beautiful fall morning , an almost obnoxiously cinematic day to turn over a new leaf .
But by the time I was halfway to the office , I started to feel a slight nausea coming on .
Of course , that is a common side effect , as are constipation , gas , vomiting , and changes in dreaming .
These five symptoms were emblazoned in a large font on the patient - information sheet .
My stomach settled as I finished my first cup of coffee .
I slipped into my boss ’s office , proudly announcing that I ’d just started taking Chantix .
“ You ’ve probably seen the commercial , ” I said .
A CGI tortoise races against a sprightly CGI hare , while a paternal voice - over reminds us that quitting smoking “ is n’t for sprinters … it ’s all about getting there ! ”
Clinical trials demonstrated a whopping 44 percent of patients were still off cigarettes after twelve weeks , the ad says .
The tortoise winks knowingly .
“ You know , I saw something about Chantix , ” my boss said , sounding vaguely concerned .
He tracked down the story on a CBS Website .
It was a sensational report on Carter Albrecht , a Dallas musician formerly with Edie Brickell & New Bohemians .
Albrecht had started taking Chantix with his fiancée , with seemingly dramatic side effects .
She claimed he had had bizarre hallucinations that worsened when he drank .
One evening , he attacked her , something he ’d never done before .
He then ran to his neighbor ’s house and kicked at the door , screaming incomprehensibly .
The neighbor was so panicked he wound up shooting Albrecht through the door , killing him .
I tried not to roll my eyes .
It seemed obvious this was nothing more than scaremongering — perhaps Big Tobacco had launched a spin campaign .
Millions of Americans were on Chantix .
Why focus on the negative ?
The next night , I nodded off listening to Radiohead ’s In Rainbows , feeling a little guilty that I ’d paid zero dollars for it .
I had a quick blip of a dream : A dark , inky fluid was jolting violently from the corners of my ceiling , zigzagging its way across the walls and wooden floor in jerky sync to the music .
It was only a dream , though it seemed more immediate and visceral than my usual fare , which I rarely remember after waking up .
The following night , things got even stranger .
I fell asleep with Bravo blaring on my TV and dreamed that a red - faced Tim Gunn was pushing me against the wall .
“ But I always thought you were so nice , ” I said .
By night four , my dreams began to take on characteristics of a David Cronenberg movie .
Every time I ’d drift off , I ’d dream that an invisible , malevolent entity was emanating from my air conditioner , which seemed to be rattling even more than usual .
I ’d nap for twenty minutes or so before bolting awake with an involuntary gasp .
I had the uneasy sense that I was n’t alone .
I smoked a cigarette , then tried going back to sleep .
But each time I started napping , I ’d dream that something increasingly ominous — carbon monoxide ?
Vampires ?— was sucking vital essence out of me .
Soon the clock on my desk read 3:20 a.m .
The most unsettling thing about sleeping on Chantix is that I never felt like I was truly asleep .
Some part of me remained on guard .
It was more like lucid dreaming , what I thought it might feel like to be hypnotized .
And it did n’t entirely go away come morning .
As I showered , shaved , and scrambled into clothes , I tried to shake a weird , paranoid sense that I ’d just been psychically raped by a household appliance .

On January 25 , Pfizer was able to share some good news : Japan — where 40.2 percent of all men still smoke — had green - lighted the manufacturing and marketing of its smoking - cessation drug .
But a few days later , the Chantix news was less cheering .
On February 1 , the Food and Drug Administration warned that Chantix , which had fourth - quarter sales of $ 280 million ( up from $ 68 million a year ago ) , could cause serious psychiatric problems , including suicidal thinking .
Several weeks earlier , Pfizer had independently changed the small - print booklet that accompanies all drugs to say “ All patients … should be observed for neuropsychiatric symptoms including changes in behavior , agitation , depressed mood , suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior . ”
( Previously the fine type had listed suicidal ideation as a rare adverse reaction . )
Now , after investigating an escalating number of complaints from doctors , patients , and health - care providers , the FDA was citing 34 suicides and 420 instances of suicidal behavior in the U.S.
Could n’t those cases have had to do with depression brought on by nicotine withdrawal , compensatory dopamine notwithstanding ?
Perhaps , said the agency , but some occurred among people who were still smoking while taking the pill .
Varenicline , Chantix ’s chemical name , was approved by the FDA in 2006 .
In development for over a decade , it is the first smoking - cessation medicine designed to work specifically on nicotine receptors , and at first glance , it would appear that it performed quite well in testing .
“ At week 12 , we looked at how many of the smokers did n’t touch a cigarette for the last four weeks of treatment , ” says Dr. Anjan Chatterjee , a medical director at Pfizer .
“ Forty - four percent . ”
But the tortoise in the ad does n’t say how patients fared later on .
“ About 23 percent still had n’t taken a puff from week 9 to week 52 , ” Chatterjee admits .
“ So the relapse rate was about 77 percent . ”
Still , that ’s not bad given that only 7 percent of smokers using the nicotine patch or gum are still off cigarettes after six months .
A total of 3,659 people were handpicked for the Chantix tests before it came on the market , an almost equal number of men and women , with an average age of 43 .
Nearly all were white , and the tests excluded anyone with a history of depression , panic disorder , heart disease , kidney or liver problems , alcohol or drug abuse , and diabetes .
These exclusions are n’t mentioned in the original “ Who Should Not Take Chantix ” part of the patient - information sheet , which merely states that the drug was n’t tested on people under 18 .
( Pfizer does tell patients they should let their doctors know if they have kidney problems or take insulin . )
For me , self - destructive fantasies began cropping up as cartoonish flights of fantasy — nagging chatter that became a little more concrete with every passing day .
Around 5 million prescriptions have been filled in the U.S. thus far .
So why would so many groups have been excluded from the testing , particularly for a drug with such potential mass appeal ?
“ In order to satisfy the FDA ’s criteria , we have to isolate all the different variables that could affect the outcome , ” says Chatterjee .
“ We ca n’t use very sick people or people who would not tolerate the drug . ”
An FDA spokesperson acknowledges this : “ It ’s not unusual to exclude people with major medical or psychiatric illnesses from some clinical trials , ” says Susan Cruzan .
“ When they tested the drug , the sample they chose simply is n’t representative of the people they ’re targeting , ” says Dr. Daniel Seidman , the director of Smoking Cessation Services at Columbia University Medical Center .
“ By excluding drinkers , you ’re artificially inflating your results , potentially .
I run a clinic , and two out of three [ smokers ]
I see have a psychiatric or mood problem .
None of these people would have been part of the original trials . ”
Public Citizen , a consumer - advocacy group , recommends that people not use Chantix — or most new drugs , for that matter — for seven years .
“ The first seven years are when problems will occur , ” says Dr. Sidney Wolfe , editor of Worstpills.org .
“ I remember hearing that argument , ” Chatterjee said , a few weeks before the FDA ’s new warning was issued .
“ And it ’s just so illogical .
If no one uses the drug for seven years , there ’s no one to report experiences at the end of seven years — so you ’re exactly where you were at the beginning . ”
While I was on Chantix , I did n’t scan Websites for news about it .
As my dream life continued plunging into strange and increasingly grotesque territory , I did think of Carter Albrecht a couple of times , but his story still seemed strictly outlier , a freakish occurrence .
As Chatterjee would explain , “ What we know of the story has only come from the press .
But the level of alcohol in his body was over three times the legal drinking limit in Texas .
In the controlled clinical trial , these kinds of changes in behavior were extremely rare , occurring almost as often as the placebo .
Based on the tests , we have no evidence of any kind of consistent relationship between Chantix and aggressive behavior . ”
Nor was the rate of depression any different between those taking Chantix and those on a placebo .

It was n’t until after I ’d stopped taking Chantix ( and switched to the patch ) that I would read about other cases , ones in which violence was directed inward rather than out .
In December , Omer Jama , a TV news editor in the U.K. , slashed his wrists and died , a few weeks after going on Champix .
( In the U.K. , Chantix is known as Champix , but the FDA objected to that name because it was “ overly fanciful and overstates the efficacy of the product . ” )
Shortly thereafter , a 36 - year - old welder hanged himself after completing a thirteen - week Champix regimen .
The term suicidal ideation looks pretty dead on the page , and if you were ever to experience such a symptom , it ’s unlikely you ’d pick up on it right away : “ Here comes that damned suicidal ideation again .
I had better call my physician . ”
For me , self - destructive fantasies slowly began cropping up as cartoonish flights of fantasy — nagging , almost imperceptible chatter that became a little more concrete and domineering with every passing day .
A week into my Chantix usage , I started to feel as if the city landscape had imperceptibly shifted around me .
Mundane details began to strike me as having deep , hidden significance .
The neon arch above McDonald ’s :
The lights blinked on and off in some sort of pattern , and I needed to crack the code .
One of my co-workers was messing with some papers :
What is he trying to imply with all that damned crinkling ?
Sitting in the subway : A man hurries to get inside .
His hand , holding a cup of coffee , gets stuck in the closing door .
I watch the hand wriggle .
The lid bursts open and steaming brown liquid hits the floor .
Fingers twitch and splay .
Coffee splashes in crisscrossing slats through the subway car .
It was a sign — something bad was going to happen .
It felt as if the essential barrier between reality and my imagination had eroded .
Was it because I was n’t getting enough R.E.M. sleep , so my dream life was rebelling , pouring into daylight , insisting to be attended to , one way or another ?
Meanwhile , smoking cigarettes had become an exercise in futility .
At work , I ’d put on my coat , head out , and light up — but there was no pleasure to be found , just a truly nasty taste .
One afternoon , I was typing away at advertising copy , and as I did so , I began to wonder how I had succeeded in fooling myself that my life had any sort of value at all .
Writing ?
Sure , it was what I ’d wanted to do since I was 6 — but at the end of the day , who cared ?
Maybe I should just go downstairs and leap in front of a tour bus .
Or launch my head through the computer screen .
All this seemed logical , but also weirdly funny , even at the time : I could see how crazy these impulses were , I could recognize them as suicidal clichés .
But I could n’t make them go away .
I ’d wake up with my clothes on , music blasting , and strange half - eaten sandwiches lying on the floor that I had no recollection of buying .
A few minutes later , they did , and I thought , Who was the depressed seventh - grade goth girl who had just muscled into my brain ?
I had n’t thought of suicide in any serious way since I was a teenager , and that had just been adolescent posturing .
I had no interest in killing myself — that ’s why I wanted to quit smoking in the first place .
Seidman , who has seen only a handful of patients on Chantix , says that “ one guy said he was having waking nightmares — actually experiencing nightmares while he was awake . ”
Last week , Dr. Mary O’Sullivan , the director of the Smoking Cessation Program at St. Luke ’s–Roosevelt ( who , like Seidman , says she has no ties with Pfizer ) , saw her first Chantix patient with “ suicidal ideation . ”
This “ was quite a shock , ” she says .
“ He had no background in mental illness , no underlying tendency to depression . ”
However , before then she had “ given it to well over 200 patients without a single side effect . ”
And she still believes that in terms of smoking cessation , “ it ’s been a miracle drug . ”
“ I have n’t seen suicide in patients , and I have n’t seen psychotic breaks , either , ” says Dr. Elliot Wineburg ( also no Pfizer affiliation ) of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine .
“ But as far as people successfully quitting smoking , I also have n’t seen great results . ”
My own , spectacularly unscientific survey of people on the drug was equally mixed .
“ It ’s getting easier by the day , ” says Nicholas Bullock , a 27 - year - old art director .
“ And the nausea has stopped as well . ”
Others said Chantix worked but left them feeling temporarily lobotomized .
Chris Masters , a 26 - year - old investment - firm manager , began experiencing “ daytime hallucinations .
In the car , I ’d feel my cell phone vibrate and roll the window down . ”
On the way to a wedding in the country , “ I decided I would plow into a herd of sheep if the street I was looking for did n’t come up soon . ”
And then there ’s Elizabeth McCullough , a 48 - year - old musician .
“ Chantix made me desperately suicidal , just crazy , ” she says .
“ I joked to my friends that Chantix was the ultimate quit - smoking drug , because when you kill yourself , there ’s no chance of relapse . ”
Since the FDA ’s announcement , those hare - and - tortoise commercials seem to have disappeared from the airwaves .
Is the voice - over being retooled ?
“ Yes , we ’re currently updating our branded campaign in order to reflect the changes to the label , ” says Francisco Debauer , a Pfizer spokesperson .
“ In the meantime , we ’ll be airing our unbranded ad in TV and print ” — the My Time to Quit campaign , which never mentions Chantix , but directs people to a Website that eventually leads to them to another , which does .
The drug would appear to be at a crossroads — perhaps the worst , rarest adverse reactions have been reported , perhaps more cases are still to come .
Pfizer says no lawsuits have been filed , but there are certainly injury lawyers hungrily putting up Chantix Webpages .
Smokers who want to quit are left with a more difficult decision — and the strong advice , if they do take the drug , to be on the lookout for mood changes .
After a few weeks on Chantix , I had managed to stop smoking altogether — but it did n’t feel like a triumphant turn of events .
I ’d become rather reclusive , avoiding calls from friends , and basically just shuttling back and forth between my office and my apartment .
I began to dread six o’clock ; it meant I had to walk through the streets again .
The subway was now out of the question ; it made me too nervous .
I stopped going to the gym , too .
I wondered whether Chantix was zapping my brain ’s pleasure - delivery system to such a degree that not only did I find no reward in cigarettes , but I also found no reward in socializing , exercising , writing , or any of my usual self - stimulating tricks .
I ’d pace the floor , sit on the bed , channel surf , pace some more , try to read , but the room had a stale , sinking feeling .
Maybe I should go and grab a drink — then at least I might be able to get some rest .
There was no warning against drinking while on Chantix , and even if there had been , I ca n’t say with any honesty that I ’d have adhered to it .
( I was n’t taking any other medication , though . )
But while I ’ve had my fair share of dark and drunken nights over the years , what I experienced on Chantix was something else altogether .
One evening , I steeled myself to go on a date , but after a few drinks with the guy , I abruptly burst into tears mid-sentence .
The crying jag lasted about 30 minutes , with the thought I ca n’t do this anymore looping through my head .
This was happening a lot lately , as though someone had spliced other people ’s thoughts into the tape whirl of my brain .
Another night , at an East Village bar , an older man in a trench coat caught my attention .
I chatted him up for a while , until I realized I was actually trying to go home with the shadow cast by a potted plant .
With alcohol in my system , I was somehow able to take this hallucination in stride : “ The man who got away … ” But that same evening ended with my taunting a skinhead who was improbably on the corner of Avenue A and 14th Street .
“ You must be lost , ” I snapped .
“ Are you looking for 1993 ? ” He ended up chasing me into a deli and saying he was going to murder me .
( The guy at the register called the cops and the skinhead fled , so I ’m fairly confident that he , at least , was real . )
I ’ve blacked out a handful of times before , but now it was n’t unusual to have five or six hours completely wiped out of my memory .
I ’d wake up with my clothes on , music blasting , and strange half - eaten sandwiches lying on the floor that I had no recollection of buying .
One morning , I found an unopened container of dental floss in my coat , as well as a batch of business cards from people whom I could n’t remember at all .
Later that day I received a text message : “ I had a great time meeting you … I could have talked to you for another two hours . :) ”
I have no idea who that person was .
Why did n’t I just stop taking the drug ?
I did consider it .
But there ’s something particularly dispiriting about quitting a medicine that ’s supposed to be helping you quit smoking .
I kept thinking that my body was still getting used to being on Chantix and off cigarettes , that I should wait until everything readjusted itself .
A few nights later , a friend invited me to a party and I reluctantly agreed .
I was still avoiding my closest friends for fear that they ’d notice changes in my behavior .
But maybe I ’d feel better if I stopped keeping to myself , for just a night .
At the party , I tried to impersonate myself as best I could , but I found myself staring and nodding blankly , actually having difficulty understanding what people were trying to say , and getting oddly touchy at offhand comments .
I was offered a piece of cake on a plate and a fork .
For the life of me , I could n’t figure out the puzzle .
How the hell were these pieces supposed to fit together ?
Fork .
Plate .
Cake .
What sort of maniac would present me with something like this at a party ?
I abandoned the cake for a vodka tonic , which I drank in silent rage .
I left without saying good - bye .
In the cab , I watched the city slash past the windows and was tempted to just throw open the door .
Running up the stairs to my apartment , I barely had the door open before the crying started again .
I sat on the edge of the bed , doubled over , and I felt severely ill , as though some freakish primal despair had finally been loosened from my stomach .
The sensation was more like vomiting than any sadness I ’ve ever experienced , and the shrieking sobs were punctuated by sudden jags of rage .
Like a spoiled teenager , I ’d suddenly uproot drawers from the bureau , push all the belongings off shelves with a sudden swat of the arm , smash a glass against the wall , and then the crying would take over yet again .
Meanwhile , the room seemed to be pulsing and reverberating around me , and my eye would keep zeroing in on objects — the television , the AC , a pair of shoes — and feel as though they were somehow buzzing with life and gleefully watching me endure the biggest meltdown I ’d ever had .
I had somehow ruined myself , and suicide seemed like a good way to avoid the embarrassment of this fact ’s being exposed .
The next morning , I called in sick to work and started cleaning up the considerable mess I ’d made .
I had to throw out a bunch of broken CDs , smashed glasses , torn clothes , ripped photographs , and the remaining boxes of Chantix from my medicine cabinet .
It was a good call , I think , the second most important decision I ’d ever make in my life .
When I was young , my parents had a copy of the National Geographic Atlas — the one that weighs around 30 pounds .
While the maps of Earth were fascinating , what held my attention were the pictures of the heavens .
Starting with the solar system , then the constellations , then our galactic neighbors , and finally a depiction of the known universe at the time , the Atlas was fascinating .
On Friday , Google — after showing everyone what the Earth , our moon , and Mars looks like — turned its attention to Google Sky .
While previously available as an addition to Google Earth , this new version is accessible through a web browser and makes sharing images as easy as sharing a hyperlink to a web page .
In what follows , we briefly review Google Sky while pointing out some of the most interesting and impressive destinations to be found ... in outer space .
Hands on with Google Sky
At first glance , Google Sky has an interface — and response speed — very similar to that of Google Maps .
There 's the familiar zoom level bar on the left , and one can scan via a set of buttons or by dragging the mouse around the screen .
I spent some time exploring the universe from my sofa , which is what Google Sky is all about .
To help you understand where you are and how to get where you might like to go , the Google Sky screen displays the right ascension ( RA ) and declination ( DEC ) of where your pointer is at all times ( RA and DEC are coordinates in the equatorial coordinate system that astronomers use to pinpoint astronomical bodies ) .
Along with simply being able to view our Universe , Google has added a trio of interesting overlays , each with user controllable transparency .
Understanding these is key to getting the most out of Google Sky .
For scientific inquiry , one can overlay the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) radiation or the infrared ( IR ) signature of the universe on top of the visual sky that you are looking at ; unfortunately this only worked at zoom levels above a certain point — often too big to see any of the features of individual bodies .
I imagine this is not a shortcoming of Google 's code , but a lack of detailed survey data .
The length scale of a single astronomical body ( galaxy , supernova , etc. ) compared to the entire universe is just too disparate .
Searching the heavens
Google naturally provides a search feature so you can find your favorite heavenly body by name or description .
I began my investigation by searching for some recent newsworthy astronomical events .
Sadly this is where the wheels start to come loose .
Going back over a sampling of recent Nobel Intent stories on dark matter , a " death star , " a supernovae of unprecedented size , and random X - ray surprises , I did n't find any relevant materials .
These objects were apparently all too obscure , which suggests that Google has much more work to do in mapping astral phenomena to the news .
Still , there 's plenty to check out .
Google Sky has a collection of pre-selected heavenly bodies for people to look at .
Starting with our Solar System , it had images of all the eight planets plus Pluto , although no mention of Ceres or Eris .
Next up in the pre-selectable feature set were the constellations .
Selecting this not only allowed one to see a given constellation , but it connected the dots — literally — between the various stars that each constellation is composed from .
This feature combined with the historical overlay is very interesting .
After the constellations , Google Sky has a large collection that it calls the " Hubble Showcase , " referring to images captured over the past few decades by the Hubble Space Telescope .
The images here are quite beautiful , but are nothing new .
Honestly I can find better images of each by , perhaps ironically , doing a simple Google image search for them .
When viewed in Google Sky , you essentially see a high resolution image of the selected body or phenomenon pasted onto the low resolution surrounding star field .
Each has a pop up box with information and a link to learn more about the image or object .
After the Hubble collection , there is a category for what they term " Backyard Astronomy , " which is really a collection of images of approximately 100 different galaxies .
Seeing the invisible
Up to this point , all the images shown have had one thing in common : they are in the visible light spectrum .
Visible light only shows us a small picture of the entire universe ; non-visible spectra such as ultraviolet ( UV ) , infrared and X - ray hold a whole other world of information .
Here is where Google Sky becomes very cool .
There are three more sections that highlight fantastic images from the Chandra X - Ray Observatory , the GALEX Evolution Explorer ( UV ) , and the Spitzer Space Telescope ( IR ) .
What makes these very cool is that under each selected body there is a slider that will change the displayed image back and forth between the visible and invisible spectrum .
For instance , if one looks at Cassiopeia A as it would be seen in the visible spectrum , you would see a small amount of hot gas .
However , if you look at its X - ray spectrum , far more information can be gleaned — in fact the X - rays observed from this supernova remnant offered up clues as to the origin of high energy cosmic rays .
Similarly interesting things can be seen using IR and UV — in the visible spectrum , very little of interest can be seen , but outside what humans can see without the aid of technology lies a plethora of interesting dynamics .
However , it must be pointed out that the zooming functionality does n't work so well when moving between two different spectra .
If one image is not sized similarly to the other , the function ceases to work , and you will only see one spectrum regardless of what you do with the slider .
The Top 10
The following is a list of 10 of the best images I found while using Google Sky .
This is not meant to be an objective list , but I would argue that these are all places not to be missed if and when people visit the Universe :
If you ever want to see the beginning of a galactic
collision , be sure to visit the outskirts of NGC2207 .
collision , be sure to visit the outskirts of NGC2207 .
While most likely seen before , The
Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula are one of Hubble's
crown jewels — be sure to look at their X - ray spectrum as well for
hidden clues as to new stars forming .

For things that go ( or went ) boom , have a look at Chandra's
images of Kepler's
Supernova Remnant , and the remnant of supernova G292.0+1.8 .
Note that both are basically invisible in the visible spectrum .

Note that both are basically invisible in the visible spectrum .
Since the majority of our readers reside in the northern hemisphere , I suggest having a look at something you will never see here in the night sky : the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy is quite a sight .
While the CMB represents the earliest views we have of the universe , it is worthwhile to check out the galaxies furthest from us , taken courtesy of Hubble 's Deep Field imager .
Finally , check out a pair of nebula , the Crab
and Rosette ,
that show their colors in the infrared spectrum courtesy of Sptizer .
In the end , Google Sky is a fun and educational tool .
The ability to view astronomical bodies in various spectra is by far the coolest feature , and I encourage readers to check it out .
Going into this , I had hoped for a free - wheeling romp around the universe ; what I got was a guided tour at the local science museum .
While not bad , it fell short of my hopes .
I do encourage fans of astronomy to look into it , if only to perhaps discover something new on the ' pre - selected ' menus .
Just keep in mind that for just about every highlighted body , I was able to find better images faster elsewhere on the web .

Convicted Marine speaks about murder of Iraqi civilian David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday August 10 , 2007
Print This Email
This A marine acquitted of killing an Iraqi civilian but found guilty on related conspiracy charges was released on Friday after his sentence had been reduced to time served by a military jury composed entirely of Iraq war veterans .
Corporal Marshall Magincalda was one of a group of marines that kidnapped a man from an Iraqi villages , bound and executed him , then tried to cover up the crime by creating the appearance of a firefight with an insurgent caught planing a bomb .
The prosecutors had asked for a ten - year sentence , while the defense had argued in extenuation that because Magincalda is a devout Christian he was reluctant to challenge his squad leader .
Magincalda spoke to the Associated Press about the crime , saying , " I knew that what we were doing was n't the right way to do things , but I did n't know that my activity would be considered criminal . "
" My sergeant 's here , he 's telling me this is the plan , this is what he wants done , " said Magincalda .
" I do n't agree with shooting the guy , even though he 's telling me he 's a bad dude and we have , you know , a lot of ... intelligence to suggest that that whole village was bad at that time . "
" I 'm upset with my actions over there for not stopping what happened , " Magincalda continued , " but at the same time ... I do n't think you guys understand what 's going on over there .
This is a war .
...
This is my third combat tour .
I 've killed people .
It never feels good to do that , but you have to believe that you 're doing it for the right reasons .
... I 'm always going to question , because we do n't know who this man was . "
" I feel a little guilty because of the way we conducted ourselves out there , " concluded Magincalda .
" I have freedom now ... but also , I take it with a heavy heart because I still have my brothers that are still in jail for doing their job . "
Magincalda's parents ' website refers to their son as " a Hero to Our Country " and accuses the military of charging the squad members as the result of " intense ( and highly questionably ) interrogation by the N.C.I.S. ( Naval Criminal Investigation Services ) " and of holding the eight men " under Maximum Security , Solitary Confinement , treated worse than the United States detainees currently in Gitmo ! "

THE REAL PRESENCE CHRIST IN THE EUCHARIST
Eucharistic Miracle Lanciano , Italy 8th Century A.D.
Ancient Anxanum , the city of the Frentanese , has contained for over twelve centuries the first and greatest Eucharistic Miracle of the Catholic Church .
This wondrous Event took place in the 8th century A.D. in the little Church of St. Legontian , as a divine response to a Basilian monk 's doubt about Jesus ' Real Presence in the Eucharist .
During Holy Mass , after the two - fold consecration , the host was changed into live Flesh and the wine was changed into live Blood , which coagulated into five globules , irregular and differing in shape and size .
The Host - Flesh , as can be very distinctly observed today , has the same dimensions as the large host used today in the Latin church ; it is light brown and appears rose - colored when lighted from the back .
The Blood is coagulated and has an earthy color resembling the yellow of ochre .
Various ecclesiastical investigation ( " Recognitions " ) were conducted since 1574 .
In 1970 - '71 and taken up again partly in 1981 there took place a scientific investigation by the most illustrious scientist Prof. Odoardo Linoli , eminent Professor in Anatomy and Pathological Histology and in Chemistry and Clinical Microscopy .
He was assisted by Prof. Ruggero Bertelli of the University of Siena .
The analyses were conducted with absolute and unquestionable scientific precision and they were documented with a series of microscopic photographs .
These analyses sustained the following conclusions :
The Flesh is real Flesh .
The Blood is real Blood .
The Flesh and the Blood belong to the human species .
The Flesh consists of the muscular tissue of the heart .
In the Flesh we see present in section : the myocardium , the endocardium , the vagus nerve and also the left ventricle of the heart for the large thickness of the myocardium .
The Flesh is a " HEART " complete in its essential structure .
The Flesh and the Blood have the same blood - type : AB ( Blood - type identical to that which Prof. Baima Bollone uncovered in the Holy Shroud of Turin ) .
In the Blood there were found proteins in the same normal proportions ( percentage - wise ) as are found in the sero - proteic make - up of the fresh normal blood .
In the Blood there were also found these minerals : chlorides , phosphorus , magnesium , potassium , sodium and calcium .
The preservation of the Flesh and of the Blood , which were left in their natural state for twelve centuries and exposed to the action of atmospheric and biological agents , remains an extraordinary phenomenon .

It appears thus that the Flesh and the Blood in Lanciano belong to AB blood group .

The profile of serum fractions is normal and superimposable to that of a fresh serum sample .

After seeing me play a little of portal my wife liked the look of the Aperture Science Enrichment Center computer cases .
She asked if I could make our home server / media PC to look like it .
I agreed ( gentlemen , never argue with a pregnant woman ) even though I was planning on getting some work done on my Delorean case over the holidays .
Anyways ... some start picsGot the mouse done .
I managed to get the ASEC symbol on there by using Parafilm ... any labtech out there will know and love this stuff .
Its like thick saran wrap but stretches .
Worked like a charm .
here is what I am starting with .
The wife thinks it is rather ugly .
I think its fine but nothing special .
This is the 4th build in this case .
The keyboard to start with : I finished most of the keyboard today but need to color the keys that need to be colored .
I got a free piece of 8 " diameter PVC pipe for the project .
That will go on top .
I also did some bondo work on the case sides because they need to be flat ...
The dvd drive will be placed on its side and a button needs to be added at the bottom .
This is nothing special ...
Just thought I would share .
The writer is working on his latest book
Exclusive interview
The creator of the Discworld series was diagnosed with a rare early - onset form of the disease in December .
Pratchett , 59 , announced the pledge of about £ 494,000 at the Alzheimer 's Research Trust annual conference .
Telling leading dementia specialists of his determination to find a cure , he said : " I intend to scream and harangue while there is time . "
Personally , I 'd eat the arse out of a dead mole if it offered a fighting chance
Terry Pratchett
There are 15,000 people in the UK with early - onset dementia , which strikes under the age of 65 years .
Mr Pratchett has a rare form of the disease called posterior cortical atrophy , in which areas at the back of the brain begin to shrink and shrivel .
He says he is starting to notice its effect on him .
" I 've given up my driving licence because I did n't feel confident driving .
And if I 've got something inside out , it 's a little bit puzzling getting it the right way round again . "
He added : " The curious thing is that writing goes on , although the typing does n't . "
Mr Pratchett is paying for the Alzheimer 's drug Aricept because the NHS says he is too young to get it for free .
Lack of funds
The author told the conference he is prepared to go to extreme lengths in order to beat the disease .
He said : " Personally , I 'd eat the arse out of a dead mole if it offered a fighting chance .
" I am , along with many others , scrabbling to stay ahead long enough to be there when the cure comes along .
" Say it will be soon - there 's nearly as many of us as there are cancer sufferers , and it looks as if the number of people with dementia will double within a generation .
" In most cases , alongside the sufferer you will find a spouse suffering as much .
" It is a shock to find out that funding for Alzheimer 's research is just 3 % of that to find cancer cures . "
In total , an estimated 700,000 people in the UK have Alzheimer 's disease .
However , the Alzheimer 's Research Trust estimates that just £ 11 per patient is spent annually on research into the disease - compared with £ 289 for each cancer patient .
Rebecca Wood , chief executive of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said the trust currently had to turn down two out of every three research projects due to lack of funds .
She said : " Whilst we were deeply saddened to learn of Mr Pratchett 's diagnosis , we are delighted that he has chosen to speak out about his experiences with Alzheimer 's disease , to raise awareness about its impact and the desperate need for more research .
" Research is the only way to beat this disease and help people like Terry - to prevent them losing their thinking skills and keep them doing the things they love . "
Germany 's Tired Graveyards A Rotten Way to Go ?
Strange as it may seem , the dead have quit rotting in German cemeteries -- they are turning into wax - like corpses .
Will the use of burial chambers solve the problem ?
Or is extensive soil reconditioning the only viable alternative ?
Greenwich
AMID this holiday season , food pantries in lower Connecticut are reporting a surge in the number of residents seeking a decent meal .
Some food providers in Fairfield County  from well - heeled towns like Greenwich to more urban areas like Stamford and Norwalk  say the demand is twice that of last year .
“ I have had to turn people away , ” said Joyce Gumbus , who oversees the 164 Wilson Memorial Food Pantry in Stamford .
The pantry is providing groceries for up to 400 people a week , compared with 200 a week last year , Ms. Gumbus said .
“ There were times I went home and wanted to cry , ” she said .
Ms. Gumbus is not alone .
Kate Lombardo , executive director of the Food Bank of Lower Fairfield County , said the 100 - plus agencies that receive food through her organization were reporting higher numbers than ever .
In Norwalk , for example , the Christian Community Action food pantry , open five mornings a week , Monday through Friday , often draws 30 to 35 families a day , many more than its limit of 24 families .
Three years ago , the average was 15 families a day , said its director , Christi Pope .

Two questions :
What the hell are kids eating in France ?
[ Postscript : readers have noted in the comments that this first video was actually in Mexico , though some also claim Brazil . ]
If you could have the physical capabilities of any athlete in the world , who would you choose ?
I might opt for another French lad named Junior .
I used to breakdance ( at about 1:40 of this video ) , but he is superhuman .
The clip below is from the Red Bull BC One competition of 2004 .
Be sure to watch the whole thing or jump to 2:40 — you wo n’t believe the move in the last five seconds …

Medine 's raps set out to sell Islam to French society
Medine was here - hunched into a parka against the chill sea breeze - to practise in the municipal dance hall .
He was brought up in the bleak tower blocks that overshadow the place , and was once a member of the disenchanted Muslim youth who preached to French society about its decadence and immorality .
He was named after the Muslim holy city of Medina .
Now his CDs and live performances send a different message - the offer of a new deal , and full participation in a secular society , and of a readiness to compete for success in a free market and liberal democracy .
We reached the dance hall up a stained concrete staircase , off a plain of concrete slabs , designed to engender a sense of community but today empty and colonised by weeds .
The community centre 's grey walls are decorated with thin lines of yellow tiles and the mirrored hall is light and warm .
But the whole place seems to belong to a long - abandoned social strategy , its occupants half - way through moving out .
' Common values '
Medine - whose rap is more pleading than angry - is also part of a generational shift .
I 've decided to talk about some of my values in my album - but it's not to say that my religion is best , or to say ' join my religion '
Medine
Burly , crew- cut and bearded , Medine faces Mecca to pray at the set hours and sticks to a regime of Muslim clean - living .
His raps set out to " sell " Islam to French society .
But he does n't emphasise Islam 's religious dogma , stressing instead what he says are the universal principles it shares with Western society .
" I think that in all religions today , there are common human values " , says Medine .
" I do n't think that sharing is unique to Islam , or that generosity is unique to Catholicism , or love is unique to Judaism .
" I 've decided to talk about some of my values in my album , but it 's not to say that my religion is best or to say ' join my religion ' .
Not at all . "
Marketing Islam
Economic competitiveness and artistic success are the hallmarks of the new Muslim elite .
Medine 's office in the ground - floor flat of another tower - block is equipped with computers and stuffed with merchandise , mostly clothes .
They are trying to promote an Islamic identity - but also an ethic of solidarity , charity , responsibility for each other
Amel Boubekeur
Islam series : Radical rethink
Amel Boubekeur , of the School of Social Studies in Paris , has named the movement " cool Islam " .
She says it combines business and performance to promote Islam , but on French society 's terms .
Making money is now an important mark of success to a generation whose parents were suspicious of wealth .
But their businesses and performances , whether rap , song , theatre , television or comedy , also promote Islamic ethics .
" They are trying to promote an Islamic identity , but also an ethic of solidarity , charity , responsibility for each other , " Ms Boubekeur says .
" They use products in order to make a positive contribution to society . "
Ms Boubekeur says " cool Islam " is being led by a generation which , unlike their parents , have accepted that they are in France to stay .
Unicite 's clothes extol values such as friendship , charity and justice
But for all their willingness to contribute , to participate , there is friction with an aggressively secular state .
' Proud to be Muslim '
The leaders of the new Islam want to be acknowledged as both French and Muslim .
That certainly goes for the staff of Unicite - a Muslim company whose name underlines the oneness of God .
Three young Muslim men distribute clothes from a chilly garage in a house on the outskirts of Paris .
The clothes - T - shirts , shorts , baseball caps - bear Islamic symbols , classic Arabic script , a childlike depiction of a hand making a Muslim blessing .
But more importantly , the messages they bear emphasise the need for values - not so much Muslim values , but any values in an increasingly godless society .
" Those values we want to show are coming from Islam .
They are human values that everyone - a Muslim and a non-Muslim can recognise , " the company 's director Thierry Roseau says .
" Values such as friendship , charity , justice and so on .
So , the first thing we want is for Muslims to stop hiding and to be proud of what they are . "
Embracing the West
There 's nothing furtive about Zahya , a young Muslim woman trying on wedding dresses , among the profusion of dress shops in the streets around the Gare du Nord in Paris .
Like many women , Zahya intends to wear a white dress for her wedding
Zahya 's marriage will be conducted by an imam , but the rest of her wedding will be as Western as her everyday life .
" We go to the cinema , we go to night clubs , we party " , Zahya says with an edge of defiance .
" We do the things everyone else does - and more and more openly .
Now in the year 2008 , we live according to the moment .
" Everyone wears white dresses for their marriage .
Just like all other women , I want to wear a white dress . "
But perhaps more significant than young Muslims ' embrace of secular French society is that the religion itself may also be moving towards Western liberalism .
Imams such as Tariq Oubrou are thinking the unthinkable - and suggesting that only by becoming a Western religion can Islam allow its followers to thrive in European culture .
We have to take a fresh approach , and ask how the Koran would have revealed itself in this time and place , in this culture
Imam Tariq Oubrou
He presides over a conventional - looking mosque , rows of men , mostly Arab in origin , listening silently as he preaches , and moving to pray in unison .
But in an upstairs office dominated by books heavily embossed in classic Arabic , what he says is revolutionary .
The new Islam needs to take account of Western philosophy and theologians , even Catholic and Protestant thinkers , he says .
He accepts that it will mean revisiting Islamic texts - including the Koran - and reinterpreting them in a way that fits the modern era .
" We 're living in an evolving geopolitical climate , therefore we have to have a dynamic approach towards our texts " , says Imam Oubrou .
" We can't afford to read our texts to the letter in a static way .
We have to take a fresh approach , and ask how the Koran would have revealed itself in this time and place , in this culture - and then apply this new model to our everyday lives . "
The idea is being echoed elsewhere in the Muslim world , especially in Turkey .
A formal revision of the Hadith - the sayings of Muhammad - is well advanced in Turkey , and Muslim women in the West have been pushing for equal status with men .
It does n't mean giving up on faith , or abandoning a Muslim identity .
In France that much is evident from the wild applause live audiences give Medine when he demands a religious identity for French Muslims .
People such as Imam Oubrou and Medine insist that however radical Islam 's adaptation to contemporary culture , it will preserve a kernel of uncompromising , permanent Muslim belief .
They say European societies need to let it flourish if they are to win the bigger prize of a renewed , reinterpreted Islam no longer at odds with a secular West .
The blend is made from two rare coffee beans
Would you drink it ?
A gourmet coffee blended from animal droppings is being sold at a London department store for £ 50 per cup .
Jamaican Blue Mountain and the Kopi Luwak bean are used to create Caffe Raro which is thought to be the most expensive cup of coffee in the world .
Kopi Luwak beans are eaten , then passed , by the cat - like Asian palm civet , and sell for £ 324 a kilogram .
All profits from sales of the coffee at Peter Jones in Sloane Square in April will go to Macmillan Cancer Support .
Ripest berries
Asian palm civets , which live in the foliage of plantations across south - east Asia , are said to pick the best and ripest coffee berries .
Enzymes in their digestive system break down the flesh of the fruit before the animals expel the bean .
The beans are then collected from the plantation floor by workers who wash away the dung and roast them .
David Cooper , who created the blend , said : " These rare coffees have been slowly hand roasted for around 12 minutes to ensure that we maximise the potential of each coffee .
" The final roast colour is quite dark to ensure that the espresso is perfect for a smooth latte or cappuccino . "
Now obviously , before proceeding here you 're going to want to find the largest grain of salt you can locate and keep it nearby .
According to SEfanatics , a page in an issue of Sony Magazine ( an office favorite over here ) makes passing mention of a " PSP - Style phone " which is supposedly in development , then casually suggests the device could be " in shops as early as February . "
Of course , we 've been hearing hushed conversations about this topic for some time now , though it does strike us as slightly odd that it 's referenced in what is essentially a multi-page Sony advertisement .
Sure , it 's possible that something like that patent we recently saw could be headed our way -- obviously the company is still capable of throwing a few curve - balls in our direction , though we 're going to need to little more evidence than this to start cracking open our piggy banks .

The odometer of a low emission hybrid electric test vehicle today reached 100,000 miles as the car circled a track in the UK using the power of an advanced CSIRO battery system .
The UltraBattery combines a supercapacitor and a lead acid battery in a single unit , creating a hybrid car battery that lasts longer , costs less and is more powerful than current technologies used in hybrid electric vehicles ( HEVs ) .
“ The UltraBattery is a leap forward for low emission transport and uptake of HEVs , ” said David Lamb , who leads low emissions transport research with the Energy Transformed National Research Flagship .
“ Previous tests show the UltraBattery has a life cycle that is at least four times longer and produces 50 per cent more power than conventional battery systems .
It ’s also about 70 per cent cheaper than the batteries currently used in HEVs , ” he said .
By marrying a conventional fuel - powered engine with a battery to drive an electric motor , HEVs achieve the dual environmental benefit of reducing both greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel consumption .
The UltraBattery also has the ability to provide and absorb charge rapidly during vehicle acceleration and braking , making it particularly suitable for HEVs , which rely on the electric motor to meet peak power needs during acceleration and can recapture energy normally wasted through braking to recharge the battery .
Over the past 12 months , a team of drivers has put the UltraBattery to the test at the Millbrook Proving Ground in the United Kingdom , one of Europe ’s leading locations for the development and demonstration of land vehicles .
“ Passing the 100,000 miles mark is strong evidence of the UltraBattery 's capabilities , ” Mr Lamb said .
“ CSIRO ’s ongoing research will further improve the technology ’s capabilities , making it lighter , more efficient and capable of setting new performance standards for HEVs . ”
The UltraBattery test program for HEV applications is the result of an international collaboration .
The battery system was developed by CSIRO in Australia , built by the Furukawa Battery Company of Japan and tested in the United Kingdom through the American - based Advanced Lead - Acid Battery Consortium .
UltraBattery technology also has applications for renewable energy storage from wind and solar .
CSIRO is part of a technology start - up that will develop and commercialise battery - based storage solutions for these energy sources .
Bad blood may impact on children
A University of Rochester study , reported by New Scientist , found sickness levels were higher in children of anxious or depressed parents .
It also found links between stress and immune system activity in the children .
A UK scientist said children were " highly resilient " , and urged parents not to worry about the findings .
I believe that children are highly resilient , and their systems are sufficiently robust to cope with this
Dr David Jessop
Bristol University
It has long been known that stress can cause immune system changes that make a person more prone to infections and other illnesses .
However , the new study , first published in the journal Brain , Behavior and Immunity , is the first to provide evidence that the problem can be transmitted from parent to child .
The researchers , led by Dr Mary Caserta , followed the parents of 169 children over a three - year period , with the parents recording instances of childhood illness , before undergoing six - monthly psychiatric evaluations .
The total number of illnesses was significantly higher in the children of parents with higher levels of " emotional stress " .
In addition , immune cells in the blood of the children was measured , and those with more stressed parents had raised levels .
The researchers conceded that allowing parents to measure the illness in their children could skew the results , as over - anxious parents were more likely to record higher levels .
However , they said that the findings still strongly suggested a connection between parental stress and children 's health .
Stress relief
Dr David Jessop , a researcher in stress and health at Bristol University , said that longer - term studies were needed to measure both the immediate impact of the stress , and how children recovered in periods of less parental anxiety .
He said that it would be wrong for the research to worsen the plight of parents already suffering from stress .
" The 64,000 dollar question is , once this stress is alleviated , do the children 's immune systems return to normal , or are they scarred for life ?
" I believe that children are highly resilient , and their systems are sufficiently robust to cope with this .
" Although it is a good study , parents should not let it worry them unduly . "

Political Pseudoscience
Matthew B. Crawford
In The Flight from Reality , Ian Shapiro casts a critical eye upon important trends in the social sciences , political science in particular .
He finds the discipline too method - driven , and makes a case for realism — that is , for letting research questions flow from real problems that present themselves to political actors , rather than from the availability of particular methods .
He uses the metaphor of flight to describe a common form of disconnectedness .
To fly is to feel a heady sort of freedom and maneuverability , a feeling that may become more absorbing for the flier than whatever is taking place on the ground far below .
According to Shapiro , such disengagement has become increasingly characteristic of the human sciences .
His most damning arguments are directed against those disciplines that , following economics , have “ modeled themselves on physics — or at any rate on a stylized version of what is often said to go on in physics . ”
Here we find “ a perverse sense of rigor , where the dread of being thought insufficiently scientific spawns a fear of not flying among young scholars . ”
The perversity of this sense of rigor lies in the fact that it is measured not by genuine sensitivity to human experience , but rather by how far one goes in developing a “ model ” that allows for the display of mathematical prowess .
Such methods generally require fateful simplification .
For example , if one assumes that human beings are interested solely in maximizing their own selfish utility , then one can import the quantitative methods of microeconomics into disciplines that concern themselves with realms traditionally regarded as non-economic , such as political science , sociology , and law .
This approach goes by the name of “ rational choice theory . ”
Of course , many have criticized the unrealistic picture of human beings , indeed of rationality , on which this approach depends .
Shapiro ’s contribution is to argue that , even taken on its own terms , the rational choice approach fails miserably in political science ; it has “ degenerated into elaborate exercises geared toward saving ... theory from discordant encounters with reality . ”
What it “ explains ” too often involves merely “ stylized facts that turn out on close inspection not to bear much relationship to any political reality . ”
It specifies theories “ so vaguely that they turn out to be compatible with all empirical outcomes ” ; its failures include “ scouring the political landscape for confirming illustrations of the preferred theory while ignoring the rest of the data ” ; even the alleged confirmations often as not depend on “ tendentious descriptions of the political world . ”
As Shapiro has shown in his past work , these accusations are not just polemical bombs of the sort humanists often hurl indiscriminately at the social sciences .
They are critiques from within .
In an earlier book entitled Pathologies of Rational Choice Theory ( cowritten with Donald P. Green ) he goes deep into the rational choice literature to parse its errors in detail .
His criticisms are offered in terms that ought , at least , to be fully admissible within this literature ; his procedure is to take the scientific pretensions of rational choice theory seriously , and thereby to reveal them as mere pretensions .
By contrast , when humanists ( especially those of a postmodern stripe ) criticize reductive social science , they tend to assume the method is living up to its scientific aspirations , and take the poverty of insight issuing from the method as grounds for a wholesale criticism of modern science altogether .
Such critiques are often valuable , but they can gain no hearing among those criticized .
Shapiro , on the other hand , cannot be ignored in good faith ; he is appealing precisely to the scientific conscience of those who take themselves to be scientists .
Shapiro ’s book also seeks to consider “ the relations between disengaged human sciences and the reproduction of the social and political order . ”
Quantitative political science has a tendency to neutralize dissent by ( implicitly ) positing a spurious consensus , as though all reasonable people must accept the description on offer .
In particular , when political science narrows the scope of questions it can ask to those that issue in testable predictions , this can “ lead us to undervalue critical reappraisals of accepted descriptions of reality . ”
Sometimes , what is thought to stand in need of explanation is “ so mis-specified that the right causal questions [ are ] not even on the table . ”
For example , the political scientist may be looking for “ opaque causal mechanisms that produce consent ” when the more pertinent facts lie with conditions that render the consent in question spurious , as in the old Soviet politburo .
These shortcomings lead Shapiro to recommend that we conceive the vocation of political theory as essentially critical , a gadfly within the larger discipline of political science : “ Political theorists have an important role to play in exhibiting what is at stake in taking one [ descriptive ] cut rather than another ” ; to display the presuppositions of these descriptions , and propose alternatives .
Shapiro offers this as an alternative to what too often transpires in political theory : the perpetuation of highly abstract polemics by constant recourse to what he calls “ gross concepts . ”
These are “ ideas that feed into and promote misleading dichotomies ” — for example , negative freedom ( freedom from ) versus positive freedom ( freedom for ) .
Champions of the first take a minimal view of what society owes people , and champions of the second believe society ought to make sure everyone develops his capacities to the fullest .
These abstractions , like other gross concepts , distract from “ first - order questions about the world ” — in this case , questions about precisely who is free and in what ways .
Political theorists should resist the intellectual allure of gross concepts , Shapiro argues .
Our job is to reel in gross concepts , not to traffic in them .
Rather than try to find the right gross concept to champion , we do better to operate as principled social critics whose goal is [ to ] embellish political argument with political reality .
We should be roving ombudsmen for the truth rather than partisans of any particular message .
And this critical posture matters not just to scholars :
This [ critical ] activity is particularly important when the defective account is widely accepted outside the academy .
If political science has a constructive role to play outside the academy , it must surely include debunking myths and misunderstandings that shape political practice .
Shapiro ’s critique is indispensable , and indeed this last point might be pushed farther .
Arguably the defective accounts that issue from disengaged theorizing ( whether the gross concepts of political theory or the reductive accounts of political science ) affect not only our political practices , but also what lies behind those practices .
The horizon of our political consciousness comes to be shaped by “ myths and misunderstandings ” of academic origin .
Disengaged theorizing acts as a sort of unelected legislator — of opinion , and ultimately of our sensibilities .
Shapiro might be said to have renewed Kant ’s project of defending practical life , including politics , from the presumptuousness of theoretical reason ( an aspect of Kant ’s thought forgotten by today ’s Kantians in political theory ) .
Properly understood , the realm of political practice is autonomous from academic theorizing , and statesmen ought to take their bearings from their own experience of the world .
Conversely , those who study politics in a theoretical mode would do well to test their reasonings against the concerns of political actors , and see if they are intelligible from the perspective of the statesman .
Anything else tends toward scholasticism .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Gold prices tumbled Wednesday , as the dollar regained strength , to sink nearly $ 100 below its record high set Monday - leaving some traders wondering if this is the beginning of the end for gold 's impressive run .
COMEX gold for April delivery fell $ 59 to settle at $ 945.30 an ounce Wednesday .
Gold had set an intraday record of $ 1033.90 Monday .
Gold began to slide shortly after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates Tuesday by 3 / 4 of a percentage point , instead of the full percentage point that some market participants had expected .
The dollar , which has hit a series of record lows , began to advance against the euro in response to the Fed 's announcement .
Normally , interest rate cuts depress the value of the dollar .
However , since the cut was less aggressive than many expected , the greenback benefited .
" It looked like the sky would fall , which is why we got up to those record levels Monday , " said Jon Nadler , senior analyst at Kitco Bullion Dealers in Montreal .
" But when the dollar started a bit of a gain this morning , people pulled the trigger across the commodity board . "
Gold is priced in dollars , making it an attractive investment for overseas buyers .
But if the dollar begins to strengthen , investors from overseas markets are more likely to sell their gold .
Moreover , gold 's reputation as a safe - haven investment , one that holds value in times of economic volatility , contributed to the metal 's record - breaking run .
' A major shift in psychology '
Buying gold and other commodities like oil and wheat is seen by many as a way to hedge against inflation , which has also helped support the gold market recently .
As the dollar continues to post gains against the euro , some analysts think gold is heading south after growing nearly 40 - fold since its trough of $ 253 in August 1999 .
" If gold drops below $ 915 , it will represent a major shift in psychology , " said Nadler , who believes gold could fall to about $ 850 in the next week .
With lower mortgage resets , the upcoming elections - which tend to boost the dollar - and the coming seasonal lull for gold , Nadler sees gold slipping to around $ 650 to $ 750 in the summer .
" That represents a good equilibrium level for gold , as jewelers will be able to sell gold again , " he said .
Still , some analysts think Wednesday 's selloff is largely a hiccup - a temporary reaction by speculative buyers to changes in the economic climate , which can dramatically impact on the price of gold .
" When you are operating in a heavily overbought market , corrections like the one we 're seeing today are very easy to have , " said Nicoals Kavalis , a senior analyst at precious metals consultancy GFMS .
Kavalis notes that the recent run-up in gold prices has been supported by speculative buying .
" It 's not hard for that ' hot money ' to move out of market [ when conditions change ] , " he added .
Time and time again I find myself having to explain why people should n’t take a gung - ho approach to locking , or , more often , what a deadlock is .
Simple explanations being the best , the following is the stock answer I came up with for these situations .
The first parable of the bathroom
Imagine a typical office , with two office workers .
We ’ll call these people Mr. A and Mr B .
Mr. A spills some coffee , and wants to wipe it up .
He goes to the bathroom , grabs the toilet roll , and starts mopping up the spill .
While Mr. A is busy , Mr. B goes to answer the call of nature , and goes into the bathroom .
Mr. B obviously likes his privacy , so he locks the bathroom door so that no one can enter while he ’s using it .
Now , both A and B are stuck .
When A finishes mopping up the coffee , he cannot replace the toilet roll because B has locked the door .
On the other hand , B cannot finish before he uses the toilet roll , which he cannot do because the toilet roll simply is n’t in the room .
This is a typical deadlock situation – two workers are waiting for each other to finish , which will never happen because their end conditions are interdependent .
The second ( unimproved ) parable of the bathroom
Now , some forms of locking provided by .
Net allow the developer to specify a timeout .
This tells the worker to give up if it is unable to acquire a lock within the given time .
In our example , this would looks something like this :
A goes into the bathroom .
( A locks the bathroom )
A gets the toilet roll ( A locks the toilet roll )
A leaves the bathroom ( A releases the bathroom )
B enters the bathroom ( B locks the bathroom )
B tries to get hold of the toilet roll ( B tries to lock the toilet roll )
Of course , the lock on the toilet roll is still held by A , so B will give up trying to get the lock .
Depending on how B is coded , it will either fail with an exception , or simply go ahead , unlock the bathroom , and continue working .
Both situations are undesirable ; in the first case , it means that B is not doing the work it was meant to do .
In the second case , B continues working in a possibly inappropriate state ( It left the bathroom without using the toilet roll ) .
Timeouts on locks are , in general , a BAD idea ; so much in fact that the recommended locking syntax in C# , the lock statement , does not even give you an option to specify one .
The third ( possibly improved , possibly not ) parable of the bathroom
This still leaves us with a deadlock though .
One way to get past it is to lock more aggressively , which may not be the ideal solution in most cases .
It certainly works , but the chances are that it ’s going to put the hurt on performance .
A more aggressive lock would be something like this :
A goes into the bathroom ( A locks the bathroom )
A gets the toilet roll ( A locks the toilet roll )
A leaves the bathroom , but keeps the key ( A is still holding the lock to the bathroom )
B tries to get into the bathroom , and starts waiting for A to unlock it .
A returns the toilet roll .
( A releases the toilet roll )
A returns the key to the bathroom .
( A releases the bathroom )
B finishes waiting and goes about its business .
In this case , we are considering that to finish a given task ( returning the toilet roll ) , A depends on the availability of the bathroom ; to make sure this is available when needed , we lock the bathroom for the duration of the task , so a deadlock situation never arises – if A has the toilet roll , it also has exclusive access to the bathroom .
While this works , it is important to remember that locks should really be considered on a case by case basis .
For example , while an aggressive lock as above may be acceptable if A has a brief task , it would not have been acceptable if the task had required a certain amount of time .
Sometimes a reorganization of the code or the resources may be in order – again in the example above , it may not have been necessary to take out the entire toilet roll ; perhaps taking a small part of it would have been enough .
Moral of the story
Handle locks with care , or you ’ll end up in crap up to your eyeballs .
Peace can not be kept by force .
It can only be achieved by understanding .
— Albert Einstein
The Canadian state - run media CBC is portraying an aggressive image of Canadians .
Canada has pretty much abandoned its vaunted image as a nation of peace .
This is far removed from the day when former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau embarked on a peace initiative to end the Cold War , drawing the ire of Washington .
But Canadian troops shed any pretense to peacekeeping , in 1993 , when members of the Canadian Airborne Regiment tortured Somali children and killed 16 - year - old Shidane Arone .
Since the Afghanistan “ mission ” began in 2002 , 81 Canadian soldiers and one Canadian diplomat have been killed .
The latest fatality has been described as “ a committed warrior ” by lt.- col .
Dave Corbould .
Corbould opined , “ He was someone we can all emulate .
He represented the warrior spirit 100 per cent . ”
Is the warrior what Canadians should emulate ?
One definition of a warrior is “ a person habitually engaged in warfare . ” .
Is Rambo to be emulated over persons committed to peace , such as a Mohandas Gandhi or an Albert Einstein ?
Canadian chief of defense [ sic ] staff , General Rick Hillier weighed in : “ I ’m a little uncomfortable with the term warrior .
I ’m even more uncomfortable with the term peacekeeper .
I ’m neither of those ; I ’m simply a soldier . ”
Hillier is unequivocal about the role of a soldier : “ We are the Canadian Forces , and our job is to be able to kill people . ” [ italics added ]
The job is not to protect people , it is to kill people — not defense .
Of the slain Canadian warrior , regimental sgt.- maj .
Brian Semenko said , “ He was really dedicated to the idea of serving overseas .
He felt the best way to serve was to do it overseas .
His idea was not to give candy to children , but to kill insurgents . ”
A human who prefers to kill other humans to the non-violent joy of bringing smiles to the faces of children .
Is that how Canadians are to serve ?
By killing ?
Brig.- gen .
Guy Laroche said , “ We have lost a brother and a fine soldier who answered a call of duty one last time . ”
Why not hail those people who struggle for peace .
Is not the struggle for peace — an end to war and killing — the greater “ call of duty ” ?
Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper lauded the fallen Canadian as “ an exceptionally brave soldier who deserves the support and gratitude of all Canadians . ”
No mention of Afghan gratitude is made .
Canadians were at one time smug that they could not be saddled with a George W. Bush - type “ war president ” like their neighbors across the border .
However , Harper pursues a neoconservative agenda like Bush .
Canadians have no reason to gloat .
Propagandizing Canadians
Hillier spoke of the public speaking training the military gets .
“ When I was in Afghanistan , we had people from the BBC come in to help us create the right perceptions , because perception is reality . ”
The CBC reporting plays into the perceptual reality spun by the Department of National Defense [ sic ] .
Hillier sees it as a duty .
He declared , “ When a soldier steps on foreign soil in a high - risk environment , every single Canadian should be walking with him or her . ”
As for walking with soldiers , the pacifist Einstein was quoted :
He who joyfully marches to music rank and file , has already earned my contempt .
He has been given a large brain by mistake , since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice .
This disgrace to civilization should be done away with at once .
Heroism at command , how violently I hate all this , how despicable and ignoble war is ; I would rather be torn to shreds than be a part of so base an action .
It is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder .
Canadians and people everywhere need to decide : are they for war or for peace ?
If people are for peace , then how can they walk with killers ?

Pulsed Laser Imaging of Flows , Flames and Plumes
Enterprise
For StarTrek fans we tested the USS Enterprise in our super - orbital expansion tube - X2 .
A scale model was placed in the test section and the facility used to generate a high speed gas flow of around 6.6 km /s .
This was passed over the Enterprise for a duration of approximately 100 microseconds .
We perform similar tests on other models investigating dissociation and ionisation processes which occur during atmospheric re-entry .
But the Enterprise is n't designed to enter an atmosphere ??
Very true !
However one could argue that this test was a simulation of the flight of the Enterprise where the Mach number of the flow is analogous to the Warp speed of the vehicle .
The Mach number gives the speed of a vehicle relative to the speed of sound .
The latter is determined by the atmosphere in which the vehicle is travelling ( eg in air at room temperature , the speed of sound is about 300 m /s ) .
The Warp speed is related to the speed of light ( about 300,000,000 m/s in a vacuum ) .
Hence the test simulates the effect of the motion of the vehicle on space - time ( not on the atmosphere or space dust that it is travelling through ) !
Our test had a Mach number of around 5 , a bit below the full capabilities of the Enterprise .
An image that we recorded at this speed can be seen adjacent ( the green image ) .
This was taken with a digital camera open to luminosity from the hot test gas present for the duration of the test .
Note the highly intense regions in front of the blunt sections of the vehicle .
What did we learn ?
A more quantitative study of the flow was done using holographic interferometry .
An interferogram yields a picture with light and dark bands called fringes .
Bends in the fringes indicate a change in the density of the gas .
The image shows diagonal lines coming from the front of the Enterprise - these are the bow shock waves .
Shocks are also seen emanating from other points on the vehicle .
A crucial design point is the avoidance of " shock - shock " interactions where one shock wave hits another directly in front of the body .
If this were to occur there would be catastrophic consequences for space - time in these regions .
The image shows that the designers certainly knew their stuff - at this speed , the bow shocks pass comfortably outside the other sections of the vehicle .
However at Warp 10 , this may not be the case !
What else did we learn ??
We found that , with shields down , the Enterprise is very susceptible to the ever increasing amount of space junk .
The picture shows the Enterprise after our last test .
A piece of " space junk " shown at the bottom right impacted the Enterprise at high speeds ripping it to pieces .
It was fun while it lasted !

Last month , the Copyright Office held a closed - door session on the issue of statutory damages .
A small affair , the roundtable was a response to the PRO - IP Act introduced in Congress late last year .
In the wake of the meeting , eight public interest and industry groups have published a white paper ( PDF ) arguing against any changes to the " one work " rule and the increases in statutory damages that would result from such changes .
The PRO - IP
Act would drastically alter US copyright law by increasing the amount of statutory damages that could be awarded to rightsholders .
For instance , someone copying a 50 songs from a boxed set could be liable for $ 7.5 million in damages instead of the current $ 150,000 .
There 's more : there would be a new office created within the executive branch that would be responsible for IP enforcement , while the Department of Justice would get a new IP enforcement division .
The white paper , submitted by the Consumer Electronics Association , Public Knowledge , the Center for Democracy and Technology , the Association of Public Television Stations , the Library Copyright Alliance , the Computer & Communications Industry , NetCoalition , and the Printing Industries of America , argues against the kind of changes to the copyright law envisioned in the PRO - IP Act .
Noting that the courts can currently award massive statutory damages without rightsholders having to demonstrate that they have suffered any actual harm ( ask Jammie Thomas about that ) , the white paper calls current copyright law a " carefully designed compromise " meant to balance the interests of both parties .
After all , if a rights - holder believes that it has suffered damages in excess of the statutory limits , it has the option to seek punitive damages as well .
From the standpoint of Big Content , the problem is that it can be difficult to prove actual damages ; lifting the ceiling on statutory damages is much easier .
During the Jammie Thomas trial , one recording industry executive testified that she had no idea what the RIAA 's actual damages were .
" We have n't stopped to calculate the amount of damages we 've suffered due to downloading , " testified Sony BMG 's head of litigation Jennifer Pariser .
That 's not enough , argues the white paper .
Supporters of the PRO - IP
Act are " not able to produce any examples where that rule has created unfair outcomes for rightsholders , " according to the groups .
" In fact , at the January 25 meeting Associate Register Carson asked the proponents of Section 104 if they could cite a single example where the one work rule produced an unjust result .
The proponents were unable to do so . "
The authors of the white paper paint a dreary future where " copyright trolls " file lawsuits in order to rake in massive amounts of statutory damages , where innovation is stifled , and where artists are afraid to " Recut , Reframe , and Recycle " because of the financial risks involved .
The PRO - IP
Act would also strengthen the hand of rightsholders when it comes to secondary infringement , a development the white paper contends should be avoided at all costs .
Noting that courts have seldom — if ever —ruled on the question of the applicability of statutory damages in the case of secondary infringement ( a federal judge rejected the RIAA 's argument that Debbie Foster was liable for secondary infringement in Capitol v. Foster ) , the authors argue that any changes to the Copyright Act must limit liability for secondary infringement .
Otherwise , companies would be less willing to create innovative new products for fear of running afoul of this issue .
The increase in statutory damages might be justified , allow the white paper 's authors , if there was evidence that it would help in the fight against piracy .
They argue that such evidence is lacking .
" At the January 25 , 2008 , meeting , supporters of the amendment provided no evidence that weakening the one work rule would deter infringement by end users or commercial ' pirates . ' "
There 's a lot more in the white paper , including a fascinating ( well , fascinating to me , anyway ) look at the history of development of the statutory damages clause in the Copyright Act .
But the key takeaway is this : current law already provides for adequate damages for rightsholders , and the proposals backed by Big Content in the current legislation would have far - reaching negative consequences if the bill is passed in its current form .

The US has charged a Guantanamo Bay detainee with war crimes for the 1998 al - Qaeda attack on the US embassy in Tanzania , which left 11 people dead .
Charges against Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani - who was captured in 2004 - include murder and attacking civilians .
The Pentagon claims Mr Ghailani worked for al - Qaeda after the bombing as a forger , trainer and as a bodyguard for Osama Bin Laden .
The Pentagon said Mr Ghailani could receive the death penalty if convicted .
Mr Ghailani , a Tanzanian , is the 15th person to be charged at Guantanamo , where trials are expected to start later this year .
He goes by dozens of aliases , including " Foopie " and " Ahmed the Tanzanian " .
Al - Qaeda ' trainer '
The US defence department says Mr Ghailani 's involvement included :
- buying explosives , detonators and transporting bomb components to Dar es Salaam
- helping buy the lorry used in the attack
- escorting the bomb engineer between Dar es Salaam and Mombassa , Kenya , after the bomb had been made
- scouting the US embassy with the suicide bomb driver
The defence department says that after the bombing , Mr Ghailani " continued in his service to al - Qaeda as a document forger , physical trainer at an al - Qaeda training camp , and as a bodyguard for Osama Bin Laden " .
According to the transcript of a closed - door hearing in March 2007 , Mr Ghailani admitted delivering explosives used to blow up the embassy .
But he said he did not know about the attack beforehand and apologised to the US government and the victims ' families .
The charges must be approved by a Pentagon official who oversees the court at Guantanamo before trial proceedings can begin .
An Explanation for Soaring Commodity Prices
Jeffrey Frankel
The standard story for high commodity prices is rapid growth by China , India and company .
But world growth is slowing , while commodity prices still hit new highs .
This column suggests that the key may be low real interest rates .
It is hard to remember now , but mineral and agricultural commodities were considered passé less than ten years ago .
Anyone who talked about sectors where the product was as clunky and mundane as copper , corn , and crude petroleum , was considered behind the times .
In Alan Greenspan ’s phrase , GDP had gotten “ lighter ; ” the economy was becoming weightless , ” dematerializing . ”
Agriculture and mining no longer constituted a large share of the New Economy , and did not matter much in an age dominated by ethereal digital communication , evanescent dotcoms , and externally outsourced services .
The Economist magazine in a 1999 cover story forecast that oil might be headed for a price of $ 5 a barrel .
Since then , of course , we have seen tremendous increases in the prices of most mineral and agricultural commodities , many of them hitting records in nominal and even real terms ( see graph ) .
Oil is now well above $ 100 a barrel and gold has just crossed the $ 1000 an ounce line .
The question is why .
There could well be merit to many of the explanations that have been offered for the rise in the price of oil .
One is the “ peak oil hypothesis , ” and another is geopolitical uncertainty in Russia , Nigeria , Venezuela and – above all – the Gulf .
Corn prices have been impacted by American subsidies for biofuel .
And other special microeconomic factors are relevant in other specific sectors .
But it cannot be a coincidence that mineral and agricultural prices have risen virtually across the board .
Some macroeconomic explanation is called for .
The popular explanation since 2003 has been rapid growth in the world economy .
The strongest growth has of course been coming from China and other recently minted manufacturing powerhouses in Asia , but the expansion has been unusually broad - based – including up to last year the United States and even a reinvigorated Europe .
So growth has pushed up demand for energy , minerals , farm products , and other industrial inputs , right ?
This reigning explanation now looks suspect .
Since last summer the US economy has slowed down noticeably , and is probably entering a recession .
Despite talk of decoupling , it is clear that other countries are also slowing down at least to some extent .
In its most recent forecast , the IMF World Economic Outlook revised downward the growth rate for virtually every region , including China .
The overall global growth rate for 2008 has been marked down by 1.1 % ( from 5.2 % in July 2007 , just before the sub - prime mortgage crisis hit , to 4.1 % as of January 29 , 2008 ) .
And prospects continue to deteriorate .
Yet commodity prices have found their second wind over precisely this period !
Up some 25 % or more since August 2007 , by a number of indices .
So much for the growth explanation .
How to explain commodity prices go up while the economy turns down ?
If strong economic growth is not the explanation for the large increases since 2001 in prices of virtually all commodities , then what is ?
One would n’t want to try to reduce commodity markets to a single factor , nor to claim proof of any theory by a single data point .
Nevertheless , the developments of the last six months provided added support for a theory I have long favoured : real interest rates are an important determinant of real commodity prices .
High interest rates reduce the demand for storable commodities , or increase the supply , through a variety of channels :
by increasing the incentive for extraction today rather than tomorrow ( think of the rates at which oil is pumped , gold mined , forests logged , or livestock herds culled )
by decreasing firms ’ desire to carry inventories ( think of oil inventories held in tanks ) , by encouraging speculators to shift out of spot commodity contracts , and into treasury bills .
All three mechanisms work to reduce the market price of commodities , as happened when real interest rates were high in the early 1980s .
A decrease in real interest rates has the opposite effect , lowering the cost of carrying inventories , and raising commodity prices , as happened in the 1970s , and again during 2001 - 2004 .
It ’s the original “ carry trade . ”
The theoretical model can be summarised as follows .
A monetary expansion temporarily lowers the real interest rate ( whether via a fall in the nominal interest rate , a rise in expected inflation , or both – as now ) .
Real commodity prices rise .
How far ?
Until commodities are widely considered “ overvalued ” — so overvalued that there is an expectation of future depreciation ( together with the other costs of carrying inventories : storage costs plus any risk premium ) that is sufficient to offset the lower interest rate ( and other advantages of holding inventories , namely the “ convenience yield ” ) .
Only then do firms feel they have high enough inventories despite the low carrying cost .
In the long run , the general price level adjusts to the change in the money supply .
As a result , the real money supply , real interest rate , and real commodity price eventually return to where they were .
The theory is the same as Rudiger Dornbusch ’s famous theory of exchange rate overshooting , with the price of commodities substituted for the price of foreign exchange .
There was already some empirical evidence to support the theory : Monetary policy news and real interest rates , along with other factors , do appear to be significant determinants of real commodity prices historically .
But the events since August 2007 provide a further data point .
As economic growth has slowed sharply , both in the US and globally , the Fed has reduced interest rates , both nominal and real .
Firms and investors have responded by shifting into commodities , not out .
This is why commodity prices have resumed their upward march over the last six months , rather than reversing it .
In April last year a group of environmentalists shut down E.ON 's coalfired power station in Ratcliffe - on - Soar .
The goal : to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and , in their words , " save lives " .
Yesterday judge Morris Cooper presented a 20 - page judgment accepting there was an " urgent need for drastic action " , but convicted them of aggravated trespass , saying their defence , that their crime was necessary to save lives , could not be substantiated .
In the trial , for which I was an expert witness , crucial questions were how many people does climate change kill , and what proportion is the UK responsible for ?
I was surprised to discover that nobody knows .
Scientists such as myself are involved in programmes to measure CO2 emissions , air temperatures , sea-ice loss and the much more complex impacts on birds , rainforest trees and coral reefs .
We know that climate change - related events are killing people , yet there is no comprehensive global monitoring program to document the lives lost due to climate change .
There is no official climate - change body count .
Admittedly , the impact of climate change on human health and mortality is difficult to quantify .
There is no comparison group of people not exposed to climate change .
Deaths are often due to multiple causes .
And while the probability of a particular event occurring under modified climate conditions can be estimated , no single event can be solely attributed to climate change .
The biggest obstacle is the sheer variety of effects it has on health .
These include direct effects such as drowning in floods and complex indirect effects , such as falling crop yields which increases malnutrition and changes in the spread of infectious diseases such as malaria .
Furthermore , care must be taken to subtract any positive health impacts on climate change , such as the reduced effects of cold weather on health in a warming world .
The World Heath Organisation publishes the only global estimate of the number killed by climate change - about 150,000 annually .
Worryingly , this estimate comes from a single modelling study in 2002 , and includes only four impacts of climate change ( deaths from one strain of malaria , malnutrition , diarrhoea - type diseases and flooding ) .
It is , as the authors point out , a highly conservative first estimate and , by now , considerably out of date .
Why are we relying on a single , limited , out - of - date study for our information on the numbers of people killed by climate change ?
This is not a criticism of the WHO ; the real question is why they are apparently alone in this effort .
The core of the climate - change community , of course , is that group studying the atmosphere .
Their questions therefore do n't often relate directly to human health .
The medical profession is obviously more interested in saving lives now than in the slower and longer term effects of climate change , and so have been late in engaging with the question .
Naturally , funding influences which questions are answered .
Politicians have not asked for a body count .
But why not ?
Perhaps there are parallels with another politically charged issue involving widespread mortality , where nobody counted : the war in Iraq .
Governments probably do not want to hear about people dying in foreign lands because of their own choices .
Who is going to fund comprehensive studies when the headline might read " British carbon emissions responsible for 3,000 deaths last year " ?
The precise relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and deaths that both the environmentalists and Judge Cooper wanted information on should not be beyond scientists in the future .
Equivalent statements are routinely made by medical specialists , such as the proportion of all stroke deaths attributable to hypertension in a given year , or attributing lung cancer deaths to passive smoking .
It is merely a question of deciding whether it is an important question to answer .
Such an understanding is essential for two quite different reasons .
First , it is a basic issue of justice .
The dead should be remembered and their families and friends should understand the factors involved in their deaths .
Second , it seems likely that the numbers of people killed by climate change has been significantly underestimated .
This means that , in addition to issues of the morality of equating human lives with the time spent waiting in airport queues , such cost - benefit analyses used to shape government policy with major climatic impacts , such as building a new runway at Heathrow , are likely to be biased by underestimating the cost in human lives of such decisions .

I think this is the specific point of disagreement .
Complexity in a language does not necessarily reduce the complexity of programs .
I think the opposite may be truer .
The difficulties we have had in the development community since 1999 were not due to over - minimization .
They were due to features that did not work as expected or reliably over the various brands and versions .
I think that with minimal changes we can significantly improve this language .
Most of the changes I would make would make it simpler , not more complex .
And of course , our overwhelmingly most important problem , insecurity , is not addressed by this proposal .
The proposal is trying to solve a problem from a 2000 viewpoint .
We have moved on since then .
We have new problems now , and the proposal does not match them .
I believe that it will be easier to improve the performance of the language by simplifying it .
That performance improvement will be critical as we move toward mobile .
I can't make sense of your point about competition .
The web 's competitors all provide access to multiple languages , including JavaScript .
In the unlikely case that the proposed language is successful , I would expect them to support it too .
It would seem that the web would be more competitive if it also offered multiple languages .
I do n't believe that a single , all - inclusive monster language will be competitive .
DIGG THIS
I recently sent a note to my email list in support of Ron Paul .
One of the more thoughtful replies from a friend questioned the advisability of withdrawing our military from bases around the world .
Here 's his concern :
" I typically do n’t get involved in political discussions , but your email got me thinking ( as it intended ) .
I like Ron Paul , and I agree that he seems like a nice down - to - earth kind of guy .
However , I ’m very surprised that you think that pulling out of all 700 +
US bases around the world is a good idea .
Retracting all of our forces seems like a very isolationist policy , and I ca n’t see that intentionally significantly weakening our worldwide military capability is wise .
Further , a great deal of our intelligence is gained from operations that are only logistically possible with those bases in place .
Is the hope that other countries would like us more if we just went home and left them alone ?
Or is the move solely based on economic reasons ?
There are other issues that I would also question , but this one stands out the most . "
Here is a more in - depth analysis of what a policy of withdrawal would do in actual fact .
The Fairness Factor
I can tell you first - hand that the only people in other countries that like our US military presence on their soil are the pimps , madams , and liquor store owners near the bases .
Imagine the impact a Chinese military base a block down the street from your house would have .
Armed young foreign men , even if they were angels , are not what we ’d like in the US .
Every few years the US military kills a few foreign civilians in training accidents alone .
Think of the USS Vincennes killing over 200 Iranian civilians , the USS Greenville accidentally sinking the Ehime Maru and US Airmen recklessly killing 20 skiers in the Italian Alps .
Imagine the outrage if the Mexican Military killed 30 Texans in a border training exercise .
Still , the jingoist may retort " So what !
We 're Americans , and I do n't give a darn about fairness .
The US is unique , and our government should try to maximize our every advantage . "
Since this seems to be the opinion of many Americans , let ’s look at this from a US - centric viewpoint .
Intelligence Gathering
The vast majority of our foreign intelligence has nothing to do with guys in uniform stationed at bases .
Information is gathered as Human Intelligence and Signals Intelligence ( HUMINT and SIGINT as the spooks call it ) .
HUMINT comes from “ diplomats ” in our embassies who are CIA operatives , information exchange between friendly government intelligence agencies ( Mossad in Israel MI - 6 in the UK , etc. ) , double agents , and all the other tricks of the CIA .
SIGINT , run mostly by the NSA , comes from our spy satellites , and communications interception , warrantless tapping of International phone calls , etc .
Thinking through all the various ways our government gathers intelligence , guys in uniform on bases barely contribute .
Bases and people in uniform are easily spotted , and are no deterrent to terrorist plots .
The 9/11 plot was practiced and carried out in the US , with the FBI missing warnings of the attack on several occasions .
Military bases around the world did not stop that attack , or contribute in any meaningful way to intelligence gathering to stop the attack .
In fact , military bases around the world are one of the reasons for the attack .
Isolationism
A call for military withdrawal is commonly and incorrectly called isolationism .
Think through what would actually happen if our troops and equipment were packed up in 2009 , and brought home .
It ’s just the troops and gear coming home .
Among the Americans who would remain engaged and on the ground in foreign countries are : diplomats , ambassadors , aid workers , volunteers , ex-pat residents , dual citizens , businessmen , missionaries , and tourists to name just a few .
In short , it ’s the Americans who are most welcome that would remain , not the ones with tanks and M - 16’s .
In the absence of a military presence on their soil , foreigners would be more welcoming of Americans .
Some will claim “ how can we ensure Americans in foreign countries would be safe without a military presence ? ”
First , the US military is not a police force , nor does it have police power , or routinely carry out police duties .
The lone exception of Iraq shows why this is a bad idea .
The military is designed to destroy other military forces , not rescue kittens , arrest drunken brawlers , or keep the peace .
Second , foreign countries have their own police that are just as functionally dysfunctional as our own gendarmes .
Third , it ’s the responsibility of an individual to make informed decisions about the relative risks of traveling abroad , and to take precautions while traveling .
It 's not the responsibility of the US government to try and protect every US citizen everywhere , at all times .
The Real Purpose of Military Power
No state military in the world is poised to invade or bomb the United States .
The myth of " Forward Deployment " is a fig leaf for the true purposes of the military overseas : protect US business interests , the foremost being oil ; coerce countries like Libya and Syria to get with the US program , run by the neocons ; distract from domestic issues by having news - ready wars of choice , such as Yugoslavia , Gulf War I & II , and Afghanistan .
While bases around the world do not protect the territory or citizens of the United States , they provide three important negative consequences .
First , they are an irritant or outright provocation to those living in that country .
The 9/11 Commission points out that our bases in Saudi Arabia , the Muslim Holy Land , provided the ideological justification , however misguided , for the 9/11 attacks .
Second , bases abroad are a convenient target for militants and terrorists in foreign countries .
The suicide attack on the Marines in Lebanon in 1983 , the near sinking of the USS Cole , and the Kobar Towers attacks were all possible because bases are conveniently located in these countries .
We were not at war with any of those countries at the time of the attacks .
Third , our military presence around the world negatively influences our own foreign policy .
By making a near immediate military response possible , our politicians resort to it first , rather than as a last , defensive resort .
When the only tool you have is a hammer … .
Consider that Clinton ordered missile strikes on what turned out to be an aspirin factory in Sudan during the Monica Lewinsky testimony and bombed Serbia right after the failed impeachment trial .
Politicians use the military to police the world , protect US business interests , and distract from domestic issues , rather than engage in diplomacy .
The Effectiveness of the Modern Military
Our military is correctly assessed as being ready to fight the last war .
In this case , our military is ready to fight and win a World War II or Gulf War I style of conflict against another state military .
The military is pretty good at blowing up tanks , planes , buildings , soldiers in uniform , and unfortunately civilians in foreign countries .
That style of warfare is over .
All the attacks I cited in the fairness factor section were terrorist attacks .
No state military would dare challenge the United States .
Instead we have entered what military thinkers call “ 4th - Generation War . "
This is warfare by non-state actors such as terrorists , secessionists , or ideologues against a state .
The war in Iraq continues not because the Iraqi army is making a last stand against the United States military .
Rather , some Iraqi’s are furious over a foreign invasion , some are terrorists who have come to harass and kill our conventional forces , and some are fighting for control of the nascent government , eliminating militia - style competition .
In this context we not only see the failure of war as an instrument of US policy , but the change in the terms of victory .
Perhaps the United States military has n’t won a war since World War II because the nature of war itself , as understood by the people in it has changed .
Read everything by the excellent William Lind for more insight on this topic .
The Final Analysis
The United States would not be undefended if our military was withdrawn from around the world .
Exactly the opposite would happen .
By having our military here in the United States , military forces could be used to patrol and enforce our borders , and regain their proper place defending the United States rather than policing the world .
Our intelligence gathering capability would not suffer .
Overall , the United States would be safer , US citizens would be more welcome abroad , and military personnel would not be needlessly placed in harm ’s way .
This is hardly an isolationist policy .
The warfare Republicans in control of the executive branch are fighting this tooth and nail , because it would mean an end to their ability to wage wars of choice , and carry out the Likudnick policies of the neocons .
The feckless Democrats , swept into legislative power on the high tide of anti-war sentiment , are also fighting it .
One need only examine the cruise missile diplomacy of Bill Clinton to see that the supposed anti-war party is just as ready to kill foreigners and sacrifice US troops to advance their pro-big government agenda .
In the final , grand analysis , that 's what all those foreign bases amount to : the tangible reminder to the world of the United States Government 's ability to enforce its will through bombs and bullets .
As we head into a recession that Washington is loathe to admit exists , the Federal budget must be cut .
Reductions in expensive foreign military bases are a vital first step .
Ron Paul is right , bringing the troops home will usher in peace , liberty and prosperity .

http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eB...ksid=p3907.m32
Jerez black on Fox red was not my first choice ( I have a deposit for AW / Silver interior with DCT at a local dealer ) but I was willing to live with it at a 60 K price point , so I bid on it with the intention to pay if I won .
I wasnt sure if I would win or not , but I went ahead and secured financing prior to the auction end so I could arrange immediate payment .
I ended up winning the auction with a bid of 60 K ( my max was 61K ) .
15 minutes after auction end , this guy Michael Barett ( At BMW of Nebraska ) calls and nervously tells me the auction was a mistake .
I reminded him of his contractual obligation to complete the transaction , to which he continues to reply it was a mistake , and refused to honor the deal .
He then offered to call his manager and confirm what they could do , but same response .
When I pressed the issue and raised the possibility of legal action , this guy had the nerve to condescendingly laugh and say we are a multi-billion dollar company , ebay will definitely side with us .

Can sellers , especially dealers ( which you would think are held to a higher standard on ebay ) just decide they dont want to honor a price ?
I know not all dealers are like this , but its pretty unethical , on both sides to back out of an auto auction because you dont like th eprice .
Im convinced this dealer went into this auction intentionally setting a low price , with no reserve .
The title , 08 M3 LOWEST PRICE ON EBAY says it all and me thinks they were hoping to generate bids , which didnt pan out .
Also , the pricepoint at which they started the auction , 60 K is no small amount ..... its not as if the auction started at 0.01 and ended there , it started at 60 K .
Obviously , they set it to attract serious buyers with the money to complete the transaction .
In this case , this dealer wasnt happy with the ending price , a 7 K difference from his BUY IT NOW ( which he adjusted twice , so I assume they watched this auction ) .
Had the auction ended at 64 K , would they have still refused ?
But I know had the auction ended at 90 K , and I refused to pay , Im sure their lawyers would be all over me .
Not sure what Im going to do , but part of me feels I should pursue this on principle alone .
But at the same time , I dont want to get too worked up , as these things might drag out , take time / money and make it a negative experience overall .
I want to be happy getting a new M3 like some of the others on the board , ya know ?

Just by reading the " rules " it seems to me that , although there is a contractual obligation once the auction ends between the seller and the winning buyer , this " obligation " stays within the eBay domain .
Outside of that domain , there is no declaredobligation that you can plainly see in this section other than what eBay - again - can perform .
I would stop contacting the seller and proceed with the eBay policy violation report .
After all , you already tried on your own to resolve this issue with the seller - caused by the seller according to you - and simply did not work .
So before this situation escalates to nastiness just follow the eBay rules and hope for the best ...
Iraqi minister sees another decade of US occupation RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday January 15 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Iraq 's defense minister says Iraq 's military will not be self - sufficient for at least another decade , giving a stark assessment that sees US troops occupying the longer than either government has previously acknowledged .
" The Iraqi defense minister said Monday that his nation would not be able to take full responsibility for its internal security until 2012 , nor be able on its own to defend Iraqs borders from external threat until at least 2018 , " reports the New York Times ' Thom Shanker .
" Those comments from the minister , Abdul Qadir , were among the most specific public projections of a timeline for the American commitment in Iraq by officials in either Washington or Baghdad .
And they suggested a longer commitment than either government had previously indicated . "
Excerpts : President Bush has never given a date for a military withdrawal from Iraq but has repeatedly said that American forces would stand down as Iraqi forces stand up .
Given Mr. Qadirs assessment of Iraqs military capabilities on Monday , such a withdrawal appeared to be quite distant , and further away than any American officials have previously stated in public .
Mr. Qadirs comments are likely to become a factor in political debate over the war .
All of the Democratic presidential candidates have promised a swift American withdrawal , while the leading Republican candidates have generally supported President Bushs plan .
Now that rough dates have been attached to his formula , they will certainly come under scrutiny from both sides .
Senior Pentagon and military officials said Mr. Qadir had been consistent throughout his weeklong visit in pressing that timeline , and also in laying out requests for purchasing new weapons through Washingtons program of foreign military sales .
 According to our calculations and our timelines , we think that from the first quarter of 2009 until 2012 we will be able to take full control of the internal affairs of the country ,  Mr. Qadir said in an interview on Monday , conducted in Arabic through an interpreter .
 In regard to the borders , regarding protection from any external threats , our calculation appears that we are not going to be able to answer to any external threats until 2018 to 2020 ,  he added .

Logitech G915 TKL review
The Logitech G915 TKL is one of the best tenkeyless gaming keyboards I ’ve ever used , but it ’s also one of the most expensive .
Has This Been the Best Primary Season Ever ?
Coming into this very long , harried , and intensely reordered presidential primary season , there was a lot of talk about how poorly the nominating process serves the electorate .
The common argument seemed to be that the acceleration and clustering of states ’ primaries would create a chaos from which no electoral good would come .
I ’d like to suggest an opposing view : this primary season has been remarkably successful at letting the public come to know the candidates and what they ’re about .
Why ?
For one thing , there has been massive exposure to every significant candidate , thanks in part to the scattered primary schedule .
There have been so many debates that a voter would have had to try hard not to at least read about them , let alone see them .
But the second reason is , I think , far more important .
This year ’s primary schedule has forced candidates to act a bit less like candidates and a bit more like managers — and , therefore , a bit more like an actual President .
Think about it .
The schedule called for a dazzling array of primary variables : some were public caucuses and some were standard private votes ; independents voted in some primaries and not in others ; both parties held primaries on the same day in some states and on different days in others .
And then there ’s the intense clustering of many primaries in many states in a relatively short time .
So what have the candidates been forced to do ?
Strategize intensely , adapt to a slew of different circumstances and formats , and , most of all , figure out how best to allocate precious resources — money and time chief among them — in order to optimize their outcome .
Sounds kind of like managing , does n’t it ?
And it sounds kind of like making the decisions that someone like a President makes , does n’t it ?
Rudy Giuliani , for instance , decided to forego the early primaries and concentrate on Florida , a brash and highly untraditional cost - benefit decision whose outcome we ’ll know shortly .
Was he wise to not squander his resources on those first states ?
Or did he sacrifice precious momentum by sitting them out ?
I am not saying that the nominating process is a great way to assess what kind of President a candidate would make ; I ’m not sure there is such a thing .
But I do think that , for all the anxiety that greeted this primary season , the public and the media have gotten a truer taste of how each candidate responds to a variety of pressures , the need to make quick decisions and strategic shifts , and the allocation of scarce resources .
It just might be good training for something like , say , putting together a financial stimulus plan that works .
Age1600 - I am so sorry , what a nightmare !
That 's not just scary , but traumatizing .
You did n't do anything wrong and I guess we both realize this is a function of your HFA .
You live in New Jersey , which is entirely different from my home ( Interior rural Alaska ) .
But I have had SCREAMING ( I mean literally ) in public ... I HATE this beyond imaginable .
I am shy and this just about kills me .
Something AWFUL happened to me in January and I told no one .
I will tell you because you 're my friend ( yes , I know you from WP ) and we have the same ' condition , ' or version of .
Then I 'll tell you what I do that SAVES me .
I was driving north to visit an older couple and I 'd never been to their remote place before .
Ever .
Ironically , I have a good sense of magnetic direction but I cannot know novel back roads , of course .
I was supposed to meet them at 6 pm .
They have no phone or electricity so I could n't have contacted them to let them know I was in distress .
I felt AWFUL that I had disappointed them ( but I had n't - they were really sad with what happened , or what tragically could have happened ) .
I was alone , no one knew of my whereabouts , and I became lost .
Badly , seriously lost .
I knew meltdown was pending and I had a nightmare meltdown .
Then I had a seizure where everything was black , white , black , white , black , white .
I remember vividly SCREAMING and screaming and screaming , crying uncontrollably .
I was beyond hysterically frantic .
I have a good heater in my car but the temperature outside was - 41 degrees F. I was disoriented out - of - mind .
I had the presence of mind to pull over from the isolated road I was somewhere on .
Oh , it 's really dark in AK at this time too .
Pitch black .
A truck pulled over , seeing a car in distress ( since off - road ) .
He was so nice ..... somehow he sensed I had a real medical problem - thankfully .
I was not , nor have I ever been , drunk , drugged , etc .
He recognized this as the medical emergency it was , not the latter .
I did have a cell phone on my car seat but had n't used it .
I virtually never carry my cell .
He called 911 and I showed him my medic alert ID bracelet , which has my name and ' Autistic - AS ' engraved .
Probably saved my life .
And , significantly , I carry a printed card in my wallet with a brief description of HFA ( high - functioning autism ) and simple instructions in the event of meltdown &/ or emergency .
He related this stuff to 911 .
The troopers were there quickly .
I was already feeling much better but still shaky .
Those troopers , after knowing the info on both my medic alert bracelet and medical card , were incredibly understanding and supportive of me .
They got me back to Fairbanks .
The original trip would have taken just about 30 - 35 minutes .
I had left my Fairbanks apartment at about 5:35 pm .
When the troopers arrived the time was at 10:00 pm .
I had a 4 hour meltdown and was beyond exhausted .
I could barely stand and was not well .
The medical personnel could ' see ' I was in medical distress , not that I was being ' bad/weird/drunk/drugged/retarded / psycho , etc ' I was okay but rested the entire next day and recuperated .
Age1600 - Because I do know what you went through , and have had similar , please get a medical alert ID bracelet .
This investment is WELL WORTH IT !!
Plus , your medical insurance may pay - but a med bracelet does n't cost that much .
It may save your life .
Next ( this is imperative ! ) , have a PRINTED card prominently displayed in your wallet ( mine says , " Read in case of emergency " ) .
On this card print your name , contact info , Dr.'s # ( or equivalent ) , plus a SPECIFIC yet succinctly written statement of what your conditon is and brief instructions of what a medical transponder should do in the event of an emergency &/ or meltdown .
This can SAVE you !
Otherwise , the police have NO WAY of knowing what is going on with you and they can assume the worst .
You do NOT need this and mistreatment by an unknowing medical transponder , or the police is a disaster waiting to happen - as you know .
You may certainly have your medical provider authorize your medical alert card and have another ( your boyfriend ? ) look over your card , offering input or edit .
I hope nothing of this sort happens to you again , but a meltdown ( or equivalent ) is out of your control and being ' punished ' for what you are NOT makes it worse !
Hope you feel better really soon .
Age1600 , if you wish , you may PM me and I 'll print what 's on my card for you - your will invariably need to adjusted to match your needs , but similar .
And try to order a medical alert bracelt right away - it 's worth it .
And could save your life .
I 'll be thinking of you !

The New Yorker recently ran a characteristically loquacious essay about the decline of the newspaper and what it means for the future of journalism .
The author , Eric Alterman , concludes that we 're beginning an era of " superior community conversation but a decidedly diminished level of first - rate journalism . "
Alterman claims that the blogosphere and other web - based news outlets largely lives parasitically on the traditional news media , relying on the latter to do original reporting , which web - based publications can then link to and comment on .
The future is now ... in the tech scene
This seems like a rather myopic view .
Journalism in the future will be different , to be sure , and the changes may be disorienting to those who are used to the old ways of doing things .
But there are good reasons to think that , if anything , reporting in the future will be considerably better than it was in the past .
You can get a good sense for where journalism is headed by looking at the world of tech reporting , which tends to be a step ahead of the rest of the media .
Most geeks have been getting tech news from sites like Slashdot and Ars Technica for a decade or longer , and aggregators like Digg and Techmeme are used more heavily among techies than in the rest of the news media .
We 've long since passed the point where most of the best tech journalism appears online .
So there 's a good chance that today 's tech news trends are a foretaste of what 's ahead for the broader media world .
One way to get a sense for the state of tech journalism is to look at Techmeme 's leaderboard , which gives a rough idea of the sites that get the most links and discussion in the tech blogosphere .
Only one of top ten sites — the New York Times — is a mainstream media outlet .
The other nine are native web - based publications , either blogs like TechCrunch and GigaOm or news sites like CNet and Ars Technica .
Looking further down the list , we see a smattering of mainstream media outlets — the AP and Reuters , the Wall Street Journal and the BBC — but the majority of sites are still web - based .
While some of these sites certainly link to mainstream media outlets on a regular basis , virtually all of them do original reporting or analysis as well .
Indeed , it has become common for important technology stories to be broken first by a blog or other tech web site and then get picked up by mainstream media sources afterwards .
Experts , journos , and depth
Alterman suggests that web - based publications can't match the depth of knowledge and expertise that professional journalists bring to the job .
But in the technology field , the opposite is often true .
If you 'll forgive us for tooting our own horn , Ars Technica is a good example of the ways a new business model can improve the depth of news coverage .
Ars began life when Ken Fisher , already with several years of IT experience , became dissatisfied with the tech reporting online .
When Ken considered who he wanted to reach out to in order to start the site , he went not for the best writers or journalists , but for his friends and associates with the technical chops .
As a result , Ken and the other early contributors leveraged their knowledge of the technology world into reporting that had greater depth and sophistication than most of what you could find in the mainstream media .
For example , Jon Stokes ' comprehensive write - ups of various chip architectures are unlike anything you 'll find in the mainstream media .
As Ars has grown , it has leveraged the same basic approach to other areas of the site .
The regular contributors to Nobel Intent , for example , include several freelancers with day jobs in the scientific fields they cover , and they all hold PhDs .
This gives them a level of insight and sophistication that would be difficult for a professional journalist to match .
Ars is now large enough to have several full - time reporters doing work that 's quite similar to what a mainstream reporter would do .
But it would be impossible to achieve the same combination of breadth and depth without recruiting contributors from a variety of different backgrounds .
The same pattern can be seen around the technology world .
Mike Arrington and his merry band of writers at TechCrunch regularly scoop mainstream media outlets with stories about the startup world .
Mike Masnick at Techdirt ( where I 'm also a regular contributor ) has been covering the technology world daily for a decade and knows the beat as well as anyone at any dead - tree publication .
Wired ( which has a magazine but is increasingly a web - focused organization ) and CNet have top - notch reporters and bloggers that do work that compares favorably to the work of reporters on the tech beat at the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal .
And there are hundreds of blogs like Groklaw and Freedom to Tinker that cover specific aspects of the technology world in greater depth than a mainstream newspaper could hope to do .
In short , a mix of traditional journalists and expert amateurs can often produce better results than either of them acting alone .
Better , not worse
Looking at the broader media world , it 's true that the majority of high - quality journalism still happens in traditional mainstream media outlets .
It would surprising if this were not the case , since they still control a majority of eyeballs and advertising dollars .
But the idea that the web is , or is likely to become , a journalistic wasteland does n't make a lot of sense .
As the reader attention — and with it , advertising dollars — shift to the web , web - based publications ( along with those mainstream publications that successfully navigate the transition to the web ) will have the resources to recruit the best journalists to work for them .
High - quality reporting draws eyeballs , and eyeballs generate advertising revenue , so talented writers will continue to be in demand regardless of the medium .
One of the big challenges that mainstream media outlets will face is that their size and bureaucracy makes it difficult for them to experiment with new news gathering techniques .
As we 've seen here at Ars , one of the big advantages of web - based publishing is that it 's possible to draw on contributions from a broader range of professional writers , bloggers , and amateurs with subject matter expertise .
Large , monolithic news organizations , which rely on full - time employees for the bulk of their writing , may have difficulty exploiting this model .
If a natural disaster occurs , for example , a news organization that flies a professional reporter to the scene of the tragedy will likely get scooped by a news organization that has an existing network of freelancers in the area who can cover the story without leaving their home towns .
What those writers lose in writing skills they are likely to make up in timeliness and depth of local knowledge .
Mastering new styles of reporting , and discovering new ways of organizing the reporting process to ensure a minimal level of quality , will require a lot of experimentation .
Looking back a couple of decades from now , journalists will no doubt marvel at the crudeness of the work now being done by the Huffington Post ( and Ars Technica ) .
It may be true that in the future we 'll have fewer people whose official title is " journalist . "
But that does n't prove that the reading and viewing public will be less - informed about the world around them .
To the contrary , as we come to more fully understand the capabilities of new communications technologies , we will almost certainly see big improvements in the depth , responsiveness , and diversity of journalism .
The new media world will be different , to be sure , and will probably require the reader to do a bit more work to separate the wheat from the chaff .
But it would be awfully hard to argue that tech journalism is in worse shape today than it was a decade ago , and there 's every reason to think the transition to the web will be just as healthy for the enterprise of news gathering more generally .

Whether to proceed with laser eye surgery is one of the most important life - changing decisions you will ever make .
If you have n't arrived here from our main laser eye surgery info page , you may want to check it out .
It will provide you with some of the most unbiased information available on the web , and help you make the right decision .
In the meantime , you will definitely find these videos of real and computer - generated laser eye surgery procedures interesting :
Lasik Eye Surgery In 47 Seconds ( Middle ) :
This is a time - lapse video of a lasik procedure , in which a corneal flap is cut before the actual laser is applied , then put back into place afterword .
( Drops are used to numb the area first ) .
The black marks were used as a guide to help the surgeon place the flap back correctly after the application of the laser .
Most patients report little or no pain during the cutting of the flap or application of the laser itself .
Newer procedures use a second laser to cut the flap , as opposed to an actual blade .
One of the biggest concerns with the lasik procedure is the healing process of the flap itself .
See types of laser eye surgery for more details .
Now A Look At The PRK Procedure ( Bottom ) :
Your doctor will recommend the PRK procedure ( as opposed to lasik ) if your cornea is too thin to create a proper flap .
As you can see , the upper layer of the cornea is scraped away before the laser is applied .
Again , numbing agents are used to eliminate any pain involved .
Most patients report feeling pressure on the eye , but not much else .
Those who have the PRK procedure will definitely report more pain after their surgery .
PRK also takes longer to recover from , and results are not immediately seen as they are in LASIK .
Some may take up to six months before their vision is crystal clear again .
One of the benefits of PRK is that there is no danger of the corneal flap dislocating or becoming wrinkled .
See types of laser eye surgery for details .

Computer - Generated Simulation ( Right ) :
This short video uses computer animation to demonstrate why and how a typical lasik ( not PRK ) procedure is performed , and how the surgery can improve your vision .

WASHINGTON  Instead of sending helicopter batteries , the United States shipped four electrical fuses for Minuteman nuclear missile warheads to Taiwan , a mistake that was discovered only last week  a year and a half after the erroneous shipment , Pentagon officials disclosed on Tuesday .
Officials said the nose - cone fuses contained no nuclear material , and were similar in function to the ones used for conventional munitions , although these were designed specifically to send an electrical signal to the trigger of the MK - 12 nuclear warhead as it was approaching the ground .
Even so , the incident is another embarrassment for America ’s nuclear weapons establishment , in particular the Air Force , which previously disclosed that a B - 52 bomber mistakenly carried six nuclear cruise missiles on a flight from North Dakota to Louisiana last year .
The United States government is one of the most relentless advocates of halting the proliferation of nuclear weapons , their components and the ballistic missiles to carry them , and has made public cases against potential adversaries like North Korea and Iran .
It has even criticized partners like Russia for not sufficiently safeguarding its stockpile of weapons .
1 . Does the president have inherent powers under the Constitution to conduct surveillance for national security purposes without judicial warrants , regardless of federal statutes ?
Intelligence and surveillance have proven to be some of the most effective national security tools we have to protect our nation .
Our most basic civil liberty is the right to be kept alive and the President should not hesitate to use every legal tool at his disposal to keep America safe .
A President must always act in the best interests of the United States to protect us against a potential threat , including a nuclear Iran .
Naturally , it is always preferable to seek agreement of all  leadership of our government as well as our friends around the world  where those circumstances are available .
3 . Does the Constitution empower the president to disregard a congressional statute limiting the deployment of troops -- either by capping the number of troops that may be deployed to a particular country or by setting minimum home - stays between deployments ?
In other words , is that level of deployment management beyond the constitutional power of Congress to regulate ?
The founders created a constitutional system in which the war power was divided between the President and Congress .
A President must respect the constitutional design while at the same time remain faithful to commander - in - chief powers and obligations to keep this country safe .
4 . Under what circumstances , if any , would you sign a bill into law but also issue a signing statement reserving a constitutional right to bypass the law ?
I share the view of many past presidents that signing statements are an important presidential practice .
5 . Does the Constitution permit a president to detain US citizens without charges as unlawful enemy combatants ?
All US citizens are entitled to due process , including at least some type of habeas corpus relief regardless whether they are designated unlawful enemy combatants or not .
Here ’s something new for 2008 : we will be seeing 3d effects in logo design that will reach different places and stimulate different viewers who are craving for a new , fresh look !
Polish those lenses and see 3D escalate to a higher level !
Let ’s take an example .
You ’re seeing the Silverlight logo for the first time .
Your eyes are trying to absorb every feature and then - you suddenly react .
What ’s your first reaction ?
A breathless “ WOW ” ?
Do you find yourself saying “ aha ” ?
Does the Silverlight logo design trigger a feeling in you , arousing a desire to actually want to see the product that ’s behind that logo ?
That reaction was what the creators of this corporate logo were aiming for .
The logo designer starts with a very basic shape that is applied to a simple transparency effect .
This can lead to a more complicated process , but one thing you must remember is that the end result should look as organic as possible .
Take your distortion tool for a good spin !
We welcome this type of logo design because it stands out and it tells us that it ’s not “ run of the mill . ”
You see , the 3d bubbles and transparency effects – which were overused – were getting really boring .
There is just one downside : ” eye catching ” logos were appearing on the scene and becoming more sophisticated but they are not necessarily the easiest to print .
CARACAS , Venezuela 
In the four days since Colombian forces crossed into Ecuador and killed a guerrilla leader taking refuge there , tensions between Colombia  Washington ’s top regional ally  and its leftist neighbors have erupted , highlighting the fact that Colombia and its policies are increasingly viewed here as American proxies .
President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela called Colombia the “ Israel of Latin America ” saying both countries bombed and invaded neighbors by invoking “ a supposed right to defense ” that he said was ordered by the United States .
He has sent troops to the border and expelled Colombia ’s ambassador .
His agriculture minister said Tuesday that the frontier with Colombia would be closed to stop commerce .
In turn , Colombia said it would file charges against Mr. Chávez with the International Criminal Court , accusing him of assisting Colombia ’s largest rebel group .
Meanwhile , President Bush fiercely defended Colombia , which receives $ 600 million a year in American aid to fight the leftist rebels and drug trafficking .
He used the diplomatic crisis to push Congress to approve a Colombia trade deal that has languished for more than a year because of concerns among senior Democrats over human rights abuses there .

Retired Green Beret Shoots Intruder , Gets Court Martial
Retired Green
Beret shoots intruder , gets court martial
BREVARD , Jan. 19 , 2008 – Retired Army Green Beret Smokey
Taylor got his court martial this weekend and came away feeling good about it .
Taylor , at age 80 the oldest member of Chapter XXXIII of the Special Forces Association , was on trial by his peers under the charge of “ failing to use a weapon of sufficient caliber ” in the shooting of an intruder at his home in Knoxville , TN , in December .
The entire affair , of course , was very much tongue in cheek .
Taylor had been awakened in the early morning hours of Dec. 17 , 2007 , when an intruder broke into his home .
He investigated the noises with one of his many weapons in hand .
When the intruder threatened him with a knife , Taylor warned him , then brought his .22 caliber pistol to bear and shot him right between the eyes .
“ That boy had the hardest head I ’ve ever seen , ” Taylor said after his trial .
“ The bullet bounced right off . ”
The impact knocked the would - be thief down momentarily .
He crawled out of the room then got up and ran out the door and down the street .
Knoxville police apprehended him a few blocks away and he now awaits trial in the Knox County jail .
The charges against Taylor were considered to be serious .
He is a retired Special Forces Weapons Sergeant with extensive combat experience during the wars in Korea and Vietnam .
“ Charges were brought against him under the premise that he should have saved the county and taxpayers the expense of a trial , ” said Chapter XXXIII President Bill Long of Asheville .
“ He could have used a .45 or .38 .
The .22 just was n’t big enough to get the job done . ”
Taylor ’s defense attorney , another retired Weapons Sergeant , disagreed .
He said Taylor had done the right thing in choosing to arm himself with a .22 .
“ If he ’d used a .45 or something like that the round would have gone right through the perp , the wall , the neighbor ’s wall and possibly injured some innocent child asleep in its bed , ” he said .
“ I believe the evidence shows that Smokey Taylor exercised excellent judgment in his choice of weapons .
He did nothing wrong , and clearly remains to this day an excellent weapons man . ”
Counsel for the defense then floated a theory as to why the bullet bounced off the perp ’s forehead .
“ He was victimized by old ammunition , ” he said , “ just as he was in Korea and again in Vietnam , when his units were issued ammo left over from World War II . ”
Taylor said nothing in his own defense , choosing instead to allow his peers to debate the matter .
After the trial he said the ammunition was indeed old and added the new information that the perp had soiled his pants as he crawled out of the house .
“ I would have had an even worse mess to clean up if it had gone through his forehead , ” Taylor said .
“ It was good for both of us that it did n’t . ”
Following testimony from both sides , Taylor was acquitted of the charges and was given a round of applause .
Meanwhile , back in Knox County , the word is out :
Do n’t go messing with Smokey Taylor .
He just bought a whole bunch of fresh ammo .

I love it ... this is priceless .
This man does n't fool around .
He went for a head shot and struck gold .
Too bad he did n't have a larger caliber gun .

Awww - - sweet !
I love it .
If we all used the rights afforded us , I think crime would go way down .
We can't be afraid .
Posted by : Lynn at January 25 , 2008 08:17 AM
That had to be a small brained , hard headed criminal .
Even a .22 at close range should have done him in .
That being said , as a former SF Weapons Sergeant , I only have large caliber handguns and assault weapons laying around .
My big problem facing an intruder would be making up my mind which excellent weapon I would want to destroy him / them with .
Congratulations Smokey on your shooting , your " aquittal " and your nomination .

It bounced off his head .
Maybe it was a glancing blow , rick o'shea , but damn it bounced .
Tom I only like the M1911A1 at close range , nothing better .
That bullet is so big you can't possibly miss at 10 yards .

Great story .
As the saying goes , " Only in America . "

It is not enough to have every intelligent person in the country voting for me .
I need a majority .
Perhaps that quote helps explain why Adlai Stevenson lost two presidential races .
Either because :
His casual arrogance alienated many people ; or People were too stupid to vote for him .
Either way , it ’s a quote that has some bearing on how this coming election will turn out , as many people question whether a majority of the country , having voted for Bush , is capable to making an intelligent decision about who should clean up Bush ’s numerous messes .

MANCHESTER , New Hampshire ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee ’s plan to eliminate all income taxes and replace them with a flat consumption tax has the support of martial arts guru Chuck Norris but few economic analysts .

The former Arkansas governor ’s victory in the Iowa caucus , which kicked off the presidential nomination process for the November 2008 White House race , will bring his policy proposals under closer scrutiny as the candidates do battle in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday .
Much of the focus has been on the social conservatism of Huckabee , an ordained Baptist preacher who has connected solidly with his party ’s influential evangelical base .
But some of his supporters have been attracted by his populist tax plan , which calls for an end to all income and payroll taxes .
It is the key plank of his economic platform .
“ Putting the IRS out of business ” has been a common refrain in his speeches in both Iowa and New Hampshire and it always draws some of the most enthusiastic applause .
Huckabee says taxing income is a tax on productivity that stifles economic growth and hits the middle class and small businesses the hardest .
“ The FairTax will replace the Internal Revenue Code with a consumption tax ...
All of us will get a monthly rebate that will reimburse us for taxes on purchases up to the poverty line ...
That means people below the poverty line wo n’t be taxed at all , ” says his Web site .
“ All our headaches and heartburn from tax stress will vanish .
Instead we will have the FairTax , a simple tax based on wealth .
When the FairTax becomes law , it will be like waving a magic wand releasing us from pain and unfairness , ” it says .
Analysts see some sleight of hand here .

“ To truly equal today ’s federal revenue take , to be revenue neutral , the flat tax has to be quite high -- usually higher than is advertised up front , ” said Richard DeKaser , chief economist at National City Corp in Cleveland .
UNDERGROUND TRANSACTIONS ?
“ And the complication that comes with that is it encourages underground economic activity .
People will increasingly try to circumvent the tax system by doing transactions under the table , ” he said .
Analysts also see it as regressive -- as it is the same rate across the board regardless of income -- even if Huckabee ’s plan does make provisions to exempt the poor .
On Sunday , Huckabee was asked about Bush administration criticism that his plan would reduce taxes for those making less than $ 30,000 a year or more than $ 200,000 but raise them for everyone else .
“ Of course they do n’t like the fair tax , ” he said on Fox News .
“ These are the guys that are going to go out of business .
Thirty - five thousand lobbyists in Washington -- do you think they like the idea that a tax would be so simple that they could n’t really go in there and tinker with the congressmen ? ”
Given the U.S. government ’s massive revenue needs , Huckabee ’s plan is not seen as feasible , although abolishing the Internal Revenue Service appeals to many Americans .
“ I think the fair tax is a great idea .
It would be great to get rid of income tax ... it really stops people from growing businesses , ” said Bruce Weinfeld , 41 , who went from New York to Londonderry , New Hampshire , to attend a Huckabee rally .
It is a policy proposal that also could resonate in New Hampshire , which has no state income tax and where evangelicals are less numerous than in Iowa .
The speeches that Huckabee has given in New Hampshire since his Thursday Iowa victory have put more emphasis on his tax plan and less on his opposition to abortion and gay rights .
Huckabee ’s “ FairTax ” idea caught the attention of action movie actor Chuck Norris , who has been traveling with him in what has been dubbed the “ Huck and Chuck ” show .
Norris tells crowds that young conservative bloggers sent him e-mails about Huckabee ’s tax plan , selling him on the man .

The year is not starting off well on Wall Street .
Stocks plunged on Thursday as investors confronted new indications of the depth of subprime losses and housing woes .
The Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 300 points , bringing its decline to 15 percent since its peak in October .
Since Jan. 1 alone , the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index , a broad measure of the financial markets , is down more than 9 percent .
And the Russell 2000 index , which tracks small companies , is now officially in a bear market , 20 percent below its peak .
A dismal report on manufacturing activity caught investors by surprise on Thursday morning , sending the main indexes into the red after an early stint in positive territory .
The report , from the Federal Reserve , found that Philadelphia - area manufacturers had contracted much more than expected in a January survey , reaching a six - year low .
A similar drop in the index occurred in early 2001 , just before the onset of the last recession .
Events like the one announced for the 2nd of May will allow Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and his team to show off their new hardware and what strategies they are currently planning .
It is speculated that this year they will be looking for a revision of the popular Surface Pro .
This is due to the fact that the Pro line has n’t seen any update since 2015 and with Intel ’s new processors rolling out , this will give them the opportunity to release a Pro 5 and maintain them in the game .
While this might not be the most exciting thing they could announce , it could be done to ensure that the Surface Pro 5 will remain relevant .
Microsoft has a solid group of manufacturers to ensure that the hardware side of things will be kept on going , but it will need to promote it .
Currently , Microsoft is increasing its focus on cloud - centered services .
Outlook and Office suites are getting replaced by OneDrive storage or Redmond ’s cloud covers .
This makes it easily accessible with all operation systems like Android , iOS , macOS .
Of course , Windows 10 will be closely integrated and will increase adoption of cloud systems .
Windows Cloud could be a massive opportunity for them to trim the hardware requirements and offer manufacturers a new product line , and as such , add more users in the cloud .
This will also come as an alternative to the Chromebook , which does not only pose a threat to the Windows OS but also ties down users to Google ’s cloud and not Microsoft’s .
Another side of the industry that Microsoft could focus on improving compatibility with low - cost computers .
It is known that Windows 10 is able to function quite well on cheaper hardware , but it is still taking a heavy toll on laptops , especially as far as resources and storage is concerned .
I while back I was telling someone how I found it hard to believe there was a debate in the early 20th century over constructivism .
If it were not for the existence of computers , I would never be a constructivist .
In the early 20th century there basically no computers , so why would anyone defend the constructivist position ?
My friend suggested that for most of the 3600 year history of mathematics , mathematics was done constructively .
He suggested that it was n’t until the mid 19th century did people do any effectively non-constructive reasoning .
I found this very reasonable .
For number theory , all Π 2 statements provable in PA are also provable constructively .
This probably encompasses a large part of the work in number theory .
The rest of the theory may very well have been constructively valid as well .
For analysis , well , if you believe non-continuous functions are n’t really functions , then you have practically taken a constructivist ’s position .
For more information he suggested I have a look at The Introduction of Non-Recursive Methods Into Mathematics by G. Metakides and A. Nerode .
They give a little history lesson in their paper .
Kummer and Kronecker developed an algorithmic theory of prime ideals in 1859 .
His theory of ideal primes was wholly algorithmic , and the criteria for two such formal linear combinations to give the same prime were computational .
But Dedekind was n’t happy with the equivalence relations in the theory and he created the set - theoretic formulation that we suffer with today .
Although the set - theoretical formula is elegant , there are no equivalence relations , the result is a less computation theory .
Meanwhile people were struggling with real numbers and analysis .
In 1817 Bolzano had identified what we call the Cauchy completeness property of the real numbers , but he still did n’t have a definition of what the real numbers were .
In the early 1860s Weierstrass gave a definition of real numbers similar to the modern definition of Cauchy sequences with an equivalence relation .
Once again , Dedekind was n’t happy with this , and in 1872 , he proposed his own notion of real numbers based on set - theory by Dedekind cuts of the rational numbers .
Again Dedekind ’s theory works to eliminate the computational content of mathematics .
In light of this history , a debate in the early 20th century seems more reasonable .
Unfortunately , the wrong side won , but I do n’t think the war is over .
An interesting question arises :
What was the first accepted non-constructive theorem ?
Using Cauchy completeness , Bolzano proved the intermediate value theorem .
This could be the first accepted non-constructive theorem .
Exercise ( easier ) , verify that Bolzano statement was a non-constructive version of the intermediate value theorem .
Exercise ( harder ) , check to see if there are any previous constructively invalid theorems .
Netscape lost ground to Microsoft 's internet Explorer
Netscape Navigator , now owned by AOL , will no longer be supported after 1 February 2008 , the company has said .
In the mid-1990s the browser was used by more than 90 % of the web population , but numbers have slipped to just 0.6 % .
In particular , the browser has faced competition from Microsoft 's Internet Explorer ( IE ) , which is now used by nearly 80 % of all web users .
" While internal groups within AOL have invested a great deal of time and energy in attempting to revive Netscape Navigator , these efforts have not been successful in gaining market share from Microsoft's Internet Explorer , " said Tom Drapeau on the company 's blog .
Browser wars
Netscape was developed by Marc Andreessen , co-author of Mosaic , the first popular web browser .
Mosaic was written while Mr Andreessen was a student at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois in 1992 .
Firefox was created by many of the Navigator developers
After graduation he set up Netscape Communications Corporation and began development of the Navigator browser .
The first version was released in 1994 .
It was quickly a success and dominated the browser market in the mid-1990s .
But other companies followed its success , notably Microsoft , which bundled its Explorer software with its operating systems .
This culminated in a highly - publicised legal battle , which saw Microsoft accused of anti-competitive behaviour .
Although the settlement saw Netscape gain many concessions from Microsoft including the ability to exploit IE code , it has been unable to gain back its market share .
The demise of Navigator was compounded in 2003 when AOL , which bought Netscape in 1998 , made redundant most of the staff working on new versions of the browser .
Many of the staff moved to the Mozilla Foundation which develops the popular Firefox browser .
This browser has a 16 % share of the browser market .
Fade away
Although a core team has continued to work on the secure browser - it is currently on version nine - AOL has decided to finally pull the plug .
" After 1 February , there will be no more active product support for Navigator nine , or any previous Netscape Navigator browser , " wrote Mr Drapeau .
" We feel it 's the right time to end development of Netscape branded browsers , hand the reins fully to Mozilla and encourage Netscape users to adopt Firefox , " he said .
Users of the browser will no longer receive security or software updates after the date .
Old versions of the browser will still be available for download , but will no longer be supported .
Microsoft is expected to launch a new version of IE in 2008 , whilst the third version of Firefox is currently available as a beta , or test version .
The 72 - year - old Paul has plenty of free political time now because no Democrat , not even in Texas , is dumb enough to take him on in the November House election , which will award Paul his 11th term .
On March 4 , Paul vanquished his main Republican challenger in the 14th District by capturing 70 % of the vote .
Other than that , it was close .
McCain 's entourage includes Connecticut 's Joe Lieberman , former Democratic vice presidential candidate , former Democratic senator , current independent senator and probably McCain 's future secretary of defense .
Although that has n't been officially announced yet because McCain first has to win this little thing called a presidential election .
This just so happens to provide photos back home of him talking to foreign leaders like a president and praying at the Wailing Wall while Democrats argue over Florida again .
And John McCain has already wrapped up the September nomination so tightly he's not even campaigning and has headed off on an overseas trip this week with congressional colleagues .
Rep .
Ron Paul of Texas and his thousands of fervent supporters may be fighting more over the soul of the Republican Party nowadays than they are for the actual presidential nomination , se eing how the congressman is more than 1,000 delegates shy of what he'd need to head the ticket .
smaller government , more personal freedoms and an end to American troops abroad wherever his followers are strong and loyal , places like Pennsylvania , North Carolina , maybe Idaho .
But they 're actually all over , even allegedly liberal California , where one branch posed nearly - naked for a Hotties4RonPaul pinup calendar .
Others did a music video .
As noted here earlier this week , Paul 's volunteers are winning GOP influence the old - fashioned way , at the grassroots level county by county , tedious meeting after tedious meeting , largely under the radar of the national media , except The Ticket .
Paul 's volunteers , many of them new to politics , hope to exert some influence on the platform in St. Paul and go from there , the way the 1964 Goldwater generation of conservatives finally won in 1980 with Ronald Reagan .
This is supposed to be a bad year for Republicans , whose turnout in caucus states , for instance , has been low compared with Democrats .
But although Paul has yet to win an actual primary or caucus , he 's taken some fourths , fifths and seconds .
And with a minimalist campaign organization and a ton of money from about 400,000 dedicated donors ( just watch the comments section below for their bounteous vows of loyalty ) , Paul has won about 803,000 votes .
Which , in case you did n't notice , is more than that New York mayor guy with all the ex-wives got , and more than that tall , slow fellow from Tennessee who was a prosecutor and also played one on TV .
In fact , Paul , a former OB / GYN , raised more money in the fourth quarter of 2007 -- nearly $ 20 million -- than any other Republican candidate , including those rich guys from the East who were supposed to walk away with the nomination .
In fact , Paul 's website has a delightful photo display of all 11 Republican presidential candidates .
Nine of them have big black Xs across their face because they 're gone .
And guess who 's not ?
Paul even outlasted ( and easily out - fund - raised ) that Arkansas governor who stayed around forever .
Speaking of money , Paul has now filed his required monthly campaign finance report with the Federal Election Commission .
Knowing how interested The Ticket remains in the Ron Paul Revolution , The Times ' dutiful Dan Morain dug out the Texan 's new report .
Not only does Paul talk the conservative talk , it seems he walks the conservative walk .
He reported having raised $ 34.65 million since he launched his ( get ready , Paulunteers ) long - shot White House bid last year .
Paul reported spending about $ 29 million as of Feb. 29 .
And he reported having an impressive $ 5.57 million cash left in the bank .
Now , get this :
The Ron Paul presidential campaign reported no debts .
Not a dollar .
Not even a penny .
What has this country come to when half the members of Congress run for president and fully one of them campaigns within his means ?
This conservative revolution will not be run on funny money like the Federal Reserve system they want to abolish .

Check out the MTube .
Sure , the name is weird and maybe a little pointless , but the device itself is pretty interesting .
We do n't have a ton of detail on the little guy -- which was put together by Taiwan 's Science and Technology Advisory Group -- except that it 's built atop VIA 's Mobile - ITX motherboard , features a 2.8 - inch , 640 x 480 touchscreen , 8GB of flash memory , a 1GHz VIA CPU , and is running some form of Linux .
The new , miniscule ITX form factor apparently also includes a CDMA baseband chip , which opens up wireless connectivity possibilities for devices of this type .
Right now this is just a prototype , but production is planned for 2009 , and once VIA 's credit - card sized motherboard hits the market , we suspect we 'll be seeing all kinds of new gadgetry like this popping up .

This article contains 10 visual tutorials intended for web designers and newbies on how to apply Javascript effects with jQuery .
In case you do n’t know about jQuery , it is a " write less , do more " Javascript library .
It has many Ajax and Javascript features that allow you to enhance user experience and semantic coding .
Since these tutorials are focused on jQuery , I ’m not going to get into the details of the CSS .
Note : the version used in this article is jQuery 1.2.3

How jQuery works ?
First you need to download a copy of jQuery and insert it in your html page ( preferably within the < head > tag ) .
Then you need to write functions to tell jQuery what to do .
The diagram below explains the detail how jQuery work :
How to get the element ?
Writing jQuery function is relatively easy ( thanks to the wonderful documentation ) .
The key point you have to learn is how to get the exact element that you want to apply the effects .
$ ( " #header " ) = get the element with id =" header "
= get the element with id =" header " $ ( " h3 " ) = get all < h3 > element
= get all < h3 > element $ ( " div#content .photo " ) = get all element with class = " photo " nested in the < div id =" content " >
= get all element with class = " photo " nested in the < div id =" content " > $ ( " ul li " ) = get all < li > element nested in all < ul >
= get all < li > element nested in all < ul > $ ( " ul li:first " ) = get only the first < li > element of the < ul >
1. Simple slide panel
Let ’s start by doing a simple slide panel .
You ’ve probably seen a lot of this , where you click on a link and a panel slide up / down .
( view demo )
When an elment with class = " btn - slide " is clicked , it will slideToggle ( up / down ) the < div id =" panel " > element and then toggle a CSS class = " active " to the < a class = " btn - slide " > element .
The .active class will toggle the background position of the arrow image ( by CSS ) .
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " .btn - slide " ) .click ( function ( ) { $ ( " #panel " ) .slideToggle ( " slow " ) ; $ ( this ).toggleClass ( " active " ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
2. Simple disappearing effect
This sample will show you how to make something disappear when an image button is clicked .
( view demo )
When the < img class = " delete " > is clicked , it will find its parent element < div class = " pane " > and animate its opacity=hide with slow speed .
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " .pane .delete " ) .click ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .parents ( " . pane " ) .animate ( { opacity : " hide " } , " slow " ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
3 Chain - able transition effects
Now let ’s see the power of jQuery ’s chainability .
With just several lines of code , I can make the box fly around with scaling and fading transition .
( view demo )
Line 1 : when the < a class = " run " > is clicked
Line 2 : animate the < div id = " box " > opacity =0.1 , left property until it reaches 400 px , with speed 1200 ( milliseconds )
Line 3 : then opacity =0.4 , top=160 px , height=20 , width=20 , with speed " slow "
Line 4 : then opacity =1 , left=0 , height =100 , width=100 , with speed " slow "
Line 5 : then opacity =1 , left=0 , height =100 , width=100 , with speed " slow "
Line 6 : then top=0 , with speed " fast "
Line 7 : then slideUp ( default speed = " normal " )
Line 8 : then slideDown , with speed " slow "
Line 9 : return false will prevent the browser jump to the link anchor
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " .run " ).click ( function ( ) { $ ( " #box " ) . animate ( {opacity : " 0.1 " , left : " + =400 " } , 1200 ) .animate ( {opacity : " 0.4 " , top : " +=160 " , height : " 20 " , width : " 20 " } , " slow " ) .animate ( {opacity : " 1 " , left : " 0 " , height : " 100 " , width : " 100 " } , " slow " ) .animate ( {top : " 0 " } , " fast " ) .slideUp ( ) .slideDown ( " slow " ) return false ; } ) ; } ) ;
4a . Accordion # 1
Here is a sample of accordion .
( view demo )
The first line will add a CSS class " active " to the first < H3 > element within the < div class= " accordion " > ( the " active " class will shift the background position of the arrow icon ) .
The second line will hide all the < p > element that is not the first within the < div class= " accordion " >.
When the < h3 > element is clicked , it will slideToggle the next < p > and slideUp all its siblings , then toggle the class = " active " .
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " .accordion h3:first " ) .
addClass ( " active " ) ; $ ( " .accordion p:not ( : first ) " ) . hide ( ) ; $ ( " .accordion h3 " ).click ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) . next ( " p " ) .slideToggle ( " slow " ) .siblings ( " p:visible " ) .slideUp ( " slow " ) ; $ ( this ).toggleClass ( " active " ) ; $ ( this ) .siblings ( " h3 " ) .removeClass ( " active " ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
4b. Accordion # 2
This example is very similar to accordion # 1 , but it will let you specify which panel to open as default .
( view demo )
In the CSS stylesheet , set .accordion p to display : none .
Now suppose you want to open the third panel as default .
You can write as $ ( ".accordion2 p " ) .eq ( 2 ) .show ( ) ; ( eq = equal ) .
Note that the indexing starts at zero .
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( ".accordion2 h3 " ) .eq ( 2).addClass ( " active " ) ; $ ( ".accordion2 p " ) .eq ( 2 ) .show ( ) ; $ ( ".accordion2 h3 " ).click ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) . next ( " p " ) .slideToggle ( " slow " ) .siblings ( " p:visible " ) .slideUp ( " slow " ) ; $ ( this ).toggleClass ( " active " ) ; $ ( this ) .siblings ( " h3 " ) .removeClass ( " active " ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
5a . Animated hover effect # 1
This example will create a nice animated hover effect with fade in / out .
( view demo )
When the menu link is mouseovered , it will find the next < em > and animate its opacity and top position .
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " . menu a " ) .hover ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) . next ( " em " ) .animate ( {opacity : " show " , top : " - 75 " } , " slow " ) ; } , function ( ) { $ ( this ) . next ( " em " ) .
animate ( {opacity : " hide " , top : " - 85 " } , " fast " ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
5b . Animated hover effect # 2
This example will get the menu link title attribute , store it in a variable , and then append to the < em > tag .
( view demo )
The first line will append an empty < em > to the menu < a > element .
When the link is mouseovered , it will get the title attribute , store it in a variable " hoverText " , and then set the < em > text content with the hoverText ’s value .
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " .menu2 a " ) .append ( " < em ></em > " ) ; $ ( " .menu2 a " ) .hover ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) . find ( " em " ) .animate ( {opacity : " show " , top : " - 75 " } , " slow " ) ; var hoverText = $ ( this ) . attr ( " title " ) ; $ ( this ) . find ( " em " ) .
text ( hoverText ) ; } , function ( ) { $ ( this ) . find ( " em " ) .animate ( {opacity : " hide " , top : " - 85 " } , " fast " ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
6. Entire block clickable
This example will show you how to make the entire block element clickable as seen on my Best Web Gallery ‘s sidebar tabs .
( view demo )
Suppose you have a < ul > list with class = " pane - list " and you want to make the nested < li > clickable ( entire block ) .
You can assign the click function to " . pane - list li " ; and when it is clicked , the function will find the < a > element and redirect the browser location to its href attribute value .
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " . pane - list li " ).click ( function ( ) { window.location=$ ( this ) .find ( " a " ) . attr ( " href " ) ; return false ; } ) ; } ) ;
7. Collapsible panels
Let ’s combine the techniques from the previous examples and create a serie of collapsible panels ( similar to the Gmail inbox panels ) .
Notice I also used the same technique on Web Designer Wall comment list and Next2 Friends message inbox ?
( view demo )
First line : hide all < div class =" message_body " > after the first one .
Second line : hide all < li > element after the 5th
Third part : when the < p class = " message_head " > is clicked , slideToggle the next < div class= " message_body " >
Fourth part : when the < a class= " collpase_all_message " > button is clicked , slideUp all < div class=" message_body " >
Fifth part : when the < a class = " show_all_message " > is clicked , hide this , show < a class = " show_recent_only " > , and slideDown all < li > after the fifth one .
Sixth part : when the < a class = " show_recent_only " > is clicked , hide this , show < a class = " show_all_message " > , and slideUp all < li > after the 5th .
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) {
// hide message_body after the first one $ ( ".message_list .message_body : gt(0 ) " ) . hide ( ) ; // hide message li after the 5th $ ( " .message_list li:gt ( 4 ) " ) .hide ( ) ; //toggle message_body $ ( ".message_head " ) .click ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .next ( ".message_body " ) .slideToggle ( 500 ) return false ; } ) ; //collapse all messages $ ( ".collpase_all_message " ).click ( function ( ) { $ ( ".message_body " ) .slideUp( 500 ) return false ; } ) ; //show all messages $ ( " .show_all_message " ).click ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .hide ( ) $ ( " .show_recent_only " ) . show ( ) $ ( " .message_list li:gt ( 4 ) " ) .slideDown ( ) return false ; } ) ; // show recent messages only $ ( ".show_recent_only " ).click ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .hide ( ) $ ( " .show_all_message " ) .show ( ) $ ( " .message_list li:gt ( 4 ) " ) .slideUp ( ) return false ; } ) ; } ) ;
8. Imitating the WordPress Comment Backend
I think most of you have probably seen the WordPress Ajax comment management backend .
Well , let ’s imitate it with jQuery .
In order to animate the background color , you need include the Color Animations plugin .
( view demo )
First line : will add " alt " class to even < div class = " pane " > ( to assign the grey background on every other < div >)
Second part : when < a class = " btn - delete " > is clicked , alert a message , and then animate the backgroundColor and opacity of < div class= " pane " >
Third part : when < a class = " btn- unapprove " > is clicked , first animate the backgroundColor of < div class = " pane " > to yellow , then white , and addClass " spam "
Fourth part : when < a class = " btn- approve " > is clicked , first animate the backgroundColor of < div class = " pane " > to green , then white , and removeClass " spam "
Fifth part : when < a class = " btn- spam " > is clicked , animate the backgroundColor to red and opacity = " hide "
// do n't forget to include the Color Animations plugin //< script type = " text / javascript " src=" jquery.color.js " ></ script > $ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " .pane:even " ) .addClass ( " alt " ) ; $ ( " .pane .btn - delete " ) .click ( function ( ) { alert ( " This comment will be deleted !

Suppose you have a portfolio where you want to showcase multi images without jumping to another page , you can load the JPG into the target element .
( view demo )
First append an empty < em > to H2 .
When a link within the < p class=thumbs > is clicked :
– store its href attribute into a variable " largePath "
– store its title attribute into a variable " largeAlt "
– replace the < img id =" largeImg " > scr attribute with the variable " largePath " and replace the alt attribute with the variable " largeAlt "
– Set the em content ( within the h2 ) with the variable largeAlt ( plus the brackets )
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " h2 " ) .append ( '< em ></em > ' ) $ ( " . thumbs a " ) .click ( function ( ) { var largePath = $ ( this ) . attr ( " href " ) ; var largeAlt = $ ( this ) . attr ( " title " ) ; $ ( " #largeImg " ) .
attr ( { src : largePath , alt : largeAlt } ) ; $ ( " h2 em " ) .html ( " ( " + largeAlt + " ) " ) ; return false ; } ) ; } ) ;
10 . Styling different link types
With most modern browsers , styling the link selector is very easy .
For example , to style the link to .pdf file , you can simply use the following CSS rule : a[href $ ='.pdf ' ] { ... } .
Unfortunately , IE 6 does n’t support this ( this is another reason why we hate IE ! ) .
To get around this , you can do it with jQuery .
( view demo )
The first three lines should be very straight foward .
They just a CSS class to the < a > element according to their href attribute .
The second part will get all < a > element that does not have " http://www.webdesignerwall.com " and / or does not start with " # " in the href attribute , then addClass " external " and set target= " _blank " .
Surely if Human Rights
Watch did not exist most of us would want to see it quickly created and would want to join in that effort ourselves .
Its work since its founding 29 years ago , as Helsinki Watch , has been generally exemplary given the conditions it sometimes finds in the 70 countries it operates in .
Yet its research , hypotheses , findings , interpretations , reports and recommendations are not infallible and , in fairness , HRW has never claimed that they are .
Its August 29 , 2007 128 - page Report entitled “ Civilians Under Assault : Hezbollah ’s Rocket Attacks on Israel in the 2006 War ” is a case in point .
This Report raises serious questions concerning HRW ’s recent drift afield from its original mandate and whether it is becoming a captive of those who house and financially support the human rights organization .
For some perspective , HRW ’s most recent Report is not the first it has issued on the subject of resistance to Israeli occupation and aggression over the past few years that has raised concerns within the academic and international legal community .
One need only consult the Mideast section of HRW ’s website recently to learn that it is consistently critical of the Palestinian society in sundry ways ranging from domestic violence to various resistance activities against the illegal Israeli occupation which increasingly smoothers every aspect of Palestinian life .
Unfortunately , a deep imbalance , both in the number of reports being issued against the occupiers and the occupied , in terms of the failure to hold accountable the side committing the far greater abuses of human rights which is Israel has become the HRW ’s modus operandi in Israel - Palestine as well as in Lebanon .
Last fall , in its press release “ Civilians Must Not Be Used to Shield Homes against Military Attacks , ” HRW lambasted Palestinian resistance groups for inviting their civilian neighbors to surround homes that have been targeted for air strikes by the Israeli military .
HRW barely mentioned that 1,500 Palestinians had been made homeless from house demolitions in the preceding few months and that more than 105 houses had been destroyed from the air .
Increasingly , HRW denounces Palestinian attempts at non-violent and collective action to halt Israeli attacks .
HRW appears to mold principles , standards and rules of international law to achieve a political objective .
In its press release accompanying its “ Findings of Fact and Conclusion of Law ” HRW treats the recent appeal to Palestinians to exercise their right to protect their neighbors , and to act in solidarity with non-violent resistance to occupation , as no different from the dozens of known violations committed by the Israeli army of abducting Palestinian civilians as human shields to protect its troops .
Women volunteering to surround a mosque become the equivalent of the notorious incident in January 2003 when 21 - year - old Samer Sharif was handcuffed to the hood of an army Jeep and driven towards stone - throwing youngsters in Nablus as Israeli soldiers fired their guns from behind his head .
HRW prefers to highlight a supposed violation of international law by the Palestinians — their choice to act as “ human shields ” — and to demand that the practice end immediately , while minimizing the very real and continuing violation of international law committed by Israel in undertaking punitive house demolitions against Palestinian families .
They do the same with respect to Hezbollah .
In language that would have made George Orwell shudder , Human Rights Watch ignored the continuing violation of the Palestinians ’ right to security and argued instead : “ There is no excuse for calling [ Palestinian ] civilians to the scene of a planned [ Israeli ] attack … knowingly asking civilians to stand in harm ’s way is unlawful . ”
With due respect , this approach is seriously flawed .
There is no supporting morality or law for this position .
Citizens , Palestinian , Lebanese and worldwide have every right , indeed duty , to project their property and livelihood by peaceful means .
HRW knows better .
As Nazareth - based British journalist Jonathon Cook correctly notes , “ This ( HRW ) reading of international law is wrong , if not Kafkaesque .
Popular and peaceful resistance to the oppressive policies of occupying powers and autocratic rulers , in India and South Africa for example , has always been , by its very nature , a risky venture in which civilians are liable to be killed or injured .
Responsibility for those deaths must fall on those doing the oppressing , not those resisting , particularly when they are employing non-violent means .
On HRW ’s interpretation , Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela would be war criminals . ”
In fairness it must be noted that one HRW Report does urge the Israeli government to ensure that the army investigates the reasons for the shelling that killed the 19 Palestinian inhabitants of Beit Hanoun .
Yet , after four decades of reporting on Israel ’s occupation of the Palestine , HRW has covered most of Israel ’s many categories of human rights abuses and so now increasingly ignores them .
HRW appears to have Human Rights and international law monitoring fatigue when it comes to Israel .
For example , despite thousands of violations of Palestinian rights at Israeli check points every day , they are ignored by HRW in favor of one report every few years .
HRW under Pressure from the Israel Lobby ?
HRW has acted as an advocate with an Israeli brief against the Lebanese Resistance .
As a Human rights organization it should base its judgment of whether the Resistance violated International Law by examining the facts and then applying the relevant legal principles .
In failing to do this HRW violated its mandate in this case and instead argued Israel ’s case while shedding its own neutrality .
–J. Benoit , PhD .
One explanation being offered in America , among human rights and pro-peace , pro-Arab and pro-Muslim groups as well as by Americans seeking to change US policy toward the Middle East is that Human Rights Watch has caved to intimidations by pro-Israeli members of Congress and the AIPAC led US Israeli Lobby .
It is no secret that an increasing number of Zionist warnings and threats have targeted HRW and that some of its personnel and supporters have been advised that HRW would be destroyed if it did not balance its criticism of Israel with “ equal criticism ” of Hezbollah .
There has also been an increase since 2002 , of efforts by some Zionist organizations in the US , such as the Anti-Defamation League , and the American Jewish Committee have been instructing their members not to contribute to HRW until further notice .
In addition , some HRW researchers have long complained of pressure by Israeli officials and threats that HRW would be expelled from Israel if its reports were not “ more balanced . ”
Ever since the US based , but increasingly international , Israel lobby intensified its campaign to intimidate HRW in the late 1990s , which action increased following the IOF 2002 assault on the Palestinian camp at Jenin , Palestine , HRW appeared to increasingly follow a pattern of erroneously interpreting international law such as to refuse the Palestinians the right to resist the aggression and occupation and to protect homes from attack .
HRW wrongly labels these civilians “ human shields ” even while admitting that most of the homes are not legitimate military targets .
Along with this trend , HRW has remained mute about the common practice in Israel of building weapons factories and army bases inside or next to Arab communities , thereby forcing Israeli civilians to become human shields for the army .
HRW has continued its disturbing trend during the 2006 July War when it again skewed legal standards to blame the victims rather than the aggressors .
As Cook has argued in recently , HRW goes soft on Israel because “ constant press releases denouncing Israel would provoke accusations , as they do already , that Israel is being singled out — and with it , the implication that anti-Semitism lies behind the special treatment . ”
HRW ’s annual budget now exceeds $ 25 million .
Its employee ’s number more than 240 with 70 % of its budget estimated to be provided by Jewish contributors .
Its landlord at 350 Fifth Avenue in New York City are Zionists and it is increasingly apparent to some observers that HRW too often follows the expectations of the Israel lobby and sometimes rejects equity and justice to buy peace for itself .
Adding to the pressure on HRW are frequent warnings from Members of the US Congress including Tom Lantos , Elliot Cohen , Shelly Berkeley , Adriana Ros-Lehtinen , Gary Ackerman , among others , including AIPAC , who keep a close eye on HRW while more than once threatening to audit , investigate , and shut them down .
Observations on Human Rights Watch ’s August 27 , 2006 Report entitled ” Civilians Under Assault : Hezbollah ’s Rocket Attacks on Israel in the 2006 War :
“ The timing of the release of the Report led many observers to believe HRW “ was spreading false publicity against Lebanon and weakening the national spirit . ”
One official Lebanese Judicial report on August 30 , 2007 accused HRW of attempting to “ prevent the resistance from protecting its country against Israeli assaults and violating Lebanon ’s sovereignty . ”
The following comment argues that HRW has taken the same skewed approach to Israeli actions in Lebanon during the 2006 July war , as it has increasingly done in Palestine .
HRW ’s view of the law and the facts with respect to the Lebanese Resistance ’s right of self defense during the July 2006 War
Most lawyers , if their case is quite weak on the facts , may , when preparing to argue their clients case in Court , stress to the Court and especially the Jurors , the heavy and solemn weight and technical aspects of applicable legal principles , standards and rules .
They will sometimes tell the jurors that their own personal feelings and intuition do not count and must not interfere with what the law , in the opinion of the advocate , requires .
It is an approach crafted to achieve the desired result and which is sometimes based on legal fictions and misleading technicalities .
If the law is against their client ’s case the lawyer would likely zealously argue the facts in their clients favor .
It is submitted that HRW , in the Report under review , argues technical aspects and certain selected international legal principles it views in Israel ’s favor .
It chose this lawyerly approach because the facts of the July 2006 War overwhelmingly and incontrovertibly support Lebanon , the Lebanese Resistance and the civilian victims in Lebanon rather than Israel ’s actions .
Some examples :
Throughout its Report , HRW explains and tries to excuse its lack of prohibitive evidence by blaming Israeli censorship :
“ Citing national security concerns , Israeli military authorities limited the amount of information publicly available ( to HRW ) about various aspects of the war , including certain information on where Hezbollah rockets landed during the conflict .
These restrictions limited our ability to fully investigate the pattern of Hezbollah attacks ”
“ We also encountered restrictions on information concerning certain industrial targets .
For example , Kobi Bachar , chief of police for the Zvulon district north of Haifa , said , ‘ Hezbollah was trying to hit the petrochemical plants in our area .
We had hits within the factories , but because of censorship , I do not know if I am allowed to give you that information .
In the end he did not provide it . ' ”
“ July 19 , Human Rights Watch researchers visiting Haifa ’s Rambam Hospital met an IDF soldier being treated for an injury sustained when a rocket hit an air force base just outside the city .
He said that the IDF had instructed him not to speak to the press , and in fact the news media never , to our knowledge , reported that rocket attack .
A physician at Rambam who said he treated the soldier also told us that the IDF had prevented that particular rocket strike from being publicized . ”
HRW complained in its Report that “ Israeli censors did not allow HRW researchers permission to report missile hits at IDF bases and / or strategic facilities , or the location of those facilities ” .
The fact that the Israeli military did not make it easy for Human Rights Watch to gather evidence they were seeking , or apparently hoping for , does not justify HRW filling in evidentiary gaps or imagine evidence based on intuition and then use that speculation to issue an international indictment against Lebanon and its resistance .
HRW admitted that Hezbollah ’s claims that its rockets had hit military targets inside Israel more often than the media was reporting were true based on its own findings .
HRW fails to sufficiently acknowledge or weigh the fact that in the north of Palestine , fixed military facilities , such as IDF bases , are located next to or in the midst of civilian settlements , i.e. , the IDF ’s frequent use of human shields .
For example it is well known that the IDF northern command headquarters is located near the city center of Safed — also that the Israeli navy has a major training base on the Haifa waterfront , next to a major hospital and a neighborhood of low - rise apartment buildings .
Moreover , in many cases the IDF fired artillery into Lebanon from locations quite near to residential communities , such as the border villages of Zarit and Arab al - Aramshe .
These artillery emplacements constitute military objects ; in some of its wartime communiqués , Hezbollah announced that it had directed its rockets at such artillery positions inside Israel .
One of HRW ’s most egregious conclusions and misstatements of international law is the following :
“ Hezbollah ’s attacks in violation of the laws of war , when combined with such statements indicating criminal intent , is strong evidence that some Hezbollah members and commanders were responsible for war crimes . ”
HRW concludes there was a violation of international law and then finds criminal intent by joining certain use of puffing or verbal psychological warfare tactics by Hezbollah in press releases including threats to Israeli military authorities ’ regarding possible attacks on certain areas if Israel did not stop its carpet bombing of Lebanon .
In concluding that these elements somehow “ renders Hezbollah members and commanders responsible for war crimes ” is not an accurate reading of international customary law or treaty law .
Words in this context and on the facts HRW offer do not establish criminal intent
As Hezbollah leaders have stated , especially in its experience with Israel and in asymmetrical warfare theatres , psychological warfare is increasingly important in dealing with Israel military and political leaders .
Israel certainly thought so when it dropped scores of thousands of threatening leaflets , sent threatening text messages to Lebanese phones , broke into TV and radio broadcasts and generally tried to gain military advantage by unnerving its opponents .
Moreover , Hezbollah threats had the effect of sending ten of thousands of civilians out of harms way .
That was one of their objectives .
By contrast , Israel warned civilians to leave and then bombed them as they fled .
This occurred at Marwahin on July 15 , at Aitaroun on July 16 , on a minibus in the Bekaa Valley on August 10th and on more than one dozen other occasions .
Did not the Lebanese Resistance have a right to use psychological tactics and increase pressure on Israeli authorities to end their attacks by suggesting it had surprises and intended to match the level of response to Israeli attacks ?
The psychological tactics used by Israel and Hezbollah during the July War were not illegal under international law .
That there are problems with the enforcement of International law is well known .
Also there are some issues that need the attention of an International Conference on Revisions of The Laws of Armed Conflict .
One subject that requires attention and discussion is the one raised during the July War by Hezbollah ’s Secretary - General Sayed Hasan Nasrallah expressed thus :
“ As long as the enemy undertakes its aggression without limits or red lines , we will respond without limits or red lines . ”
This statement mirrors international practice .
Should it be codified by convention ?
Does it accurately reflect international customary law ?
Certainly the history of warfare reveals that virtually every army has used retaliation , sometimes massively .
Dresden , Coventry , Berlin come to mind .
Were there errors in firing rockets by Hezbollah ?
Certainly .
The Lebanese Resistance readily admits this .
Should HRW ’s claim that Hezbollah purposely targeted civilian be credited ?
Not based on the evidence it tenders .
HRW ignored Israeli use of Human Shields
HRW also ignores a plethora of credible reports that Israel used Palestinian Arabs as human shields in the areas north of Haifa by placing arms depots , military vehicles , mobile launchers , and bases near and inside Arab neighborhoods while providing only the Jewish neighborhoods with adequate bomb shelters .
The record of military actions during the July War suggests that Hezbollah may well have known exactly where Israeli military installations were placed and monitored the movement and placement of Israeli mobile positions and launchers before it fired rockets .
HRW admits this possibility but avoids the conclusion that Hezbollah had the right to target Lebanon - bound rockets from Israel as long as the military necessity outweighed risk to civilians .
HRW also condemns Hezbollah for firing on Kiryal Shmona but omits mention of the real possibility that Israel did have mobile military sites in that and more than 20 other locations where civilians were nearby .
HRW offers no proof that Hezbollah purposely targeted civilians .
It leaves to one footnote the mention that Hezbollah urged civilians to leave the area of the Israeli bases and move south out of danger and that Sayed Nasrallah pleaded for residents to move south and away from Israel positions , declaring that “ your blood is our blood . ”
HRW seeks to excuse its lack of proof that Hezbollah targeted civilian areas and to avoid its duty to provide compelling evidence by stating that Israeli base locations are classified .
This remarkably weak excuse for not meeting its burden of proof could be applied to any unsubstantiated assertion .
Most war criminals classify their crimes .
If HRW is not able or willing to provide maps showing the position of Israeli bases in relation to targeting by Hezbollah it should withdraw its unsupported accusation .
The Donald Rumsfeld paradigm ?
One of HRW ’s main arguments is that “ Hezbollah ’s means of attack relied on unguided weapons that had no capacity to hit military targets with any precision .
It repeatedly bombarded cities , towns , and villages without any apparent effort to distinguish between civilians and military objectives .
In doing so , Hezbollah , as a party to an armed conflict governed by international humanitarian law , violated fundamental prohibitions against deliberate and indiscriminate attacks against civilians . ”
Does this mean there were no legitimate targets ?
Did HRW later learn what the targets were ?
HRW reports that , “ In some of those cases , we could find no evidence there had been a legitimate military target in the vicinity at the time of the attack , suggesting it was a deliberate attack on civilians . ”
Suggestions are insufficient when accusing someone of war crimes .
Again , HRW ’s suggestion is not proof of war crimes .
Its suspicions do not meet its required burden of proof or the legal standard to accuse Lebanon ’s resistance of war crimes .
Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is the lowest legal standard to be applied , for such a serious charge as war crimes .
Under international law no one should be charged , as HRW does , with being a war crime unless there is overwhelming and irrefutable evidence .
HRW fails to produce it and fails to meet its burden of proof .
Regarding not being able to find evidence , HRW adopts former US Defense Secretly Donald Rumsfelds edict that “ absence of evidence is not evidence of absence . ”
Rumsfeld was wrong and so is HRW .
Absence of evidence is just that , absence of evidence .
It is a neutral fact of independence significance and does not convict Hezbollah of War Crimes but rather it suggests the contrary .
That there was no apparent a legitimate military target on the date of HRW ‘ research ’ means just that .
But that alone is not probative evidence that there was no legitimate military target at the time Hezbollah fired its weapon .
HRW concludes , “ The justness of the cause does not affect the international humanitarian law analysis . ”
HRW ’s New York lawyers are wrong if they truly believe this conclusion which defies basic common sense , morality and international customary law .
Does HRW believe that there exists moral , political , or legal parity between someone who tries to kill another and the response of the victim attempting to stop the continuing life endangering attacks ?
The Lebanese Resistance had the international legal right and duty to protect Lebanon .
By returning fire in an effort to encourage the aggressors to stop their carpet bombing of Lebanon their defensive action were not on the same moral level as the aggressors .
Neither domestic laws virtually every neither country nor international customary law equates the acts of aggressors with the defensive acts of the victim .
In doing so , HRW errs .
International customary law incorporates international morality .
HRW charges that Hezbollah “ repeatedly bombarded cities , towns , and villages without any apparent effort to distinguish between civilians and military objectives . ”
What probative , relevant , and material evidence does HRW have concerning the actual firings logs of Hezbollah , and what a particular target was at the time of firing and whether or not Hezbollah acted “ without any apparent effort to distinguish between civilians and military objectives ? ”
HRW builds it case on language such as “ In some of those cases , we could find no evidence there had been a legitimate military target in the vicinity at the time of the attack , suggesting it was a deliberate attack on civilians . ”
Even Israeli military leaders have frequently expressed the surprise they experienced by Hezbollah ’s prowess , tactics , and battlefield intelligence regarding Israeli positions .
The fact that Hezbollah chooses for its own tactical reasons not to share all that it knew about Israeli targets during the July War with HRW ( and Israel ) does not prove war crimes .
This is based damage that , according to examination by HRW , did not reveal a definite military target .
By way of Recommendations following its Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law , HRW calls on the government of Lebanon to interdict the delivery of rockets to Hezbollah and implies it should disarm the Lebanese Resistance .
This HRW demand constitutes interference in the internal affairs of Lebanon .
It is for the Lebanese government , not Israel or HRW to decide how its country defends itself .
Finally , the timing of the HRW Report appears politically calculated to achieve maximum publicity for HRW given the great interest in Hezbollah .
Within the next few days HRW will issue its report on Israel ’s activity in the July war .
Given the sensitive , even tense atmosphere in Lebanon / Palestine of which HRW is well aware , it would have been preferable for HRW to issue one comprehensive Report containing all its findings and not single out just one side
The timing of the release of the Report led many observers to believe HRW “ was spreading false publicity against Lebanon and weakening the national spirit . ”
One official Lebanese Judicial report charged accused HRW of attempting to “ prevent the resistance from protecting its country against Israeli assaults and violating Lebanon ’s sovereignty . ”
HRW ’s recent use of harsh , narrow , legalistic judgments on the Palestinian and Lebanese resistance suggests that it has been willing to trim its sails under pressure from the Israeli lobby and as a consequence it may have lost its moral compass and betrayed its mandate .
The international community needs the work of human rights organizations on behalf of victims of human rights abuses .
Hopefully Human Rights watch will reexamine its recent work and draw the correct conclusions .
In the future , all those DVDs you buy could be made from air pollution .
If plans to remove carbon dioxide from smokestacks succeed , the gas could be harnessed and turned into plastic products , new research claims .
Carbon dioxide is emitted into the air by the burning of fossil fuels , primarily by power plants and automobiles .
It is the main greenhouse gas contributing to man-made global warming .
Sucking the carbon dioxide from smokestack emissions could enable a process by which the heat - trapping gas would be turned into a raw material for making polycarbonates , a type of plastic , and keep it from raising global temperatures even more , according to two groups of researchers who presented their findings today at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in New Orleans .
" Using CO2 to create polycarbonates might not solve the total carbon dioxide problem , but it could be a significant contribution , " said the leader of one team , Thomas Müller of the Institut für Technishe und Makromolekulare Chemie .
Carbon dioxide is also cheaper and less toxic than other starting materials traditionally used to make plastics .
Polycarbonates , which are easily worked and molded , are used to make many transparent materials , including CDs and DVDs , eyeglasses and drinking bottles .
Both teams are developing methods to transform carbon dioxide into the starting materials for polycarbonates and expect that people could be watching movies on waste - carbon dioxide DVDs sooner than they think .
" I would say it 's a matter of a few years " before these waste - derived polymers are available to the public , Müller said .

Top 10 Emerging Environmental Technologies
What 's Your Environmental Footprint ?
( NaturalNews ) Encouraged by the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) , pediatricians across the United States have begun questioning children about their parents ' habits , in some cases even filing police reports based on this information , according to an opinion article published in the Boston Herald .
Article author Michael Graham recounts that his own children were asked by their doctor whether their parents used drugs and alcohol , owned guns , or were abusive .
The doctor did not seek parental permission before asking the questions , nor did he inform them that they were being asked ; Graham and his wife found out only after their children came home from the visits .
"
The doctor wanted to know how much you and mom drink , and if I think it 's too much , " Graham reports his daughter saying .
" She asked if you two did drugs , or if there are drugs in the house .
The doctor wanted to know how we get along .
And if , well , Daddy , if you made me feel uncomfortable .
" Graham also reports the case of an Uxbridge , Massachusetts man who had his legal gun ownership reported to the police by his daughter 's doctor .
The doctor filed a police report after asking the 5 - year - old girl if her father owned a gun , then following up with questions to her and her mother about the type and number of the weapons .
Graham blames the trend on guidelines issued by the AAP , which classifies parents as " persons of interest " and encourages doctors to ask children questions in order to uncover inappropriate or illegal behavior .
"
The paranoia over parents is so strong that the AAP encourages doctors to ignore ' legal barriers and deference to parental involvement ' and shake the children down for all the inside information they can get , " Graham writes .
According to Graham , anti-gun advocacy by pediatricians is widespread enough that " some states are considering legislation to stop it .
" " What this interrogation of children demonstrates , " added consumer health advocate Mike Adams , " is just how deeply the medical establishment now believes it has total authority over the lives of patients .
This kind of behavior is arrogant , outrageous and should be outlawed , " Adams said .
Go figure .
Two out of three Americans ( 65 percent ) oppose the Bush Administration ’s proposed rule “ to ease environmental regulations to permit wider use of ‘ mountain top removal . ’
( MTR ) coal mining in the U.S , ” AkA This :
The survey was conducted by Opinion Research Corporation for the 700 Mountains project of the nonprofit and nonpartisan Civil Society Institute ( CSI ) think tank .
Read the full report here .
( pdf )
Other key survey findings include the following :
“ The Bush Administration plan to permit wider MTR coal mining is favored by only about one out of four Americans ( 26 percent ) , including 14 percent of Democrats , 27 percent of Independents , and 42 percent of Republicans .
“ Almost nine out of 10 Americans ( 88 percent ) – including 83 percent of Republicans , 82 percent of Independents and 94 percent of Democrats – agree with the statement : “ Before the United States puts in place new regulations to permit more coal mining , it should first make sure that coal mines and coal mining practices are safe for miners , nearby communities and the environment . ”
The impact of recent mining deaths in Utah and elsewhere are evident in the findings , with 93 percent of women and 81 percent of men agreeing with the statement .
I know in my heart that environmental issues should n’t be a liberal or conservative issue , but why is it that republicans consistently come down on the wrong side of almost all of these issues ?
Could it be that the republicans are taking the opposing view just to oppose the democrats ?
They ca n’t really think removing the tops of mountains in order to get dirty burning coal that will make global warming worse , can they ?
Seems the “ not in my backyard ” also applies to removing mountain tops .
The Civil Society Institute also launched today the 700 Mountains Web site to encourage Americans to comment on the proposed Department of Interior / Office of Surface Mining ( OSM ) rules and simultaneously express their views to their elected members of Congress .
( The public comment period on the controversial OSM rules that would permit more MTR coal mining expires on October 23 , 2007 , so get over there and let them know how much you do n’t like this idea . )
The new www.700Mountains.org site also features a seven - minute segment of an upcoming documentary film entitled “ Burning the Future : Coal in America , ” which focuses on the impact of mountain top removal coal mining in West Virginia .
Civil Society Institute President and Founder Pam Solo said : “ What we are faced with today is a threat about which no American should remain silent .
With nearly 500 U.S. mountains estimated to already have been subjected to the ravages of mountain top removal coal mining , we are deeply concerned that another 500 - 700 mountains could be at risk under the wide - open approach contemplated under the proposed rule change .
Federal officials in league with the coal industry suggest that there is nothing to fear from the rule .
We believe that the much more likely scenario is that a coal mining industry unfettered from environmental restrictions would waste no time in seizing on mountain top removal with a new zeal that would lay waste to major sections of this country and the communities located within them . ”
“ Those of us who live in coal country understand the terrible threat posed to scores and scores of communities that would be under assault if mountain top removal was permitted to kick into even higher gear than it is now ” said Teri Blanton , member and former state chair of Kentuckians for the Commonwealth , a 4,000 - member citizen ’s organization that speaks out on MTR coal mining and other issues of concern .
“ Many of us in Kentucky and West Virginia see this as the last chance to save our streams and open spaces .
If this rule change goes through , the face of coal country will end up being scarred far worse than it is today . ”
Opinion Research Corporation Senior Researcher Graham Hueber said : “ The lack of public support – regardless of political views – for mountain top removal coal mining is one of the most striking results of this survey .
Only about four in 10 self - identified Republicans support the proposed Bush Administration rule .
The softness of this GOP support is evident in that two out of three Republicans – 65 percent – favor more energy conservation as a first step before more MTR coal mining is permitted .
While Democrats may have a more predictable profile on this issue , it is worth nothing that Independents are about 50 percent less likely than Republicans to support the rule and far more likely to embrace increased energy conservation as a more palatable alternative . ”
Key Survey Findings
The ORC survey conducted for the Civil Society Institute found :
“ Women ( 21 percent ) are less likely to support expanded MTR coal mining than are men ( 31 percent ) .
Regional differences in opposition to the Bush Administration plan are relatively minor , including in the South ( 63 percent ) , where most MTR coal mining currently takes place .
“ Women ( 21 percent ) are less likely to support expanded MTR coal mining than are men ( 31 percent ) .
Regional differences in opposition to the Bush Administration plan are relatively minor , including in the South ( 63 percent ) , where most MTR coal mining currently takes place .
“ The already low overall level of support for MTR coal mining drops even further when supporters are told that the proposed easing of environmental rules “ could result in the leveling of 700 additional U.S. mountains over the next 10 years . ”
When the one out of four Americans ( 26 percent ) who initially support the MTR coal mining rule change learn of this fact , the percentage who switch their views approaches one half ( 45 percent ) , compared to just half who continue to support MTR .
“ More than seven out of 10 Americans ( 71 percent ) would “ oppose the use of ‘ mountain top removal ’ coal mining ” for a mountain located within 50 miles of their home .
Half of those surveyed would “ strongly oppose ” such mining near where they live .
Support for such coal mining is present among fewer than two out of five Republicans ( 37 percent ) , 25 percent of Independents and 16 percent of Democrats .
“ More than three out of four Americans ( 77 percent ) agree with the statement : “ It would be better for the Bush Administration to concentrate first on energy conservation to reduce energy waste before resorting to more mountaintop removal coal mining . ”
Over half of Americans ( 52 percent ) “ strongly agree ” with the statement , with certain subgroups ( e.g. , 18 - 24 year olds at 62 percent ) among the most intense supporters .
This statement attracts strong bipartisan support : 65 percent of Republicans ; 71 percent of Independents ; and 87 percent of Democrats .
Women ( 82 percent ) are more likely than men ( 71 percent ) to support the statement .
The level of support for the statement in the coal - rich South ( 78 percent ) is roughly the same as in the rest of the nation .
“ On an unaided basis , almost half ( 45 percent ) of Americans say that they “ have heard of a coal mining industry practice known as ‘ mountain top removal , ’ which involves the leveling of an entire mountain to get at coal and the filling in of nearby valleys and streams with the removed rock and soil from the mountain . ”
Men ( 54 percent ) were more likely than women ( 37 percent ) to say that they know about MTR coal mining on an unaided basis .
Full survey findings are available online at www.700Mountains.org and www.CivilSocietyInstitute.org.
The Civil Society Institute recognizes that the scarcity of quality information about the impact of mountain top removal ( MTR ) coal mining to date is a major problem that needs to be addressed .
The estimate of nearly 500 mountains that have been so far impacted by MTR is based on mapping - and permit - based researched conducted by Appalachian Voices ( AV ) for their National Memorial for Mountains Project , which to date has identified 470 such mountains .
The rough projection by the Civil Society Institute of a potential impact felt during the next 10 years of 500 - 700 additional mountains is based on ( 1 ) the AV research about the toll of MTR to date , ( 2 ) the conservative acreage and stream impacts in the environmental impact statement ( EIS ) accompanying the OSM rules and ( 3 ) CSI ’s strong view that the coal mining industry is likely to exploit the new rule to fullest in the event that the rule is adopted .
CSI acknowledges that this estimate is , by necessity , based on the limited amount of available data and subject to further research / verification .
The Civil Society Institute is fully supportive of any and all efforts to improve the extent , quality and availability of MTR impact data .
The ORC survey results reported for the Civil Society Institute are based on telephone interviews conducted among a sample of 1,001 adults ( 501 men and 500 women ) age 18 and over , living in private households , in the continental United States .
Interviewing was completed during the period of August 30 - September 2 , 2007 .
Completed interviews of the 1,001 adults were weighted by four variables : age , sex , geographic region , and race , to ensure reliable and accurate representation of the total adult population .
The margin of error at a 95 percent confidence level is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the sample of 1,001 adults .
Smaller sub - groups will have larger error margins .
Many in the Central Valley farm town of Lindsay were shocked when a man was arrested after allegedly viewing photos of nude boys on a computer in the local library .
But even more shocking was the dismissal two days later of the library branch ’s lone employee , who said she alerted police over the objections of her supervisor .
The firing of aide Brenda Biesterfeld has prompted a prayer vigil outside the library , a stinging letter from the City Council to Tulare County officials , rumblings about the town of 11,000 breaking off from the county library system and a wave of anger throughout the community
On Tuesday , an organization promoting “ family - friendly ” libraries honored Biesterfeld , 46 , a single mother of two , before the Lindsay City Council .
Attorneys connected with a conservative legal group based at Jerry Falwell ’s Liberty University have taken up her cause , threatening to sue the county .
Local firefighters are talking about giving her some of the proceeds from a department fundraiser next month .
“ As a community , we are extremely upset , ” said Suzi Picaso , a Lindsay councilwoman and former president of the local chamber of commerce .
“ We want to make sure that people who move here know we have policies in place to keep our children safe .
If the library ’s policy is to not report such viewing , then we might have to break our partnership with them . ”
County officials Tuesday offered to have the dispute mediated by a retired judge .
They say there is no policy that keeps librarians from reporting child pornography and that Biesterfeld ’s firing -- which occurred two weeks before her six - month probation was to end -- had nothing to do with her report to police .
Unless she consents to disclosure of her personnel files , however , privacy laws prevent them from proving their point .
“ She can say whatever she chooses , and we ca n’t respond , ” said Tulare County Counsel Kathleen Bales - Lange .
Biesterfeld could not be reached for comment .
An attorney for suspect Donny Lynn Chrisler said there was no evidence that his client did anything wrong at either the library or his home , where authorities said they found a number of explicit images after his arrest .
Chrisler , 39 , is a library regular who is deaf .
A diagnosed schizophrenic , he is being held at Tulare County Jail on $ 100,000 bond .
By Biesterfeld ’s account , the uproar started Feb. 28 , when she saw Chrisler staring at photos of naked , blond boys .
She was sickened , she said , and called her supervisor , Judi Hill .
According to Biesterfeld , Hill told her to give the man a note ordering him to stop .
When Biesterfeld suggested calling the police , Hill told her not to do it , her attorneys said .
But the next day Biesterfeld , nagged by doubts , used her lunch hour to visit the police station next door .
She was told to contact the station if the same thing happened again , said Mathew Staver , one of her attorneys .
“ She was doing the moral and legal thing that anyone would do , ” he said .
“ When you see someone viewing child pornography , you report it to the proper authorities . ”
On March 4 , she called police when she saw Chrisler allegedly viewing the same kind of images .
Police arrested him and confiscated the computer as evidence .
They then received an angry call from Hill , who told them they had violated Chrisler ’s “ privacy rights , ” according to a letter Biesterfeld ’s lawyers sent county officials .
Biesterfeld was fired March 6 for unacceptable performance -- an allegation her attorneys deny , pointing to a favorable job review six weeks earlier .
The brouhaha riled city officials .
“ Our alarm bells really went off when we heard of a library supervisor questioning the right of our Police Department to confiscate a computer and investigate a crime , ” said City Manager Scot Townsend .
The incident also inflamed a widely held feeling in the area that many libraries are more willing to protect speech than patrons .
“ Libraries are known to sweep these things under the rug , ” said Councilwoman Picaso , contending that the American Library Assn. opposes restrictions on what computer users may view .
Mary Minow , a lawyer who specializes in library issues , disagreed .
She said the library association unsuccessfully sued the government over requirements for Internet filters intended to block child pornography .
But that was largely because the filters block too much -- including , she said , her own blog .
Child pornography is “ not protected by the Constitution or the Supreme Court , ” she pointed out : “ When librarians witness a crime , they call the police . ”
When it comes to explicit photos of adults , practices vary .
Viewing such images is not usually illegal and libraries , such as one in Hawaii that threw out a patron looking at shirtless men on a gay website , have been sued for overreaching .
The distinction could come up in the Lindsay case .
Roland Soltesz , Chrisler ’s attorney , said that all but a few of the hundreds of printed - out images police found at his client ’s house were of adult males -- and not illegal .
Those that may have depicted children were found on web pages with numerous other photos , he said .
Soltesz cast the case as a test of civil liberties .
“ When I go to the library and check out ‘ Madame Bovary ’ or ‘ Lolita , ’ a librarian can call the police and give them my library record just because she does n’t like classics that deal with sexy topics , ” he said .
“ That ’s what ’s frightening in this case . ”
Biesterfeld ’s supporters have a different view .
“ It ’s scary that an individual can think he ’ll go into the library and just view these types of images , ” Picaso said .
“ You can have any type of firewall you want , but the safest firewall was Brenda . ”

Despite the centrality of peer review to the development of a scholarly community , very little is known about the biblical basis and Christian conduct of peer review .
We find that peer review is rooted in several Christian virtues , such as reflecting Christ , being honest , seeking wisdom , humbly submitting , showing Christian love , correcting error , and being accountable .
Given these principles , we recommend that creationists use a double - blind peer review system , wherein the identities of the author and peer reviewers are confidential .
Additionally , we recommend that creationist publishers develop a regular public audit of their peer - review process .
Critics of creationism and Intelligent Design ( ID ) often note that creationist or ID research does not appear in peer - reviewed literature ( e.g. , Crawford 1982 ; Scott and Branch 2003 ; Max 2004 ; Bottaro et al. 2006 ) .
Creationists complain that we are excluded from the peer - reviewed literature ( Anderson 2002 ; Kulikovsky 2008 ; see also Tipler 2004 ) and are therefore required to publish in our own peer reviewed - literature ( Morris 2003 ) .
Critics view creationist peer review as not “ real ” peer review .
For example , recent attempts to launch new creationist peer - reviewed journals have been met with scorn or dismissal ( Sparks et al. 2007 ; Brumfiel 2008 ) .
The irony of this conflict over peer review is that peer review is poorly understood and criticized even in conventional journals .
Over the past 25 years , the process of peer review has come under increasing scrutiny , especially in the biomedical community ( e.g. , Lock 1986 ; Godlee and Jefferson 2003 ; Rennie 2002 ) .
The efficacy of peer review to improve the quality of manuscripts and to minimize bias has been questioned .
Some studies show benefits , while others show no benefits or negative influences from peer review ( e.g. , Armstrong 1997 ; Jefferson et al. 2002a ; Jefferson et al. 2002 b ; Overbeke and Wager 2003 ) .
For every one of these studies , however , there are enthusiastic editorials defending the value of peer review ( e.g. , Gannon 2001 ; Tobin 2002 ) .
What seems certain at this stage is that peer review is no guarantor of the accuracy or scientific quality of a published paper ( Callaham et al.
1998 ; Altman 2002 ; Horton 2002 ) .
These new perspectives on the process of peer review have led to strong calls for changes to the peer - review system .
For example , Rennie ( 2003a ) listed eight criticisms of peer review , including the lack of standardization , the stifling of innovation , and the introduction of malice by reviewer anonymity .
He calls for open peer review , in which the identity of the author and reviewers are known to each other ( Rennie 1998 ) .
Others , fearing biased reviewers , advocate a double - blind system , wherein the identity of the author and reviewers are withheld from each other during the editorial process ( Mainguy et al. 2005 ) .
In response to these criticisms , several journals are experimenting with new styles of peer review .
The British Medical Journal now conducts open peer review and offers training workshops for peer reviewers ( Schroter and Groves 2004 ) , while Biology Direct publishes signed peer reviews with the articles ( Koonin et al. 2006 ) .
Other journals , such as Nature , have resisted the calls to change ( Anonymous 2008 ) .
Some of these issues already exist in microcosm in creationist literature .
In our experience , creationist journals generally conduct double - blind peer review , with few exceptions .
For example , the Proceedings of the First International Conference on Creationism included published , signed peer reviews for each technical paper .
In response to criticisms of the peer review process at BSG , Wood ( 2007 ) published an editorial endorsing the current peer review system based on his own anecdotal experiences .
Presently lacking within creationism is a justification and explanation of peer review from a Christian standpoint .
What are the aims of peer review ?
Is peer review biblical ?
How should it be done given Christian morals , values , and ethics ?
Creationists value peer review ( at least six English - language creationist publications claim to engage in peer review , Table 1 ) , but we do so without a clear understanding of why .
Table 1 . Creationist publications that claim to be peer reviewed1 Title Publisher Date Begun Answers Research Journal Answers in Genesis 2008 Creation Research Society Quarterly Creation Research Society 1964 Journal of Creation Creation Ministries International 1984 Occasional Papers of the BSG BSG : A Creation Biology Study Group 2002 Origins Geoscience Research Institute 1974 Proceedings of the International Conference on Creationism Creation Science Fellowship 1986
This lack of perspective on peer review in Christian circles is not limited to creationists .
Numerous noncreationist , Christian journals claim to be peer reviewed , including Christian Scholar ’s Review , Philosophia Christi , Christian Higher Education , and Science and Christian Belief .
A search of the Christian Periodical Index and the American Theological Libraries Association database revealed only one full paper on peer review , an editorial by Barrett and Mustard ( 2002 ) in Faith & Economics .
We also found a brief editorial note by Haas ( 1995 ) endorsing peer review in Perspectives on Science and the Christian Faith .
Barrett and Mustard ( 2002 ) emphasized the sacrificial service of peer reviewers and discussed practical tips on writing a good review , but they took the value of the peer - review process for granted .
Like the creationist journals , Christian journals at large clearly value peer review without any serious discussion of why .
Our objective in this paper is to open a Christian examination of peer reviewing by developing the beginnings of a biblical and Christian perspective on scholarly publication .
We open the paper with a brief practical and theological discussion of why peer review is important .
Next , we consider biblical passages and principles that relate to the justification and practice of peer review .
We conclude with suggestions regarding the application of these biblical principles to the specific practices involved in Christian scholarly publishing .
It is our prayer that this work will stimulate important discussions of the Christian practice of peer review and help us all to improve our scholarly publications for the glory of God .
The Need for Peer Review
Before we can determine whether we need peer review , it is necessary to define what we mean when we say “ peer review . ”
Peer review is a system whereby one ’s written work is evaluated by one ’s “ peers , ” i.e. , other scholars who are knowledgeable about the topic of the written work .
Peer review may be informal , as when a person distributes a manuscript to a small group of trusted colleagues for feedback .
Peer review might also be formalized in the process of publication , wherein an editor distributes the manuscript to peers who might not even be known by the author .
The purpose of this more formal peer review is twofold , namely to improve the written work ( in content and written presentation ) and to select works that merit publication .
The implicit principle in peer review is that no human being produces perfect written work .
There are almost always errors present .
Some errors are trivial and easily fixed , but others are more substantive and might render the work invalid .
Peer review helps the author identify these errors before they become part of the public record .
This would seem to provide benefits to a number of groups .
The public and other scholars gain confidence that the published work has been scrutinized for errors .
Authors avoid the embarrassment of having identifiable errors made part of the public record .
Given these benefits , peer review would seem , at least in theory , to be a useful tool .
Is it then an appropriate tool for the Christian ?
Christians have two primary commands to follow in all activities : to love God and to love others .
We believe that peer review helps to fulfill both of these commands .
Peer review aids us in loving God by reflecting His character in this world .
Likewise , peer review helps us love our neighbors by putting only the best published materials into their hands .
Ultimately , we believe that these two divine commands can be fulfilled in the peer review process .
Like all Christian activities , we believe that a proper perspective on peer review must begin with God .
God is love , knowledge , truth , and wisdom ( e.g. , 1 John 4:8 ; Romans 5:8 ; 1 Samuel 2:3 ; Isaiah 40:28 ; Deuteronomy 32:4 ; Psalm 146:6 ; Isaiah 11:2 ; Colossians 2:3 ) .
In fact , He possesses all these attributes in perfect excellence ( e.g. , Psalm 8:1 , 18:30 ; Matthew 5:48 ; Isaiah 28:29 ) .
We are His image ( Genesis 1:26 –27 , 9:6 ; 1 Corinthians 11:7 ) and are called upon to display His attributes ( e.g. , Matthew 5:48 ; 1 Peter 1:15 – 16 ) .
We must therefore strive for excellence in knowledge and truth with all wisdom and love in both our personal lives and our public claims and statements .
This must be true regardless of our particular calling , situation , or occupation .
This imperative must include words both spoken and written and articles short and long , unpublished and published , private and public , lay and professional .
As humans we acknowledge that we know in part ( e.g. , Job 8:9 ; 1 Corinthians 13:9 ) and are limited in the attributes of wisdom , love , and truth which we should be displaying .
We are limited both by our finiteness ( Psalm 139:5 ; Job 8:9 ) and , further , by our fallenness ( e.g. , Romans 1:22 ; 2 Peter 3:5 ) .
However , our personal imperfection does not alleviate our responsibility to “ be perfect even as He is perfect ” ( Matthew 5:48 ) .
Rather , realization of our imperfection should force us to be diligent and humble — diligent to strive for excellence in knowledge , truth , wisdom , and love , and humble enough to seek outside of ourselves for the perfection of those attributes , while trusting our failures to God and the blood of Christ .
Peer review can be seen as seeking the counsel of others to assist in our own striving for God ’s excellence .
By striving for excellence , we also love our neighbors .
In our modern , western culture , many people view scientific pronouncements as authoritative .
Christians who are also scientists therefore have an even higher duty to speak with excellence than the average Christian , simply because of the perceived authority that they possess .
Errors made by Christians speaking in the name of science , no matter how well intentioned , can become “ common wisdom ” and thereby very difficult to correct .
Even greater responsibility lies upon the scholar who professes ideas to the general public rather than just scholarly colleagues .
In doing so , the scholar becomes a teacher , with all the attendant responsibilities ( e.g. , Matthew 5:19 , 18:6 ; James 3:1 ) .
We therefore love our neighbors by striving to present the excellence of God in our written work and avoid the dangerous alternative of leading them into error .
Attaining accuracy in work begins with a healthy skepticism toward our own work , manifested by repeating experiments and observations , working to falsify personal hypotheses , and developing and testing alternative theories .
Even this , however , is not enough since the subjectivity of working in isolation — or even in a small group — can blind researchers to alternative explanations or certain flaws in reasoning .
This potential source of error can be remedied by seeking input from knowledgeable colleagues unconnected with the research , thus leading to at least the beginning of peer review .
Unfortunately , personal peer review is not infallible .
There is always the danger that external opinions can introduce new sources of error .
For example , when seeking advice , we tend to select advisors that we suspect will at least sympathize with our ideas .
We have a tendency to avoid harsh critics or individuals with high standards , but these demanding critics are those most likely to detect error and hence are the very advisors that we most need .
Our natural proclivity to avoid them is therefore at odds with our need to exhibit the excellence of God and His creation .
We believe that this need to minimize error combined with the natural aversion to criticism necessitates a formal peer review process , as described above .
By allowing an editor to select our reviewers for us , we minimize the biases introduced by our own selection of reviewers .
The tendency to seek favorable review should be minimized since the editor is ( or should be ) unconnected to the research .
We believe that this model of peer review is the best possible method to balance the need to publish scientific findings and theories with the need to be accurate in our work , and thereby reflect the excellence of God to the world .
Criticism
Despite this need to detect and correct error , formal peer review has serious shortcomings .
For example , Callaham et al. ( 1998 ) described an experiment in which a manuscript with 23 deliberate flaws was sent to 124 reviewers .
Ten of these flaws invalidated the entire study , and thirteen were less severe .
The reviewers detected an average of 3.4 of the major flaws and 3.1 of the minor flaws .
Altman ( 2002 ) describes many serious errors that appear in the published medical research literature .
These results suggest that peer review fails to eliminate error .
Many critics of peer review note the inherent biases involved in the review process , many of which have now been demonstrated to some extent ( Godlee and Dickersin 2003 ) .
For example , Ross et al. ( 2006 ) studied abstracts accepted at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association and found a bias toward authors who speak English , come from the United States , and work at prestigious academic institutions .
Rennie ( 2003 b ) cited numerous anecdotes of innovative ideas rejected by peer review that later became important advances in their fields .
Given its shortcomings and demonstrated failure to eliminate error , why should we spend time and money on peer review at all ?
Before we answer this question , it is important to review the context of peer review in creationism .
We believe that the form of peer review depends to some degree on the community served .
Since creationism differs from the conventional research community in important respects , we believe these differences warrant a different response to peer review .
First , creationism includes a much wider range of expertise than the conventional scholarly community , where most authors are well - versed in their disciplines .
Creationism is a mixed community of trained scholars and informed amateurs .
As a result , the range of quality in creationist manuscripts is likely much wider than in the conventional literature .
In certain papers written by nonexperts , flaws are more apparent to the editor and therefore judgments can be more certain than in the medical literature , where debates over finer points of methodology might be more difficult for the editor to grasp .
Second , the active creationist community ( those regularly publishing ) is vastly smaller than the conventional community .
This influences the identification and recruitment of qualified reviewers .
For example , if all the creationists with formal training in one field coauthored a paper together , what qualified peer is left to review it ?
Such limitations might force creationist editors to rely on less qualified individuals or to seek peer review from noncreationists .
It should be noted , though , that seeking peer review outside of creationism might often benefit creationist theories and ideas .
Third , because the creationist community is small , the journals tend to be more interdisciplinary than the typical conventional journal .
Of the six English - language creationist publications that claim to be peer reviewed , only the Occasional Papers of the BSG restricts its focus to a single field , biology .
The remainder publish papers in any field , from theology and philosophy to the “ hard ” sciences .
As a result the average creationist editor is likely to be editing manuscripts from many fields of expertise .
Reliance on peer reviewers therefore becomes more necessary to adequately evaluate submitted manuscripts .
Fourth , the size of the creationist community could produce a benefit , namely the opportunity to review papers carefully .
Manuscripts submitted to all creationist journals in a given year probably do not outnumber the total manuscripts submitted to a single prominent conventional journal , such as Science or Nature .
The paucity of manuscripts therefore allows us to scrutinize each one more carefully .
Fifth , there is no impetus to publish in the creationist literature ( with the possible exception of individuals employed by creationist journal publishers ) .
In the conventional community , success as a scholar is tied to output of peer - reviewed publications in prestigious journals .
Publication in creationist journals does not usually render a direct benefit to the author and in some cases might even carry a professional stigma .
As a result , the temptation to publish papers of lower quality should be diminished .
Given these differences , why should creationists engage in peer review if it is flawed and potentially ineffective ?
Critics seem to focus on peer review ’s failure to eliminate error , but error elimination is not the goal of peer review ( Rennie 2003a ) .
Rather , peer review seeks to reduce errors , which is a known outcome of peer review .
For example , Callaham et al. ’s ( 1998 ) findings indicated that many errors deliberately introduced in a manuscript went unnoticed by individual reviewers , but they did notice several of the errors .
Likewise , Wager and Middleton ( 2002 ) found that technical editing improved the readability of manuscripts , as well as the accuracy of references and quality of abstracts .
Given the demonstrated biases of reviewers , is it possible to alleviate some of the inappropriate bias ?
Bias against authors might be alleviated by implementing a double - blind review , as described above ( Mainguy et al. 2005 ) .
Studies of blind versus open peer review have found no difference on the quality of reviews ( van Rooyen et al. 1998 ; Justice et al. 1998 ) , suggesting at the very least that blinding does not adversely influence the reviewing system .
Godlee et al. ( 1998 ) found that reviewers who knew the author ’s identity were more likely to recommend acceptance of a manuscript , suggesting that a potential bias toward certain authors had been alleviated when the authors ’ identities were kept confidential .
Within creationism , we are forced to rely on our personal experiences with creationist editing to affirm the improvements wrought by peer review .
We can all attest to improvements to our own work as a result of peer review .
Sometimes those improvements have been trivial , but in several cases , our written work has benefited tremendously from the feedback of peer reviewers .
This paper , for example , has undergone four major revisions as a result of feedback from five informal reviewers and three anonymous peer reviewers .
Given all of these considerations , we believe that peer review is not merely an option to creationist publishers but a duty .
We have a duty to reflect the excellence of God and to put before the world only the best we can offer .
Peer review can assist us in correcting errors in our work , and its flaws can be identified and remedied .
As creationists , the lighter publication load affords us an opportunity to evaluate manuscripts carefully .
Therefore , neglecting , ignoring , or circumventing reasonable efforts to reduce error , such as peer review , would be wrong ( James 4:17 ) .
Biblical Concepts
Since peer review is justifiable as a Christian activity , what then is the best way to conduct peer review ?
We find that peer review and criticism embody important biblical principles related to reflecting Christ to the world , being truthful , attaining wisdom , submitting to others , displaying Christian love and mercy , being accountable , and correcting error .
The first three principles reflect our relationship to God and therefore our duty to love God , and the last four reflect our duty to love our neighbors .
These principles should inform our practice of peer review .
Christ ’s ambassadors
The Church , i.e. , believers in Christ , is the embodiment of Christ in the present time ( between the Resurrection and the Second Coming ) ( 1 Corinthians 12:12–13 , 27 ; Ephesians 4:1–16 , 5:30 ; Colossians 1:24 ) .
As such , He is in us , and we are to be a true reflection of Christ , functioning as part of the body of Christ , which carries out the work that pleases Him ( John 17:20 –26 , 20:21 ; Acts 1:8 ; Romans 12:3–8 ; 1 Corinthians 6:1–6 ; 2 Corinthians 5:20 ; Ephesians 4:20 – 24 ; Colossians 3:12 –14 ; 2 Timothy 4:2 ; Hebrews 10:24 ; James 3:13 ; 1 Peter 2:4–10 ) .
In the scholarly world , we reflect Christ when we seek to write and publish only work of excellent quality .
Honesty
Throughout the Bible , we find that God is truthful ( e.g. , Deuteronomy 32:4 ; Psalm 33:4 ; John 17:17 ) and Jesus is Himself truth ( John 14:6 ) .
As a reflection of Christ in the world , we should strive for truthfulness ( e.g. , Joshua 24:14 ; 1 Samuel 12:24 ; John 4:24 , 16:13 ; 1 Corinthians 13:6 ; Ephesians 4:15 , 25 ; Titus 2:7–8 ; James 3 ) .
Indeed , Jesus commands us to speak truthfully ( Matthew 5:37 ) , as does the ninth commandment ( Exodus 20:16 ) .
Exodus 20:16 , Proverbs 12:22 , and Proverbs 14:25 illustrate the value God places on truthfulness in people .
The call to scholarly honesty requires us to admit our errors and correct them .
Wisdom
God provides wisdom directly to those who fear Him — those who earnestly strive for it in Scripture and prayer ( Proverbs 2:1–9 ) .
Wisdom can be received from others when we seek godly counsel .
Fearing God and seeking godly counsel are often tightly linked in Scripture ( Psalm 1 ; Proverbs 1:1–7 , 20–33 ; 3:5–8 , 11–17 ; 9:10 ; 12:15 ; 13:10 , etc. ) .
Sometimes godly counsel comes in the form of rebuke , criticism , or discipline ( e.g. , Proverbs 25:12 ) .
Godly peers with similar interests , but different viewpoints , should be sought to mutually sharpen our thoughts ( Proverbs 25:11 , 27:17 ) .
If multiple godly advisors concur , an action is more likely to reflect God ’s will and succeed ( Proverbs 11:14 , 12:1 , 15:22 , 32–33 ) .
Scholars , authors , and reviewers alike ought to seek wisdom together .
Humility and submissive servant leadership
The principle that God can use only those persons who are humble in spirit likewise is pervasive ( e.g. , Proverbs 3:34 ; 15:33 ; 16:5 , 19 ; 21:4 ; James 3:13 , 4:6 ; and 1 Peter 5:5 –6 ) .
Christ demonstrated servant leadership in His last meeting with His disciples before His crucifixion ( John 13:1 –17 ) .
In the body of Christ , humility and mutual submission are required ( Romans 12:3 – 4 ; Ephesians 5:21 ) , as is submitting to the direction of God- ordained leaders , who in turn submit to the needs of those in their care ( Ephesians 5:21 , 6:1–9 ; James 4 ; 1 Peter 2:13 –3:7 , ch. 5 , especially 5:3 ) .
Finally ,
God reacts favorably to those who submit in humility and resists activity that is motivated by pride ( 1 Peter 5:5 –6 ) .
Humility is necessary for all parties involved in peer review .
Possessing Christian love
Truthfulness and humility are closely tied to Christian love ( Ephesians 4:15 – 16 ) and mercy ( Psalm 85:10 , 86:15 ; Proverbs 3:3 , 16:6 , 20:28 ) .
We are even to love our enemies and to pray for those who despitefully use us ( Luke 6:27 –28 , 35 ) .
Jesus also commands us to do to others that which we would have done to us ( Luke 6:31 ) .
One of God ’s goals is to draw all people to Himself by the manner of life of Christians ( 1 Timothy 2:1–7 ) and by the love Christians display to one another ( John 13:34–35 ) .
In our efforts to bring down strongholds and stamp out error , we must remember our Lord ’s command to love the people involved — those who are deceived by the error , those who are believing lies , and even those promoting nontruths .
Christian love should manifest itself especially when reviews and editors strive to improve a poor - quality submission .
Accountability
The principle of accountability is strongly ingrained in biblical teaching and examples .
God directly confronted individuals with their sin ( e.g. , Adam , Cain , Samson , David , and Jonah ) .
God also made entire people groups accountable for their sins ( e.g. , the judgment of the Flood , the Israelites ’ 40 - year sojourn in the wilderness , and the Babylonian captivity ) .
We are all accountable to God and should be accountable to one another ( Acts 15:1 –35 ; Romans 14:12 ; Galatians 6:2 ; Colossians 3:12 – 14 ; James 5:16 ; Hebrews 10:24 ) .
Scholars should be held accountable for their actions as reviewers , editors , and authors .
Correction of error
We are to correct error when it is found in the body of Christ ( Galatians 2:11 – 21 ; James 5:19 –20 ) .
Although these references apply to moral error ( sin ) , we believe that they give us guidance for correction of any error .
Love for the person in error and for those whom the error might harm should motivate us to correct that person ( Galatians 6:1 –4 ; Ephesians 5:15 – 16 , 25 ; 1 Peter 5:5 ) .
A relevant corollary is the biblical mandate to begin our correction one - on - one , and only if that fails should we expand our confrontation to more witnesses / counselors in a private setting .
Errors should be made public only if the one in error is recalcitrant ( Deuteronomy 19:15 ; Proverbs 12:23 ; Matthew 18:15 –17 ; 1 Corinthians 6:1–6 ; Colossians 4:5–6 ; 1 Timothy 5:19 –20 ) .
Confidentiality to protect the parties involved is also important ( Proverbs 3:32 , 11:12–13 , 20:19 , 25:9–10 ) .
Furthermore , Scripture draws a clear distinction between evaluating the words and actions of a person for the purpose of restoration and judging unseen motives for the purpose of harm or punishment — the latter being a usurpation of God ’s authority ( Acts 10:42 ; Romans 14:10 – 13 ; 2 Timothy 4:1–5 ; James 4:11 –12 ) .
Again , the “ honest ” mistakes in scholarship are not the same as willful sin , but the principles of moral correction give valuable guidance to both situations .
Practical Advice
Since a good peer - review process can accomplish correction of error in the spirit of humble , biblical correction , all scholarly Christians should support and engage in rigorous peer review .
The peer - review process shares the responsibility for accuracy among the author , editor , and publisher .
Each individual involved in the process has specific responsibilities to ensure that the process is conducted in accordance with biblical principles .
General considerations
Based on the biblical principle of correction , we see that the Bible values correction done in private .
We suggest that implementing this in peer review requires confidentiality to protect the author , reviewers , and the review process itself .
Because we are accountable to God and to each other , we should avoid the potential for bias by removing ourselves from situations of conflict of interest .
Potential conflict of interest by any party should be openly stated from the outset , and reassignment of editors or reviewers should be made as needed .
Responsibility for choice of good reviewers and filtering unduly harsh remarks falls on the editor .
Upon receiving the editor ’s and reviewer ’s comments , the author is to carefully consider the advice and either redress the deficiencies or provide a well - supported rebuttal as to why the paper should not be changed .
Appeal should be possible but within a clearly articulated protocol that protects editors and reviewers from false accusations .
Publishers
Publishers set the standards and attitudes reflected in their publications .
They are responsible for establishing a competent and humble editorial board .
They articulate the editorial and appeal policies that embody the biblical principles above and guide the actions of the editors .
The progress that the creationist community makes toward advancing sound science ultimately depends on the resolve of publishers to uphold high standards , reflecting God ’s character .
Authors
The first responsibility for publishing accurate papers lies with the author .
Scholars should exercise skepticism and Christian humility toward their own work .
By doing so , the researchers will also begin to separate ideas from emotion .
It is very easy to become emotionally attached to our own ideas , but this is inappropriate , especially if an idea is incorrect .
In cases where an emotional attachment has already developed prior to peer review , authors must at least remember that the biblical prohibition against judging ( Luke 6:37 ) does not apply to correction ( i.e. , peer review ) as noted above .
The purpose of peer review is to benefit rather than harm , and all Christian authors must adopt an attitude of humility toward their own work .
Authors should seek private reviews prior to submitting the work for publication .
Accepting criticism is much easier when it comes from a friend than from a person unknown to you , and identifying errors privately is less embarrassing than having a reviewer or editor point them out .
Reviews should be sought from trusted and reliable sources .
Authors should also account for the strengths and weaknesses of their private reviewers .
For example , it could be unwarranted to accept scientific advice from a theologian or vice versa .
By seeking good , private reviews , authors can submit “ one to another in the fear of God ” ( Ephesians 5:21 ) .
Authors should choose an appropriate scholarly publication .
Many publications have specific requirements and preferences that may be unrelated to quality issues .
A publication may focus on a single discipline ( such as biology ) or type of contribution ( such as evidential apologetics ) .
Obviously , an author should respect these preferences , since they do not relate to moral issues .
Authors concerned with achieving the highest accuracy for their work ( which should be the case for all Christian authors ) should seek out publications with the highest editorial standards .
By selecting a publication with a proven track record in publishing high - quality work , authors have a greater chance of minimizing errors .
Authors should avoid thinking that an affirming review ( or even publication ) means that the paper is without error .
It is very common to appeal an editor ’s decision by claiming that someone else gave an affirmative review .
This need not be a relevant consideration , either to the editor or the author .
The editor need not consider the opinion of people outside of the reviewers , unless there is compelling evidence that the outside reviewer saw something that other reviewers missed .
The author also must realize that the personal reviews may also be erroneous .
Editors
The responsibility of the editor is to select submissions to publish , but the editor should not act merely as a gatekeeper .
Rather , the editor ’s first duty is to improve each paper submitted , consistent with the duty of leaders and teachers to serve the church ( see above ) .
Finding a perfect paper is unlikely ; there will almost always be room for improvement .
The goal of the editor , then , is to identify which improvements are necessary for publication .
If the editor and author do their jobs well , another goal of the editor should be minimization of rejections .
The initial evaluation of the article depends on the editor ’s own assessment .
Errors detected by the editor might be simple and correctable errors , or they may be more serious flaws that might actually invalidate the entire work .
In the former case , it seems most prudent to send the paper for review immediately .
If the errors are insignificant and easily remedied , it is likely that competent reviewers will also identify them in their reviews , rendering comment by the editor unnecessary .
In cases of seriously flawed papers , the editor may select from several options .
If the editor believes that the flaws could warrant rejection of the work , the editor might seek additional opinion from one or more peer reviewers to validate the initial assessment .
Alternatively , the editor could reject the paper based on personal judgment alone .
On the other hand , if the editor believes that the work could be salvaged with significant revisions , the editor could request those revisions without consulting reviewers .
This seems best , since it limits knowledge of the error to the editor and author and thereby follows the Bible ’s encouragement to keep such knowledge as private as possible ( see above ) .
Selection of reviewers must be done with great care , with the assumption that wise advisors are more likely to provide good advice .
Reviewers should not be personally biased for or against the work and should be qualified to assess the work .
Because of the potential for personal bias , the editor should not follow all reviewer recommendations submitted by authors .
One reviewer from the author ’s recommendations might be appropriate , but the editor should also choose other reviewers to ensure that any personal bias on the part of the reviewer is minimized , since author - chosen reviewers were found to recommend publication sooner than editor - chosen reviewers ( Schroter et al. 2006 ; Wager et al. 2006 ) .
The editor should select reviewers who are most qualified to assess the work .
For example , paleontologists should review paleontology papers , philosophers should review philosophy papers , and so on .
If reviewers with specific qualifications cannot be identified , the editor should instead use reviewers with the best qualifications and consider their shortcomings when evaluating their reviews .
In evaluating reviews , the editor should not merely passively collect opinions .
Reviewers should be held to the same standards as the authors ( Armstrong 1997 ) .
Reviewers should justify their evaluations with logic or references where appropriate , whether positive or negative .
Unusually succinct reviews , e.g. , “ This paper is fine , ” should be challenged .
Why is the paper “ fine ” ?
What about it is relevant ?
If there are errors , how does the reviewer know ?
Since the ultimate fate of the article is the responsibility of the editor , editors should demand reviews of good quality .
In general , no single opinion should be considered conclusive , but what constitutes a single opinion should be left to the discretion of the editor .
Minimally , no paper should be evaluated on the testimony of a single reviewer , whether or not the reviewer affirms it .
This would be consistent with Moses ’ admonition to establish legal fact only by two or more witnesses ( Deuteronomy 19:15 ) .
We recommend that at least two and preferably three opinions on any given work should be sought .
In cases where the reviewers unanimously agree on the paper ’s quality , no further assessment would be necessary .
In cases where reviewers disagree , the editor should give the benefit of the doubt to the critics rather than those who praise the work , since the goal of the peer review should be error minimization , and it is possible that reviewers might miss errors .
Alternatively , if the editor believes the negative reviews to be unwarranted , they can be disregarded .
Some submissions might warrant seeking more than three reviews .
In general , it seems appropriate that a particularly provocative , controversial , or sensational paper should be scrutinized more carefully than an average paper .
The controversial status of a paper might be evident immediately to the editor or might come to light in the strong reactions of the reviewers .
In such cases , more than three reviewers would seem to be necessary .
These additional reviewers will protect both the author and the editor , either in the case of publication or by preventing publication .
In rendering an editorial decision , the editor should give the author every possible opportunity to revise and thereby improve the work .
Only in cases of irreparable flaws or uncooperative authors should the editor resort to rejecting a manuscript .
In the spirit of humble servanthood , the editor should handle negative reviews delicately .
Reviewers should never be discouraged from giving a negative review , but in relaying that review to the author , the editor should offer some words of encouragement and a reminder that a negative review is not a personal attack .
If the review is especially offensive , the editor may wish to challenge the reviewer to rewrite the review or simply select the most relevant portions to report to the author .
Reviewers
Scholars called upon to review articles should first evaluate their own qualifications and suitability for the article in question .
Potential reviewers should decline to review papers for which they are not qualified and should identify any conflicts of interest to the editor immediately .
A major source of conflict of interest is competition .
Potential reviewers who are working on similar projects or alternative models should identify this bias to the editor prior to conducting the review .
The editor will then decide whether the conflict of interest is sufficient to warrant replacement of the reviewer .
Not all disagreements among authors and reviewers would be conflicts of interest .
It may be that the editor wants an opinion from a scholar who disagrees with the approach or philosophy of the authors .
The primary duty of the reviewer is to be honest .
If the work contains errors , it will do the author no good if the reviewer fails to point out those errors for fear of offending the author .
Remember that it is the editor ’s responsibility to evaluate the work based on the reviewer ’s comments .
Concealing problems on the pretense of “ kindness ” or “ Christian unity ” only inhibits the editorial process .
Furthermore , allowing a Christian author to persist in mistakes and errors is unloving .
As noted above , the editor should do what is necessary to “ cushion the blow ” when communicating the reviews to the author .
The secondary duty of the reviewer is to treat others with respect and to speak the truth in love .
Abusive or sarcastic reviews are disrespectful to the author and the editor .
Reviewers should treat the author as the reviewer would like to be treated .
Again , this should not be considered a reason to overlook error or excessively compliment poor - quality work .
Encouraging a fellow Christian to conduct or publish work of poor quality is unloving .
Reviewers should encourage excellence whenever possible .
Finally , for the sake of the editor , reviewers must write a thorough review .
Barrett and Mustard ( 2002 ) described a three - part approach to writing a review .
In the first part , the reviewer briefly summarizes the work , highlighting the basic argument and the importance of the subject .
Next , the reviewer suggests areas of improvement , focusing on the major weaknesses in the paper .
The review concludes with specific comments aimed at improving the writing or the clarity of figures or tables .
In the case of creationism , following these suggestions may be challenging , especially when dealing with an amateur author who is unfamiliar with the basic conventions of the reviewer ’s field of expertise .
Nevertheless , making the effort to follow these suggestions will help to craft a loving and kind review , even if the reviewer recommends against publication .
Confidentiality
As noted above , the Bible encourages privacy when correcting error , and a good peer - review process should be conducted confidentially and sensitively .
The editor should not share the contents of unpublished work outside the conduct of editorial procedures .
The editor should consult only fellow editors or reviewers for opinions on the work .
In the interest of fairness , the editor should not conduct a private review process that is not communicated to the author .
All peer reviews should be passed along to the author .
Reviewers should also respect the confidentiality of unpublished material .
Only the person asked to review the work should review it ( Barrett and Mustard 2002 ) .
If the reviewer knows of someone who is more qualified to review it , the reviewer should communicate that person ’s identity to the editor .
The reviewer should not pass along a paper to anyone without the consent of the editor .
The editor should also try to make the identity of the author and reviewers unknown to each other .
This is difficult in the case of the author , especially when a previous work by the author is cited .
Minimally , the author identification on the title page should be removed from the paper prior to sending it for review .
Papers or reviews in electronic format ( e.g. , Microsoft Word or Corel WordPerfect ) should have their digital signatures removed or altered .
Accountability
To ensure that the editorial process does not itself fail ( which is always a danger when fallen humans are involved ) , a peer - reviewed publication should build in multiple levels of accountability .
This accountability could include mechanisms to avoid conflicts of interest , a process to appeal editorial decisions , and regular , formal assessments of editorial quality .
These mechanisms will increase the likelihood that the editorial process remains fair and just .
Minimally , every Christian scholarly publication should make the editorial procedure as transparent as possible by publicly disclosing their editorial process in an editorial manual .
The guidelines and recommendations of this paper can be applied in different ways , depending on the circumstances .
For example , a publication may not accept unsolicited manuscripts or may choose to edit stand - alone abstracts differently than full papers .
Disclosing specific editorial procedure allows the public to evaluate the publication itself and gauge the likely quality of any published item , thereby protecting the reputation of the publication , editor , and author .
A clearly articulated editorial manual also protects the publication in the event that a dispute arises between authors and editor .
In creationism , the most detailed editorial manuals are published by the International Conference on Creationism and Answers Research Journal .
Least detailed are the guidelines of the Occasional Papers of the BSG and Origins ( GRI ) .
Most important in the editorial manual is a policy on conflict of interest .
Conflict of interest occurs when an editor , reviewer , or author has some relationship that might cause inappropriate bias .
Within creationism , conflict of interest is prevalent because of the small size of the community .
For example , all six creationist publications that claim to be peer reviewed regularly publish articles written by members of their editorial staff , and none of them has a public policy regarding conflict of interest .
The biggest offender is the Occasional Papers of the BSG , wherein five of the ten published articles were written or cowritten by the assistant editor .
Similarly problematic is the peer - review status of special publications , such as the RATE books , which were funded , written , and edited by the same organization .
Without a clear policy regarding conflict of interest , the public does not know when or if a paper has been adequately reviewed .
To avoid conflict of interest , no editor should edit his or her own paper or the paper of a coworker .
This might require that an editorial team have a variety of individuals who are not coworkers who could edit papers of other editors .
Alternatively , the editor ( and the editor ’s coworkers ) should avoid publishing in his own journal ( which seems unusually harsh since there are so few creationist journals ) , or a temporary editor must be recruited each time there is a conflict of interest ( which seems burdensome ) .
In the case of a journal with multiple editors or a special temporary editor , the publisher should disclose the editor of each article so that any appearance of conflict of interest can be avoided .
Even without a conflict of interest , it is likely that an editor will eventually make an error and reject work of significant merit .
To protect authors who might find their work rejected unjustly , the publication should include a process to appeal an editor ’s decision .
Given the essential trust that should exist between editor and publisher , all appeals must favor the editor .
Formal appeal should commence only when the author has exhausted reasonable efforts to persuade the editor .
We recommend that an appeal committee be composed of other editors of the same publication .
In this way , editors still have final say on the content of the publication rather than a temporary committee of outsiders or an unqualified committee of publishing administrators .
Procedures for the appeal committee and minimum standards of proof should be publicly issued prior to the initiation of a formal appeal .
We recommend that an upheld appeal should result in the paper being reassigned to a different editor , rather than the automatic acceptance of the paper .
In order to avoid the appearance of special treatment or conflict of interest , ad hoc or irregular appeals outside of the stated appeal process should never be conducted .
What if an editor makes the opposite mistake ?
Instead of rejecting work that warrants publication , what if the editor accepts work that is erroneous ?
As long as the editor acted in good faith within the stated guidelines , editorial decisions should not be overturned ( Graf et al. 2007 ) .
Errors detected after publication can be addressed by errata or corrigenda .
On the other hand , a pattern of accepting erroneous papers will reflect poorly on the publication and the publisher .
In such cases , the publisher should seek a new editor or editorial team .
Detecting poor editorial performance would best be accomplished by a regular editorial assessment , rather than an arbitrary or irregular intervention .
Editorial Assessments
In order to assure the public that peer review is being conducted appropriately , publications should regularly audit their own performance .
Statistics on the handling of papers should be collected and published .
Such statistics could include the average time taken to process a manuscript , the average number of reviews received , the average number of reviews received from reviewers not on the editorial board , and overall rejection and acceptance rates .
These statistics might also bring problem areas to the attention of the editors and publisher .
Currently , we know of no creationist publication that publishes such statistics .
The CRS Quarterly published acceptance and rejection statistics in the past but not recently ( Kaufmann 1989 , 1990 , 1991 , 1993a , 1993b , 1994 , 1996 , 1998 , 1999 ) .
Further assessment might include an author ’s survey , a reviewer ’s survey , or some kind of formal review by the publisher .
Such surveys might evaluate the quality of the peer reviews , the editorial communications , or other specific aspects involved in the peer - review process .
When conducting any survey of authors , the publisher should keep in mind that Weber et al. ( 2002 ) found a significant association between the rejection of a manuscript and the author ’s negative opinion of the peer - review process .
Conclusion
Christians will probably never satisfy critics of creationist peer review , but we believe that creationists have a duty to practice stringent peer review .
Presenting only the best information to the public is a responsibility of all Christian scholars , regardless of their opinion about the creation / evolution issue .
Peer review is an important tool for doing that .
Resting upon the biblical principles outlined in this paper , we believe that peer review is godly counsel that will improve our work , including our research proposals and choice of research methods , as well as the published presentation of our results in abstracts , journal articles , and monographs .
We reject any suggestion that peer review is a form of personal judging that disrupts unity of the body of Christ .
Rather , if carried out correctly , peer review acts to unify the body in purpose , function , and integrity .
The status of peer review in the creationist community is largely unknown .
Other than personal experiences , there is very little data about the practice or effectiveness of creationist peer review .
Applying the recommendations in this paper , all creationist publications can better serve the public and better reflect the excellence of God .
We hope that this is the goal of every Christian scholar .

China has ramped up security to quell the Tibetan uprising , with hundreds of military trucks and thousands of heavily armed soldiers seen pouring into the remote Himalayan region .
Huge military convoys were heading towards Tibet , while a build - up of troops also took place in nearby provinces , after a week of violent protests against China 's rule of the region , witnesses , activist groups and media reports said .
More than 400 vehicles were seen heading to Tibet through mountain passes in western China , a BBC reporter said , without specifying his location because of Chinese restrictions on foreign press reporting in the area .

He added he was ready to travel to Beijing .

Tibet 's tourism industry hit hard
Chinese travel companies specialising in tours to Tibet say they expect the security lock - down of the Himalayan region to keep foreign travellers out for up to three months .
Chinese tourism authorities have ordered travel companies not to apply for permits for people wishing to travel to Tibet , and many foreigners have been diverted elsewhere or had their payments refunded , travel agents said .
" The Tibet Travel Bureau said that because of the incidents in Lhasa , they do not want to issue permits for travel into Tibet , " said the manager of one company in Chengdu , capital of south - western Sichuan province which borders Tibet .
" Some people who had already booked tours with us and been issued permits have not been able to go , and I think it will be impossible for independent travellers for some time , " she said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
Tibet has been sealed to outsiders since the weekend .

Only doctors trained and formally recognized as surgeons can claim to practise cosmetic surgery in Ontario , the physicians ' regulatory body has ruled .
The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario yesterday reserved the title of surgeon for doctors whose qualifications it formally recognizes or are certified as surgeons by its national counterpart .
The regulation , however , does not forbid non-surgeons from continuing to perform procedures such as liposuction , nose reconstruction and breast enlargement .
" The regulation that was passed today is strictly about title , what they can call themselves , " said college president Dr. Preston Zuliani .
" Today 's regulation was primarily to protect the public by providing clarity about what the qualifications are . "
Currently , hundreds of family physicians in Ontario advertise themselves as cosmetic surgeons without any specialty designation or training – an issue that sparked demands for the college to crack down on the industry following the death of a Toronto real estate agent last fall during liposuction .
Zuliani added the college is continuing with a program it began last year to send teams of doctors to inspect the quality of cosmetic practices across the province .
While the wording of the ruling does not specifically mention cosmetic or plastic surgery , it was pointedly aimed at the field , which has been drawing dozens of general practitioners and other non-surgeons into its lucrative ranks over the past decade .
" In the past , there have been difficulties where some physicians have embellished their credentials and called themselves cosmetic surgeons , for example , when indeed they weren't , " Zuliani said .
" This sort of behaviour now will be forbidden . "
It will likely be this summer or early fall before the changes will become law , said Ontario health ministry spokesperson John Yoannou .
Zuliani does not yet know how doctors who breach the rules will be penalized .
The issue made headlines last September with the case of Krista Stryland , 32 , who died following liposuction at a North York cosmetic clinic .
Her physician , Dr. Behnaz Yazdanfar , was not recognized as a surgeon by the provincial doctors ' body or the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada .
Yet she , like any other doctor with some amount of training in cosmetic procedures , was able to claim to be a cosmetic surgeon or to practise such surgery .
In November , the college announced it was investigating 16 physicians performing high - risk cosmetic procedures in which there was evidence they were not properly trained .
That investigation is still ongoing , the college said yesterday .
It also demanded another 20 doctors answer a survey or their licences would be suspended .
Dr. Gordon Wilkes , president of the Canadian Society of Plastic Surgeons , welcomed the move , saying that only qualified surgeons should be performing surgery .
" There is quite a bit of confusion amongst the public about what a cosmetic surgeon is , " Wilkes said from Edmonton .
" Most people who use the terms are not plastic surgeons and many are not surgeons at all , but the public presumes that they are plastic surgeons because they view them as synonymous . "
Wilkes said most plastic surgeons , who spend at least five years in post - medical school training , would view claims made by many general practitioners that they were properly trained in cosmetic procedures as laughable .
As well , he said , undertrained doctors have caused tremendous harm in doing cosmetic surgeries .
" Surgery is n't something you can learn on a weekend course , " he said .
Canadian - trained doctors who are surgeons will have the letters FRCSC , which means they are a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Canada , Wilkes said .
" Ideally , I do n't think anyone should be calling themselves a cosmetic surgeon , you should call yourself what you are , " he said .
" It should be clear to the public who they are dealing with . "
Toronto cosmetic surgeon Dr. Bill Middleton , who has more than six years of surgical training and is recognized by the Royal College , said the move will clarify things for people seeking cosmetic procedures .

" The way doctors have described themselves in the past has caused a lot of confusion for patients , " said Middleton , who specialized in head and neck surgery before turning to a cosmetic practice .
A Star investigation last September documented years of dithering by the college about whether to crack down on unqualified cosmetic surgeons .
College council briefing notes and discussion papers from as far back as the early 1990s showed years of lax standards and unenforced regulations , even as college officials quietly raised concerns about family doctors conducting cosmetic procedures without oversight or training .
Three weeks after the story , the college sent out mandatory surveys to 406 physicians requesting details about their cosmetic procedures to determine whether a " practice assessment " by the college was necessary .

Apparently , the state of Arizona , fearing the coming old - folks demographic boom , is looking to create programs to keep older Americans working longer ( and by extension off the government teat longer ) .
The thought of millions of boomers taking their early - retirement
benefits is causing concern about the stability of Social Security and
Medicare .
" We know not everybody is going to up and retire all at once , " Starns
said , " and we will have younger workers coming in .
But if you look at
all the demographics , there just wo n't be enough people to fill all the
jobs that could be vacant . "
Add that possibility to existing shortages of workers in health - care
and other fields , she said , and " there could be some pretty significant
problems in society . "
Arizona , which launched its Mature Workforce Initiative in 2005 to
avert such a crisis , was one of five states lauded last month for
efforts to engage people 50 and older in meaningful jobs and community
service .
The San Francisco - based Civic Ventures think tank also cited
California , Maryland , New York and Massachusetts , saying the five
states recognize older workers as " an experience dividend , " rather than
a drain on resources .
Of course , since it is government , the state of Arizona is , with one hand , patting itself on the back for instituting vague and meaningless but well publicized programs nominally targeted at this issue , while with the other taking steps that have real and substantial effects in exactly the opposite direction .
First , Arizona has some of the toughest laws in the country to penalize businesses for hiring , even accidentally , young vigorous immigrants who do n't have all their government licenses in order .
Young workers are pouring into this state every day , but Arizona is turning them away and locking them up .
Second , Arizona has been legislating as fast as it can to make it nearly impossible to hire older workers .
I know , because the vast majority of my work force managing campgrounds is over 65 .
These workers tend to work for a free camp site plus minimum wage .
They like the job despite the low pay because they get a place to park their RV and because the job is part time and very flexible in how they work ( not to mention offers the opportunity to take whole chunks of the year off ) .
I like these workers because they are experienced and reliable and paying them minimum wage helps offset their slowing productivity and higher workers comp costs as they age .
Here is the math : Older workers might work 30 - 50 % slower than a younger worker ( I have workers right now in their nineties ! )
They also have higher workers comp costs , maybe equating to as much as 10 % of wages .
This means that an older worker at the old minimum wage of $ 5.15 an hour might be financially equivalent to a younger worker making $ 9.50 an hour , which is about what we might have to pay for such a worker .
However , many states have implemented higher minimum wages with annual cost of living escalators .
States like Oregon and Washington now have minimum wages over $ 9.00 .
At $ 9.00 an hour , an older worker is now financially equivalent to a younger worker making $ 16.50 an hour , well above what I can hire such a person for .
This means that as minimum wages rise , I have to consider substituting younger workers for older but slower workers .
Last year , Arizona adopted just such a minimum wage system with annual escalators .
Though we have not reached the point yet , the state soon may make it impossible economically to hire older workers .
Already , we are looking at some automation projects to reduce headcount in certain places .
This is sad to me , but in a business where a 12 % rise in wages wipes out my entire profit , I have to think about these steps .
I have to react to the fact that , no matter how many " policy advisers on aging " the state hires , in reality it is increasing the price to my company of older people 's labor vis a vis younger workers .
Symptoms And Possible Causes
Problems Paying Attention ?
Unable To Do The Things You Once Did ?
Loss Of Pleasure And Interest ?
There 's Hope ...
If you 're reading this column , you definitely own at least a couple video games .
You probably own several , and some of you are the custodians of an innumerable collection that you meticulously arrange and then photograph for posting on internet forums .
And you spend at least a decent chunk of your time playing , and another portion still of your time coveting the next purchase .
But what percentage of them have you ever completed ?
Beaten , conquered , finished , whichever your pleasure .
I recently spoke with Naughty Dog Studio vets Dan Arey and Bob Rafei on the launch of their new studio , Big Red Button Entertainment , and they theorized that the average gamer confronted with the average game is more likely than not to leave it unfinished -- and it seems a reasonable estimation .
Rising retail costs mean that for most , it 's damn near painful to crack the wallet open at the game store , and yet implausibly , despite the larger financial investment , it actually seems like we 're finishinggames than we once did .
We demand more engaging , immersive and enduring game experiences -- and then we do n't finish them .
What 's wrong with us ?
Do you suffer from Completion Anxiety ?
Looking for answers ?
Yeah , me too .
There are a few easy theories close at hand as to why we 're finishing fewer games .
" Failure to Complete " almost sounds like a condition for which we 'll start seeing prescription drug ads on morning television , does n't it ?
And as a matter of fact , size , length and depthinvolved .
It 's quite possible that in these areas , modern games have outgrown the available free time of the average player in all of these areas .
And a core portion of the gaming audience has begun to age , meaning time is even more at a premium .
Despite this , next - gen games can no longer escape the court of public opinion unscathed should their available gameplay hours fail to equate , in the player 's mind , to the dollar value invested .
For just one example , early next - gen titletook knocks in reviews and , more broadly , in public discussion , for being too succinct .
These days , few ( if any ) companies can get away with charging $ 60 for fewer than 60 hours of gameplay .
To be fair , games are now much bigger and larger than they used to be .
16 - bit veterans who used to spend months at a time whittling away at a platformer in their clumsier youth can now buy it on Virtual Console and knock out a victory in a handful of hours .
Nonetheless , we 've demanded deeper experiences for years -- those old games are generally a nostalgic snack , not a long - term project .
Now , extensive and complete multiplayer campaigns have become increasingly essential to a title 's success .
Multiplayer 's supposed to add value in that it 's infinitely replayable , as users create a different experience amongst themselves each time .
Yet many users end up spending far more time on the multiplayer component than they ever did on any single - player campaign -- so does n't that mean time 's not the culprit for Failure to Complete ?
So if time 's not really the issue , then maybe our attention spans are dwindling .
We live in a wired society connected to multiple sources of various stimuli at any given time during the day -- and gamers tend to be more tech - savvy than most .
Could this have atrophied our ability to sit still and concentrate ?
We can now hold a gathering of our friends , assign tasks and cope with an evolving environment without ever having to get up and get dressed , thanks to online play .
And while doing that , we can put on the TV , order our dinner , pay our bills and call our parents from the very same chair , all at the same time , all without having to wait for a minute .
It 's easy enough to theorize that living in such a world has made it difficult for us to engage fully with any one single thing , or to invest time in it , if time is what it demands .
fans , for one thing , do n't seem to have a problem making time for their hobby .
And the most oft - cited reason is instant gratification -- the game can scratch that itch with a relatively low investment of attention , behaviors that are almost automatic , small rewards on the way to bigger ones .
Are we an audience of gamers who just does n't want to put time and effort in for the payoff ?
Maybe it 's more persistence , better problem - solving skills we need .
Are today 's games too difficult for us ?
I was recently having that completion discussion with Arey and Rafei because their new studio work is predicated on the idea that frustration and inaccessibility is the reason why many gamers do n't finish .
During the interview , Arey proposed , " Can you imagine what the film industry would be today if you could only watch 60 percent of a DVD and then stop ?
" What , indeed .
Especially given that we 're welcoming a wider audience of players into our world and want to continue doing so , the pair told me that a dynamic difficulty level , that lets the players control how they 're challenged , is the key to a taller stack of finished titles in every gamer 's home .
How many , of the past several games you left unfinished , were either too hard for you to finish or too easy for you to remain engaged with ?
If you could have had control over the difficulty level , would you have finished the game ?
I 'm still not convinced that dynamic difficulty would n't result in a few too many hollow victories for my taste -- what 's the point , after all , of overcoming a challenge that you 've set precisely in your comfort zone ?
But then , that 's assuming that difficulty level is the issue at all .
I 'd say , in fact , that today 's games have gotten much easier Now , the tricky one : Maybe it 's just that a lot of these games are n't very good .
You did n't finish them because you were bored .
You were n't frustrated because it was too hard , but because it was too unwieldy , difficult in the wrong way , or you just hated the characters .
We talk a lot about the promise and potential of games as an engaging storytelling medium -- but words like " promise " and " potential " are words we use when somethingbe there , but is n't there yet .
Game design is trying every day to raise that bar , and what " does it " for some players wo n't do it for others .
Still , it 's a safe bet that there are many games with which you can't necessarily find fault , that are still sitting and waiting for you to haul through that last leg of the journey .
While you 've probably abandoned plenty of games because they were just terrible or you did n't enjoy them , it 's likely there are just as many others that you 're not exactly sure why you never got around to winning .
I 've got plenty of such titles .
In most cases , I 'm much further than halfway through , averaging perhaps 40 - 20 percent left to go .
They 're good games .
Ito finish them , or so I say .
And yet , I just can't , or do n't , or wo n't .
It is n't an issue of time , it is n't an issue of my attention span , and it is n't an issue of engagement .
I 've dumped some 95 hours just into , doing repetitive behaviors over and over again , so I 've obviously got plenty of time and attention .
Those games I have n't finished ?
I think about them , even write about them rather often .
It 's not necessarily an engagement issue either , unless it 's on some subtle level beyond my cognition .
So while we 've suggested that even the most decent of games go unfinished because the investment required is too steep -- time , money , attention , skills , patience -- how can we really say that , when everything we as an audience say and do suggests weto be immersed , weto commit that investment , weto be challenged ?
Except for the price -- of course we all would like games to cost less -- we 're actually most frustrated when a gameprovide that depth of experience , when it 's over too quickly , when it 's too easy , when it lacks places for us to make an enduring emotional connection .
What if it 's just that , after investing so much , we just do n't want it to be over ?
You poured hours into your character .
You navigated an inscrutable chain of events to obtain his weapon .
You grit your teeth against boss battles , and you came to care about your character 's success .
You fell in love with the world -- why would you want to face its ending ?
After all that work , there 's probably no replay value left unless you 're hardcore .
And even then , the second playthrough is an architecture , a science experiment , a manipulation , not a new discovery .
Failure to Complete analogizes us to the social archetype who breaks up with their partner just when they start to fall in love .
Who bails just when it looks like this could be forever , or who flees at the first suggestion of commitment .
Do n't we have relationships with some of our games ?
Think about it -- it begins with attraction , when you see an appealing description , a good preview , a sexy trailer .
Then comes the skepticism , the scrutiny of the developer 's previous efforts , the steeling yourself for disappointment .
The swapping gossip with your gamer buddies after the first " date , " the sense of careful , hesitant joy as you start to get drawn in .
At first , the new game was all you could think about .
And then , once the novelty has worn off , you realize you 're comfortable .
You 're satisfied -- and coming to the game 's end result might exhaust the possibilities .
You love the game while it 's still young and exciting , so much you do n't want to visualize yourselves married and aged .
You 're afraid of disappointment .
Maybe you sense the game taking a turn for the odd and you 're afraid of the pain of betrayal .
You fear that the ultimate result of all your work will be a letdown .
Or you 're just afraid of being alone and starting over again when it 's all done with .
A shiny new release catches your eye , and before you know it , you 've ditched your old companion for the excitement of a new relationship .
Is our obsession with multiplayer gaming really a deep desire to playwith our online friends ?
Or is it just that we want gameplay that will never nosedive on us , never break our hearts and never be over ?
As for me and my 95 hours of , I 'm about to go and buy all of the rest of the portablegames I do n't have , so that I can collect more Pokemon from older games .
No expense of time , money or affection would be too steep , because the nearly - impossible task of completing the National Pokedex means that I 'll always have something left undone in a world that I already trust .
Even if I can complete the National Dex , I 'm sure the next game will be out by then .
I feel secure in the relationship .
That 's why , despite requiring a good deal more investment than any of my other still - unfinished games , I recently completed the story .
Maybe I still need treatment for my Failure to Complete if I ever want to have longer , deeper , more sizable gaming sessions .
But this is a good start , I 'm sure .
The Wall Street Journal 's Walt Mossberg ( SSD ) and AnandTech 's Anand Lal Shimpi ( HDD ) have each issued reports on the battery performance of Apple 's new MacBook Air models after putting the notebooks through some extensive real - world tests .
For his part , Mossberg pit both 1.6GHz MacBook Air SSD and a 1.6GHz MacBook Air HHD against each other by turning off all power - saving software , setting screen brightness to maximum , turning on Wi-Fi , and playing an endless loop of music .
" In this test , the SSD made little difference in the MacBook Air and , in fairness , Apple is making no claims of any significant battery - life gains on its SSD model , " he wrote .
" The SSD MacBook gave me just five more minutes of battery life .
Apple says this is because its hard - drive model already uses a very low - power drive . "
Next , Mossberg ran a system boot test and found that the SSD version booted up from a cold start , and rebooted with several programs running , about 40 percent faster than the HDD model .
" But the gain isnât as impressive as it seems because even the hard - drive versions of the MacBook Air booted up in under a minute and rebooted in just a little over a minute , " he explained .
Overall , Mossberg dubbed the advent of notebook - grade SSDs a " promising improvement over the hard drive , " but said " now is not the time for most users to buy it . "
Over at AnandTech , Lal Shimpi focused his battery benchmarking efforts off a 1.8GHz HDD - based MacBook Air , as he set out to discount Apple 's ' laughable ' claims of 5 hours battery life .
A wireless web browsing test used an 802.11n connection to browse a series of 20 web pages of varying size , spending 20 seconds on each page .
The test continued in a loop while playing MP3s in iTunes , yielding battery life of 4.27 hours .
A second test simply played a copy of the DVD Blood Diamond — which had been ripped to the hard drive — in a loop until the battery ran out , yielding battery life of 3.42 hours .
In a final test emulating a multitasking workload , 10 GB of files were downloaded in the background while simultaneously running the aforementioned web browsing test , and playing back in QuickTime the first two episodes of Firefly encoded in a 480 p XviD format .
Battery life during this test lasted just 2.43 hours .
Source : AnandTech
For each of the three tests , the MacBook Air 's display brightness was set at 9 blocks ( just over 50 percent ) , and the system was set to never shut off its display and never go to sleep , although the hard drive was allowed to spin down when possible .
Apple 's 5 hour claim is laughable but not as much as I expected .
If I wanted to I suspect I could hit 5 hours by making the web browsing test less stressful , but my focus was on real world usage scenarios , not proving Apple correct , " Lal Shimpi concluded .
" Regardless , 4 hours and 16 minutes doing what I consider to be the intended usage model of the Air is respectable .
It 's not great , but it 's not terrible either . "
AppleInsider is presently putting its own MacBook Air SSD review model through the ringer , and will have some reflections soon .
Meanwhile , readers are welcome to pose questions for Prince — who will be conducting the reviews — and make their own benchmark suggestions or requests in the comments section of this article .
David Blankenhorn , president of the marriage advocacy group the Institute for American Values , said married couples had become a minority largely because of the growing number of households made up of people who planned to marry or who used to be married .
Steve Watters , the director of young adults for Focus on the Family , a conservative Christian group , said that the trend of fewer married couples was more a reflection of delaying marriage than rejection of it .
“ It does show that a lot of people are experimenting with alternatives before they get there , ” Mr. Watters said .
“ The biggest concern is that those who still aspire to marriage are going to find fewer models .
They ’re also finding they ’ve gotten so good at being single it ’s hard to be at one with another person . ”
But Pamela J. Smock , a researcher at the University of Michigan Population Studies Center , said her research — unaffiliated with the Census Bureau — found that the desire for strong family bonds , and especially marriage , was constant .
“ Even cohabiting young adults tell us that they are doing so because it would be unwise to marry without first living together in a society marked by high levels of divorce , ” Ms. Smock said .
A number of couples interviewed agreed that cohabiting was akin to taking a test drive and , given the scarcity of affordable apartments and homes , also a matter of convenience .
Some said that pregnancy was the only thing that would prompt them to make a legal commitment soon .
Others said they never intended to marry .
A few of those couples said they were inspired by solidarity with gay and lesbian couples who cannot legally marry in most states .
Jennifer Lynch , a 28 - year - old stage manager in New York , said she had lived on the Lower East Side with her boyfriend , who is 37 and divorced , for most of the five years they have been a couple .
Why Buy Organic ?
There are many reasons to buy organic foods .
The USDA Organic label tells you that fruits and veggies were n't raised using manmade chemical pesticides , fossil fuel - or sewage - based fertilizers or genetically modified seeds .
On meat , the label indicates that the feeds provided met those same standards , and that the animals were n't administered hormones and antibiotics .
Bottom line : " Organic " is more sustainable and healthier -- for the environment and farm workers , certainly , and often for you and your family .
How is organic healthier ?
It 's healthier because some studies suggest that organic produce has more nutrients than its conventional counterparts , probably because the soil is left in better condition after repeated plantings ; and healthier because you avoid ingesting any harmful pesticide residues left on conventional produce .
But , particularly as the economy sags and millions of Americans lose their jobs , it can be hard to afford the often - premium price charged for organic foods .
That 's why we 've published this updated list , based on Environmental Working Group 's latest compilation of government data about pesticide residue .
The fruits and vegetables on this list were the least likely to have pesticides detected on the parts you eat , after typical washing , whether or not they 're certified organic .
( Remember , though , that the farmworkers and the farm soil , will thank you for any organic purchases you can make . )
For a list of the foods most likely to be contaminated , see The Daily Green 's feature Dirty Dozen : 12 Foods To Buy Organic .
Would n’t it be horrible if our American suburbs starting turning into slums ?
It ’s already happening , according to this article from The Atlantic : “ The Next Slum ? ”
For 60 years , Americans have pushed steadily into the suburbs , transforming the landscape and ( until recently ) leaving cities behind .
But today the pendulum is swinging back toward urban living , and there are many reasons to believe this swing will continue .
As it does , many low - density suburbs and McMansion subdivisions , including some that are lovely and affluent today , may become what inner cities became in the 1960s and ’ 70s — slums characterized by poverty , crime , and decay . . .
The experience of cities during the 1950s through the ’ 80s suggests that the fate of many single - family homes on the metropolitan fringes will be resale , at rock - bottom prices , to lower - income families — and in all likelihood , eventual conversion to apartments .
This future is not likely to wear well on suburban housing .
Many of the inner-city neighborhoods that began their decline in the 1960s consisted of sturdily built , turn - of - the - century row houses , tough enough to withstand being broken up into apartments , and requiring relatively little upkeep .
By comparison , modern suburban houses , even high - end McMansions , are cheaply built .
Hollow doors and wallboard are less durable than solid - oak doors and lath - and - plaster walls .
The plywood floors that lurk under wood veneers or carpeting tend to break up and warp as the glue that holds the wood together dries out ; asphalt - shingle roofs typically need replacing after 10 years .
Many recently built houses take what structural integrity they have from drywall — their thin wooden frames are too flimsy to hold the houses up .
This article documents that many of yesterday ’s suburban Pleasantvilles that are already tipping into decay .
The elephant in the room is the inexorable increase in energy prices .
Cheap oil created the suburbs .
Expensive energy will destroy their affordability .
Why am I convinced that the rise in energy prices is inexorable ?
Because even though we are starting to have a national dialogue that “ something ” needs to be done about energy supplies , very few Americans are taking this crisis seriously .
We continue carving out new suburbs , encouraged by pipe dreams about corn being solution to the energy problem .
Yet we are doing almost nothing to develop sustainable ways to replacing the 5,000 gallons of oil Americans use each second .
We are in deep denial while conservation is still ridiculed by many Americans ( e.g. , those who vote with SUV’s and new suburban and exurban houses ) .
The coming years are not going to be kind to many of those Americans who bought into unsustainable versions of the American Dream .
Obama getting personal , Clinton camp tells bloggers Nick Juliano
Published : Monday March 17 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Hillary Clinton 's internet director has distributed a letter to prominent political bloggers imploring them to rectify the " prevailing misconception " that Barack Obama has not run a negative campaign .
The lengthy diatribe from Peter Daou , a former blogger who 's now in charge of Clinton 's online outreach , comes in the midst of increasing hostility toward the former First Lady in online progressive forums .
The letter , sent to Clinton supporters , opponents and neutral bloggers , says Obama 's tactics are getting a free pass in the blogosphere while Clinton 's campaign faces fire for its own strategy , such as questioning Obama 's commander - in - chief credentials .
" Senator Obama and his senior campaign officials have engaged in a systematic effort to question Hillary 's integrity , credibility , and character , " Daou writes .
" They have portrayed her as someone who would put her personal gain ahead of the lives of our troops , someone who would say or do anything to win an election , someone who is dishonest , divisive and disingenuous .
They have adopted shop - worn anti-Clinton talking points , dusted them off and unleashed a torrent of unfounded character attacks against her . "
Daou is not alone in his belief that Clinton is not getting a fair shake online .
A DailyKos member declared a writers ' strike at the site because of its perceived pro-Obama slant .
The e-mail from Daou has spurred a mixed reaction in the blogosphere , but it does n't seem to have immediately changed many minds .
" At its core , this e-mail from Peter Daou amounts to ' MOM !!!
He 's calling me names !' " writes Jill at Brilliant at Breakfast .
" It 's distasteful because Hillary seems to want to have it both ways ; to be thought of as a strong leader but also a fragile flower who needs to be protected from Mean Men . "
Writing at The Left Coaster , eriposte , a Clinton supporter , sees Daou 's point .
" Some of the top " progressive " bloggers have either been wilfully blind to the campaign tactics of Sen.
Obama or given him a pass while going after Sen.
Clinton in a very ugly and mendacious manner . "
Chuck Butcher , who says he is " in no way connected to the Obama campaign , " sees Daou 's e-mail as Clinton playing the victim card .
" I 've got news for you , you were never inevitable except in your own mind and some lazy journalists ' and you do n't have a teflon coating - your stuff is going to stick to you , " he writes .
" Whine at somebody else .
Better yet , knock off the BS and folks wo n't have it to hit you with . "
Talk Left contributor Jeralyn " agree[s ] " with this line from Daou 's e-mail , in particular : " There is a sharp line between supporting a candidate ( and excusing their faults , which all supporters do to some degree ) and conducting a " full assault " on an opponent 's integrity and character .
The Obama campaign 's unabashed attacks on Hillary 's honesty and trustworthiness should give every Democrat pause . "
Pro-Obama blogger Robster sees the problems Daou notes as simply a matter of one - good - turn deserves another .
" Before you even think about attacking Barack Obama over running a civil campaign , you better take a long look in the mirror , " Robster writes .
" Whomever you see in the reflection is who brought this on themselves .
Your candidate threw the kitchen sink and we 're lobbing it back . "
The Obama campaign did not immediately respond to RAW STORY 's request for comment .
Daou 's e-mail is printed below : I 'm writing this to a group of bloggers .
Some of you are Hillary supporters , some not , some neutral .
I want to address a pervasive misconception , namely , that Senator Obama has n't run a negative campaign against Hillary .
I think it 's time to put that misconception to rest .
The truth is that for months , the Obama campaign has been attacking Hillary , impugning her character and calling into question her lifetime of public service .
And now the Chicago Tribune reports that Senator Obama is preparing a " full assault " on her " over ethics and transparency . "
To those who contend that Senator Obama is the clear frontrunner , I ask , to what end this " full assault " on Hillary ?
On CNN last Tuesday , Senator Obama said , " Well , look , Wolf , I think if you watch how we have conducted our campaign , we 've been very measured in terms of how we talk about Senator Clinton .
... I have been careful to say , that I think that Senator Clinton is a capable person and that should she win the nomination , obviously , I would support her .
You know , I 'm not sure that we have been getting that same approach from the Clinton campaign . "
The facts of this election stand in stark contrast to that statement .
Senator Obama and his senior campaign officials have engaged in a systematic effort to question Hillary 's integrity , credibility , and character .
They have portrayed her as someone who would put her personal gain ahead of the lives of our troops , someone who would say or do anything to win an election , someone who is dishonest , divisive and disingenuous .
They have adopted shop - worn anti-Clinton talking points , dusted them off and unleashed a torrent of unfounded character attacks against her .
Among other things , they have described Hillary - and her campaign - as : " Disingenuous " " Too polarizing to win " ' Divisive ' " Untruthful " " Dishonest " ' Calculating ' " Saying and doing whatever it takes to win " " Attempting to deceive the American people " " One of the most secretive politicians in America " " Literally willing to do anything to win " " Playing politics with war "
To top it off , they have blanketed big states with false radio ads and negative mailers -- ads and mailers that experts have debunked time and time again .
They have distributed health care brochures using Republican framing .
They have tried to draw a nexus between Hillary 's votes and the death of her friend Benazir Bhutto .
And one of Senator Obama 's top advisers ( who has since left the campaign ) recently called Hillary " a monster . "
This " full assault " on Hillary comes from the very top of the Obama campaign , not surrogates and supporters .
This " full assault " is being directed at someone I personally know to be a thoughtful , brilliant , principled , compassionate person , someone the world knows as a good Democrat , a trailblazer , a lifelong champion for children and families , a respected former first lady , a senator , a presidential candidate .
This " full assault " is targeting a staff of hundreds of hard - working , dedicated Democrats , who I 've had the privilege of working with for the past 14 months .
This is a hard - fought campaign - as it should be .
Like any candidate for elected office , Hillary has made clear why she thinks she would do a better job than her opponent .
She has laid out comprehensive policy proposals , put forth her 35 - year record of accomplishment , and spent countless days introducing herself to voters across the country .
She has said that she is far better prepared to take on John McCain on national security .
She has contended that she is the candidate with the experience to confront the GOP attack machine .
She has argued that she is more electable .
She has said that Senator Obama 's words are not matched by actions .
And she has challenged him to live up to core Democratic values and goals such as universal health care .
I recall indignation online at the suggestion that Senator Obama has not made the case that he is ready to be Commander in Chief -- the concern being that this would be terribly detrimental to him in a general election .
As I blogged recently , and as many of you know , I spent 2004 in the Kerry - Edwards war room , and I understand full well that national security will be front and center in the general election .
It 's not a matter of choice .
And the reality is that the public views Hillary as better prepared to take on Senator McCain when it comes to national security .
Democrats must factor that in as they nominate a candidate to win in November .
If that suggestion is potentially harmful to Senator Obama in a general election , how exactly do the personal attacks against Hillary ( which echo and reinforce rightwing talking points ) help her in the event she wins the nomination ?
I recall no similar outrage at those harsh attacks on her character , many of which were directed at her when she was the clear frontrunner and seen as the likely nominee .
Both candidates are running a vigorous campaign .
Both have had surrogates or supporters who have crossed the line and made offensive statements that they rejected .
And these offensive statements are an unfortunate part of a long and close campaign .
Those who make a habit of automatically assuming and ascribing to only one candidate the worst motives , ignoring more reasonable and benign explanations , who substitute conjecture for fact and then use those assumed ' facts ' as a foundation on which to pile more conjecture about only one candidate 's intentions , who express anger at negative campaigning and perceived dirty tricks but focus on only one candidate 's words and actions , risk losing credibility .
And those who conclude from that one - sided reasoning that Hillary ought to stop seeking victory , should ask themselves if quitting in the middle of a hard - fought  and winnable  contest is a desirable attribute in a future president .
Hillary has rightfully stated that as Democrats we should be proud of our field of candidates .
And it is truly inspiring to see the level of enthusiasm among voters this cycle .
We should encourage as many people as possible to become part of this process and to forcefully advocate for their candidate of choice .
But there is a sharp line between supporting a candidate ( and excusing their faults , which all supporters do to some degree ) and conducting a " full assault " on an opponent 's integrity and character .
The Obama campaign 's unabashed attacks on Hillary 's honesty and trustworthiness should give every Democrat pause .
We are all entitled to support and oppose whomever we choose , but I challenge my online friends to call this " full assault " on Hillary 's character for what it is .

Dr. Millin , the state Democratic chairman , said that getting a grip on Wyoming was probably a bit far - fetched , but that the party fully intended to capitalize on the excitement and to lasso into the fold as many new caucusgoers as possible .
The state party has 18 national delegates to apportion  12 to be decided , directly or indirectly , by the caucus votes on Saturday , and 6 more , including 5 superdelegates , who could go to the August convention in Denver uncommitted .
“ We ’ll make the pitch on Saturday that politics and political races are n’t going to end today , and then invite people to help out other candidates , ” said Dr. Millin , who supports Mr. Obama , of Illinois .
“ We ’ll have lists of all the people who participate , and that should make a good starting point for the future . ”

Of course , Democrats do get elected to office in Wyoming .
A tradition of Democratic governors in particular extends back to statehood in 1890 , with more years under Democrats  including the current governor , Dave Freudenthal  than under Republicans , according to Phil Roberts , a professor of history at the University of Wyoming .
And for about 70 years , until 1978 , at least one member of the state ’s delegation to Congress was a Democrat .
( The Republican who broke the streak with his election to Congress that year , ushering in 30 years since of Republican supremacy ?
None other than Vice President Dick Cheney , who earned some of his first political chits here . )
Another historical quirk that could resonate here on Saturday is that one of the worst electoral droughts for Democrats in state history coincided with the years when Bill Clinton was president .
From 1994 to 2002 , not a single statewide elected official or delegate to Congress was a Democrat .
Dr. Roberts said that was partly a backlash to Democratic rule in Washington and partly because the party seemed to have written off Wyoming as a lost cause , a policy that he thinks has since changed .
This is part 2 of 2 in parsing .
Part 1 parses chemical equations using hand - written code .
Parsing with PLY
The ALGOL programming language in the late 1950s / early 1960s introduced the idea of computer languages based on a machine understandable grammar .
The notation is called BNF for Backus - Naur Form .
It was n't until the 1970s though that people understood the practice well enough to write general - purpose tools which helped build parsers .
The first popular book describing the process is known as The Dragon Book because it had a picture of a knight attacking a dragon on the cover ; a hint that this was a hard topic being conquered .
The back cover had Don Quixote attacking windmills .
It taught how to take the theory and turn it into practice .
It 's considered a classic because of its impact but the material is dated .
This is also the time when lex and yacc were introduced as part of Unix .
Lex is a lexer and yacc is " yet another compiler compiler . "
As you can infer , it was n't the first .
The term " compiler compiler " means it uses a language used to build a parser for another language .
The term " compiler " is a misnomer in this case and the classical distinction between " compiled " and " interpreted " language has mostly become irrelevant .
There are many parser tools for Python .
A web search will dig them up for you .
The tools take several different approaches .
The one I liked the most some years back was SPARK , Last month I looked around and found that PLY is the more modern tool for the niche that SPARK filed .
The author of PLY is David Beazley , who is also the author of SWIG .
PLY splits the processing up between the lexer and the parser .
As with the final code in the " parsing by hand " talk the lexer assumes all the tokens are described by regular expressions and assumes they are all potentially values at any point in the input .
This is usually true for languages designed to be read by parser generator tools , but false for most bioinformatics file formats .
( Eg , " GENE " can be someone 's name , a section header and a protein sequence , all in the same file .
The meaning depends on the location in the file .
PLY supports stateful systems like this but I have n't tried that out . )
tokenizing with PLY 's ' lex ' module
PLY uses variables starting with " t_ " to indicate the token patterns .
If the variable is a string then it is interpreted as a regular expression and the match value is the value for the token .
If the variable is a function then its docstring contains the pattern and the function is called with the matched token .
The function is free to modify the token or return a new token to be used in its place .
If nothing is returned then the match is ignore .
Usually the function only changes the " value " attribute , which is initially the matched text .
In the following the t_COUNT converts the value to an int .
import lex tokens = ( " SYMBOL " , " COUNT " ) t_SYMBOL = ( r" C[ laroudsemf ] ?
|Os? |N[eaibdpos ] ?|S[ icernbmg ] ?|P[ drmtboau ] ? | " r" H[ eofgas ] ?
| A[ lrsgutcm ] |B[ eraik ] ?
| Dy|E[urs ] |F[erm ] ?
| G[aed ] | " r" I[ nr ] ?
| Kr? |L[iaur ] |M[ gnodt ] |R[ buhenaf ] |T[ icebmalh ] | " r" U|V|W|Xe|Yb? |Z[nr ] " ) def t_COUNT ( t ) : r" \d + " t.value = int ( t.value ) return t def t_error(t ) : raise TypeError ( " Unknown text ' %s ' " % ( t.value , ) ) lex.lex ( ) lex.input ( " CH3COOH " ) for tok in iter ( lex.token , None ) : print repr( tok.type ) , repr(tok.value )
iter ( f , sentinel )
f ()
BTW , is a handy function .
It callsand returns the return value using the iterator protocol .
When the returned value equals the sentinel value it raises a StopIterationError .
In other words , I converted the sequence of multiple function calls into an iterator , letting my use a for loop .
When I run the code I get the following
' SYMBOL ' ' C' ' SYMBOL ' ' H' ' COUNT ' 3 ' SYMBOL ' ' C' ' SYMBOL ' ' O ' ' SYMBOL ' ' O ' ' SYMBOL ' 'H '
parsing with PLY 's ' yacc ' module
You can see that the count was properly converted to an integer
PLY 's parser works on tokens .
It uses a BNF grammar that describes how those tokens are assembled .
Parsers can handle some ambiguity .
In this chemical equation example the grammar is ambiguous after reading a chemical symbol .
There could be repeat count afterward or not .
There are a huge number of techniques to resolve the ambiguity such as as lookahead ( see what the next tokens are ) and precedence rules ( given the choice between " * " and " + " use " * " first ) .
The parsing algorithms go by names like LALR ( 1 ) , SLR , LL and LR .
The most general purpose is the Earley algorithm ( which SPARK used ) but it 's usually slower than the more limited ones I just listed .
The limited ones only parse less complicated grammars .
You might think that 's a problem , but in practice that 's rarely the case .
People have a hard time with complex grammars as well and it's better to have a syntax which people can understand without deep thought .
Here 's the parser part of my chemical equation evaluator .
class Atom ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , symbol , count ) : self.symbol = symbol self .
count = count #
When parsing starts , try to make a " chemical_equation " because it 's # the name on left - hand side of the first p_* function definition .
def p_species_list ( p ) : " chemical_equation : chemical_equation species " p [ 0 ] = p [ 1 ] + [ p [ 2 ] ] def p_species ( p ) : " chemical_equation : species " p [ 0 ] = [ p [ 1 ] ] def p_single_species ( p ) : " " " species : SYMBOL species : SYMBOL COUNT " " " if len ( p ) == 2 : p [ 0 ] = Atom ( p [ 1 ] , 1 ) elif len( p ) == 3 : p [ 0 ] = Atom ( p [ 1 ] , p [ 2 ] ) def p_error ( p ) : print " Syntax error at ' %s ' " % p.value yacc.yacc( ) print yacc.parse ( " H2SO4 " )
As you can see , I can have one or more rule defined per parser function , and I can have multiple functions which work on the same left - hand side term .
When using yacc , remember to return the information through p[ 0 ] .
I keep expecting to " return " the object instead .
When I run the above , combined with the lexer code ( and with the lexer test code removed ) I get the following output
[< __main__ .
Atom object at 0xb83b0 > , < __main__.Atom object at 0xc14d0 > , < __main__.Atom object at 0xc12b0 >]
class Atom ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , symbol , count ) : self.symbol = symbol self .
count = count def __repr__( self ) : return " Atom ( %r , %r ) " % ( self.symbol , self.count )
[ Atom ( ' H ' , 2 ) , Atom ( ' S ' , 1 ) , Atom ( ' O ' , 4 ) ]
parsetab.py
That proved rather unhelpful .
I can see there are 3 atoms but I can't see what the atoms are .
I 'll modify the Atom class to add a __repr__ method .
and with that in place I see
Generating the parser can be expensive ( that is , take a lot of time ) .
PLY will store the parser in a file called " parsetab.py " and reuse it if the grammar is unchanged .
If you with you can change the filename to something else .
The new count functions
There is only a minor change to the count functions .
I do n't need the tokenize step because PLY handles that for me .
I can pass a string directly into the yacc. parse functions .
Here 's are the new versions
import collections def atom_count (s ) : count = 0 for atom in yacc.parse(s ) : count += atom.count return count def element_counts (s ) : counts = collections.defaultdict( int ) for atom in yacc.parse(s ) : counts[ atom.symbol ] += atom.count return counts
Because the function APIs are unchanged I can use the same test suite as before .
When I do that I found two problems :
1 ) I did n't get a TypeError when the input was an invalid string .
This was because I was only printing the error , with
def p_error ( p ) : print " Syntax error at ' %s ' " % p.value
def p_error ( p ) : raise TypeError ( " unknown text at %r " % ( p.value , ) )
when I should have raised an expection , with
2 ) I did n't support the empty string .
My previous code allowed " " to mean " no chemical compound " .
Supporting that is straight - forward but required a bit of rearranging .
I had to add a new start token which can either be the empty string ( in which case p [ 0 ] gets an empty list ) or be a list of chemical species .
The new grammar is
def p_chemical_equation ( p ) : " " " chemical_equation : chemical_equation : species_list " " " if len ( p ) == 1 : # the empty string means there are no atomic symbols p [ 0 ] = [ ] else : p [ 0 ] = p [ 1 ] def p_species_list ( p ) : " species_list : species_list species " p [ 0 ] = p [ 1 ] + [ p [ 2 ] ] def p_species ( p ) : " species_list : species " p [ 0 ] = [ p [ 1 ] ] def p_single_species ( p ) : " " " species : SYMBOL species : SYMBOL COUNT " " " if len ( p ) == 2 : p [ 0 ] = Atom ( p [ 1 ] , 1 ) elif len( p ) == 3 : p [ 0 ] = Atom ( p [ 1 ] , p [ 2 ] )
The final code
For posterity 's sake , here 's the final code with all the fixes , docstrings and self - test code .
# A grammar for chemical equations like " H2O " , " CH3COOH " and " H2SO4 " # Uses David Beazley 's PLY parser .
# Implements two functions : count the total number of atoms in the equation and # count the number of times each element occurs in the equation .
import lex import yacc tokens = ( " SYMBOL " , " COUNT " ) t_SYMBOL = ( r" C[ laroudsemf ] ?

count = count def __repr__( self ) : return " Atom ( %r , %r ) " % ( self.symbol , self.count ) #
When parsing starts , try to make a " chemical_equation " because it 's # the name on left - hand side of the first p_* function definition .
#
The first rule is empty because I let the empty string be valid def p_chemical_equation ( p ) : " " " chemical_equation : chemical_equation : species_list " " " if len ( p ) == 1 : # the empty string means there are no atomic symbols p [ 0 ] = [ ] else : p [ 0 ] = p [ 1 ] def p_species_list ( p ) : " species_list : species_list species " p [ 0 ] = p [ 1 ] + [ p [ 2 ] ] def p_species ( p ) : " species_list : species " p [ 0 ] = [ p [ 1 ] ] def p_single_species ( p ) : " " " species : SYMBOL species : SYMBOL COUNT " " " if len ( p ) == 2 : p [ 0 ] = Atom ( p [ 1 ] , 1 ) elif len( p ) == 3 : p [ 0 ] = Atom ( p [ 1 ] , p [ 2 ] ) def p_error ( p ) : raise TypeError ( " unknown text at %r " % ( p.value , ) ) yacc.yacc ( )

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Poor and middle - class families are entering the recession in a precarious situation due in part to declining or stagnant income growth , a study released Wednesday has found .
Incomes , on average , have declined by 2.5 % among the bottom fifth of families since the late 1990s , while inching up by just 1.3 % for those in the middle fifth of households , according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic Policy Institute , two liberal think tanks .
The wealthiest slice of Americans , however , saw their incomes rise by 9 % .
The average income of the bottom fifth of families was $ 18,116 ; the middle fifth , $ 50,434 ; and the wealthiest fifth , $ 132,131 .
Unlike what happened during the economic boom of the 1990s , lower - and middle - class families did not share in the prosperity of recent years , the report found .
In fact , the United States has had its longest jobless recovery and slowest rate of payroll growth during this decade .
" We 're worried about the impact of the downturn on the families whose incomes have n't recovered from the last recession , " said Jared Bernstein , Economic Policy Institute senior economist and co-author of the report .
Wages have not kept up with inflation , families have loaded up on debt and homeowners have seen the value of their largest asset decline , he said .
The situation will only get worse during the economic downturn .
" Families are uniquely economically exposed to the costs of recession , " he continued .
" As we head into a recession , their incomes will take a further hit . "
The income gap between the rich and the rest of the population is widening .
In 22 states , the top fifth of families made more than seven times what the poorest fifth took home , according to the report .
In the late 1980s , only one state - Louisiana - had such a spread .
Meanwhile , in more than two - thirds of the country , the wealthiest saw their income grow more than twice as fast as the middle - class over the past two decades .
State governments , however , can step in and help mitigate this growing inequality and insecurity , said Elizabeth McNichol , a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the report 's co-author .
For instance , they can extend the amount of time workers receive benefits during an economic downturn .
Also , they can offer or improve support services , such as child care , health insurance and transportation services .
Governments can also put resources into public services and infrastructure projects , which will help create jobs and stimulate the economy , said James Galbraith , professor at the University of Texas at Austin and income gap specialist .
The federal government may also have to funnel more money to the states so they can maintain services at a time when tax revenues may decline .
The study is based on U.S. Census Bureau income data that have been adjusted for inflation , the impact of federal taxes and cash value of government subsidies .
It does not factor in capital gains or losses .
It compares data from 2004 to 2006 with that of 1987 to 1989 and 1998 to 2000 .
Symonds clatters the streaker at the Gabba Australia 's Andrew Symonds will not face any action after flattening a streaker during Tuesday 's one - day international against India .
Robert Ogilivie evaded security and ran on to the pitch during Australia 's innings in Brisbane but Symonds floored him with a shoulder tackle .
Ogilivie was fined AUS $ 1,500 ( £ 700 ) by magistrates for wilful exposure and interfering with a sports event .
But Cricket Australia said there was no case for Symonds to answer .
Australian players have been told not to get involved with spectators on the field ever since Terry Alderman injured his shoulder during the 1982 - 83 Ashes series .
And the players ' code of conduct forbids physical assault of a rival player , official or spectator .
The sanction , if found guilty of such an offence , is a suspension , ranging from five Tests or 10 one - day internationals , up to a life ban .
However , Cricket Australia spokesman Michael Brown said : " Symonds was dealing with self - preservation , which we support 100 % 606 : DEBATE
It was a class hit that any rugby team would be proud of
ukmaffiaman
" No person has the right to impinge upon another person 's space , particularly a sportsman plying his trade . "
Symonds , who had not scored at that stage , eventually made 42 before falling lbw to Harbhajan Singh as Australia lost the game by nine runs .
Following his court appearance , Ogilvie told journalists : " It was great actually , just like playing [ Aussie Rules ] football . "
Magistrates were told he had been drinking with his brother and friends when he decided to take off his clothes and run onto the outfield .
Ogilivie said he would not streak again but had no regrets about the incident , adding : " You only live once , do n't you ? "
Former Australia captain Greg Chappell escaped a fine for hitting a streaker on the buttocks with a bat during a match in Auckland , New Zealand , in 1976 .

" There appears to be no evidence that the American people themselves are even aware of the catastrophic events soon to overtake them . " — Steve LeFemine , independent candidate for Congress " Our worst fears confirmed !
We are suffering a coup d’etat in America .
It is in the final stages of completion ... the program to abrogate American Sovereignty ... May God have mercy on America . " — Lawrence Patterson Criminal Politics ( May - June 2006 )
The evidence is overwhelming .
There is absolutely a wicked and devastating plot and conspiracy to overthrow America .
The traitors are now confident they will soon wash over 225 years of American tradition and history down a sinkhole .
If their foul plan suceeds , the vision we as patriots once had of a strong , prosperous nation of liberty , freedom and prosperity will soon vanish beneath a cavernous cesspool of forgotten dreams .
Over the years I have personally withstood a torrent of abuse and ridicule over my assertion that a small clique of traitorously evil men and women were plotting to bring down the walls of history .
Still , I soldiered on , enduring the cruel arrows of ignorant and malicious critics .
I refused to play along and keep quiet , and I have done my best to expose their heinous plot to shutdown the fabled American experiment in freedom and self - government .
Among the evil culprits I fingered over the years were such anti-American globalist groups as the Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) , the Trilateral Commission , the Freemasons and the Bilderbergs .
All play important roles in the on - going conspiracy .
But behind them all is the satanic influence and power of Zionists .
Zionists , in fact , are the real , but , so often , unheralded authors of the globalist plot .
Stepping Out Of the Shadows Now , finally , this traitorous clique of elitists has stepped out of the shadows into the light .
No longer need they fear public
This is the Council on Foreign Relations document requiring President Bush and the U.S. Congress to dissolve the United States as an independent nation and allow Mexican illegal aliens free access to America ’s land and resources .
disapproval .
So effective has been their psychological brainwashing campaign and their dumbing down of the citizenry , the arrogant plotters believe they can finally come out and defiantly show themselves .
Evidently , they think that no one is able to stop or even delay their bold plot to murder —yes , murder — America .
The CFR has even published its despicable plan in a book , entitled Building A North American Community .
Authored by three elite members of the New York - based organization , the book calls for the ending of American sovereignty and the overthrow of the American Constitution and government .
The CFR 's membership of 4,275 conspirators , backed by the organization 's predominantly Zionist Jew leadership , demands that , by the year 2010 , America as we once knew it will no longer exist .
By that date , the Illuminati intends that the following be achieved :
(1) A new currency , called the Amero , replace the dollar .
( 2 ) All borders between Mexico , the U.S.A. , and Canada be erased and the Border Patrol retired .
( 3 ) A North American Parliament Group , composed of Mexican politicians and U.S. quislings , take over legislative authority , superseding our own Senate and House . ( 4 ) A North American Judicial Council , or Tribunal , take over the judicial function and demote the U.S. Supreme Court to an advisory only role .
( 5 ) A joint Executive Authority be set up , possibly with its capitol in Mexico City or Toronto , to dictate to U.S. citizens the terms of surrender .
( 6 ) The 106 million citizens of Mexico be given full rights by the defunct U.S.A. and be allowed to enter our territory , re-conquer and seize whatever lands and property they wish within the once sovereign U.S.A. ( 7 ) The Bill of Rights be abolished and a new North American " Declaration of Rights " be drawn up .
It will comprise a shrunken list of abridged , government granted privileges more suitable to the changed times .
( 8 ) Over 100 million Mexicans living South of the Border , plus 20 million more Mexicans now residing illegally in the U.S.A. , will be awarded full social security and medicare benefits and have full job , voting and other rights granted to them .
American taxpayers will foot the bill .
( 9 ) Mexican workers will be given affirmative action and preferential job quotas .
Millions of Anglo - Americans will lose their jobs .
( 10 ) Hispanic - owned corporations will be favored with government grants and contracts .
The economies of Mexico , the former U.S.A. , and Canada will be totally merged and a 4 - football fields wide NAFTA super highway is already being built .
Thousands of air - polluting Mexican trucks and vehicles will rumble up I -35 and disperse to the various states .
( 11 ) The 50 existing American states will be formally dissolved and the former U.S.A. will be divided into ten weakened administrative regions .
Some will have Mexican leaders appointed over the local , formerly American citizens .
( 12 ) Spanish and English will both be recognized as joint official languages .
Mexican textbooks critical of United States history and disrespectful of American " gringo " traditions will be required in all North American schools .
( 13 ) The North American Union will join the European Community and the ASEAN ( Asian ) Union as the three major subdivisions of the planned global governance system , as envisioned by Rockefeller ’s Trilateral Commission .
Bush , Mexico's President Fox , and Canadian Prime Minister Martin relax and chat just after signing a new , CFR - prepared pact designed to dissolve the United States as a separate and independent nation .
President Bush and congressional leaders are now pushing for amnesty and full citizenship for all Mexican illegals in the U.S.A .
That is only one of scores of changes that must take place by the year 2010 , according to the CFR agenda .
This is Nothing Short of Treason !
As shocking as the CFR plot is , equally upsetting is that President George Bush , Mexican President Vicente Fox , and Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin met in Waco , Texas , March 23 , 2005 , and signed a secret pact called the Security and Prosperity Partnership .
That pact , prepared by CFR and Bilderberg administrators , sets forth step - by - step what each nation must do to insure the new , merged slave " nation , " the North American Union , is fully operational by the year 2010 .
Forget about the fact that the U.S. Consitution requires the President to submit treaties such as this to the Senate for a vote .
Imperial dictator Bush knows that no U.S. Senator dare utter one word of protest against the CFR Plot .
That would be the kiss of death for his or her senatorial career .
Having disposed of American sovereignty , the " New World Order " forged by Bush and Gorbachev in the 80s and cemented Masonic handshake : Mexican President Vicente Fox shares a Masonic handshake with Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin as U.S. President George Bush looks on .
The three met in Waco , Texas in 2005 and jointly signed a pact requiring the United States to be dismantled as an independent nation and integrated into a CFR - planned North American Union .
by traitorous Clinton - Bush , Democrat - Republican alliances will finally become a reality .
The fly in the ointment , of course , will be the small contingent of true American patriots that remain .
This is why the Bush Administration recently gave Halliburton a $ 385 million contract to build new detention camps .
It is also why NSA computers have all our names tagged in its " dissident " database list .
If necessary , they will get rid of us — permanently .
American military forces will enforce the New World Order .
Mexican and other foreign officers will no doubt be given high military commands to guard against mutiny by angry U.S. soldiers .
A few rogue nations — Venezuela , Cuba , etc. — must be dealt with .
The hapless Islamic masses will not be a major problem .
They are to be enslaved and / or killed off , just as is happening now in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Their oil resources will be expropriated .
The Zionist Connection :
The CFR is Dominated by Jews The Zionist Connection is the sinewy thread that ties this entire , vast , traitorous enterprise together .
The Bush Administration is only a puppet operation .
The Council on Foreign Relations has among its leading members such Zionist fanatics and servants as Vice President Dick Cheney , Secretary of State Condi Rice , and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
In all , over seventy percent of the membership of the CFR is Jewish !
Also on the CFR 's rolls : Ben Bernanke , Chairman of the Federal Reserve ; Robert Rubin , Clinton 's former Secretary of the Treasury ; and Madleine Albright , Clinton 's former Secretary of State .
Every one of these persons is a Jew and a Zionist Agent .
Their first allegiance is to the Jewish World Authority .
Here are some other top Jewish names that dominate the CFR .
Indeed , the CFR is nothing more than America 's premier Zionist Secret Society , a traitorous front for global Jewish interests and headquarters for the furtherance of the Zionist plot for a global Jewish Utopia : Carla Hills , Henry Bienen , Kenneth Duberstein , Martin Feldman , Richard Salomon , Bart Friedman , Maurice Greenberg , Morton Janklow , Ira Lipman , Seymour Sternberg , Frank Wisner , Michael Moscow , Roger Altman , Jessica Einhorn , David Greenberg , Louis Perlmutter , Joshua Steiner , Anita Wien , Douglas Schoen , Malcolm Weiner , Charles Schumer , Nancy Soderberg , Peter Tannoff , Abraham Lowenthal , Marc Thiessen , Daniel Yergin , Douglas Feith , Richard Perle , Carl Gershman , Peter Rosenblatt , Joseph Lieberman , Mortimer Zuckerman .
All of those listed are CFR Jews .
All are globalists .
As CFR conspirators and associates , all , in my opinion , are deceitful traitors , guilty of treason , enemies of the Constitution of the United States of America .
They deserve to be arrested , indicted , and , if found guilty by a jury of 12 honest American Patriots , sent to prison or executed .
White House strategist Karl Rove is shown here confidently displaying the El Diablo horned devil sign with both hands just after having met with Republican congressmen and giving them their marching orders on the illegal immigration issue .
Rove ’s immediate boss is Joshua Bolton , a Zionist Jew who runs things as President Bush ’s Chief of Staff .
Bolton , alias " Mordecai , " speaks fluent Hebrew .
His role is to transmit orders from the CFR Jewish elite to Karl Rove , President Bush and Vice President Cheney .
Bolton cracks the whip and makes sure the three men stay loyal to the CFR scheme .
That scheme is to put Mexico first , end American sovereignty and set up a North American Union to replace the government and Constitution of the " outmoded " U.S.A .
The Trap Has Been Set Dear friends , the trap has been set .
The media are not on our side .
Neither are the leaders of the Christian religious establishment .
They are owned by Jewish Wall Street corporation interests .
Neither can we count on either of the two major political parties to rescue us .
The Congress and the State Capital delegations are packed with CFR traitors who have already sold out the American Republic for a pot of porridge .
Today in America , we have the best politicians and clergy that money can buy !

" I 've known the national security advisor , Professor Rice , for about 20 some years , " former Colorado Sen.
Gary Hart told WABC Radio's John Batchelor and Paul Alexander .
" She was a supporter of mine in my first presidential campaign as a graduate student in Denver . "
After giving a speech on the terrorist threat in Montreal on Sept. 5 , Hart said he requested an urgent meeting with Dr. Rice in Washington .
" I said to her , ' You must move more quickly on homeland security .
An attack is going to happen . '
" That was Sept. 6 , 2001 , " Hart told WABC , without characterizing Dr. Rice 's reaction .
The night before , Hart said , he issued the same warning to an air transportation group in Canada .
Three years ago Hart and former New Hampshire Sen. Warren Rudman co-chaired the U.S. Commission on National Security for the 21st Century , which warned specifically of a domestic terrorist attack .
In a Sept. 15 , 1999 report , the Hart - Rudman Commission concluded , " America will be attacked by terrorists using weapons of mass destruction and Americans will lose their lives on American soil , possibly in large numbers . "

House of Representatives Passes a Tax Bill on Oil Companies
Democrats , upset that Americans are paying too much for gas and oil , have decided to ………. make sure Americans pay even more for gas and oil .
For the purpose of this post I am going to set aside the fact that the United States government has no business regulating how much of a profit a private business is allowed to make .
I am also going to set aside the fact that a growing number of people think government intrusion into private businesses is okay .
This goes beyond profits , and into government intrusion into such things as whether a private business can allow smoking .
But , as I said , I am going to set that aside for the purpose of talking about a little business 101 .
The United States House of Representatives recently passed legislation that would raise taxes on oil companies .
Big , bad oil companies .
There is only one problem with raising taxes on oil companies , who do you think will pay the price for this ?
You and I .
When the price of doing business goes up , whether it is the price of material , labor , overhead , or anything else , the price of the product has to be raised in order for a company to maintain a profit margin .
Part of the price of doing business is how much a company pays in taxes .
If the government raises taxes on the oil company , the increase will naturally fall on the consumers .
This is not hard to understand .
The government will not be taking profits away from the oil companies , they will be taking money out of our pockets .
Oil prices will rise to offset the increase in taxes .
Is this how the Democrats plan to help us ?
Here is what House Minority Leader John Boehner had to say about this bill :
“ Unfortunately , the Democrats ’ ‘ no energy ’ bill will only make matters worse by raising taxes and setting the table for even higher prices at the pump . ”
That is exactly correct .
This is nothing more than a publicity stunt by house Democrats .
They know that the outcome of this bill would be higher prices at the pump , they also know that President Bush will veto this bill if it ever makes it to his desk .
Democrats are just trying to win the approval of the American people by posing as if they are going after “ BIG OIL ” all the while knowing President Bush is going to veto it .
They will then use the veto as a political tool and issue to use against the president .
By vetoing this legislation even higher gas prices will be avoided but Democrats will be able to successfully paint George W Bush as being in bed with the oil companies .
It ’s actually a very good strategy on the Democrat ’s part , as most of the American people just do n’t understand how business works evidently .
They ca n’t lose under this scenario , the only ones that can lose are us .
The government makes more on a gallon of gas with taxes than the oil companies make .
If anything , the Democrats in the house should look at investigating the windfall profits the government is making on the price of gas .
Perhaps the government should give back some of their profits instead of telling a private business how much of a profit is allowed .

The development of Europe 's ATV has taken 11 years Mission Guide : Jules Verne
Launch preparations
The Automated Transfer Vehicle ( ATV ) is an unmanned ship that can carry up to 7.6 tonnes of supplies to the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
Its other primary role is to push the orbiting outpost higher into the sky to keep it from falling back to Earth .
The ATV will launch on an Ariane 5 rocket from the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana at 0403 GMT on Sunday .
Its mission will be a huge statement of capability .
The maiden voyage will announce that Europe now has some important new technical competencies to rival the very best in the space exploration business .
ATV is a marriage of human spacecraft and satellites
Alan Thirkettle , Esa 's space station programme manager
" The ATV is how we contribute to the operations costs of the space station - by taking up several tonnes of logistics , " says Alan Thirkettle , the European Space Agency 's ( Esa ) ISS programme manager .
" It 's also very important as a development .
ATV is a marriage of human spacecraft and satellites .
It 's a very complicated spacecraft ; and European industry has had the opportunity to develop new technologies and new techniques as a result of ATV , " he told BBC News .
The vehicle has been dubbed " Jules Verne " for Sunday 's flight and will weigh some 20 tonnes at launch .
Its booster , the Ariane 5 , has had to be specially strengthened for the task .
PUTTING THE ATV ON THE RIGHT PATH TO THE ISS (1 ) The Ariane 5's first thrust phase lasts 17 minutes ; the strap - on solid boosters and the main stage fall into the Atlantic Ocean ( 2 ) Upper - stage re-ignition occurs 1hour and 2 minutes into the flight , and circularises the 260 km orbit .
The ISS is about 340 km high At 1 hour and 6 minutes , the ATV is ejected ; and a final burn ( 3 ) deorbits the upper - stage .
The ATV must now raise its own orbit
Kourou : European spaceport 's sky - high ambition
For the Ariane 5 , the mission also marks an important milestone - that of the heaviest single payload it has ever attempted to put in orbit .
The 775 - tonne Ariane 5 - ES vehicle was rolled to the pad on Friday
Ariane 's upper - stage will also have to reignite twice - once to circularise the orbit before ejecting the ship ; and a second burn to take itself safely out of the sky and into the Pacific Ocean .
The ATV will essentially then be parked in space .
It must wait until Space Shuttle Endeavour has completed its forthcoming mission to the ISS before moving in to make a docking , probably on 3 April .
The ship 's own computers will be in charge as an advanced form of GPS and , in the latter stages , optical sensors guide it into position on the end of the Russian Zvezda module .
Mission controllers in Toulouse , France , will keep a watching brief but will not intervene unless they see a problem arising .
Likewise , on the station itself , the astronauts will view the approach but will have no role other than in an emergency .
If they do sense danger they can order the ATV to reverse by pushing a large red button on a panel positioned in the Zvezda module .
Over time , the ISS crew gradually deplete its stock of food , fuel , water , air and equipment .
" And that 's when we also act as a dustbin , " explains John Ellwood , Esa 's ATV project chief .
" All the stuff that the crew has used during the six months that we are attached , they will put in ATV and then we will dump this in a very controlled re-entry into a completely unpopulated area of the Pacific . "
Europe has high hopes for the ATV and its technology .
Although astronauts will not launch to the ISS in the ship , the vehicle is human - rated - they can go inside its pressurised vessel without wearing spacesuits .
The ATV is a starting point , therefore , if Europe wants to develop its own independent , crew transportation system .
At the moment , no Esa astronaut can get into orbit without the US space shuttle or the Russian Soyuz vehicle .
At their meeting in The Hague in November , Europe 's space ministers will be asked to build on the knowledge gained on ATV by approving a research programme that would investigate further technologies which could be used in a possible future human - launch system .
Cost : Total bill was 1.3bn euros ( at least 4 more ATVs will be built )
Total cargo capacity : 7.6 tonnes , but first mission will fly lighter Mass at launch : About 20 tonnes depending on cargo manifest Dimensions : 10.3 m long and 4.5 m wide - the size of a large bus Solar panels :
Once unfolded , the solar wings span 22.3 m
Engine power : 4 x 490 - Newton thrusters ; and 28 x 220N thrusters

Saints Rise Again with ‘ Boondock ’ Sequel
I am a very happy , happy movie fan today .
Troy Duffy , genius - to - be who was lost in the carnage that is Hollywood , as well as the writer / director of The Boondock Saints , has posted a video officially announcing the sequel that the entire cult following has been clawing and scratching for like Britney Spears at a “ Free Crack Samples ” stand —
The Boondock Saints : All Saints Day .
There ’s a documentary called Overnight that shows the story of Duffy and his band / friends / family as they blow up on the scene , selling Boondock and getting a record contract — followed by the seemingly immediate crash and burn as he tried too hard to make it all happen his way with some big wigs that just do n’t take too kindly to being pushed .
Anyone who has seen this movie will indeed worry about this sequel announcement and how it is ACTUALLY going .
If Duffy has learned his lessons , I expect that it will go fine and we will see this play out … if he ’s stuck with old habits , do n’t go crazy just yet !
We ’ll always wonder what the first movie would have been if it went as well as it looked like it was going to go ; if Troy Duffy was to become the next huge thing , the next Tarantino , if they would have had all the budget and time they wanted … but would you really want it any different than it is now ?
Sure it ’s got flaws and you can tell where budget and some better supporting cast could have helped , but the main characters and the way it all played out was some hard , rugged brilliance that this movie fan will always adore .
I ’m sure I ’m not alone there .
As per the announcement , All Saints Day has been picked up by Sony Pictures Studios and is looking to start shooting this summer .
Fingers crossed that this happens as spoken !
Stay tuned kids .
VIDEO Q&A : YOU ASK THE TREASURY SECRETARY VIDEO Q&A : YOU ASK THE TREASURY SECRETARY By David Calvert for
USA TODAY " I think the numbers are 20 % to 30 % down from last year , and last year was n't too good , either .
Everything in the economy is affected by this . " -- Michael Lavin , owner of Carson Oak Outlet furniture in Reno By Davis Turner for

The company is growing so fast it is " getting close to our physical limit . " -- David Quinn , co-founder of Pisgah Brewing in Black Mountain , N.C.
How 's the economy in your hometown ?
On the campaign trail and in homes across the USA , the debate is underway about whether the U.S. economy in 2008 will see its first downturn in seven years .
Despite the recent onslaught of negative news , it remains unclear whether the current state of affairs meets the economists ' definition of a recession : a widespread decline in economic activity lasting more than just a few months .
As in politics , all economics is local .
Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody's Economy.com , for example , believes the U.S. economy is in recession .
WHAT THE FED SAYS :
Its latest regional look at the economy
But the contraction is far from uniform .
Zandi's firm estimates that in January , 30 state economies were expanding while 15 were " at risk " of slipping into recession .
Arizona , California , Florida , Michigan and Nevada were already in a recession at the start of the year .
Those states account for one - quarter of the nation 's total economic output .
While business owners and workers in parts of the country for months have weathered recession - like conditions — job losses , home foreclosures and slumping consumer and business spending — others have been doing well .
Some areas are likely to feel very little effect from the slowing economy .
That 's mainly because a marked contraction in housing is leading the overall economy down this time .
Housing had been instrumental in boosting many regions , particularly the Southwest , in recent years .
During the housing expansion , job growth in related industries flourished , and consumers tapped their growing home equity to buy everything from cars to couches .
But in many parts of the country , housing never boomed , so now there 's not likely to be a corresponding bust .
And a number of other elements of the economy are still doing well , helping to keep some regional economies above water .
Depending on a state 's business mix , factors such as high agricultural prices , strong tourism or a heavy reliance on exports are keeping some state economies growing .
Likewise , heavy dependence on struggling sectors such as automobile manufacturing can drag states down further .
Even troubling aspects of the economy such as high energy costs produce some winners .
Stanley Stonier of Boise started as an entry - level worker on an oil rig near Pinedale , Wyo. , in January .
Before , the 31 - year - old was making $ 15 an hour as a housing construction worker .
Now he is making $ 26 an hour .
" I 'm loving it , " says the former Army reservist who served a year in Iraq in 2005 .
A look at a variety of factors in play in states around the nation : HOUSING HOUSING
Home sales are down in nearly every state , but the depth of the decline varies widely .
Many of the hardest - hit states are those in the Southwest , such as Arizona , Nevada and New Mexico .
Other states , such as Colorado and Arkansas , saw more modest declines .
And home buying was up or unchanged in the fourth quarter in North Dakota and South Dakota , according to the National Association of Realtors .
Home values fell last year in a number of states , but in other parts of the country there were gains .
Alabama 4.5 % Alaska 6.0 % Arizona - 2.4 % Arkansas 3.6 % California - 6.7 % Colorado 1.4 % Connecticut 0.8 % Delaware 2.0 % District of Columbia 1.9 % Florida - 4.7 % Georgia 2.6 % Hawaii 2.0 % Idaho 4.6 % Illinois 2.0 % Indiana 1.5 % Iowa 2.7 % Kansas 2.5 % Kentucky 3.5 % Louisiana 4.1 % Maine 1.9 % Maryland 0.8 % Massachusetts - 2.2 % Michigan - 4.3 % Minnesota - 1.2 % Mississippi 4.1 % Missouri 2.5 % Montana 6.9 % Nebraska 2.5 % Nevada - 5.9 % New Hampshire - 0.6 % New Jersey - 0.3 % New Mexico 5.4 % New York 0.7 % North Carolina 4.9 % North Dakota 7.9 % Ohio - 0.4 % Oklahoma 5.1 % Oregon 3.9 % Pennsylvania 2.8 % Rhode Island - 2.6 % South Carolina 3.8 % South Dakota 4.8 % Tennessee 4.1 % Texas 5.2 % Utah 9.3 % Vermont 2.4 % Virginia 0.8 % Washington 5.4 % West Virginia 3.0 % Wisconsin 1.9 % WyominG - 8.3 % Source : Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight But economists ' statistics alone do n't tell the story of the USA 's uneven housing market .
Sales of house paint hold some clues , too .
" The Sun Belt area of the country , those areas where housing had been strong , are feeling most of the pain today , " says Chris Connor , CEO of paint company Sherwin - Williams .
( SHW ) " Other areas of the country are holding up fine for us , " he says , noting the company still plans to add stores and expand business this year .
The housing sector has a way of trickling through the economy .
Not only are people who work in related fields , such as construction and real estate , negatively affected , but the ability of homeowners to take out loans to fund their spending has all but dried up as home values have declined .
And that decline tends to have a so - called negative wealth effect on consumers :
When people feel less wealthy they are less likely to spend as much .
Homeowners who are seeing their interest rates jump on their adjustable - rate mortgages also have less spending money .
In the Reno area , home foreclosures jumped from 105 in 2006 to 750 last year , according to the Center for Regional Studies at University of Nevada , Reno .
Thirty miles south of Reno in the state capital of Carson City , business is down at the Carson Oak Outlet furniture store .
" I think the numbers are 20 % to 30 % down from last year , and last year was n't too good , either , " owner Michael Lavin says .
" Everything in the economy is affected by this . "
In Arizona , Jose Cabrera , 39 , made a good living as a real estate agent for eight years in Phoenix .
Then , suddenly , Cabrera went from selling three units per month to none .
In June , he got a second job as a machinist making airplane parts .
Cabrera likes the work , even if it means " going into a cave " for eight hours daily .
But his income has been cut in half .
And he does n't take his wife and four children to dinner or movies as often .
" Before , I did n't think anything of going out , " Cabrera says .
" Now , you have to watch where you spend your money . "
Across the country in Black Mountain , N.C. , where housing , although slower , has been helped by an increase in residents to the area , Pisgah Brewing co-founder David Quinn is seeing an entirely different picture .
He expects the firm to sell 2,500 barrels of the firm 's organic beer this year , up from 1,340 in 2007 and 538 in 2006 , when the company started .
He 's hiring workers and says the company is growing so fast it is " getting close to our physical limit . "
Businesses and consumers not in areas most affected by the housing boom and bust are not escaping the effects of the housing slump entirely .
That 's because in the fallout from the subprime mortgage mess , banks have tightened lending standards for a variety of loans , no matter where the borrower is .
" The whole key ( for the economy ) since August has been the credit crunch extending beyond housing , " says James Diffley , managing director of U.S. regional services at Global Insight .
AGRICULTURE AGRICULTURE
Farmers have benefited from a historic run-up in grain prices driven by surging demand in nations such as China and India , poor weather in some important producing nations and the increasing use of corn and other crops to make biofuels such as ethanol .
Top 10 states with agriculture as the highest percentage of gross state product in 2006 : South Dakota 6.4 % North Dakota 6.4 % Idaho 4.9 % Nebraska 4.7 % Montana 4.3 % Iowa 3.4 % Kansas 2.9 % Arkansas 2.8 % Mississippi 2.7 % Oregon 2.6 % Source : Global Insight Soybean prices on the Chicago Board of Trade have jumped from around $ 7.50 a bushel in late 2006 to nearly $ 15 today .
Wheat prices have doubled to more than $ 10 a bushel .
Corn prices , which had been averaging about $ 2.50 a bushel earlier in the decade , have surged to more than $ 5 a bushel .
While higher farm prices are leading to rising prices in grocery stores , the gains are providing a big boost to areas where grains are grown , such as regions of North and South Dakota , Iowa , Kansas and Nebraska .
Not only are the higher prices helping farmers , but they also are boosting sales of companies that sell to farmers , such as John Deere .
( DE ) The Moline , Ill . - based company said last month it expects sales of equipment such as tractors and combines to rise approximately 17 % in 2008 .
Those who grow crops " have a spring in their step and a song in their hearts , " Wells Fargo ( WFC ) agricultural economist Michael Swanson says .
But there is a downside , Swanson notes .
Farmers with livestock who do not grow their own feed are having to pay high prices that they are not fully recouping when they sell their animals or milk .
Those farmers are facing significant losses .
He recently met with some dairy farmers in Texas .
" They are terrified . "
EXPORTS EXPORTS
The weakness in the dollar , down 11 % against a basket of major currencies during the last year , makes U.S. goods more affordable for buyers abroad and is helping to boost exports .
Top 10 states with exports as highest percentage of gross state product in 2006 : Washington 18.1 % Vermont 15.8 % Texas 14.2 % Louisiana 12.2 % Kentucky 11.8 % Michigan 10.6 % Oregon 10.1 % Alaska 9.8 % Tennessee 9.3 % South Carolina 9.1 % Source : Global Insight Exports account for more than one - tenth of all economic activity in seven states : Washington , Vermont , Texas , Louisiana , Kentucky , Michigan and Oregon .
" This cushions some of the blow , particularly in the manufacturing sector , " Global Insight 's James Diffley says .
International sales of an online service for businesses from WBP Systems have been growing 5 % to 10 % faster than overall sales , according to the Pullman , Wash . - based firm 's chief software architect , Ben Smith .
The company sells a service that helps small businesses track clients and charges a monthly rate .
The weaker dollar is " advantageous for " customers abroad , Smith says , noting sales in the United Kingdom are particularly strong .
Texas , where exports account for more than 14 % of the state 's economy , has one of the best job growth rates in the country .
It 's not only those selling abroad who appear to be benefiting .
Al Bussmann , sales and marketing director at Perfect Lawns and Landworks of Austin , expects business at the firm , which provides lawn maintenance and landscaping services , to grow by double digits this year .
He notes that for most people , having someone mow their lawn or plant shrubs is an expense that can be cut in tough times .
So the fact that business is growing suggests the local economy is doing well .
The city had a 3.6 % unemployment rate in December , presenting a challenge to Bussmann 's company .
" Our biggest challenge is hiring people , because the unemployment rate is so low in Austin .
Overall , the economy is good , " he says .
MOTOR VEHICLES MOTOR VEHICLES
In Canton , Mich. , 30 miles west of Detroit , Sharon Grigorian is trying to sell the Mobil Lounge , a bar that catered to workers at General Motors ' ( GM ) Willow Run plant before the assembly line closed in 1993 .
The plant still makes transmissions .
Top 10 states with motor vehicle production as highest percentage of gross state product in 2006 : Michigan 6.8 % Indiana 4.2 % Kentucky 3.9 % Ohio 3.0 % Alabama 2.2 % Tennessee 1.9 % South Carolina 1.6 % Missouri 1.6 % Mississippi 1.1 % Oklahoma 0.8 % Source : Global Insight Grigorian , 66 , has owned the bar for 35 years , and the downturn in auto manufacturing has been tough on her business .
" We were basically a GM bar , and it was so easy in those days , " she says , referring to when the company was the undisputed king of automakers .
" You could just set the clock by the shifts .
You did n't need dart leagues and pool leagues to make a living .
All you had to do was open the door . "
Grigorian says she still gets weekend crowds , but customers are much more careful with their money .
" It 's just a different world , and a lot harder to earn a living these days , " she says .
North American car factories are expected to turn out a little more than 14 million vehicles in 2008 , according to consulting firm Global Insight .
That 's down nearly 1 million from 2007 , when vehicle production also fell , and the lowest in more than two decades .
" These are incredibly low numbers , " Global Insight senior analyst Catherine Madden says of the manufacturing fall - off .
Slow auto sales and increased competition from abroad are leading to the declines .
It 's been particularly painful for domestic auto producers , which in recent years put greater emphasis on building bigger vehicles such as SUVs and trucks , vehicles that have become harder to sell given elevated gasoline costs .
States with a heavy reliance on domestic car production , such as Michigan and Ohio , are reeling as assembly lines close and jobs are cut .
The effects are trickling to suppliers and beyond .
At 7.6 % , Michigan 's unemployment rate in December was the highest in the nation and far above the 5 % U.S. average .
The unemployment rate in the Detroit area was 8.5 % .
TOURISM TOURISM
Strong increases in travel - related spending are helping to offset housing gloom in states with large tourism industries , including California , Florida and Nevada , some of the very places where the real estate downturn has been most severe .
Top 10 states by domestic travel expenditures in 2006 , in billions : California $ 71.3 Florida $ 50.0 Texas $ 37.2 New York $ 33.0 Nevada $ 28.2 Illinois $ 24.5 Pennsylvania $ 17.2 New Jersey $ 16.7 Georgia $ 16.6 Virginia $ 16.5 Source : Travel Industry Association Mike Carey , chairman at SnowSports Industries America and co-owner of Seirus Innovation , a maker of snow - sport accessories in Poway , Calif. , says after years of industrywide growth in the low single digits , sales are up 13 % this season .
He attributes the increases to ample snowfall across a large portion of the USA as well as an increase in foreign tourists who are coming to take advantage of the weakened dollar , which helps stretch their money .
" Across the country , there are really no weak pockets , " he says .
Walt Disney ( DIS ) last month reported attendance at Walt Disney World theme parks in Florida was up 4 % while per capita spending was up 3 % .
" The weakness of the dollar against foreign currencies has probably resulted in fewer Americans traveling overseas and has resulted in more people from international markets traveling to the U.S. , " Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger said in a conference call with analysts .
" That 's why we had record attendance at our domestic parks .
It came from basically both sides . "

A couple have spoken of their shock after their local council spied on them to see if they had been cheating the school catchment system .
Tim Joyce and Jenny Paton and their children were put under surveillance by Poole Borough Council for more than two weeks without their knowledge .
Miss Paton said this kind of scrutiny was " hugely disproportionate " .
The council has defended its actions , carried out under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) .
The council admitted using RIPA laws , which were designed to track criminals and terrorists , on six occasions in total .
Miss Paton , from Parkstone , said : " We all know there has to be scrutiny of applications but they could carry it out without resorting to anti-terror legislation and spying .
" The fact they are going to continue this is outrageous .
" I feel that this kind of scrutiny is hugely disproportionate to the circumstances to being able to scrutinise a school application .
We have a duty to make sure ... the application is fair
John Nash , Poole Borough Council " They could have come back to us and asked for utility bills , they could have come back to us and asked for telephone bills instead . "
The couple had applied to have their three - year - old daughter accepted into Lilliput CE First School - described by inspectors as " outstanding " and heavily over - subscribed - which one of their children already attends .
The couple has two addresses and they waited until after the council deadline for school applications had passed before moving from one address to the other .
But after two weeks of surveillance the couple were exonerated and their daughter was awarded a place .
Miss Paton admitted they had played the system .
She said : " We had some uncomfortable feelings about that , in that we had two addresses and we were able to do it .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" They [ the council ] produced a very detailed document of our movements .
" They were n't forthcoming with that until asked by a direct question and it took us by huge surprise .
" However , by the end of the meeting it was clear that the surveillance had shown we were n't lying . "
Poole council has admitted that it has spied on families three times over suspected fraudulent school place applications .
It said two offers of school places were withdrawn as a result .
RIPA legislation allows councils to carry out surveillance if it suspects criminal activity .
On its website , the Home Office says : " The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) legislates for using methods of surveillance and information gathering to help the prevention of crime , including terrorism . "
' Ridiculously disproportionate ' Human rights pressure group Liberty called the spying " ridiculously disproportionate " and " intrusive " .
James Welch , legal director for Liberty , said : " It 's one thing to use covert surveillance in operations investigating terrorism and other serious crimes , but it has come to a pretty pass when this kind of intrusive activity is used to police school catchment areas .
" This is a ridiculously disproportionate use of RIPA and will undermine public trust in necessary and lawful surveillance . "
Poole council said surveillance was carried out by a council officer who was fully trained and authorised to exercise RIPA powers , once it had decided it may be a criminal matter .
John Nash , the council 's strategic director for children 's services , said : " Where the main criteria for entry is to live in the catchment area then we have a duty to make sure , where there is a complaint or concern expressed by somebody else , that the application is fair . "
Mick Brookes , of the National Association of Head Teachers , said the council 's actions appear " a little over the top " .
He added : " I would have thought that if there was a doubt about where parents were living then the school would actually get in touch with them to check their address was right , not least because if there was an emergency . "

A section of nanowire produced by Texas A&M mechanical engineering researchers postdoctoral researcher Subrata Kundu and associate professor Hong Liang .
The electrically conducting nanowire is about 1/1,000 the width of a human hair and could be used in developing nanoscale electronic devices .
Sometimes simpler is better .
Engineering researchers at Texas A&M University have developed a new way to produce ultra - thin electricity - conducting wire that is simpler and faster than existing processes .
" Other methods used to produce nanowires use high temperatures and high pressure , " said Subrata Kundu , a post - doctoral researcher in the research group of Hong Liang , an associate professor in Texas A& M 's Department of Mechanical Engineering .
" This method is much simpler and faster . "
Kundu and Liang described the process in an article in the current issue of the journal Advanced Materials .
The process developed by Kundu and Liang works by shining ultraviolet light on a mixture of strands of DNA , cadmium sulfate and thioacetamide for about six hours .
UV light breaks thioacetamide to produce sulfide ions ( S2 - ) .
Chemical changes produced by the UV light allow the cadmium sulfate molecules to bind to the DNA .
The resulting nanowires — about 1,000 times thinner than a human hair — conduct electricity and could be used in the development of so - called nano - scale electronic devices like small chips to make tiny computer or medical devices .
Nano - scale devices range in size from the size of a molecule to about 100 nanometers .
One meter is 1 billion nanometers long .
Liang and Kundu plan to continue research in this area using different metals — lead , zinc and molybdenum — to produce the nanowires .
Kundu said working with the other metals will give the researchers important information about how the process works .
The UV process also allows nanowires to be built on DNA arranged in two or three dimensions , t- joints and cubes , for example .
This opens the possibility of using the process to build entire nano - scale circuits .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Sometimes touted as a contender for the Republican vice - presidential slot , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has aired her thoughts on race in the United States , a prominent issue in the presidential election campaign .

Rice , the top ranking African - American in President George W. Bush ’s cabinet , told The Washington Times she had watched Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Barack Obama ’s major speech on race last week .
“ I think it was important that he ( Obama ) gave it for a whole host of reasons , ” said Rice in a transcript of the interview released by the State Department on Friday .
Obama would be the first black U.S. president if he wins the Democratic nomination and beats Republican candidate John McCain in the November election to succeed Bush .
Obama ’s speech -- which he gave after a storm of criticism over racially charged sermons by the black pastor of his church -- spoke of a racial stalemate in the United States and a need to heal racial wounds .
While saying repeatedly she did not want to talk about the election campaign -- “ I do n’t do politics ” -- and also reiterating her lack of interest in the vice presidential slot , Rice said the United States had a hard time dealing with racial issues .
“ There is a paradox for this country and a contradiction of this country and we still have n’t resolved it , ” she said in a detailed reply to questions about Obama and race issues as a whole before next week ’s 40th anniversary of the slaying of civil rights leader Marin Luther King .
“ But what I would like understood as a black American is that black Americans loved and had faith in this country even when this country did n’t love and have faith in them , and that ’s our legacy . ”
Rice said her own father , grandmother and great - grandmother had endured “ terrible humiliations ” growing up in the segregated south and yet they still loved America .
While many blacks called themselves African American , Rice said they should not be looked at as immigrants .
“ We do n’t mimic the immigrant story .
Where this conversation has got to go is that black Americans and white Americans founded this country together and I think we ’ve always wanted the same thing , ” she said .
Later on Friday , when asked what Americans had learned about race since the civil rights movement , Rice told reporters : “ You have to work hard every day to make the extraordinary , moving and inspirational words of our founding documents a reality for all Americans . ”
Earlier this week , Rice addressed a conservative lobbying group in Washington , stoking fresh talk that despite her public protestations to the contrary , she might be interested in becoming McCain ’s running mate .
Rice told the Washington Times again that she was “ not interested ” in the vice presidential job and she planned to return to her California home when the Bush administration ends in January 2009 .
“ It ’s time for new blood , ” she said .

Booming gold investment demand as well as possible opposition by Congress , whose approval is needed before the IMF could unload its gold , should also mitigate any downward pressure on prices .
IMF ’s move will further increase the amount of gold owned by private investors instead of central banks , which allows market forces and not governments to set the price of gold , commodity experts said .
The IMF agreed on Monday to create an endowment with the sale of 403.3 metric tons of the fund ’s 3,217 metric tons of gold stocks in a move to revamp its income model .
“ We certainly have plenty of investment demand that can absorb ( IMF ’s gold ) in the market .
Also , of course , it ’s not clear that there will be any sales anyway as it requires U.S. congressional approval , ” said James Steel , metals analyst with HSBC in New York .
IMF ’s proposal was still to be approved by the IMF ’s 185 member countries and the Congress before any gold sales could begin .
On Tuesday , active U.S. gold futures for June delivery ended 1 percent lower at $ 918 an ounce and spot gold traded at $ 915 .
Steel , however , said that gold ’s decline on Tuesday was more because of speculation that news from a G7 meeting later this week would ease credit worries , denting gold ’s appeal as a safe haven investment in financial turmoil .
Bullion hit an all - time high of $ 1,030.80 on March 17 .
NO ADDITIONAL GOLD SALES
George Gero , vice president of RBC Capital Markets Global Futures in New York , said that the IMF agreement had taken a toll on buying sentiment among gold bulls .
“ So , the market will probably continue reacting to some profit taking and sell - stops after the move up that we had .
As soon as it stabilizes , I think you will probably see some bargain hunters come back in , ” Gero said .
Gero said that the IMF proposal might not affect the market quickly because the institution would sell gold within the framework of the existing Central Bank Gold Agreement ( CBGA ) , which allows for the sale of about 500 tons of gold a year .
George Milling - Stanley , manager of investment and market intelligence of the industry - sponsored World Gold Council , said that IMF ’s move should not affect gold at all as there would be no net addition to the official - sector gold sales that the market had already expected .
“ If there will be any sales , they would do it gradually , and they will do it within the context of the existing CBGA .
There ’s not going to be any increase in the supply from the official sector whatsoever , ” said Milling - Stanley , who has been working closely with the IMF and central banks .
In other words , the IMF would only sell gold according to the 500 - ton allowance provided by the CBGA , he said .
Milling - Stanley said that IMF ’s strict proposal , if it was approved , should kill any speculation that the fund would further unload any of its remaining 2,800 tons of gold .
European central banks have so far sold 191 tons of gold in the fourth year of the 5 - year pact which started on Sept 27 .
“ It ’s not something that ’s going to rock the market .
I think the market can absorb it .
And in the long term , for the market , it ’s a healthy development that gold is moving more towards private hands , ” said Axel Merk , portfolio manager of Merk Hard Currency Fund in Palo Alto , California , which has $ 400 million of assets under management , including bullion .

WHICH economy has enjoyed the best economic performance over the past five years : America 's or Japan's ?
Most people will pick America .
The popular perception is that America 's vibrant economy was sprinting ahead ( albeit fuelled by credit and housing bubbles that have now painfully burst ) , whereas Japan crawled along at a snail 's pace .
And it is true that America 's average annual real GDP growth of 2.9 % was much faster than Japan 's 2.1 % .
However , the single best gauge of economic performance is not growth in GDP , but GDP per person , which is a rough guide to average living standards .
It tells a completely different story .
GDP growth figures flatter America 's relative performance , because its population is rising much faster , by 1 % a year , thanks to immigration and a higher birth rate .
In contrast , the number of Japanese citizens has been shrinking since 2005 .
Once you take account of this , Japan 's GDP per head increased at an annual rate of 2.1 % in the five years to 2007 , slightly faster than America 's 1.9 % and much better than Germany 's 1.4 % .
In other words , contrary to the popular pessimism about Japan 's economy , it has actually enjoyed the biggest gain in average income among the big three rich economies .
Among all the G7 economies it ranks second only to Britain ( see left - hand chart ) .
Using growth in GDP per head rather than crude GDP growth reveals a strikingly different picture of other countries ' economic health .
For example , Australian politicians often boast that their economy has had one of the fastest growth rates among the major developed nations — an average of 3.3 % over the past five years .
But Australia has also had one of the biggest increases in population ; its GDP per head has grown no faster than Japan 's over this period .
Likewise , Spain has been one of the euro area 's star performers in terms of GDP growth , but over the past three years output per person has grown more slowly than in Germany , which like Japan , has a shrinking population .
Some emerging economies also look less impressive when growth is compared on a per-person basis .
One of the supposedly booming BRIC countries , Brazil , has seen its GDP per head increase by only 2.3 % per year since 2003 , barely any faster than Japan's .
Russia , by contrast , enjoyed annual average growth in GDP per head of 7.4 % because the population is falling faster than in any other large country ( by 0.5 % a year ) .
Indians love to boast that their economy 's growth rate has almost caught up with China 's , but its population is also expanding much faster .
Over the past five years , the 10.2 % average increase in China 's income per head dwarfed India 's 6.8 % gain .
Focusing on GDP per person also affects comparisons of economic health over time .
During the past five years , world GDP has grown by an average of 4.5 % a year , its fastest for more than three decades , though not as fast as during the golden age of the 1960s when annual growth exceeded 5 % .
But the world 's population is now growing at half of its pace in the 1960s , and so world income per head has increased by more over the past five years than during any other period on record ( see right - hand chart above ) .
Mankind has never had it so good .
Redefining recession
Once you accept that growth in GDP per head is the best way to measure economic performance , the standard definition of a recession — a decline in real GDP over some period ( eg , two consecutive quarters or year on year ) — also seems flawed .
For example , zero GDP growth in Japan , where the population is declining , would still leave the average citizen better off .
But in America , the average person would be worse off .
A better definition of recession , surely , is a fall in average income per person .
On this basis , America has been in recession since the fourth quarter of last year when its GDP rose by an annualised 0.6 % , implying that real income per head fell by 0.4 % .
Many Americans will shrug this off , especially those politicians who believe that the prime goal of policy is to retain their economic and military dominance over the world .
They see the size of a country 's GDP as the best measure of its economic clout , in which case the absolute rate of GDP growth matters more than growth in income per head .
Europeans seem less bothered about global dominance — although they are sure to gloat about the fact that the weakening dollar means that the euro area could overtake America as the world 's biggest economy this year .
There are several other reasons Americans can quibble over the use of GDP per head , especially with reference to Japan .
Firstly , its shrinking population is also an ageing one in which the labour force will decline as a share of the population .
Unless this is offset by more rapid productivity growth , this could make it harder to maintain the same growth in output per person in future and so harder to pay pension bills .
Secondly , slower GDP growth makes it more difficult to reduce the ratio of existing public - sector debt to GDP , which stands at a hefty 180 % in Japan .
Last , but not least , investors care about GDP growth .
Corporate profits depend upon the absolute rate of growth of an economy .
And companies wanting to invest abroad will favour markets that are expanding more rapidly .
If GDP per head is nevertheless a superior measure of people 's prosperity , why do governments not publish such figures each quarter along with their standard GDP figures ?
Population statistics tend to be less up - to - date than GDP figures and are generally not available on a quarterly basis .
But that is a lame excuse : it should be much easier to count bodies than to put a value on diverse sorts of economic output .
Not only do people have a right to know whether average living standards are rising or falling , but publishing such numbers could also benefit some countries .
If Japan 's government had drawn attention to the sprightlier growth in income per head in recent years , in contrast to endless reports about its “ underperforming ” economy , consumers may have felt cheerier and spent more — in other words , its GDP growth would have been stronger .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A series of embarrassing incidents on federal property across the country , including the theft of a trailer of surveillance equipment from an FBI parking deck , is being blamed on budget cuts at the agency charged with securing federal grounds .
A Federal Protective Service officer trains with a paintball gun .
The agency has lost staff since 2004 .
" We 're seeing the near collapse of the Federal Protective Service , " said Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton , D - District of Columbia , who leads the congressional subcommittee that oversees federal buildings .
The service 's budget and staff have been cut since it became part of the Department of Homeland Security in March 2003 , according to the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office .
" I think that FPS is less able to do its job than ... in the past , primarily because of budgetary restrictions that have occurred , and that has forced them to slash their workforce " GAO investigator Mark Goldstein said .
" There are 756 uniformed federal officers to oversee the 8,800 buildings " under the agency 's watch , he said .
A preliminary GAO report contained these findings :
• A man died at a vacant federal complex in Kansas City , Missouri , and his body was not found for three months .
Watch scene of body 's discovery »
• Twenty - two guns were stolen from a federal building in Atlanta , Georgia .
A private security guard employed at the building was convicted of participating in the theft .
• A surveillance trailer with $ 400,000 worth of high - tech equipment was stolen from the parking garage of a federal building in Los Angeles , California .
CNN has learned the trailer was stolen from the Los Angeles FBI field office in May .
Contract guards watched the theft on surveillance cameras but did nothing to intervene and did not report the incident for three days , according to an incident report confirmed by the FBI and Norton .
The trailer was recovered with some of the equipment intact .
The FBI investigation is still open .
In Kansas City , Eric L. Howell , 27 , who had been homeless from time to time , died in a vacant government building sometime in summer 2007 .
His body was found months later by a government real estate agent showing the property to a prospective buyer .
The cause of death could not be determined .
FPS director Gary W. Schenkel defended his agency , telling CNN the incidents cited by the GAO were " taken out of context . "
" FPS does not refute that these incidents took place , but I do believe that additional background information shows that FPS and its contract guards acted according to the established mission guidelines and standards , " Schenkel said .
He said the trailer was taken by " a government contractor with frequent access to the parking deck " and blamed the FBI for taking " three days to notice and report that its own trailer was missing . "
In regards to the Kansas City case , Schenkel said the Government Services Administration building in question " was not on the GSA list , " and FPS was n't being paid to guard it .
But critics say that 's just the point -- because of funding cuts since it was made a part of the Homeland Security Department five years ago and an unusual pay - for - service arrangement to compute its current budget , FPS is unable to adequate provide security for government properties .
Before the creation of the Homeland Security Department in 2003 , the Federal Protective Service was part of the Government Services Administration , which manages thousands of federal properties across the country , functioning as landlord to hundreds of federal agencies .
While part of the Government Services Administration , the Federal Protective Service had a larger budget and more agents .
But its workforce has been cut 20 percent since 2004 , the year after the agency became part of Homeland Security .
FPS is funded through a complex formula based on the square footage of the property that Government Services controls .
" Everyone was proud the day it was announced that Homeland Security was going to be formed , and there were talks that FPS was going to be absorbed .
...
It 's been downhill ever since , " said David Wright , president of Local 918 of the American Federation of Government Employees , the FPS union .
He said FPS has never been taken seriously within Homeland Security .
" We were at the bottom of the food chain , so there 's a real disregard for Federal Protective Service within our parent agency , " Wright said .
Last year , Congress required Homeland Security to add 150 officers to the service , but the department still will rely on about 15,000 contracted private security guards for the bulk of the policing at federal buildings , according to the GAO , Norton and the union .
Contract guards are generally less expensive than federal officers , but they lack the training of FPS officers , and in many jurisdictions , they have no power to arrest or detain suspects , Goldstein and Norton said .
" Unless the government is prepared to have a private army or a public army of guards , which would be astronomically expensive , we 're going to have to find the right mix of private guards to do security in less risky areas and then have more highly trained guards perhaps in higher security areas , " Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said .
Norton compared the decline of the Federal Protective Service with the shortcomings of the Federal Emergency Management Agency revealed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
" Interestingly , both happened when they were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security , " Norton said .
" I can't say honestly to anybody who asks that ' Now that the Federal Protective Service is in the Homeland Security Department , you 're better off . '
You 're worse off . "

Assistant U.S. Attorney for National Security Kenneth Wainstein announces two sets of arrests involving espionage during a briefing at the Department of Justice in Washington February 11 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Joshua Roberts
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President George W. Bush named a Justice Department official with experience in terrorism wiretap programs as his White House homeland security adviser on Wednesday .
Bush chose Kenneth Wainstein , the department ’s first assistant attorney general for national security and a former FBI general counsel , to succeed Frances Townsend as assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism .
Townsend stepped down in November .
“ He ( Wainstein ) helped improve our ability to confront the threats of a new era , ” Bush said in a release .
Wainstein , in his Justice Department post , oversaw efforts to bring Bush ’s controversial warrantless domestic wiretapping program under the auspices of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court .
Critics have charged the wiretap program launched by Bush after the September 11 attacks was illegal because it lacked court oversight .
Wainstein has also helped lead the administration ’s effort to pass new surveillance legislation that would grant legal immunity to telecommunications companies that took part in Bush ’s surveillance program .
Bush established the White House homeland security job in the weeks after the September 11 attacks , with the intention that the person would coordinate the administration ’s domestic security activities and advise the president .
The post does not require congressional confirmation .
A year later Congress created the Cabinet - level Department of Homeland Security to consolidate and manage 22 government agencies that deal with domestic security issues .
In another security move , the White House said Bush intends to nominate Michael Leiter , acting director of the National Counterterrorism Center , to serve as director .
The agency oversees the government ’s operational planning and intelligence efforts against terrorism .
Why Are So Many Fighting For Food ?
ABC News Asks Reporters Around the World to Analyze the Global Food Crisis
Food prices are rising around the world .
In an interview with ABC News , Gregory Barrow , senior public affairs officer at the World Food Program ( WFP ) , said that " the WFP has identified a number of countries that have been badly affected , and we have identified a type of country that 's most likely to suffer from rising food prices . "
" " The kind of country to be worst - affected is a country which depends on importing its food to meet its people 's needs , it is likely to have witnessed dramatic inflation recently , and where individuals typically spend a significant portion of their income , i.e. 50 percent or more , on food . "
According to Barrow , this definition " would cover a number of countries in Sub - Saharan Africa as well as countries in Asia , like Bangladesh and Pakistan . "
Click here : HOW YOU CAN HELP THE WORLD HUNGER PROBLEM
ABC News takes a look at some of the countries most badly hit by the growing food crisis .
HAITI
The poorest country in the Americas , Haiti has seen some of the worst food - related riots in recent months , with protestors taking to the streets , burning tires and looting shops .
As the vast majority of Haiti 's population struggles to get by on less than $ 2 a day , the rising prices of staple food items like rice and beans have left many Haitians angry with the government for not reducing taxes on foodstuffs .
President Rene Preval recently acknowledged that the country 's problems were related to its dependence on imported rice and promised to boost food production .
But opposition leaders immediately attacked him for doing little to address immediately the issue of food shortages .
Rising fuel costs have also made transportation of foodstuffs increasingly expensive , making the current global crisis especially painful for this nation , which already suffers from extreme poverty .
On Wednesday , U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon asked donors to provide emergency aid to Haiti .
The current unrest has provoked the U.S. Coast Guard to keep a careful eye on Haiti , in case of a migrant exodus to American shores .
INDIA
For the more than 600 million people who work in agriculture here , for the more than 600 million farmers and their families who live on less than $ 2 a day , it is the difference between cooking with oil and barely eating anything .
Wholesale inflation hit its highest level here in three years , and for 1.1 billion Indians , that means that fruits and vegetable prices have risen 20 percent in just the last month -- mostly because of lack of irrigation and unseasonably early rainfall .
To try and tame inflation , the government relaxed import duties on oils and banned exports on all but the most expensive rice .
But India is as much part of the problem as it is victim .
This country is the second - largest rice producer in the world and is now exporting a fraction of what it used to , helping driving rice prices up in Asia and around the world .
And there have never been more Indians -- the country adds 20 million each year -- and they have never been richer , demanding more and more food , especially meat , which takes more wheat to produce .
The more that the new global giants China and India eat , the higher your food prices will go .
KENYA
In Nakuru , Kenya , the price of kales , the staple vegetable , has doubled in the last three months .
Local conditions are partly to blame ; last year 's post-election violence ripped through Nakuru and the resulting ethnic fighting has driven people from their farms .
But food prices are rising across all of Africa - due to the cost of oil and demand for bio -fuels .
This is causing social unrest throughout northern and western African countries and sometimes deadly violence , such as in Cameroon .
Kenya 's response ?
A promise , so far unfulfilled , of free seeds and fertilizer for farmers .
The Head Of The World Food Program urged the international community last November to take action .
" I have seen in West Africa what havoc could be caused by the triple threat of climate change , rising food prices and population growth .
But I have also seen that there are solutions to help people adapt before it is too late , " said Josette Sheeran of the food program .
She described the combination as a " perfect storm . "
EGYPT
Deadly riots erupted in Egypt last weekend , underscoring how rising costs and inflation can undercut governments in an already shaky region .
State police were called in to quell the unrest , which left more than 100 injured among reports of looting and vandalism .
According to Joshua Stacher , a Middle East expert at Syracuse University , food prices are up 40 percent while salaries are stagnant .
Wage hikes are under discussion ; typical public salaries are roughly $ 26 a day , Stacher says .
Many take second jobs at night to make ends meet .
Both economic experts and Egypt 's working class say the government 's economic reform efforts are to blame .
" This has been going on for four years in Egypt …each year it has gotten progressively worse .
We 've seen the slashing of subsidies , massive amounts of inflation , the floating currency , and this is producing prices that are out of whack , " said Joshua Stacher , a Middle East expert at Syracuse University .
The cost of basic necessities has risen across the Middle East .
The United Arab Emirates saw record inflation of 9.3 percent last year , while Iran 's rate was closer to 20 percent .
But unlike those states , the countries of the eastern Mediterranean – Egypt , Lebanon , Syria , and others – lack the oil revenues to help fund public assistance programs .
IRAQ
In Iraq , fears over security have affected food prices .
Many Iraqis in Baghdad , Basra and other cities and towns try to stock up on food whenever possible to avoid the potential danger of returning to the markets .
As food disappears from shelves , demand for it grows , and store owners capitalize on the situation by raising prices .
An Iraqi reporter working with ABC News says that after the recent battles in Nassiriya , the price of a sack of flour went up by nearly 50 per cent .
Additionally , the high rate of unemployment ( which has reached 40 percent in some parts of the country ) means that several families cannot afford to buy such staples as rice , flour and sugar .
Despite Iraq 's status as an oil - producing nation , rising fuel costs have made transporting food an ever - expensive endeavor .
BRAZIL
Brazil is increasingly seen as a " feeding bowl " for China and India .
The growing demand for food in these two rising giants has forced them to turn to Brazil , where agriculture and livestock play a crucial economic role .
Brazil is leading the way in soyabean production ; it is currently the world 's No. 2 exporter of soy beans and in the past two years it exported just over 25 million tons -- China alone imported 10 million tons of that share .
Soy is often used to feed livestock and with China 's appetite for beef rising , so too does its appetite for cattle feed .
Brazil is also a world leader in the bio - fuel industry – many of the country 's cars run on ethanol , a product made from cheap sugarcane .
Critics of these programs complain this demand for bio-fuels is also responsible for causing international food shortages , thus pushing up food prices .
Defenders of biofuel programs , such as Brazil 's President Lula , insist that sugarcane cannot be grown to replace other crops as the land conditions are not suitable .
Sugarcane plantations for ethanol currently take up 3 percent of the country 's farmland .
Brazil has over 100 million acres of degraded land that can be used to grow more crops .
It has lately been feeling the heat of rising food prices , especially in wheat products so the pressure is on for this land to be put to use .
INDONESIA
Just last month hundreds of Indonesians took to the streets in the capital of Jakarta , demanding that the government bring down the price of food .
They were enraged over local newspaper reports that people were dying due to starvation .
Over the last year , the price of basic foods has skyrocketed .
Rice , a staple food in the country , has risen 25 percent , cooking oil 40 percent and soybeans 50 percent .
With nearly half of Indonesia 's population , more than 100 million people , living on $ 1 to $ 2 a day , the high prices mean many people are going hungry .
The government has responded by subsidizing soybeans and cooking oil and increasing rice production .
The fear here is that rising food costs will result in security concerns , in Indonesia and across the region .
CHINA
China 's demand for meat and milk is rising with its wealth .
But a bad winter and rising fuel costs is affecting all sorts of Chinese staples -- tofu , noodles , and vegetable oil .
The rising food prices are fueling inflation , which was up 23.3 percent in February from the year before .
The Chinese government has reduced food exports and offered subsidies to rein in prices .
Government officials fear continued inflation will spark massive social unrest in the same way it did leading up to the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations .
Last year , three people were killed in a stampede when a Carrefour supermarket offered free vegetable oil on a first - come , first - served basis .
As food prices rise around the world , it 's easy to point the finger at China .
Twenty percent of the world 's population lives here , and as its economy continues to grow , so does its appetite .
RUSSIA
In Russia , according to official statistics , the average household now purchases double the volume of food that it did only ten years ago .
What only recently was seen as a sure sign of Russia 's economic success trickling down to the ordinary citizen is now beginning to worry some experts , who doubt whether Russia can afford the newfound consumerism .
" Russia imports vast quantities of food and is now also integrated into the world economy .
Global inflation will affect it badly , " Catrina Stewart , the finance correspondent for the Moscow Times , told ABC News .
Russian overdependence on food imports is not just an economic concern .
It has a political dimension as well -- and that worries many Russian politicians .
Russia 's eastern region is literally fed by China .
More than 80 percent of all foodstuffs available in that vast territory are Chinese imports .
With such economic reliance on China , Moscow 's politicians fear that they may eventually lose some control over their eastern territories .
Russia has little agricultural capacity : less than half of its arable land is farmed and cultivated , and the yield remains poor .
Nearly 80 years of communism killed the traditional family farm and today there are very few Russians interested in becoming farmers , especially since laws on land ownership are vague and arbitrary .
The irony is that Russia 's huge profit from oil and gas exports has dealt another blow to its agriculture -- the state has had plenty of cash to afford massive food imports and so has neglected local farming .
In light of the new data and projections on global food prices , this neglect may now backfire .
Russia quite simply lacks a healthy agricultural industry to absorb the potential impact of the rising cost of food imports .
The blow will at least in part be compensated by rising oil and gas prices , but some economists believe that Russia 's heavy reliance on food imports could still affect it by propelling inflation even higher .
" As recently as 2000 , inflation in Russia was as high as 20 percent , " Martin Gilman , a Moscow University economics professor , told ABC News .
" Early in 2007 it reached its low point of 7.5 percent .
That 's when the relapse began and the fever is now raging .
This January inflation rose to 12.6 percent year - on - year , and it seems to be heading toward 15 percent in the months ahead . "

The Bush administration wants to open 5.6 million acres in the Bering Sea off Alaska to oil and gas leasing , including an area north of the Aleutian Islands near Bristol Bay designated critical habitat for the North Pacific right whale .
The proposal was published in Tuesday ’s Federal Register by the Department of the Interior ’s Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) , as reported by the Center for Biological Diversity .
North Pacific right whales once ranged from California to Alaska and across the North Pacific to Russia and Japan .
They were decimated by commercial whaling and remain the most endangered large whale in the world .
Fewer than 50 individuals remain in the Bering Sea population .
“ Drilling in Bristol Bay would be drilling through the heart of the most important habitat of the most endangered whale on the planet , ” said Brendan Cummings of the Center for Biological Diversity .
“ If the North Pacific right whale is to have any chance of survival , we must protect its critical habitat , not auction it off to oil companies . ”
The CBD reports the leasing proposal was made the same day the National Marine Fisheries Service , another federal agency , published a final rule in the Federal Register naming portions of the lease area as critical habitat for the North Pacific right whale .
Ooops .
“ Unfortunately , for the right whale it ’s one step forward , two steps back , ” said Cummings .
“ One branch of the federal government is acting to protect the critical habitat of the North Pacific right whale , while another branch is simultaneously proposing to destroy it . ”
It ’s also reminiscent of the recent MMS decision to lease important polar bear habitat in the Chukchi Sea at the same time the US Fish and Wildlife Service was considering offering the bears protection under the Endangered Species Act .
Both agencies are part of Dirk Kempthorne ’s Department of the Oilterior , uhm , Interior .
The latest leasing proposal would sell the North Aleutian Basin lease in 2011 …
One more reason we need the Right President to protect the Right Whales .
Not to mention the right one to wean us off the oil economy rather than enable it .

MD5 and SHA256 hashes for the release ISO images are included at the bottom of this message .
The contents of the ISO images provided as part of the release has changed for most of the architectures .
Using the i386 architecture as an example , there are ISO images named ``bootonly '' , ``disc1 ' ' , ``disc2 '' , ``disc3 '' , and ``docs ' ' .
The ``bootonly '' image is suitable for booting a machine to do a network based installation using FTP or NFS .
The ``disc1 '' , ``disc2 '' , and ``disc3 '' images are used to do a full installation that includes a basic set of packages and does not require network access to an FTP or NFS server during the installation .
In addition , ``disc1 ' ' supports booting into a live CD - based filesystem and system rescue mode .
The ``docs '' image has all of the documentation for all supported languages .
Most people will find that ``disc1 '' , ``disc2 '' and ``disc3 '' are all that are needed .
If you intend to install ports from source instead of using the pre-built packages included with the release only ``disc1 '' is needed .
FreeBSD 6.3 - RELEASE can also be purchased on CD - ROM from several vendors .

FreeBSD Update
Starting with FreeBSD 6.3 , the freebsd - update ( 8 ) utility supports binary upgrades of i386 and amd64 systems systems running earlier FreeBSD releases , release candidates , and betas .
Users upgrading to FreeBSD 6.3 from older releases ( in particular , older than 6.3 - RC1 ) will need to download an updated version of freebsd - update ( 8 ) that supports upgrading to a new release .
# fetch http://people.freebsd.org/~cperciva/freebsd-update-upgrade.tgz
Downloading and verifying the digital signature for the tarball ( signed by the FreeBSD Security Officer 's PGP key ) is highly recommended .
# fetch http://people.freebsd.org/~cperciva/freebsd-update-upgrade.tgz.asc
# gpg --verify freebsd - update- upgrade.tgz.asc freebsd-update-upgrade.tgz
The new freebsd - update ( 8 ) can then be extracted and run as follows :
# tar - xf freebsd - update - upgrade.
tgz
# sh freebsd - update.sh -f freebsd-update.conf -r 6.3 - RELEASE upgrade
# sh freebsd - update.sh -f freebsd - update.conf install
The system must be rebooted with the newly installed kernel before continuing .
# shutdown -r now
Finally , freebsd - update.sh needs to be run one more time to install the new userland components , and the system needs to be rebooted one last time :
# sh freebsd - update.sh -f freebsd - update.conf install
# shutdown -r now

Remember this morning when I posted about Sony charging $ 50 to not install bloatware on new PCs ?
Looks like Sony realized how jackassy it made them look , as it's going to be free as of tomorrow .
Here 's the full quote :
" Starting March 22 , Sony will offer Fresh Start free of charge .
We want VAIO users to have the best experience possible with our PCs , and we believe Fresh Start will help ensure that happens right out - of - the - box . "

NEW YORK , United States —
The Iranian Parliament is considering legislation that would institutionalize a series of gross human rights violations , affecting not only Baha 'is but many others , even outside of Iran , the Baha'i International Community said today .
Of greatest concern is a section that would mandate the death penalty for anyone who converts from Islam to another religion , a provision that would affect not only Baha 'is but also Christians , Jews , and others .
" This proposed law goes against all human rights norms and standards , including international treaties that Iran itself has agreed to , " said Bani Dugal , the principal representative of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations .
" It is important for the international community to speak out , now , before it is too late and the draft code becomes Iran 's law of the land . "
The proposed law also would extend the government 's reach over alleged security violations outside the country , give legal effect to discriminatory practices already in wide use against Baha 'is and others , and redefine a series of " religious " and other crimes so vaguely as to place in jeopardy virtually any group facing government disapproval .
" If adopted , the code will permit the government and the clergy to act with impunity against Iran 's citizens on the sole basis of their religious affiliation , " said Ms. Dugal .
" This is not only an affront to the people of Iran ; it is an offense to all who seek to uphold fundamental human rights . "
Ms. Dugal said the new section on religious conversion -- defined as apostasy -- is especially severe , in that its language mandates the death penalty for anyone who converts from Islam to another religion and does not immediately recant .
" The text uses the word Hadd , meaning that it explicitly sets death as a fixed punishment that cannot be changed , reduced or annulled , " said Ms. Dugal .
" In the past , the death penalty has been handed down -- and also carried out -- in apostasy cases , but it has never before been set down in law .
" The law also extends to naming as apostate any follower of a religion other than Islam who had one parent who was a Muslim at the time of his or her conception .
Thus , for instance , the child of a Muslim and a Christian who chooses to adopt the Christian faith would be considered an apostate under the terms of the law and therefore subject to execution , " Ms. Dugal said .
Another troubling section of the proposed code would extend " security " laws outside the country , exposing those outside Iran to the government 's reach .
" Iran is apparently not content with targeting those it considers its opponents only within its borders , " said Ms. Dugal , explaining that Article 112 of the proposed code refers to actions " against the government , the independence and the internal and external security of the country . "
" Since the notion of ' security ' is not defined in the law , any action can be qualified as such , " Ms. Dugal said .
" Indeed , many Iranian Baha 'is have been falsely accused of activities against the security of the state .
" If the new penal code is adopted , Iranian Baha 'is -- and others -- all over the world would likewise be liable for actions taken outside Iran that are considered contrary to Iran 's security . "
The code 's vagueness with respect to " offending the sacred " and other crimes would give the government free license to act against any group it disapproves of , said Ms. Dugal .
" The code includes articles that refer to the commission of unspecified crimes or felonies , as well as articles referring to those guilty of ' corruption and mischief on the earth , ' " she said .
" It would also institute capital punishment for anyone who ' insults the Prophet , ' " Ms. Dugal explained .
" Such provisions place many groups , including Baha'is , in an extremely vulnerable position , since an ' insult ' to the Prophet can be defined in almost any context , especially where religious belief is concerned . "
In related developments , the presidency of the European Union recently expressed " serious concern " over the " deteriorating situation " of the Baha 'i community in Iran .
" The EU expresses its serious concern at the worsening situation of ethnic and religious minorities in Iran , in particular to the plight of the Baha'i , " said the EU Presidency on 7 February 2008 .
" The EU is concerned about the ongoing systematic discrimination and harassment of Baha 'is in Iran , including the expulsion of university and high school students , restrictions on employment and anti-Baha 'i propaganda campaigns in the Iranian media . "
ROBOTIC PAST ROBOTIC PAST Japan 's love affair with robots could be said to be more than 300 years old .
Wooden wind - up dolls known as " karakuri " appeared as early as the 17th century .
Especially famous is a kimono - clad tea- serving machine considered one of the world 's first " robots . "
It carried a bowl of tea on a tray from the host to the guest , waited patiently until the guest replaced the bowl , and then returned to the host .
Based on Western gun- and clock - making technology , these robots were designed as helpers or crowd - pleasers .
That was long before Czech playwright Karel Capek 's science - fiction drama , R.U.R. , introduced the word " robot " to the public at large in the early 1920s .
Capek 's machines are at first happy to toil as laborers for their human creators , but stage a rebellion that triggers the end of the human race .
But , " In Japan , where robots are the good guys in anime or comic books , people just do n't feel as threatened by robots as they do in the United States or Europe , " said Brian Carlisle , president of Auburn , Calif . - based Precise Automation and former head of the U.S. Robotic Industries Association .
" The Japanese accept robots , and robotics technology has the potential to enter many new kinds of applications , " Carlisle said .
" Naturally , the possibilities are larger here . " —

At a university lab in a Tokyo suburb , engineering students are wiring a rubbery robot face to simulate six basic expressions : anger , fear , sadness , happiness , surprise and disgust .
Hooked up to a database of words clustered by association , the robot — dubbed Kansei , or " sensibility " — responds to the word " war " by quivering in what looks like disgust and fear .
It hears " love , " and its pink lips smile .
PHOTO GALLERY : Japan embraces robots
" To live among people , robots need to handle complex social tasks , " said project leader Junichi Takeno of Meiji University .
" Robots will need to work with emotions , to understand and eventually feel them .
While robots are a long way from matching human emotional complexity , the country is perhaps the closest to a future — once the stuff of science fiction — where humans and intelligent robots routinely live side by side and interact socially .
Robots are already taken for granted in Japanese factories , so much so that they are sometimes welcomed on their first day at work with Shinto religious ceremonies .
Robots make sushi .
Robots plant rice and tend paddies .
There are robots serving as receptionists , vacuuming office corridors , spoon - feeding the elderly .
They serve tea , greet company guests and chatter away at public technology displays .
Now start - ups are marching out robotic home helpers .
They are n't all humanoid .
The Paro is a furry robot seal fitted with sensors beneath its fur and whiskers , designed to comfort the lonely , opening and closing its eyes and moving its flippers .
For Japan , the robotics revolution is an imperative .
With more than a fifth of the population 65 or older , the country is banking on robots to replenish the workforce and care for the elderly .
In the past several years , the government has funded a plethora of robotics - related efforts , including some $ 42 million for the first phase of a humanoid robotics project , and $ 10 million a year between 2006 and 2010 to develop key robot technologies .
The government estimates the industry could surge from about $ 5.2 billion in 2006 to $ 26 billion in 2010 and nearly $ 70 billion by 2025 .
Besides financial and technological power , the robot wave is favored by the Japanese mind - set as well .
Robots have long been portrayed as friendly helpers in Japanese popular culture , a far cry from the often rebellious and violent machines that often inhabit Western science fiction .
This is , after all , the country that invented Tamagotchi , the handheld mechanical pets that captivated the children of the world .
Japanese are also more accepting of robots because the native Shinto religion often blurs boundaries between the animate and inanimate , experts say .
To the Japanese psyche , the idea of a humanoid robot with feelings does n't feel as creepy — or as threatening — as it might do in other cultures .
Still , Japan faces a vast challenge in making the leap — commercially and culturally — from toys , gimmicks and the experimental robots churned out by labs like Takeno's to full - blown human replacements that ordinary people can afford and use safely .
" People are still asking whether people really want robots running around their homes , and folding their clothes , " said Damian Thong , senior technology analyst at Macquarie Bank in Tokyo .
" But then again , Japan 's the only country in the world where everyone has an electric toilet , " he said .
" We could be looking at a robotics revolution . "
That revolution has been going on quietly for some time .
Japan is already an industrial robot powerhouse .
Over 370,000 robots worked at factories across Japan in 2005 , about 40 % of the global total and 32 robots for every 1,000 Japanese manufacturing employees , according to a recent report by Macquarie , which had no numbers from subsequent years .
And they wo n't be claiming overtime or drawing pensions when they 're retired .
" The cost of machinery is going down , while labor costs are rising , " said Eimei Onaga , CEO of Innovation Matrix Inc. , a company that distributes Japanese robotics technology in the U.S. " Soon , robots could even replace low - cost workers at small firms , greatly boosting productivity . "
That 's just what the Japanese government has been counting on .
A 2007 national technology roadmap by the Trade Ministry calls for 1 million industrial robots to be installed throughout the country by 2025 .
A single robot can replace about 10 employees , the roadmap assumes — meaning Japan 's future million - robot army of workers could take the place of 10 million humans .
That 's about 15 % of the current workforce .
" Robots are the cornerstone of Japan 's international competitiveness , " Shunichi Uchiyama , the Trade Ministry 's chief of manufacturing industry policy , said at a recent seminar .
" We expect robotics technology to enter even more sectors going forward . "
Meanwhile , localities looking to boost regional industry clusters have seized on robotics technology as a way to spur advances in other fields .
Robotic technology is used to build more complex cars , for instance , and surgical equipment .
The logical next step is robots in everyday life .
At a hospital in Aizu Wakamatsu , 190 miles north of Tokyo , a child - sized white and blue robot wheels across the floor , guiding patients to and from the outpatients ' surgery area .
The robot , made by start - up Tmsk , sports perky catlike ears , recites simple greetings , and uses sensors to detect and warn people in the way .
It helpfully prints out maps of the hospital , and even checks the state of patients ' arteries .
The Aizu Chuo Hospital spent about some $ 557,000 installing three of the robots in its waiting rooms to test patients ' reactions .
The response has been overwhelmingly positive , said spokesman Naoya Narita .
" We feel this is a good division of labor .
Robots wo n't ever become doctors , but they can be guides and receptionists , " Narita said .
Still , the wheeled machines had n't won over all seniors crowding the hospital waiting room on a weekday morning .
" It just told us to get out of the way ! " huffed wheelchair - bound Hiroshi Asami , 81 .
" It 's a robot .
It 's the one who should get out my way . "
" I prefer dealing with real people , " he said .
Another roadblock is money .
For all its research , Japan has yet to come up with a commercially successful consumer robot .
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. failed to sell even one of its pricey toddler - sized Wakamaru robots , launched in 2003 as domestic helpers .
Though initially popular , Sony Corp. pulled the plug on its robot dog , Aibo , in 2006 , just seven years after its launch .
With a price tag of a whopping $ 2,000 , Aibo never managed to break into the mass market .
One of the only commercially successful consumer robots so far is made by an American company , iRobot Corp .
The Roomba vacuum cleaner robot is self - propelled and can clean rooms without supervision .
" We can pretty much make anything , but we have to ask , what are people actually going to buy ? " said iRobot CEO Helen Greiner .
The company has sold 2.5 million Roombas — which retail for as little as $ 120 — since the line was launched in 2002 .
Still , with the correct approach , robots could provide a wealth of consumer goods , Greiner stressed at a recent convention .
Sure enough , Japanese makers are catching on , launching low - cost robots like Tomy 's $ 300 i-Sobot , a toy - like hobby robot that comes with 17 motors , can recognize spoken words and can be remote - controlled .
Sony is also trying to learn from past mistakes , launching a much cheaper $ 350 rolling speaker robot last year that built on its robotics technology .
" What we need now is n't the ultimate humanoid robot , " said Kyoji Takenaka , the head of the industry - wide Robot Business Promotion Council .
" Engineers need to remember that the key to developing robots is n't in the lab , but in everyday life . "
Still , some of the most eye - catching developments in robotics are coming out of Japan 's labs .
Researchers at Osaka University , for instance , are developing a robot to better understand child development .
The " Child - Robot with Biomimetic Body " is designed to mimic the motions of a toddler .
It responds to sounds , and sensors in its eyes can see and react to people .
It wiggles , changes facial expressions , and makes gurgling sounds .
The team leader , Minoru Asada , is working on artificial intelligence software that would allow the child to " learn " as it progresses .
" Right now , it only goes , ' Ah , ah . '
But as we develop its learning function , we hope it can start saying more complex sentences and moving on its own will , " Asada said .
" Next - generation robots need to be able to learn and develop themselves . "
For Hiroshi Ishiguro , also at Osaka University , the key is to make robots that look like human beings .
His Geminoid robot looks uncannily like himself — down to the black , wiry hair and slight tan .
" In the end , we do n't want to interact with machines or computers .
We want to interact with technology in a human way so it 's natural and valid to try to make robots look like us , " he said .
" One day , they will live among us , " Ishiguro said .
" Then you 'd have to ask me : ' Are you human ?
Or a robot ? " '

— North Carolina residents say the economy is the most important issue facing the state and will likely play a key role in state and national elections in November , according to an Elon University Poll .
Almost 30 percent of the 764 residents surveyed this week by the Elon University Institute for Politics and Public Affairs cited the economy as the most important issue in North Carolina .
About 12 percent said education was most important , followed by the drought and other energy and environmental issues at 10 percent .
“ Seeing the economy become so pronounced in such a short time indicates true concern among citizens about their personal financial well - being , ” Hunter Bacot , director of the Elon University Poll , said in a statement .
“ As people begin to feel the direct effects of the poor economy , pocketbook issues may become their primary concern in the voting booth . ”
More than four of every five respondents said the economy would influence their voting in the May primaries and November general election .
Taxes , the Iraq War and health care costs were other issues that will influence the votes of at least three - fourths of North Carolina residents , according to the poll .
Some issues have a more pronounced effect on a national level than they do on a state level .
For example , while 53 percent said the economy would influence their vote for governor , 70 percent said it would affect how they vote in the presidential election .
On the other hand , transportation and education have a larger impact on the vote for governor than they do for presidential choices , according to the poll .
Illinois Sen. Barack Obama holds a double - digit lead over New York Sen. Hilary Clinton among those surveyed , 45 to 31 percent , in the May 6 Democratic presidential primary .
Twenty - two percent of the respondents remain undecided .
On the Republican side , North Carolina residents are clearly behind Arizona Sen. John McCain .
He garnered 62 percent support in the poll , compared with 24 percent for former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee .
In the race for governor , the poll shows Lt. Gov. Beverly Perdue and Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory hold commanding leads .
Perdue was favored by 40 percent of respondents for the Democratic nomination , compared with 28 percent for State Treasurer Richard Moore .
Almost a third of voters remain undecided .
McCrory 's 28 percent response in the poll was more than double his closest competitor for the GOP nomination .
State Sen. Fred Smith was favored by 12 percent of those polled , followed by Salisbury lawyer Bill Graham at 10 percent and former state Supreme Court Justice Robert Orr at 6 percent .
Forty - four percent of voters are still undecided .
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percent , and respondents were n't limited by their voter eligibility or their likelihood of voting in an election .
In Leon 's country , most government institutions are legally obligated to disclose certain data on the internet — their structure , responsibility , public competitions , general announcements , and so on .
Leon worked for a company that did government work exclusively , and during a lull in their normal projects , they noticed an unfilled niche — software designed specifically to make sharing of this information easy .
Management prepared the specs with dozens of citations referencing government - produced documents that outlined the rigid formatting requirements .
Boiling it all down , though , it was n't so bad .
Just some document storage and retrieval , basic usage logging , and two - level security : users , who can read everything , and admins , who can edit everything .
Business logic was simple , because all changes would be done manually by an admin .
With a clear path ahead and solid specs , initial estimates were that the project would be done in six months .
The general attitude was that it'd get done sooner , but it'd be nice to have some breathing room .
And so production began .
It had a bit of a rocky start , as there was some difficulty finding subcontractors to do the work .
They had a false start with one company , but the next company they found would save them .
Sadly , the next team failed too , but they had found a third company that seemed capable of rescuing the rescue team .
This new team could do the backend , and they had some good contacts for people that could do the front end .
At this point , the project was behind schedule three months .
A huge setback , but not a showstopper .
Whenever Leon 's company called for status reports , the contractors reported that they were doing well , but needed more money .
The next two months were occupied by brutal contract renegociations and some slow progress from the contractors .
The backend was starting to come together , but the frontend was still a clunky mess of basic HTML .
Finally , the contractors found a graphic designer , who took three weeks to finish base design and images .
Huzzah , back on track !
Except that the designer then needed some help .
He assembled a team of four freelancers ( of which Leon was a member ) to create 40 + web pages .
They 'd use the Corel mockups that the designer had produced and do miscellaneous frontend work , like updating styles and fixing some broken JavaScript .
The back end , at this point , was done , and it was expected that all of these pages would be done in the remaining 5 days to meet the original deadline .
The team worked for literally four days and four nights , occasionally taking a break for a power nap or , more often , a Red Bull .
Finally , they 'd finished .
Sure , it had a crazy table - based layout that had nested tables in the double digits .
Sure , it was buggy as hell .
Sure , some of the JavaScript was broken .
But if you 're willing to stretch your interpretation of what " done " means , it was done .
The following weekend , the team members that had n't died gone insane spent the weekend doing some final bug fixes before the big release on the following Monday .
So , in the end , the project was released on time , but not within budget or necessarily done right .
All Leon 's hard work and days and nights that had probably cost him years of his life were n't without reward , though .
No , he did n't get a bonus .
No , he did n't get time off ( after all , he was needed for bug fixes from version 1.0 ) .
He got something better — credit on the web site !

Mr Lewis originally threw his support behind Mrs Clinton in October
The defection comes the day after the two main Democratic presidential candidates clashed in a TV debate .
Neither candidate landed a killer blow , but correspondents say Mrs Clinton failed to stop Mr Obama 's momentum .
Mrs Clinton has been struggling to revive her campaign before critical primaries in Ohio and Texas .
' Tremendous pressure '
Mr Lewis , a congressman from Georgia and a veteran of the US civil rights movement , defended his switch of support by saying he wanted " to be on the side of the people " .
" The people are pressing for a new day in American politics and I think they see Senator Barack Obama as a symbol of that change , " he said in a statement .
He originally came out in support of Mrs Clinton 's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in October .
Mrs Clinton said she thought Mr Lewis had been under " tremendous pressure " to jump ship to the Obama campaign .
Black voters in Georgia voted overwhelmingly for Barack Obama in the state 's primary in February .
" At the end of the day it 's not about who is supporting us , it 's about what we 're presenting , what our positions are , what our experiences and qualifications are , " Mrs Clinton said .
Mr Obama said he was " deeply honoured " to have the support of Mr Lewis .
Clinton wins needed
His loss is a fresh blow to Mrs Clinton 's campaign after Mr Obama 's 11 straight primary and caucus victories .
Analysts say she needs to win a majority of delegates in the next big primaries in Texas and Ohio on 4 March to stay in the race .
The Democratic Party chooses its presidential candidate at the national nominating convention in August , ahead of the November elections .
In a televised debate in Cleveland , Ohio , on Tuesday , the two candidates accused each other of negative campaigning and attacked each other 's policies on health care , trade and foreign policy , including the Iraq war .
It was hard to define an outright winner of the debate , says the BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington .
But there was nothing to suggest Mrs Clinton did enough to turn the tide that has been moving in Mr Obama 's favour , says our correspondent .
Amazon ’s MP3 download service has moved up to be a strong number 2 competitor to Apple ’s iTunes , according to a new report in USA Today .
The service , which launched just six months ago , has becomes popular quickly thanks to its huge DRM - free library of digital music .
This speaks to a larger issue Apple has had with its iTunes store recently : Failure to fulfill content promises Steve Jobs makes quite publicly .
Apple made headlines early last year with Steve Jobs ’ memo posted to the company ’s website calling for an end to DRM ( digital rights management , the encryption that stops files from being copied and freely distributed ) .
Shortly thereafter , music label EMI and Apple struck a deal to bring the EMI ’s catalog of music to the iTunes store in a DRM - free format , which Apple dubbed “ iTunes Plus ” .
By the time last year ’s All Things D conference came around , Jobs stated , “ Half of all the songs on iTunes will be available on iTunes Plus by the end of the year . ”
The problem ?
We ’re just about 4 month into 2008 and that still has n’t come close to happening .
Of the more than 6 million songs on iTunes , only around 2 million are available in DRM - free form .
By comparison , every single track of the 4.5 million on AmazonMP3 is DRM - free .
Apple only has the one major label ( EMI ) with DRM - free tracks ; Amazon has all of the majors selling DRM - free music .
Is this all Steve Jobs ’ fault ?
No , the music labels seem perfectly content to hold out on the digital music behemoth .
Because iTunes controls around 80 percent of the digital music market , Jobs has been seen as having commanding power over the music industry .
In the past , industry execs have asked Apple for new iTunes options such as flexible pricing only to have Jobs refuse .
If AmazonMP3 keeps growing , it could be their leverage against Apple .
While the failure to meet the goal may not be Jobs ’ fault , he still did make the statement .
That , combined with his more recent failed promise of 1,000 digital movies available by the end of February for iTunes ’ new movie rental store , suggests a problematic trend .
Apple was only able to produce somewhere between 400 and 500 of the promised 1,000 titles .
It ’s not as if Apple is narrowly missing these goals .
Apple ’s customers ( I ’m a devout one myself ) are notoriously loyal .
Even after a few lackluster keynotes and a some botched launches ( OS X Leopard , the Apple TV and the iPhone SDK were all delayed ) , the general mood around the company has remained positive .
Jobs rewarded the patience with an excellent SDK event last month ( our coverage ) .
Apple ’s stock is even now finally showing signs of recovering after taking a massive hit at the start of the year .
That said , if Jobs keeps failing to deliver on promises made for his company , at what point do we stop listening ?
A boy can only cry “ wolf ” so many times .

MINSK ( Reuters ) - Belarus said on Tuesday it had uncovered a spy ring working for Washington , deepening a diplomatic and human rights row between the countries .

Hundreds of demonstrators from the ex-Soviet state ’s liberal and nationalist opposition , meanwhile , staged an unauthorized rally in the centre of Minsk and clashed with police .
Eyewitnesses said dozens were detained .
The U.S. ambassador this month left Belarus , whose president , Alexander Lukashenko , is accused by the West of violating basic rights .
Authorities objecting to what they saw as new sanctions against Belarus had urged her to go .
The U.S. embassy has since stopped issuing visas and complied with a request to cut diplomatic staff in Minsk .
On Tuesday , Belarus ’s intelligence service , still known by its Soviet - era initials KGB , said a spy ring of Belarussian citizens had been uncovered in the country of 10 million .
“ The information about this group being exposed is completely true , ” a KGB official said .
“ A group conducting espionage for the United States has been uncovered . ”
KGB chairman Yuri Zhadobin later told Belarussian media that no arrests had been made in what he said was a “ preventive ” operation .
New checks would determine if laws had been broken .
Tightly controlled state television reported at the weekend that a spying network of 10 Belarussian nationals had been exposed , but gave no details of concrete charges against them .
“ We have no spies working on the territory of Belarus .
These are people working for the diplomatic security service , ” U.S. charge d’affaires Jonathan Moore told local media .

The report showed people described as embassy employees working as informers for the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation .
Some told an interviewer they were gathering information to prevent terrorism .
OPPOSITION RALLY
In the evening , several hundred opposition activists gathered in a Minsk square to mark the 90th anniversary of the creation of the Belarussian People ’s Republic , crushed within months by Bolshevik forces .
No authorization had been granted for a city - centre rally .
Riot police surrounded the anti-Lukashenko protesters and broke them up into smaller groups .
Clashes broke out and dozens were seen being led away to a police bus .
The opposition , often hit by internal divisions , has rarely attracted large crowds during protests in recent months .
Both the United States and European Union have long accused Belarus of crushing freedom of press and assembly .
Both bar entry to Lukashenko on grounds he rigged his 2006 re-election .
U.S. officials , more critical , have denounced Belarus as “ the last dictatorship in Europe ” .
Lukashenko , at odds with traditional ally Russia over energy prices , seeks better ties with the West , particularly the EU .
Several detainees deemed political prisoners have been freed .
Washington last year prohibited dealings with national oil products firm Belneftekhim , but denies Belarussian allegations that it has since imposed new punitive measures .
The Foreign Ministry called for sanctions to be lifted .
“ If the U.S. side truly regrets what has happened and truly wants new and different relations with our country , it must rescind sanctions against Belarus , ” a ministry statement said .
U.S. ambassador Karen Stewart last week said Belarus could end the logjam by freeing Alexander Kozulin , who ran against Lukashenko in 2006 and was sentenced to 5 - 1/ 2 years for staging protests after his landslide re-election .
Lukashenko remains broadly popular and says social benefits have spared Belarussians the turmoil of other ex-Soviet states .
SACRAMENTO – Joe Six - pack will have to pay a lot more to get his buzz on if Assemblyman Jim Beall has his way .
The San Jose Democrat on Thursday proposed raising the beer tax by $ 1.80 per six - pack , or 30 cents per can or bottle .
The current tax is 2 cents per can .
That ’s an increase of about 1,500 percent .
Beall said the tax would generate $ 2 billion a year to fund health care services , crime prevention and programs to prevent underage drinking and addiction .
“ The people who use alcohol should pay for part of the cost to society , just like we ’ve accepted that concept with tobacco , ” Beall said .
He added that the beer tax has n’t been touched since 1991 , and the increase then was meager .
But the freshman lawmaker will have to lift the legislative equivalent of a full keg of beer over his head to get his tax enacted .
That ’s because it would require a two - thirds vote in the Assembly and Senate – and then , because it ’s a constitutional amendment , it would have to be approved by voters .
Republicans say it ’s a non-starter .
“ I predict the shelf life will be very short , ” said Assemblyman Roger Niello , R- Sacramento , vice chairman of the budget committee .
“ It ’s a piecemeal approach to the budget that completely avoids any discussion of spending discipline , which is fundamentally why we have the problem that we have . ”
Mike Fox Sr. , chairman of San Jose - based beer distributor M.E. Fox & Co. , said Beall ’s heart is in the right place .
“ He ’s very dedicated in areas of health , ” Fox said .
“ But a tax of that nature is far too grievous .
The beer industry produces so much for the economy .
He wo n’t get to first base with that . ”
Dan Gordon , co-founder of Gordon Biersch Brewing Co. , calculated that the tax on a barrel of beer would go from $ 6.40 to $ 89 .
“ We would all be looking for jobs , ” he said .
Beall said he ’s targeting beer because his research showed that California undertaxes brew relative to other states , which he said is n’t the case with wine and spirits .
But it ’s also true that taking on the beer lobby will be hard enough for Beall , without letting it team up with the wine and spirits industries .
Beall , a former Santa Clara County supervisor , has focused heavily on underage drinking during his time in Sacramento .
He is pushing legislation that would require the sweet alcoholic malt beverages known as “ alco - pops ” to include warning labels clearly stating that they contain alcohol .
And last year , Beall lobbied successfully to persuade the state Franchise Tax Board to tax “ alco - pops ” at the rate assessed to hard liquor products instead of beer – a move that was expected to raise the price of a six pack by about $ 2 .
The increase is scheduled to go into effect later this year .
That effort , however , did not require a two - thirds vote in the Legislature .

The early 1970 's sure were fun .
Of course , I 'm not quite old enough to know that first hand – and , based on the last reader survey , neither are most of you – but , longtime reader and contributor G.R.G. certainly remembers .
You see , by that time , computers were starting to become a novelty .
There was the computerized this and the computerized that - if something did n't have the adjective " computer " , had no blinking lights , and could n't even make a beeping noise , then it was booorrring .
Think back to those old Computer Football or Computer Hockey games that you saw at the flea market and then quickly passed up because they were nothing more than , well , a stupid board game with a few blinking lights that occasionally beeped .
It should come as no surprise that the local television news programs went computerized , too .
For the 1972 elections , one major TV station signed a deal with a certain Large Computer Company to provide " Computer Vote Totals " .
The idea being that viewers could tune in on election night and see the results of local , state , and national elections as they were reported .
It was pretty exciting , and the TV station made sure to heavily promote the " Computer Voter Totals " for weeks leading up the election .
They even made up a little computer jingle , full of bleeps and blorps .
When election night finally came , the TV station was ready to go .
They had a room full of impressive computers for everyone at home to see .
Not actual computers , mind you .
Those were not only far too large large for the studio , but they required 1,500 kilowatts of 400 cycle power .
Instead , the Large Computer Company shipped a bunch of 3000 - series I /O controllers .
Granted , the I/O controllers were n't actually hooked up to anything , and they had long been obsoleted by the 6600 - series I / O controllers , but they were 4 - to - 6 foot high racks full of electronics and had lots and lots of blinky lights .
Besides , the newer 6600 controllers were smaller and had grown out of the blinky - light phase .
As for the actual computers , those were back the Large Computer Company 's time - share facility .
Connected to the computers were a number of dumb terminals operated by a little old ladies .
The plan was to have the various precincts call in their vote totals , and have the little old ladies type the numbers in the terminal .
A custom - built FORTRAN program would tally up the results and display them on a dumb terminal screen , and which point the TV station would point their camera at it for all to see .
This particular company 's time sharing system had a rather strange design by today 's standard .
The original designers assumed that keyboard input to a running program would be rare and brief - perhaps an occasional letter to select a menu option or , at most , a line of text - so , they made the curious choice of signaling an " END OF FILE " with an empty line .
Just type in your text , hit " return " , and then " return " again .
In FORTRAN , when a simple READ ( 5 , * ) from the standard input encounters an END OF FILE , this triggers a major and irrecoverable error .
The reason being , FORTRAN was designed to be run in batch mode , so an unexpected EOF was a major boo boo .
Of course , one could detect the EOF condition , but this would require using a fancier form of the READ ( ) statement , something like : READ ( 5 , * , .END . = 600 ) LINE .
Back to election night , with the little old ladies typing in the precinct results , and the FORTRAN program crunching the numbers .
Things were starting to getting exciting in a few races , and the respected local anchorman started talking faster and faster .
" I think it 's finally time , " the anchorman said in a dramatic manner , " to bring up the Computer Vote Totals " .
The producer flipped over to the camera pointing to the dumb terminal , and everyone 's televisions at home were filled with Computer Vote Totals , flipping through all of the different races .
Not a second later , one of the little old ladies typing in the input pressed the RETURN key before selecting the right option .
Normally , this would n't have been a big problem , but the number - crunching programmer had forgotten to put that .END .= 600 option on the read statement .
Instantaneously , the presidential election results on several millions of TV watchers screen 's turned to this ...

DUMP FROM 000000 TO 177777
The TV station quickly cut to a commercial .
The " Computer Vote Totals " never quite made it back up that night .
Paris , France .
Saturday , payday , around nine o'clock in the evening .
There is still daylight because it is June , and on the small streets off the Boulevard Barbès the men line up outside the doorways .
Almost all are Algerians , neatly dressed .
One holds a bouquet .
They stand quietly , orderly , except when the door opens and they strain to see the half - dressed woman who lets a customer out .
The police station is a few yards away , but the officers on patrol show no interest in the line of customers .
It is like other poor neighborhoods in Paris — drab houses , small shops , and cafés — but something is different .
After a few moments , the observer realizes there are no women in the streets .
They have been left behind in Algeria while their husbands earn a living at the lowest - paying jobs in Paris .
Far apart both geographically and culturally , these three scenes have one significant common ingredient : sex is bought and sold with , if not the approval , at least the tolerance of both the police and the community .
The picture in most American cities is very different .
The prevailing policy toward prostitution is " get rid of it . "
No one , including the state legislatures which mandate this policy , believes this is possible .
But the consensus that official recognition of sex as a business would be immoral prevents thinking about prostitution in any other way .
The burden of enforcing the policy , of course , falls on the police .
And they are attacked from all sides .
Required by law to be enemies of the prostitutes , the police are also harassed by the public they are trying to protect .
If the crime rate goes up in a city , the police are criticized for using scarce resources to chase whores .
If , in order to make an arrest , a cop disguises himself as a customer , civil libertarians charge " entrapment . "
Lawmakers bold enough to propose licensing prostitution or zoning for it make few friends .
Neighborhood groups and business associations say , " Sure , an entertainment zone is a great idea , but not here . "
Feminist groups such as the National Organization for Women oppose licensing and support decriminalization of prostitution , insisting that women have a right to do what they want with their bodies .
They also argue that it is unfair to arrest the prostitutes and not their customers .
In 1971 , the Nevada legislature authorized any county with less than 200,000 inhabitants ( thus excluding the counties in which Reno and Las Vegas are located ) to license brothels .
No state has legalized prostitution .
So far four Nevada counties have exercised this local option .
Almost all of the licensed houses were in operation before the law passed , but now each house pays the county a business tax of $ 1000 per month ( $ 500 if there are less than seven prostitutes at work in a house ) .
Lyon County received $ 42,000 in taxes last year from its four brothels .
It is not an important source of county revenue compared with taxes from Anaconda Copper , which has its largest open - pit mining operation there .
On the other hand , neighboring Storey County , which ekes out just a little tax money from the tourist business at Virginia City , gets its largest revenue from Joe Conforte 's Mustang Ranch , the biggest and best - known of Nevada 's brothels .

HOW IT WORKS
We will assemble in Foley Square at 3 PM .
Please be on time .
Feel free to be early .
When we ’re organized , we will all head down to the Brooklyn Bridge 6 Train stop together .
Do not talk to others once you enter the subway system .
No one knows each other .
We will wait for a train to arrive on the uptown side of the tracks and all board our assigned cars ( follow your team leader ) .
A man with a megaphone will confirm that it is time to board the train .
We may let one train go before entering to make sure everyone is ready .
Sit in the car as you normally would .
Read a magazine or whatever you would normally do .
Your team leader will have already divided you into smaller groups , assigning your group a specific stop where you will depants .
Sit near your group .
As soon as the doors shut at the stop before yours , stand up and take your pants off and put them in your backpack .
If you ’d like to use a briefcase , purse , grocery bag , or whatever instead of a backpack that ’s fine too .
You are responsible for your own pants and they should be with you at all times .
If anyone asks you why you ’ve removed your pants , tell them that they were “ getting uncomfortable ” ( or something along those lines . )
Exit the train at your assigned stop and stand on the platform , pantless .
This is a new change for No Pants 2k7 .
You will wait on the platform for the next 6 train to arrive .
Stay in the exact same place on the platform so you enter the next train in the same car as you exited the last train .
When you enter , act as you normally would .
You do not know any of the other pantless riders .
If questioned , tell folks that you â€œforgot to wear pantsâ€  and yes you are â€œa little coldâ€ .
Insist that it is a coincidence that others also forgot their pants .
Be nice and friendly and normal .
We will exit the train at 125th street .
Pay attention so you do n’t miss this stop .
We will then repeat the mission back down to Union Square .
You can wear fun underwear if you like , but nothing that screams out â€ œI wore this because Iâ€™m doing a silly stunt.â€ 
Wear two pairs of underwear if it makes you feel more comfortable .
Do n’t wear a thong or anything else that might offend people .
Our aim is to make people laugh , not piss them off .
If you have n’t already , please take a moment to read the previous mission reports for the last six No Pants rides .
This is always a blast , and Iâ€™m really happy that you are taking part in it .
You may bring along friends if you like , but make sure they get a chance to read all of these instructions .
See you on the 12th !

Getting started :
Rejecting the Windows Vista Starter EULA
After I had unpacked the Acer Aspire 4320 notebook I got ready for turning the computer on for the very first time , and rejecting the Windows Vista Starter EULA , also known as the Microsoft c.q .
Windows tax .
Since I bought this notebook for experimenting with Ubuntu and open source software , I had no need for Vista .
Moreover , this notebook has only 80 G , of which a part is already used to keep a copy of Vista on a so called rescue partition .
In my not so humble opinion , if one pays for an operating system , at least a DVD should be included with the computer .
Last Monday
I had skimmed through two success stories of people getting a refund after they had rejected the EULA , not knowing that the next day I would buy a notebook , and make it actual .
Tuesday night I emailed Acer that I had bought an Aspire in Xalapa , Veracruz , and wanted a refund for Vista Starter .
Wednesday , at the end of the day I used the support form at the Acer Latin America on - line support site to contact Acer with the same message .
And last Friday I got a reply by Juan Rios to the latter from which I quote :
To complete your request you will need to go to the National Service Center located at : Acer México ( NSC ) Av. Ejército Nacional # 579 , 4 º Piso , Granada Miguel Hidalgo , D.F. 11520 Telefono : 018001118000 , 59999400 Fax 59999401 Lunes a Viernes 9:00 a 14:00 y 15:00 a 18:00 Hrs
Here your hard drive must be erased and the Windows License removed from the bottom of your laptop .
The National Service Center will then send the Windows Certificate of Authenticity ( COA ) to be processed and a refund check sent back to you .
Since the above address is located in Mexico city , this sounds to me like a complicate way of giving me the finger .
Especially since it was followed by :
I must clarify that the version of windows installed on your laptop is an OEM license and that the refund will be from $ 5.00 to $ 15.00 U.S. Dollars .
Fifteen USD is not even sufficient to buy a one - way bus ticket to travel from where I live , Xalapa , Veracruz , to Mexico City .
Anyway , I emailed Acer back to explain to them that I was going to reject the EULA , and install Ubuntu , effectively overwriting the hard disk drive , and that I would take plenty of photos of the process as proof .
Hopefully I know more next week on the refund issue .
This all might sound like a lot of trouble to go through , but in Mexico city three people can have dinner for 15 USD .
Talking about trouble ... how does one reject a license if there is no reject option ?
But now I am getting ahead of the story .
Vista Rejection
Time ( or not )
After having connected the Acer Aspire to the adapter , I turned the notebook on , after having consulted the " Just for starters " guide , step 5 , because I could n't find the On button with just a quick glimpse ( It 's close to the word Acer underneath the display ) .
I saw shortly the word Acer on the laptop , and then a progress bar with Microsoft Corporation written underneath it .
Then the mouse arrow appeared , which changed into a mouse arrow with an animated ring underneath it .
Next , after a bit more waiting the first Windows Vista Starter window showed up , in which I could select my location , time and money formats , and keyboard .
Since I was going to reject the license , I decided not to change anything , and pressed " Siguiente " ( Next ) .
And there is was , what I had been waiting for : the EULA ( End User License Agreement ) for Windows Vista Starter in the top half of the dialog window .
The bottom part contained an EULA for software Acer bundles with the Aspire notebook .
But where was the reject option for each EULA ?
I tried scrolling both EULAs , maybe I could only reject them if I had read each in its entirety .
But no such luck , no reject button would appear .
Then I tried to read the Microsoft EULA , hoping to find an answer , because how can one reject an EULA without a reject option ?
After some time I asked Esme for help , because my Spanish is not that good .
While Esme was trying to make sense of the Vista Starter EULA , I was browsing through the Acer Aspire User 's Guide to find how to get into the BIOS utility .
I had already decided that if we both could n't find a way to make a reject button appear it was not going to happen .
And in that case I would boot from the Ubuntu 7.10 ( Gutsy Gibbon ) desktop CD I just had burned , use the entire hard disk drive for installation , and be gone with Windows Vista Starter .
A few days ago I had skimmed through the User 's Guide and was sure it mentioned how to get into the BIOS utility somewhere .
And there it was , on page 42 : " To activate the BIOS utility , press < F2 > during POST " .
I also tried to find the EULA text online , for easier reading .
But when I entered the file name , VISTA_RM.1_STARTER_OEM_es-ES , into Google I got no results at all .
In the mean time Esme had found instructions of what to do when one does n't want to accept the Microsoft Windows Vista Starter end user license agreement :
Si usted no los acepta , no use el software .
En su lugar , póngase en contacto con el fabricante o instalador para conocer su directiva de devoluciones para obtener un reembolso o crédito .
Which roughly translates to :
If you do n't accept , do n't use the software .
Instead , contact the manufacturer or installer to obtain directions on how to obtain a reimbursement or credit .
Since I already had contacted Acer , I decided that it was time to reboot the computer , get into the BIOS setup utility , and install Gutsy Gibbon on the Acer notebook .

Introduction
This homepage is approved of by court .
THRICE AND WITHOUT APPEAL , by now .
It has thereby become the world 's first ( triple ) legal Fishman Homepage .
Read the ruling of the February 1996 lawsuit , summary proceedings , in either English or Dutch .
On June 10 1999 , there was a second ruling , this time in full procedure : my page can still stay up .
Read the ruling in Dutch or in English .
Scientology has appealed this ruling .
On September 4 2003 , the ruling in appeal was pronounced .
Again , the court deemed my quotes to be fully legal .
Read the full Dutch ruling ( sorry , no English translation available ) .
Scientology has appealed again , and the case is now before the Supreme Court , who will probably rule in the summer of 2005 .
On March 18 2005 , the Attorney - General filed his advice to the Supreme Court about Scientology 's case against us .
In his opinion , all claims of Scientology should be discarded .
The AG 's advice is available in Dutch only , as a two - part pdf : part 1 ( 2.2 Mb ) and part 2 ( 2,3 Mb ) .
The Supreme Court 's ruling was planned for July 8 2005 , but got postponed because Scientology suddenly dropped the case .
The Supreme Court will decide later this year whether they will still rule on the matter .
On December 16 2005 , the Supreme Court dismissed Scientology 's appeal and made the previous ruling final .
Because Scientology withdrew their appeal , no recourse is possible after this , i.e. they have made it impossible to go to the European Court .
In other words : I am finally free of this law suit .
This is the famous Fishman Affidavit .
To explain why is has become so famous , I 'll give you some more information .
And please take a look at the Scientology Litigation Kit , where I list the materials used for my defense and the lawsuit materials ( lawsuits , plea , defense , rulings ) and at postings and news about the Dutch Protest .
The Church of Scientology ( or : CoS ; or : Co$ , as some of their opponents call it ) sells its followers expensive courses which , if students study them carefully , are supposed to set them free ( ' clear ' them ) .
A former Scientology member , Steven Fishman , was brought before court because he committed several crimes in order to get the money to pay for these courses .
Scientology urged him to get the money any which way he could .
According to Fishman , they also assigned him to kill somebody , and failing that , ordered him to commit suicide .
In an interview for Time Magazine , Fishman relayed those stories and blamed Scientology for his crimes .
Scientology sued him for slander .
When Fishman was then brought to court , he used parts of Scientology - documents to prove he had been brainwashed by the Church .
These Scientology documents thereby became public material : anybody could go to the court library and read them .
The Church , fearing that its sacred secrets would be revealed , had some of their people going to the library every day to borrow these documents , thereby preventing other people ( read : non-Scientologists ) from reading them .
Nevertheless , the Fishman Affidavit got copied ( it was also available through the clerk of the court , for a mere $ 36.50 ) .
Somebody retrieved the affidavit via the clerk , scanned it , and posted it to the net .
The Fishman Affidavit has been travelling on the Internet ever since .
The funny thing is , when you read the document , you 'll just see a bunch of gibberish .
Apart from the instructions of how to treat non-Scientologists - almost every means is allowed to silence them ; lying is common sense ; cheating is part and parcel - there 's just this silly and badly written science - fiction tale about Xenu who controls all of us people ; except ( of course ) the few Scientologist who managed to ' clear ' themselves .
Well , L. Ron Hubbard was an sf - author , but not a very good one ( and jeez , I happen to like the genre ) .
But the real story is that Scientology does not want their followers to know what 's in store for them : they forbid everybody to read this material until they 've done lots of courses , stating that it would kill those who are not yet ready for it ; but more probably because people may stop believing Scientology once they 've read this lousy sf stuff .
And of course Scientology asks their followers massive amounts of money for the ' privilege ' of reading this .
To the best of my knowledge , the files here contain nothing but a court - document .
Indeed it does include some material that may or may not be copyrighted by RTC , Scientology 's copyright bureau ; but seeing that those fragments were included in the court - document , they may be published as part of that document .
In case somebody shows me that I included non-court materials ( preferably by sending me a court - stamped copy of the original document ) , I will most certainly remove those parts of the material presented here .
Of course I would never want to publish copyrighted material of RTC other than that made public by the court , or outside of the fair use provenance .
I am thoroughly aware of the importance of copyright and copyright laws , and I do respect them .
Scientology does not argue with people who do not agree with them .
They prefer to harass , start crazy lawsuits , have people followed by private detectives , and generally intimidate them .
They do not sue in order to win ; they sue in order to intimidate and harass .
( See especially Exhibit B in the Fishman Affidavit : On Control and Lying ) Currently , they are waging a war against Internet : trying to remove newsgroups , cancelling messages , forging messages , raiding providers .
Their motto is : ' Never defend , always attack ' and they are bent on ruining people who criticise them .
Scientology has ordered various raids on providers or computersystems from which documents exposing Scientology were available ; most notably FactNet , a group of people who are putting together an on - line archive about Scientology .
In Holland they raided XS4ALL ( where one of the users , Fonss , had a copy of the Fishman Affidavit on his homepage ) and ordered XS4ALL to remove it .
XS4ALL refused to do so , stating that the content of people 's homepage is not their responsibility and that they are not even allowed to interfere with what their customers put on their pages , provided that they 're legal ; and if anybody claims that a homepage is illegal , they 'd better present solid evidence .
After XS4 all was raided , Fonss voluntarily ( well , what would you do if you knew the Church was after you ? ) removed the Fishman Affidavit but provided a link on his page to another place where it could be obtained .
That is how I found it .
Ever since Scientology started to hunt down this document , the Fishman Affidavit is popping up everywhere .
It 's a dragon : when you cut off one head , it grows seven new ones .
I hereby present another copy of this dragon .
Since mid September 1995 , a number of reports on the Dutch Protest have been posted to the Internet - newsgroup that is devoted to discussion of CoS.
Concerning the lawsuit that Scientology presented me with and my subsequent defense for the court , read here for the Dutch version and here for the English version .

Grains and pulses have been removed from their original packing and subdivided into more affordable portions .
Above the door is a space where a television used to be , and by his elbow is the Qur'an and his ledger book .
His accounts make grim reading .
His customers owe him 5,000 shekels ( £ 613 ) , and he owes his suppliers double that .
" I 'm already almost closed and I really do n't know for how much longer I will continue .
Without the shop I could try ironing or driving a taxi .
It is in God 's hands , " he said , pointing to the Qur'an .
As the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah and the Israeli government in Jerusalem prepare for talks in the United States next month , Gaza is excluded from the new rapprochement .
Mr Sultan and others like him are facing ruin as a result of Israeli sanctions designed to weaken the Hamas government and punish their supporters .
According to a World Bank report issued last month : " Gaza 's economic backbone and private sector vitality risks collapse if the current situation ... continues . "
The report states that 90 % of Gaza 's industrial production has ceased and agricultural output has fallen by 50 % in 2007 .
While the Gazan economy is in free fall , Hamas , the main target of the Israeli sanctions , and its political rival , Fatah , appear to be awash with cash .
There were crowds in the main streets last week surveying lists of names to see if they had been nominated to receive a $ 100 ( £ 50 ) gift for Ramadan from either Hamas or Fatah .
Hamas was offering the sum to 40,000 people , while Fatah was giving to 65,000 .
Both parties , through their respective governments in Gaza and Ramallah , hope to pay their civil servants and security forces in full this month .
Hamas says it will pay 16,000 salaries this week , averaging $ 400 a person , while Fatah will pay around 60,000 - on the understanding that the recipients stay at home and do not work with the Hamas government .
Chris Gunness , a spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency , the organisation that provides social services for Palestinian refugees , said that the payment of wages in Gaza was having little effect on Gaza 's continued economic disintegration .
" There is an increasing sense of isolation and desperation which is likely to lead to a radicalisation of the population when there seems to be momentum in the peace process generally .
As ever the most vulnerable sectors of society are the hardest hit by the sanctions . "
The Israeli sanctions are affecting every level of Gazan society .
Farmers have been particularly hard hit as they have been barred from exporting their products and denied pesticides and fertiliser by Israel , which makes it impossible to plant for next year .
Spare parts for water pumps and other equipment are also barred .
The army recently banned the import of hearing aid batteries for Gaza 's school for the deaf on the grounds that they could be used to make bombs .
It is reducing the amount of food going into Gaza every week as it tries to exert more pressure on the population to bring about political change .
The Israeli army is micro-managing the sanctions to ensure that it cannot be accused of starving Gaza .
In a daily communique to international organisations , the army proclaims : " No Humanitarian Crisis in the Gaza Strip - No Hunger in the Palestinian Territories " , before it lists the number of days of food it estimates that Gaza has .
But dry statistics hide thousands of stories of misery .
" Normally at this time , before Eid [ the festival that marks the end of Ramadan ] , my shelves would be full of food and presents , but no one has any money to buy anything other than the bare essentials , " said Mr Sultan .
He has already sold his car and the furniture in his home to survive .
He used the $ 100 gift from Hamas to buy more stock .
But there are others who are even worse off .
Nabil Jaber Saleem , 45 , who suffers from diabetes , enters the store .
He used to work in Israel .
He says his 10 children are still hungry after breaking their fast with a meal of tomatoes , olives , yogurt and tea .
" It 's a desperate situation .
I do n't even have a shekel to spend on food , " he said .
Last night he told them that he can no longer afford to pay their school and university fees .
" I have told my children they would be better getting married or getting jobs because there is no money for education . "
When Russ started at InsuraCorp ( as I 'll call it ) , one thing was immediately apparent :
There were two classes of programmers .
The " rock stars , " who were recruited from top universities and given first - class accommodations , like windowed offices with brand new computers and dual 21 - inch LCD monitors ; and the " dinosaurs , " who were cramped in dimly lit cubicles each about the size of a refrigerator box .
The dinosaurs were lucky if they had a fully working keyboard for their Windows 98 workstations .
It had n't always been that way .
About six months earlier , the dinosaurs occupied the nicer offices .
They were responsible for maintaining -- some , originally building -- InsuraCorp 's 25 - year - old cash - cow product .
Though it worked very well , the system ran on the VMS operating system and was written in the now - forgotten Digital Interactive Business Oriented Language ( DIBOL ) , rendering it accessible only through a text - based terminal emulator .
In the age of the Web , and competitors with a more modern product , customers demanded more .
InsuraCorp vowed to hire a new team of sharp - minded programmers to completely rewrite the software as a Windows application using VisualBasic .
NET .
This was the project Russ was brought on for , albeit several months late .
With years of Windows and .NET - based development experience , Russ would be a great fit for the rock stars .
However , he had some background in COBOL , so his manager wanted him to " spend some time " with the dinosaurs .
Not in the Band
His association with the dinosaurs and his unwelcome suggestions ( such as not focusing on developing a " cool - looking " control library ) made him an outcast among the rock stars .
They increasingly kept " forgetting " to invite him to meetings and to assign him tasks , pushing Russ ' DIBOL responsibilities from " part time " to " full time . "
Though he dreaded this at first , Russ became rather grateful as version 2 " progressed . "
After nearly a year of development , the rock stars had little more than a buggy control library to show .
More time passed , and version 2 degenerated into a hybrid of old and new technology .
SQL Server had been abandoned for indexed files stored on VMS .
Multi- tier programming was also abandoned , leaving business calculations everywhere from within DIBOL code on VMS to the paint routine of a Windows control .
QA suffered as an inexperienced testing staff managed little more than " guerilla testing " on the constantly changing features .
Eventually , version 2 was ready .
It took four years , 15 full - time developers ( the rock stars ) , and cost nearly $ 10 million .
There was just one problem :
The customer that signed up to be the first conversion had changed its mind -- it was sticking with version 1 .
The second customer bailed as well .
It had seen some of the beta software and was none too impressed .
Trial and Error
After a few months of cajoling , the higher - ups at InsuraCorp finally found another candidate .
They convinced the client that version 2 ran circles around version 1 .
Though version 2's data still resided on the VMS , it took a full weekend to migrate the data from version 1 .
The first week of version 2 was rough , to say the least .
None of the accounts could be balanced , transactions would transfer odd amounts and exceptions would pop up from nowhere .
All of the rock stars were flown out to the customer 's main office to triage bugs and provide emergency fixes .
Things went downhill from there .
By week five , the customer had become downright hostile .
It was losing clients and demanded that InsuraCorp put it back on version 1 or face the wrath of its legal team .
Welcoming Back the Dinosaurs
With nowhere left to go , the higher - ups gave in .
They vowed to dedicate all of their programming resources -- the dinosaurs and rock stars -- to " de - converting " the customer .
Easier said than done .
There was now more than a month 's worth of client data on version 2 .
The higher - ups relied on one of the dinosaurs to lead the deconversion .
He had done many conversions from competitors in the past and was the most experienced DIBOL / VMS programmer .
The problem was , version 2's data structure was built by programmers fresh out of college , with no real - world experience and not a single architect to guide them .
The rock stars had created a monstrosity of a database , consisting of hundreds of undocumented tables tied together with hundreds of undocumented relations , all glued together with copious amounts of XML .
The rock stars were demoralized and defeated .
Some , sensing their impending termination , quit right away .
Others stuck around to patch the still - live version 2 and help with the deconversion .
Three months later , the customer was finally deconverted to version 1 .
The following day , the rest of the rock stars were fired and the dinosaurs quickly moved back into their windowed offices .
In the months since , the dinosaurs have shifted from " near - death " maintenance to full - on development .
Russ , along with his colleagues , has added several new features to the product .
And although there are no immediate plans to try building version 2 again , the higher - ups have learned their lesson :
Do n't push the dinosaurs toward extinction -- work on evolution .

Today , the Senate ’s effort to pass the stimulus bill failed to break the GOP filibuster by one vote .
One Senator missed the vote .
That would be the GOP ’s front runner , John McCain , who admits the economy is n’t his strong suit .
Clinton and Obama showed up to vote for the stimulus package .
McCain could n’t be bothered :
Despite their return from the campaign trail , Democrats fell one vote shy of the 60 votes they needed to bring forward their preferred economic stimulus bill .
Sen. John McCain ( Ariz . ) , the frontrunner for the Republican nomination , missed the vote .
Bush screwed up the economy .
McCain wants to carry the mantle of Bush .
That ’s all we need to know .
Harry Reid had some words for McCain and his GOP colleagues :
It is incredible that not even nine Republicans would join us to strengthen our weakening economy by helping those who need it most .
Given a chance to act as a recession looms , more than 40 Republicans today said no to helping 20 million seniors and no to 250,000 disabled veterans .
They said no to those who have lost their jobs and no to small business that are suffering in the Bush economy .
They said no to helping American families pay their heating bill and avoid foreclosure .
Screwing the economy , screwing disabled Vets , screwing seniors … McCain already is a Bush clone .

Two weeks after Attorney General Michael Mukasey tearfully told a San Francisco audience the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks could have been prevented if the government had been able to wiretap a phone call from Afghanistan , the Justice Department is still trying to explain what he meant , and a congressional leader is demanding answers .
Among the questions posed by House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , D - Mich. , to Mukasey is whether any such phone call actually occurred and , if so , why the government was n't able to use its legal and technological powers to monitor it .
The attorney general , speaking to the Commonwealth Club on March 27 , defended President Bush 's program of wiretapping calls between Americans and suspected foreign terrorists without court authorization and said no warrant should be needed to eavesdrop on a phone call from Iraq to the United States .
Before Sept. 11 , 2001 , Mukasey said , " we knew that there had been a call from someplace that was known to be a safe house in Afghanistan , and we knew that it came to the United States .
We did n't know precisely where it went . "
He paused , seemed to stifle tears , then continued , " You 've got 3,000 people who went to work that day , and did n't come home , to show for that . "
Difficult to verify
It seemed like a sensational disclosure - a phone call that , if traced and monitored , could have allowed authorities to thwart the attacks - but it has proved difficult to verify .
A 2003 joint congressional inquiry mentioned phone messages between one of the Sept. 11 hijackers and an al Qaeda safe house - in the Middle East , not Afghanistan - but said the messages were intercepted by the National Security Agency , which failed to share them with other agencies .
The bipartisan commission that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks issued a report that did not mention any phone call like the one Mukasey described .
Former Rep. Lee Hamilton , D - Ind. , vice chairman of the commission , said in a statement this week that the panel " did not receive any information pertaining to ( the call 's ) occurrence . "
Conyers was also mystified .
In a letter to Mukasey on April 3 , the congressman said he had found no reference to such a call , " despite extensive inquiries after 9/11 . "
After several requests , Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr issued a statement saying Mukasey " has referred to this before . "
It came in a letter Mukasey and Michael McConnell , the director of national intelligence , sent to the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee in February urging passage of legislation to extend the surveillance program .
The letter said one of the hijackers , while living in the United States , had " communicated with a known overseas terrorist facility . "
The letter did n't describe the call any further but asserted it had been mentioned in an unclassified section of the 2003 congressional report - which , as others noted , contained no apparent reference to a call from Afghanistan .
Because the government , in monitoring that call , relied on a 1981 executive order by President Ronald Reagan that focused on overseas communications , " the intelligence community could not identify the domestic end of the communication " before Sept. 11 , Mukasey and McConnell wrote .
Authorization to wiretap ?
But the executive order would have allowed the government to wiretap such a call , said Kurt Opsahl , a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a privacy - rights group representing phone customers who have sued over the surveillance program .
He noted that the order allowed intercepting calls to the United States if the attorney general had probable cause to believe the U.S. recipient was a terrorist - a standard that easily could have been met , Opsahl said , for any message from an al Qaeda safe house .
He said the government also could have listened to the call under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which allowed wiretapping of suspected terrorist communications from abroad for up to 48 hours - a period since extended to 72 hours - before a warrant was required from a special court that virtually always grants such requests .
Conyers ' letter cited the same law and said Mukasey 's San Francisco statement " appears to suggest a fundamental misunderstanding of the federal government 's existing surveillance authority to combat terrorism , as well as possible malfeasance by the government prior to 9/11 . "
An expert on surveillance law also noted that , if the government needed only to identify the U.S. destination of the call , it could have legally recorded the phone number with a pen register , a device that does n't require wiretapping authority .
While the letter by Mukasey and McConnell raised legitimate questions about the authority the government needs to eavesdrop on some communications to the United States , it failed to explain why the call could n't have been monitored , said Orin Kerr , a George Washington University law professor who worked on criminal surveillance at the Justice Department from 1998 to 2001 .
Asked for clarification , Carr , the Justice Department spokesman , said inquiring whether current law could have been used to intercept this call " misses the central point " - which , he said , is that intelligence professionals should not need court approval before targeting foreigners .
He said the department was reviewing Conyers ' letter and would respond to it .
If the Democrats Want to Win ...
If the Democrats really want to prevail over George W. Bush on the Iraq War and on his authoritarian vision of presidential powers , they would put back on the table two options that their leaders have removed : a cut - off of war funding and impeachment .

Printer friendly Rather than all - night debates about resolutions that will go nowhere , the Democrats would make the case to the American people that Bush has trampled on the Constitution ; he has ensnared the nation in a catastrophic war by lying ; and he has his eyes set on more dangerous chicanery in the months ahead .
The Democrats would explain that Bush has refused to compromise when offered the chance ; he has told the people ’s representatives that their only war role is to finance whatever " the decider " wants to do ; he has declared that he has the right to ignore or break the law ; he has engaged in cover-ups of serious wrongdoing by his subordinates and is now counting on his right - wing judicial appointees to protect him from oversight .
The Democrats would call on the American people to stand up at this dangerous moment in their history – when the president and vice president have become enemies of the constitutional system devised by the Founders , a Republic based on the idea that all people possess inalienable rights and governments must ensure those rights .
Never have a president and vice president abused the public trust to the extent that George W. Bush and Dick Cheney have .
They have engaged in a consistent pattern of deception , not just political spin or cover-ups of petty matters , but lying about the most profound of issues , including war and the meaning of “ freedom ” and “ democracy . ”
While Bush ’s remaining acolytes – the likes of New York Times columnist David Brooks – continue to gush over Bush ’s rhetoric about “ freedom , ” the reality is that Bush has eviscerated many of the most important civil liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
Claiming “ plenary ” – or total – powers as Commander in Chief during an endless and boundless “ war on terror , ” Bush has swept aside the rights that have traditionally defined freedom , including habeas corpus guarantees to a fair trial , protections against unreasonable search and seizure , prohibitions on cruel and unusual punishments .
Bush also has shown contempt for democracy , from blocking a full counting of Florida ’s votes in Election 2000 to bullying dissenters prior to the Iraq War to punishing the Palestinians for voting for leaders that Bush does n’t like .
Yet Brooks and other pundits remain in awe of Bush ’s supposed reverence for exactly the principles that he has trashed .
For instance , in the July 17 New York Times , Brooks hailed Bush ’s “ unconquerable faith in the rightness of his Big Idea ” as expressed by the president during a question - and - answer session in the White House 's Roosevelt Room on July 13 : “ It ’s more of a theological perspective , ” Bush said about his confidence that democracy and freedom are on the march .
“ I do believe there is an Almighty , and I believe a gift of that Almighty to all is freedom .
And I will tell you that is a principle that no one can convince me that does n’t exist . ”
Offensive Lies But Bush ’s declarations about freedom may rank as his most offensive lies of all .
They go beyond mere hypocrisy , to some Orwellian formulation that demands public allegiance to an assertion that is the opposite of the truth , like “ freedom is slavery ” or , in this case , “ freedom is obedience ” to Bush .
Similarly , Bush appeared before the United Nations on Sept. 19 , 2006 , praising its Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 .
He said , “ The words of the Universal Declaration are as true today as they were when they were written . ”
But either Bush did n’t have the faintest idea what those principles were – or he had grown so confident in never being challenged that he thought he could say whatever he wanted , no matter how false or deceptive .
Among the 30 rights proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are these : --“ Everyone has the right to life , liberty and security of person . ”
-- “ No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . ”
--“ Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law . ”
-- “ No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest , detention or exile . ”
--“ Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal , in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him . ” --
“ Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defense . ”
-- “ No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation .
Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks . ”
--“ Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression ; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek , receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers . ”
Though Bush ’s actions in the “ war on terror ” have violated many if not all the above - cited human rights tenets , Bush unblushingly cited the Universal Declaration as the foundation for his supposed crusade to spread freedom and democracy around the world .
Reality Defined Bush apparently believes that he is not only a law onto himself but that he gets to define reality , creating his own fantasyland that everyone else must accept as true .
He is an imperial president living in an anti-empirical world .
Psychologists may debate whether Bush is delusional or just an extremely accomplished liar , but either way he represents an unprecedented threat to the future of the American Republic and to the survivability of the planet .
So , what can be done ?
If Bush is to be deterred , the country – and the Congress – must make clear that the public response will be commensurate to the threat personified by Bush and Cheney .
In other words , half - hearted half - measures wo n’t do .
The stakes must be raised and the battle joined .
Since Bush already has made clear he will spurn any constraining war resolutions from Congress , the Democrats must face up to their real options ( aside from surrender ) : move to cut off war funding ( beyond what is needed for an orderly withdrawal ) and / or commence impeachment hearings for both Bush and Cheney .
Though key Democratic leaders have dismissed these ideas as either impossible or politically risky , they mark the only real hope of forcing Bush into compromising or at least deterring him from other rash actions , such as another military escalation in Iraq or an expansion of the war into Iran .
Impeachment hearings also would give the American people a focus for both understanding the threat that Bush represents to their constitutional system and giving them a way to stand up to him .
The public also gets the idea of impeachment -- it 's like you 're firing the guy -- while they are confused and demoralized by the current legislative maneuvering .
Even if the Republicans succeed in blocking the Bush - Cheney impeachment in the House or their removal from office in the Senate , Congress would have served notice that it rejects Bush ’s dark vision for America -- and the momentous issues of Campaign 2008 would be clarified .

Gary Webb's Enduring Legacy
Three years ago , I walked into my home in Arlington , Virginia , and checked my phone messages .
One was from a Los Angeles Times reporter who was looking for a comment from me about Gary Webb ’s suicide on the night of Dec. 9 , 2004 .
It was the first I had heard of the news .

After I recovered from the shock , I called the reporter back to get more details .
I also told him he would have a hard time writing a decent obituary on Webb because the L.A.
Times had never acknowledged that Webb was substantially correct in his reporting about the Nicaraguan contras ' role in smuggling cocaine into the United States in the 1980s .
Though Los Angeles had been hit hard by the “ crack epidemic ” and the L.A.
Times had devoted front - page space to trash Webb ’s contra-cocaine reporting in 1996 , the newspaper never ran a story detailing the CIA inspector general ’s 1998 findings , which confirmed much of what Webb had alleged – and more .
The CIA inspector general found that not only had the contras helped the cocaine cartels get their goods into the United States , but that the CIA and the Reagan administration had helped cover up the evidence .
However , to have written that story in 1998 , the L.A .
Times editors would have had to admit they had wronged Webb two years earlier when they bought into the ongoing government cover stories about the innocence of the Reagan administration and the CIA .
It was much easier for the L.A .
Times to ignore the findings of the CIA 's own inspector general and to maintain the fiction that Webb was just a reckless reporter who had gotten the contra - cocaine story all wrong .
That decision by the L.A. Times – when combined with the abusive treatment Webb received from other major news outlets and his betrayal by his own editors at the San Jose Mercury News – had sent Webb ’s life into a downward spiral that ended with him shooting himself with his father ’s handgun .
On Dec. 10 , 2004 , I told the L.A.
Times reporter that since his newspaper had never reported on the CIA ’s admissions , he could not put Webb ’s death in any honest context .
So , I was not surprised the next day when the L.A .
Times published a nasty obituary that treated Webb as if he had been a common criminal rather than a fellow journalist .
The Washington Post republished the graceless L.A. Times obit – and it quickly hardened into the official judgment on Gary Webb .
Yet , today , when trying to understand how the United States ended up with a national press corps that so eagerly passed on government propaganda about Iraq ’s WMD and other lies , it is worth recalling the story of Gary Webb and the contra - cocaine scandal .
Dark Alliance
Webb ’s death in 2004 had its roots in his fateful decision eight years earlier to write a three - part series for the San Jose Mercury News that challenged a potent conventional wisdom shared by the elite U.S. news organizations – that one of the most shocking scandals of the 1980s just could n’t be true .
Webb ’s “ Dark Alliance ” series , published in August 1996 , revived the decade - old allegations that the Reagan administration in the 1980s had tolerated and protected cocaine smuggling by its client army of Nicaraguan rebels known as the contras .
Though substantial evidence of the contra crimes had surfaced in the mid-1980s ( initially in an article that Brian Barger and I wrote for the Associated Press in December 1985 and later at hearings conducted by Sen. John Kerry ) , the major news outlets had bent to pressure from the Reagan administration and refused to take the disclosures seriously .
Reflecting the dominant attitude toward Kerry and his work on the contra - cocaine scandal , Newsweek even dubbed the Massachusetts senator a “ randy conspiracy buff . ”
[ For details , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Kerry ’s Contra - Cocaine Chapter ” or Robert Parry ’s Lost History : Contras , Cocaine , the Press & Project Truth . ]
Thus , the ugly reality of the contra - cocaine scandal was left in that netherworld of uncertainty , largely proven with documents and testimony but never accepted by Official Washington , including its premier news organizations , such as the New York Times and the Washington Post .
But Webb ’s series thrust the scandal back into prominence by connecting the contra-cocaine trafficking to the spread of crack that ravaged Los Angeles and other American urban centers in the 1980s .
For that reason , African - American communities were up in arms as were their elected representatives in the Congressional Black Caucus .
So , Webb ’s “ Dark Alliance ” series offered a unique opportunity for the major news outlets to finally give the contra-cocaine scandal the attention it deserved .
But that would have required some painful self - criticism among Washington journalists whose careers had advanced in part because they had not offended Reagan supporters who had made an art out of punishing out - of - step reporters for pursuing controversies like the contra -cocaine scandal .
Also , by the mid-1990s , a powerful right - wing news media had taken shape and was in no mood to accept the notion that many of President Reagan ’s beloved contras were drug traffickers .
That recognition would have cast a shadow over the Reagan Legacy , which the Right was busy elevating into mythic status .
There was the turf issue , too .
Since Webb ’s stories coincided with the emergence of the Internet as an alternate source for news and the San Jose Mercury News was at the center of Silicon Valley , the big newspapers saw a threat to their historic dominance as the nation ’s gatekeepers for what information should be taken seriously .
Plus , the major media ’s focus in the mid-1990s was on scandals swirling around Bill Clinton , such as some firings at the White House Travel Office and convoluted questions about his old Whitewater real - estate deal .
In other words , there was little appetite to revisit scandals from the Reagan years and there was strong motive to disparage what Webb had written .
Rev. Moon ’s Newspaper
It fell to Rev. Sun Myung Moon ’s right - wing Washington Times to begin the counterattack .
The Washington Times turned to some ex-CIA officials , who had participated in the contra war , to refute the drug charges .
Then – in a pattern that would repeat itself over the next decade – the Washington Post and other mainstream newspapers quickly lined up behind the right - wing press .
On Oct. 4 , 1996 , the Washington Post published a front - page article knocking down Webb ’s story , although acknowledging that some contra operatives did help the cocaine cartels .
The Post ’s approach was twofold : first , it presented the contra - cocaine allegations as old news – “ even CIA personnel testified to Congress they knew that those covert operations involved drug traffickers , ” the Post sniffed – and second , the Post minimized the importance of the one contra smuggling channel that Webb had highlighted – that it had not “ played a major role in the emergence of crack . ”
A Post side - bar story dismissed African - Americans as prone to “ conspiracy fears . ”
Soon , the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times joined in the piling on against Gary Webb .
The big newspapers made much of the CIA ’s internal reviews in 1987 and 1988 – almost a decade earlier – that supposedly had cleared the spy agency of a role in contra-cocaine smuggling .
But the CIA ’s decade - old cover - up began to weaken on Oct. 24 , 1996 , when CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz conceded before the Senate Intelligence Committee that the first CIA probe had lasted only 12 days , the second only three days .
He promised a more thorough review .
Nevertheless , Webb was becoming the target of media ridicule .
Influential Post media critic Howard Kurtz mocked Webb for saying in a book proposal that he would explore the possibility that the contra war was primarily a business to its participants .
“ Oliver Stone , check your voice mail , ” Kurtz smirked .
[ Washington Post , Oct. 28 , 1996 ]
Webb ’s suspicion was not unfounded , however .
Indeed , White House aide Oliver North ’s chief contra emissary Rob Owen had made the same point in a March 17 , 1986 , message about the contra leadership .
“ Few of the so - called leaders of the movement … really care about the boys in the field , ” Owen wrote .
“ THIS WAR HAS BECOME A BUSINESS TO MANY OF THEM . ” [ Capitalization in the original . ]
Mercury News Retreat Kurtz and other big - name journalists may have been ignorant of key facts about the contra war , but that did n’t stop them from pillorying Gary Webb .
The ridicule also had a predictable effect on the executives of the Mercury News .
By early 1997 , executive editor Jerry Ceppos was in retreat .
On May 11 , 1997 , Ceppos published a front - page column saying the series “ fell short of my standards . ”
He criticized the stories because they “ strongly implied CIA knowledge ” of contra connections to U.S. drug dealers who were manufacturing crack - cocaine .
“ We did not have proof that top CIA officials knew of the relationship , ” Ceppos wrote .
The big newspapers celebrated Ceppos ’s retreat as vindication of their own dismissal of the contra -cocaine stories .
Ceppos next pulled the plug on the Mercury News ’ continuing contra-cocaine investigation and reassigned Webb to a small office in Cupertino , California , far from his family .
Webb resigned the paper in disgrace .
For undercutting Webb and other Mercury News reporters working on the contra investigation , Ceppos was lauded by the American Journalism Review and was given the 1997 national “ Ethics in Journalism Award ” by the Society of Professional Journalists .
While Ceppos won raves , Webb watched his career collapse and his marriage break up .
Still , Gary Webb had set in motion internal government investigations that would bring to the surface long - hidden facts about how the Reagan administration had conducted the contra war .
The CIA published the first part of Inspector General Hitz ’s findings on Jan. 29 , 1998 .
Despite a largely exculpatory press release , Hitz ’s Volume
One admitted that not only were many of Webb ’s allegations true but that he actually understated the seriousness of the contra - drug crimes and the CIA ’s knowledge .
Hitz acknowledged that cocaine smugglers played a significant early role in the Nicaraguan contra movement and that the CIA intervened to block an image - threatening 1984 federal investigation into a San Francisco - based drug ring with suspected ties to the contras , the so - called “ Frogman Case . ”
On May 7 , 1998 , another disclosure shook the earlier presumptions of the Reagan administration ’s innocence .
Rep. Maxine Waters , a California Democrat , introduced into the Congressional Record a Feb. 11 , 1982 , letter of understanding between the CIA and the Justice Department .
The letter , which had been requested by CIA Director William Casey , freed the CIA from legal requirements that it must report drug smuggling by CIA assets , a provision that covered both the Nicaraguan contras and Afghan rebels who were fighting a Soviet - supported regime in Afghanistan and who were implicated in heroin trafficking .
Justice Report
The next break in the cover - up was a report by the Justice Department ’s inspector general Michael Bromwich .
Given the hostile climate surrounding Webb ’s series , Bromwich ’s report opened with criticism of Webb .
But , like the CIA ’s Volume One , the contents revealed new details about government wrongdoing .
According to evidence cited by Bromwich , the Reagan administration knew almost from the outset of the contra war that cocaine traffickers permeated the paramilitary operation .
The administration also did next to nothing to expose or stop the crimes .
Bromwich ’s report revealed example after example of leads not followed , corroborated witnesses disparaged , official law - enforcement investigations sabotaged , and even the CIA facilitating the work of drug traffickers .
The report showed that the contras and their supporters ran several parallel drug - smuggling operations , not just the one at the center of Webb ’s series .
The report also found that the CIA shared little of its information about contra drugs with law - enforcement agencies and on three occasions disrupted cocaine - trafficking investigations that threatened the contras .
Though depicting a more widespread contra - drug operation than Webb had understood , the Justice report also provided some important corroboration about a Nicaraguan drug smuggler , Norwin Meneses , who was a key figure in Webb ’s series .
Bromwich cited U.S. government informants who supplied detailed information about Meneses ’s operation and his financial assistance to the contras .
For instance , Renato Pena , a money - and - drug courier for Meneses , said that in the early 1980s , the CIA allowed the contras to fly drugs into the United States , sell them and keep the proceeds .
Pena , who was the northern California representative for the CIA - backed FDN contra army , said the drug trafficking was forced on the contras by the inadequate levels of U.S. government assistance .
The Justice report also disclosed repeated examples of the CIA and U.S. embassies in Central America discouraging Drug Enforcement Administration investigations , including one into contra-cocaine shipments moving through the international airport in El Salvador .
Inspector General Bromwich said secrecy trumped all .
“ We have no doubt that the CIA and the U.S. Embassy were not anxious for the DEA to pursue its investigation at the airport , ” he wrote .
Despite the remarkable admissions in the body of these reports , the big newspapers showed no inclination to read beyond the press releases .
Cocaine Crimes & Monica
By fall 1998 , Official Washington was obsessed with the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal , which made it easier to ignore even more stunning contra-cocaine disclosures in the CIA ’s Volume Two .
In Volume Two , published Oct. 8 , 1998 , CIA Inspector General Hitz identified more than 50 contras and contra-related entities implicated in the drug trade .
He also detailed how the Reagan administration had protected these drug operations and frustrated federal investigations throughout the 1980s .
According to Volume Two , the CIA knew the criminal nature of its contra clients from the start of the war against Nicaragua ’s leftist Sandinista government .
The earliest contra force , called ADREN or the 15th of September Legion , had chosen “ to stoop to criminal activities in order to feed and clothe their cadre , ” according to a June 1981 draft CIA field report .
ADREN also employed terrorist methods , including the bombing of Nicaraguan civilian planes and hijackings , to disrupt the Sandinista government , the CIA knew .
Cocaine smuggling was also in the picture .
According to a September 1981 cable to CIA headquarters , two ADREN members made the first delivery of drugs to Miami in July 1981 .
ADREN 's leaders included Enrique Bermudez and other early contras who would later direct the major contra army , the CIA - organized FDN .
Throughout the war , Bermudez remained the top contra military commander .
The CIA later corroborated the allegations about ADREN ’s cocaine trafficking , but insisted that Bermudez had opposed the drug shipments to the United States which went ahead nonetheless .
Ends and Means
The truth about Bermudez ’s supposed objections to drug trafficking , however , was less clear .
According to Volume One , Bermudez enlisted Norwin Meneses , a large - scale Nicaraguan cocaine smuggler , to raise money and buy supplies for the contras .
Volume
One had quoted a Meneses associate , another Nicaraguan trafficker named Danilo Blandon , who told Hitz ’s investigators that he and Meneses flew to Honduras to meet with Bermudez in 1982 .
At the time , Meneses ’s criminal activities were well known in the Nicaraguan exile community .
But Bermudez told the cocaine smugglers that “ the ends justify the means ” in raising money for the contras .
After the Bermudez meeting , contra soldiers helped Meneses and Blandon get past Honduran police who briefly arrested them on drug - trafficking suspicions .
After their release , Blandon and Meneses traveled on to Bolivia to complete a cocaine transaction .
There were other indications of Bermudez ’s drug - smuggling tolerance .
In February 1988 , another Nicaraguan exile linked to the drug trade accused Bermudez of narcotics trafficking , according to Hitz ’s report .
After the contra war ended , Bermudez returned to Managua , where he was shot to death on Feb. 16 , 1991 .
The murder has never been solved .
Along the Southern Front , in Costa Rica , the drug evidence centered on the forces of Eden Pastora , another leading contra commander .
But Hitz discovered that the U.S. government may have made matters worse .
Hitz revealed that the CIA put an admitted drug operative – known by his CIA pseudonym “ Ivan Gomez ” – in a supervisory position over Pastora .
Hitz reported that the CIA discovered Gomez ’s drug history in 1987 when Gomez failed a security review on drug - trafficking questions .
In internal CIA interviews , Gomez admitted that in March or April 1982 , he helped family members who were engaged in drug trafficking and money laundering .
In one case , Gomez said he assisted his brother and brother - in - law in transporting cash from New York City to Miami .
He admitted that he “ knew this act was illegal . ”
Later , Gomez expanded on his admission , describing how his family members had fallen $ 2 million into debt and had gone to Miami to run a money - laundering center for drug traffickers .
Gomez said “ his brother had many visitors whom [ Gomez ] assumed to be in the drug trafficking business . ”
Gomez ’s brother was arrested on drug charges in June 1982 .
Three months later , in September 1982 , Gomez started his CIA assignment in Costa Rica .
Years later , convicted drug trafficker Carlos Cabezas alleged that in the early 1980s , Ivan Gomez was the CIA agent in Costa Rica who was overseeing drug - money donations to the contras .
Gomez “ was to make sure the money was given to the right people [ the contras ] and nobody was taking ... profit they were n’t supposed to , ” Cabezas stated publicly .
But the CIA sought to discredit Cabezas at the time because he had trouble identifying Gomez ’s picture and put Gomez at one meeting in early 1982 before Gomez started his CIA assignment .
While the CIA was able to fend off Cabezas ’s allegations by pointing to these discrepancies , Hitz ’s report revealed that the CIA was nevertheless aware of Gomez ’s direct role in drug - money laundering , a fact the agency hid from Sen.
Kerry ’s investigation in 1987 .
The Bolivian Connection
There also was more about Gomez .
In November 1985 , the FBI learned from an informant that Gomez ’s two brothers had been large - scale cocaine importers , with one brother arranging shipments from Bolivia ’s infamous drug kingpin Roberto Suarez .
Suarez already was known as a financier of right - wing causes .
In 1980 , with the support of Argentine ’s hard - line anti-communist military regime , Suarez bankrolled a coup in Bolivia that ousted the elected left - of - center government .
The violent putsch became known as the Cocaine Coup because it made Bolivia the region 's first narco - state .
Bolivia ’s government - protected cocaine shipments helped transform the Medellin cartel from a struggling local operation into a giant corporate - style business for delivering cocaine to the U.S. market .
Some of those profits allegedly found their way into contra coffers .
Flush with cash in the early 1980s , Suarez invested more than $ 30 million in various right - wing paramilitary operations , including the contra forces in Central America , according to U.S. Senate testimony by an Argentine intelligence officer , Leonardo Sanchez - Reisse .
In 1987 , Sanchez - Reisse said the Suarez drug money was laundered through front companies in Miami before going to Central America .
There , other Argentine intelligence officers – veterans of the Bolivian coup – trained the contras .
CIA Inspector General Hitz added another piece to the mystery of the Bolivian - contra connection .
One contra fund - raiser , Jose Orlando Bolanos , boasted that the Argentine government was supporting his anti-Sandinista activities , according to a May 1982 cable to CIA headquarters .
Bolanos made the statement during a meeting with undercover DEA agents in Florida .
He even offered to introduce them to his Bolivian cocaine supplier .
Containing the Scandal Despite all this suspicious drug activity around Ivan Gomez and the contras , the CIA insisted that it did not unmask Gomez until 1987 , when he failed a security check and confessed his role in his family ’s drug business .
The CIA official who interviewed Gomez concluded that “ Gomez directly participated in illegal drug transactions , concealed participation in illegal drug transactions , and concealed information about involvement in illegal drug activity , " Hitz wrote .
But senior CIA officials still protected Gomez .
They refused to refer the Gomez case to the Justice Department , citing the 1982 DOJ - CIA agreement that spared the CIA from a legal obligation to report narcotics crimes by non-employees .
Instead , the CIA eased Gomez , an independent contractor , out of the agency in February 1988 , without alerting law enforcement or the congressional oversight committees .
When questioned about the case nearly a decade later , one senior CIA official who had supported the gentle treatment of Gomez had second thoughts .
“ It is a striking commentary on me and everyone that this guy ’s involvement in narcotics did n’t weigh more heavily on me or the system , ” the official acknowledged .
A Medellin drug connection arose in another section of Hitz ’s report , when he revealed evidence suggesting that some contra trafficking may have been sanctioned by Reagan 's National Security Council .
The protagonist for this part of the contra-cocaine mystery was Moises Nunez , a Cuban - American who worked for Oliver North ’s NSC contra-support operation and for two drug - connected seafood importers , Ocean Hunter in Miami and Frigorificos de Puntarenas in Costa Rica .
Frigorificos de Puntarenas was created in the early 1980s as a cover for drug - money laundering , according to sworn testimony by two of the firm ’s principals – Carlos Soto and Medellin cartel accountant Ramon Milian Rodriguez .
Drug allegations were swirling around Moises Nunez by the mid-1980s .
At the AP , his operation was one of the targets of our investigation .
Finally reacting to these suspicions , the CIA questioned Nunez on March 25 , 1987 , about his alleged cocaine trafficking .
He responded by pointing the finger at his NSC superiors .
“ Nunez revealed that since 1985 , he had engaged in a clandestine relationship with the National Security Council , ” Hitz reported , adding : “ Nunez refused to elaborate on the nature of these actions , but indicated it was difficult to answer questions relating to his involvement in narcotics trafficking because of the specific tasks he had performed at the direction of the NSC .
Nunez refused to identify the NSC officials with whom he had been involved . ”
After this first round of questioning , CIA headquarters authorized an additional session , but then senior CIA officials reversed the decision .
There would be no further efforts at “ debriefing Nunez . ”
Hitz noted that “ the cable [ from headquarters ] offered no explanation for the decision ” to stop the Nunez interrogation .
But the CIA ’s Central American task force chief Alan Fiers said the Nunez - NSC drug lead was not pursued “ because of the NSC connection and the possibility that this could be somehow connected to the Private Benefactor program [ the contra money handled by North ] .
A decision was made not to pursue this matter . ”
Joseph Fernandez , who had been the CIA ’s station chief in Costa Rica , later confirmed to congressional Iran - Contra investigators that Nunez “ was involved in a very sensitive operation ” for North ’s “ Enterprise . ”
The exact nature of that NSC - authorized activity has never been divulged .
At the time of the Nunez - NSC drug admissions and his truncated interrogation , the CIA ’s acting director was Robert M. Gates , who is now President George W. Bush ’s Secretary of Defense .
Miami Vice
The CIA also worked directly with other drug - connected Cuban - Americans on the contra project , Hitz found .
One of Nunez ’s Cuban - American associates , Felipe Vidal , had a criminal record as a narcotics trafficker in the 1970s .
But the CIA still hired him to serve as a logistics coordinator for the contras , Hitz reported .
The CIA also learned that Vidal ’s drug connections were not only in the past .
A December 1984 cable to CIA headquarters revealed Vidal ’s ties to Rene Corvo , another Cuban - American suspected of drug trafficking .
Corvo was working with anti-communist Cuban Frank Castro , who was viewed as a Medellin cartel representative within the contra movement .
There were other narcotics links to Vidal .
In January 1986 , the DEA in Miami seized 414 pounds of cocaine concealed in a shipment of yucca that was going from a contra operative in Costa Rica to Ocean Hunter , the company where Vidal worked .
Despite the evidence , Vidal remained a CIA employee as he collaborated with Frank Castro ’s assistant , Rene Corvo , in raising money for the contras , according to a CIA memo in June 1986 .
By fall 1986 , Sen .
Kerry had heard enough rumors about Vidal to demand information about him as part of a congressional inquiry into contra drugs .
But the CIA withheld the derogatory information .
On Oct. 15 , 1986 , Kerry received a briefing from Alan Fiers , who did n’t mention Vidal ’s drug arrests and conviction in the 1970s .
But Vidal was not yet in the clear .
In 1987 , the U.S. attorney in Miami began investigating Vidal , Ocean Hunter and other contra-connected entities .
This prosecutorial attention worried the CIA .
The CIA ’s Latin American division felt it was time for a security review of Vidal .
But on Aug. 5 , 1987 , the CIA ’s security office blocked the review for fear that the Vidal drug information “ could be exposed during any future litigation . ”
As expected , the U.S. Attorney did request documents about “ contra - related activities ” by Vidal , Ocean Hunter and 16 other entities .
The CIA advised the prosecutor that “ no information had been found regarding Ocean Hunter , ” a statement that was clearly false .
The CIA continued Vidal ’s employment as an adviser to the contra movement until 1990 , virtually the end of the contra war .
Honduras Trafficking
Hitz revealed that drugs also tainted the highest levels of the Honduran - based FDN , the largest contra army .
Hitz found that Juan Rivas , a contra commander who rose to be chief of staff , admitted that he had been a cocaine trafficker in Colombia before the war .
The CIA asked Rivas , known as El Quiche , about his background after the DEA began suspecting that Rivas might be an escaped convict from a Colombian prison .
In interviews with CIA officers , Rivas acknowledged that he had been arrested and convicted of packaging and transporting cocaine for the drug trade in Barranquilla , Colombia .
After several months in prison , Rivas said , he escaped and moved to Central America where he joined the contras .
Defending Rivas , CIA officials insisted that there was no evidence that Rivas engaged in trafficking while with the contras .
But one CIA cable noted that he lived an expensive lifestyle , even keeping a $ 100,000 thoroughbred horse at the contra camp .
Contra military commander Bermudez later attributed Rivas ’s wealth to his ex-girlfriend ’s rich family .
But a CIA cable in March 1989 added that “ some in the FDN may have suspected at the time that the father - in - law was engaged in drug trafficking . ”
Still , the CIA moved quickly to protect Rivas from exposure and possible extradition to Colombia .
In February 1989 , CIA headquarters asked that DEA take no action “ in view of the serious political damage to the U.S. Government that could occur should the information about Rivas become public . ”
Rivas was eased out of the contra leadership with an explanation of poor health .
With U.S. government help , he was allowed to resettle in Miami .
Colombia was not informed about his fugitive status .
Another senior FDN official implicated in the drug trade was its chief spokesman in Honduras , Arnoldo Jose “ Frank ” Arana .
The drug allegations against Arana dated back to 1983 when a federal narcotics task force put him under criminal investigation because of plans “ to smuggle 100 kilograms of cocaine into the United States from South America . ”
On Jan. 23 , 1986 , the FBI reported that Arana and his brothers were involved in a drug - smuggling enterprise , although Arana was not charged .
Arana sought to clear up another set of drug suspicions in 1989 by visiting the DEA in Honduras with a business associate , Jose Perez .
Arana ’s association with Perez , however , only raised new alarms .
If “ Arana is mixed up with the Perez brothers , he is probably dirty , ” the DEA responded .
Through their ownership of an air services company called SETCO , the Perez brothers were associated with Juan Matta Ballesteros , a major cocaine kingpin connected to the murder of a DEA agent , according to reports by the DEA and U.S. Customs .
Hitz reported that someone at the CIA scribbled a note on the DEA cable about Arana stating : “ Arnold Arana ... still active and working , we [ CIA ] may have a problem . ”
Despite its drug ties to Matta Ballesteros , SETCO emerged as the principal company for ferrying supplies to the contras in Honduras .
During congressional Iran- Contra hearings , FDN political leader Adolfo Calero testified that SETCO was paid from bank accounts controlled by Oliver North .
SETCO also received $ 185,924 from the State Department for ferrying supplies to the contras in 1986 .
Drug Flights
Hitz found that other air transport companies , which were used by the contras , also were implicated in the cocaine trade .
Even FDN leaders suspected that they were shipping supplies to Central America aboard planes that might be returning with drugs .
Mario Calero , Adolfo Calero ’s brother and the chief of contra logistics , grew so uneasy about one air - freight company that he notified U.S. law enforcement that the FDN only chartered the planes for the flights south , not the return flights north .
Hitz found that some drug pilots simply rotated from one sector of the contra operation to another .
Donaldo Frixone , who had a drug record in the Dominican Republic , was hired by the CIA to fly contra missions from 1983 - 85 .
In September 1986 , however , Frixone was implicated in smuggling 19,000 pounds of marijuana into the United States .
In late 1986 or early 1987 , he went to work for Vortex , another U.S. - paid contra supply company linked to the drug trade .
By the time that Hitz ’s Volume Two was published in fall 1998 , the CIA ’s defense against Webb ’s series had shrunk to a fig leaf : that the CIA did not conspire with the contras to raise money through cocaine trafficking .
But Hitz made clear that the contra war took precedence over law enforcement and that the CIA withheld evidence of contra crimes from the Justice Department , the Congress and even the CIA ’s own analytical division .
Besides tracing the evidence of contra - drug trafficking through the decade - long contra war , the inspector general interviewed senior CIA officers who acknowledged that they were aware of the contra - drug problem but did n’t want its exposure to undermine the struggle to overthrow Nicaragua ’s leftist Sandinista government .
According to Hitz , the CIA had “ one overriding priority : to oust the Sandinista government .
… [ CIA officers ] were determined that the various difficulties they encountered not be allowed to prevent effective implementation of the contra program . ”
One CIA field officer explained , “ The focus was to get the job done , get the support and win the war . ”
Hitz also recounted complaints from CIA analysts that CIA operations officers handling the contras hid evidence of contra - drug trafficking even from the CIA ’s analysts .
Because of the withheld evidence , the CIA analysts incorrectly concluded in the mid-1980s that “ only a handful of contras might have been involved in drug trafficking . ”
That false assessment was passed on to Congress and the major news organizations – serving as an important basis for denouncing Gary Webb and his series in 1996 .
See No Evil Although Hitz ’s report was an extraordinary admission of institutional guilt by the CIA , it passed almost unnoticed by the big American newspapers .
[ For more details on the report , see Parry ’s Lost History . ]
On Oct. 10 , 1998 , two days after Hitz ’s Volume Two was posted at the CIA ’s Internet site , the New York Times published a brief article that continued to deride Webb but acknowledged the contra - drug problem may have been worse than earlier understood .
Several weeks later , the Washington Post weighed in with a similarly superficial article .
The Los Angeles Times never published a story on the release of Volume Two .
To this day , no editor or reporter who missed the contra - cocaine story has been punished for his or her negligence .
Indeed , some of them rose to become top executives at their news organizations .
On the other hand , Gary Webb ’s career never recovered .
Unable to find decent - paying work in a profession where his past awards included a Pulitzer Prize , Webb grew despondent .
His marriage broke up .
By December 2004 , he found himself forced to move out of his rented house near Sacramento .
Instead , Webb decided to end his life .
On the night of Dec. 9 , 2004 , Webb typed out four suicide notes for his family , laid out a certificate for his cremation , put a note on the door suggesting a call to 911 , and removed his father ’s handgun from a box .
The 49 - year - old Webb , a father of three , then raised the gun and shot himself in the head .
The first shot was not lethal , so he fired once more .
His body was found the next day after movers , who were scheduled to clear out Webb ’s rental house , arrived and followed the instructions from the note on the door .
A Last Chance Webb ’s suicide offered the New York Times , the Washington Post and the L.A .
Times one more chance to set matters right , to revisit the CIA ’s admissions in 1998 and to exact some accountability from the Reagan - era officials implicated in the contra crimes .
But all that followed Gary Webb ’s death was more trashing of Gary Webb .
The L.A . Times ran its mean - spirited obituary that made no mention of the admissions in the CIA ’s Volume Two .
The Times obituary was republished in other newspapers , including the Washington Post .
No one reading this obit would understand the profound debt that American history owed to Gary Webb , who deserved the lion ’s share of the credit for forcing the CIA to make its extraordinary admissions .
Though a personal tragedy , the destruction of Gary Webb had a larger meaning , too .
Gary Webb was a kind of canary in the mine shaft , whose fate represented a warning about the dangers that can befall a nation whose journalists care more about their salaries and status than the truth and the public ’s right to know .
Today , when Americans look at the mounting death toll in Iraq , the collapse of the U.S. dollar on international markets , and their nation ’s loss of prestige around the world , they should recall what happened to Gary Webb when he tried to shed some light amid the shadows of corrupt and covert government actions .
Webb ’s career destruction in the 1990s and his desperate act of suicide in 2004 were warnings to the American people that they must demand much more from their existing news outlets – or they must build honest new ones .
That understanding may be Gary Webb 's enduring legacy .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A convicted pedophile sentenced to do community service in a German kindergarten will return to court next week to face charges of abusing two children there , a regional prosecutor ’s office said Thursday .
The man was allowed to work as a janitor at the Evangelical Kindergarten St Petri in Melle , near the northern city of Osnabrueck , because a court worker missed three prior pedophilia convictions on his record , said Alexander Retemeyer , spokesman for the Osnabrueck prosecutor ’s office .
The man , identified only as A.B. , had been sentenced to 720 hours of community service earlier this year for working on the sly while collecting welfare payments .
“ The colleague did n’t pay attention and did n’t see he had a sexual conviction , so she allowed him to serve in a kindergarten , ” Retemeyer said .
“ She did n’t read the file . ”
The prior convictions date from 1988 - 1990 , when the man was living in the former East Germany , Retemeyer said .
Though the convictions are listed in the man ’s criminal record , the details are unclear because prosecutors cannot access his East German police file .
Police arrested the man in April after the head of the kindergarten reported he had fondled himself in front of two children .
I take special note of all the responses that come in after writing any column , even if they are highly critical .
While I cannot respond to all , they do not go unnoticed .
But , once in a while an email response comes to me that truly humbles me and makes me sit up and pay particular notice to how they reacted .
In reaction to my Bush V. Gore “ Day of Infamy ” article a man from Tennessee wrote me a response that made me feel for him .
It is when he said , “ I am a Christian and a Southern Baptist and I was very much offended when my Sunday school teacher stated that no one who called themselves a Christian could ever vote for a Democrat .
I have made my opinions public when ever there was a discussion and instead of having a sensible conversation it has always turned into a personal attack upon myself .
So , I no longer attend church . ”
No one should be turned away or made to feel uncomfortable in going to a place of worship because of their beliefs .
After all , God created man in my belief as well as the beliefs of others with free will .
That means we get to think freely .
Obviously the environment within that church was an affront to God and churches should be a spiritual place to heal one ’s soul and body .
In the beginning of the email he said , “ Your essay was no doubt the best I have read about this tragedy that began the worst two Presidential terms in our country 's history . ”
That compliment coming from such a spiritual man truly humbled me , but this is not about me , but what is going on in this country when religion mixes with politics .
While I have a faith in a just and loving God , I am not one that is religious and I am quick to anger how Evangelicals and others that are highly religious seem to feel they have the right to push their religious beliefs on all of us .
Well they do n’t and we have every right to push back !
This country belongs to all of us , instead of just some .
Recently , former Governor Mitt Romney felt the need to proselytize himself in order to gain support from Evangelical Christians when he should be showing how he could govern all of us secularly .
I have seen some reaction coming from that speech such as this one coming from Lawrence O’Donnell as he blasted the racist history of Mormonism .
While I do not know the full history of Mormonism , I say leave the religion aside and address that issue in humanistic terms .
I have even read on certain lists where Mormons believe Jesus and Satan were brothers .
Again , not knowing anything really of that religion , it has all the capabilities of being the story itself where we should be focusing in on the problems that face this nation .
Then we have preacher turned politician , Mike Huckabee wanting to isolate AIDS victims from the rest of the population .
In that article it stated that he “ opposed increased federal funding in the search for a cure ” How Christian of him to oppose curing people .
I wonder what God would say of that as his only son looked to cure many while here on Earth .
After all , Jesus cured the blind and those suffering from leprosy .
During his short life here on Earth , Jesus chose to surround himself with those who were labeled social outcasts .
I have admired Huckabee ’s stance on being pro-life since I am of that belief , but to oppose funding to find a cure for that disease , it is inconsistent with a pro-life stance .
Does he want these AIDS patients dying off ?
It sure seems that way .
Sorry , Mike , I was beginning to like you , but when I read this , you showed your true colors and not to my liking .
Also within that same article , it states that “ homosexuality could " pose a dangerous public health risk . "
What he fails to understand is that AIDS is also spread by needle sharing , transfusions , transplants and not only by homosexuality .
Again , he is labeling homosexuals as social outcasts and in my belief God would want us to surround all of these people with love and compassion .
As Huckabee stated he wanted to isolate AIDS victims , I was reminded of this passage : “ When they came for the gypsies , I did not speak , for I am not a gypsy .
When they came for the Jews , I did not speak , because I was n't a Jew .
When they came for the Catholics , I did not speak , for I am not a Catholic .
And when they came for me , there was no one left to speak . "
You can read this on the Wall at the Holocaust Museum in Washington .
There is a lesson there for not only Huckabee but for the rest of us .
In his letter the man of Tennessee wrote of the Constitutional rights that have been “ taken away from us ” and it should be the Constitution which these politicians should be looking to uphold period and not any religious doctrine .
You can not impose your own religious beliefs on others who do not believe as you do .
We have seen one Evangelical president all but destroy this country in the past seven years and we do need to heal by coming together as one and the man from Tennessee even reminded me of it through this statement , “ The divisiveness that has been created in our nation is another thing that has affected many American lives .
I know of friends and family members who are not speaking to each other because they disagree so strongly .
This has come about mainly because of the Churches that have so vehemently supported everything Republican , right or wrong . ”
Let that be part of the Bush legacy as well as the blood spilt during his two terms in office .
Bush once claimed to be the uniter , but he did everything but divide us all .
At this point in time we are a polarized nation and too must be part of his legacy .
Normally nations come together in war , but this one has left us feeling divided .
Bush had the power after 9/11 to bring us together , but he blew it big time by launching an attack upon a guiltless people .
He broke so many of the Ten Commandments and one wonders how he will be judged .
I have already stated my opinion in my Bush V. Gore piece and I will stick with it .
A person commented on OpEdNews.com that I was demonizing Bush , but when I see that one million Iraqis have been killed you tell me if he is deserving of being demonized .
That commenter also remarked that I took those statistics from the Lancet and have used them in the past , but I have also used the L.A.
Times as one of my sources as one reads this OpEdNews.com column written by me where I wrote , “ Just the other day , the mainstream media caught up with the alternative media in reporting this number .
I speak of the LA Times article , Poll : Civilian toll in Iraq may top 1M .
According to their report , “ a new survey suggested that the civilian death toll from the war could be more than 1 million . ”
While another reader reminded me that our country is not dead yet and where I could be shot for any form of dissention , the man from Tennessee had this to add , “ I save every article I come across about these things I have talked about .
I save them to a folder on my computer entitled " Democracy . "
I am 68 years old and I do n't really know why I save them or who I save them for , but I have this awful fear in my heart that someday , I will not be allowed to read this kind of material or that no one will be allowed to write articles such as yours .
I hope I am wrong about both . ”
Let that be a lesson to all politicians who are seeking religious support that fear has been used on us all to cower us into complicity .
Again , where exactly is the free will that God gave all mankind in doing that ?
Also the man from Tennessee did remind me of one more thing of those that surround Bush , “ I served my country proudly in the US Navy for 11 years from 1956 to 1967 , and it is particularly galling to me that most of the people surrounding Bush have never served a day . ”
As our men and women continue to come home in coffins , being maimed for life where some probably wished they had died , those that sent them to that Hell - hole of a battlefield are to be condemned for doing so .
If one places their hand on the Bible taking any oath of office ; how could they have voted to support this war of lies knowing full well it too broke some of the Ten Commandments ?
We can use faith to guide us morally and if one does not have any faith that there is a God that must be respected .
I have come to know some who question if there is a God as being highly moral people who also have love and compassion within them .
In essence what we need is elected leaders guided by the Constitution and not religious doctrine .
We should remind them all , “ It ’s the Constitution , stupid . ”

The tradition continues as the longest - running series on the ' Chair is back for another round ...
Shockingly , it 's been two years since I first came to ArmchairGM , and while plenty has changed , the spirit of this great site has stayed the same -- to give talented aspiring sportswriters an outlet for their opinions , so that everyone 's voice can be heard .
In keeping with that philosophy , and just like each of the last 2 years , I have projected numbers for each of the 2008 MLB season 's regulars , running them through the statistical blender to project standings .
What follows will likely be wrong as much as it's right , but you never know , sometimes these things can surprise you -- like the Phillies winning 82 games ? -- and besides , it 's all in good fun .
Remember that when your team ends up with a sh*tty projection ( or when I stupidly compare Carlos Beltran to Cristian Guzman ) .
Anyway , without further ado , I present my 2K8 NL picks .
Enjoy the preview , and here 's to many more years of success here at ArmchairGM !
National League
Projected Standings
NL East
Projected Record : 95-67
810 Runs Scored ( 5.00 per game , 5th )
671 Runs Allowed ( 4.14 per game , 2nd )
Team MVP : Johan Santana
Analysis : Historic choke job ?
What historic choke job ?
Let 's just be real here for a second : no matter what Philly may think , with Johan Santana in the fold the Mets are once again the team to beat in the East ( if not the entire NL ) , and when the smoke clears on ' 08 , their epic late - season swoon a year ago will be all but forgotten .
But it was n't always this way ... Flashback to 2007 .
When last we left the poor Mets , they were little more than a smoking pile of debris , having suffered the second - worst collapse in the history of baseball .
And as the winter meetings came and went , New York remained an old team with plenty of question marks -- in other words , they certainly did n't look like the division frontrunners for 2008 .
But on January 29 , everything changed ...
Santana immediately gives the Mets the Ace of Aces , the clear favorite for the 2008 NL Cy Young ; his presence alone separates New York from the Phillies and Braves , one of whom would likely have won this division had the Mets not pulled the trigger on the trade with Minnesota .
Plus , beyond Santana there are plenty of other reasons to erase " The Collapse " from memory : David Wright is easily the league 's best all - around 3B , SS Jose Reyes is pure electricity , Carlos Beltran still has as much talent as any NL OF , and they 've still got plenty of solid pitching and defense .
In other words , do n't count on a repeat of their embarrassing ' 07 flop -- these guys are still the clear favorites to win this division .
Upside : 98 wins
Downside : 90 wins
Projected Record : 91-71
824 Runs Scored ( 5.08 per game , 3rd )
728 Runs Allowed ( 4.49 per game , 6th )
Team MVP : Mark Teixeira
Analysis : The Braves ' window to win ( as currently constructed , at least ) centers around just one man : Mark Teixeira .
If Tex sticks with the club long - term , he gives Atlanta one of the game 's best hitters , as well as a great draw at Turner Field to offset the loss of Andruw Jones and the impending retirements of Bobby Cox , John Smoltz , Chipper Jones , Tom Glavine , etc .
However , he will be expensive after the 2008 season -- he 's going to be the best FA hitter on the market , and he 's represented by You Know Who .
So if it does n't appear as though Teixeira will stay with the Braves , new GM Frank Wren will face a tough decision ...
On the one hand , you could say that he had better get some serious compensation for Teixeria at the deadline , especially if Atlanta is not in the playoff mix .
But what if they are in the mix ?
Think about it : although NY became the clear - cut best team in the NL when they added Johan Santana , the battle for 2nd - best in the league is wide open , and there 's no reason that the Braves can't be the ones to capture that distinction , given their offense and an improved pitching staff .
Make no mistake , though : if Atlanta is in contention for the wild card ( or even sneaks past the Mets for the division , however unlikely that may be ) , it will be to a large degree because of Teixeira .
In other words , I do n't envy Wren 's position over the next 5 months -- in all likelihood he 's going to have to make the very difficult choice between short - term rewards and the long - term future of his organization .
The old Ted Turner - era Braves would have thrown money at Tex and made this problem go away , but those days are long gone ; now Wren has to deal with Atlanta 's " new " economic reality , a delicate balancing act which even John Schuerholz struggled to maintain in recent years .
The odds are good that even if Atlanta succeeds in returning to the postseason in 2008 , it will be a net loss for the franchise when Teixeira walks away after the season for nothing but a few compensatory draft picks .
Upside : 93 wins
Downside : 85 wins

Projected Record : 82-80
849 Runs Scored ( 5.24 per game , 1st )
835 Runs Allowed ( 5.16 per game , 14th )
Team MVP : Ryan Howard
Analysis : The Phils had been a really good team over the six seasons prior to 2007 , never dropping below 80 wins and finishing with 85 or more five times , but it was n't ever quite enough to make the playoffs in a division that either the Braves or Mets had owned for 12 straight years .
In 2007 , though , the Phillies broke that streak with style , following through on Jimmy Rollins ' " team to beat " assertion by saving their best for last ( they were 48 - 33 in the final 3 months of the season ) and erasing what was at one time an 8 ½ - game New York lead in the division race .
Given that heroic 2nd - half performance , you have to consider Philly the favorites in the East for 2008 , right ?
Well ... not exactly .
Think about all of the things that had to go right down the stretch for them to win the division :
First , they played over their heads in August & September -- they won 3 more games than their run differential would predict , which does n't sound like much until you consider that their final margin over NY was a single game .
Also , they were the beneficiaries of one of the most improbable early Christmas presents any baseball team ever received -- I 'm talking , of course , about the Mets ' unprecedented collapse .
On September 13 , the Mets had a 99.5 % probability of winning the division ; on that same day , the Phils had about a 12 % chance of making the playoffs .
Now , I 'm not saying that Philly did n't earn their division crown by reversing those numbers over the last 3 weeks of the season , but I am saying that the Mets lost the 2007 NL East more than the Phillies won it .
Meanwhile , looking ahead to 2008 , the Mets and Braves have gotten significantly better since this time last year ( adding Johan Santana and a full season of Mark Teixeira , respectively ) while Philly has done little to improve a suspect pitching staff ( other than adding inconsistent closer Brad Lidge and moving Brett Myers back to the rotation ) .
So while it would n't exactly be inconceivable to see Philadelphia make another run at the East title or the wild card , the good money is on 2007 being the apex of their recent run , " team to beat " talk or not .
Upside : 88 wins
Downside : 80 wins
Projected Record : 75-87
773 Runs Scored ( 4.77 per game , 8th )
834 Runs Allowed ( 5.15 per game , 13th )
Team MVP : Ryan Zimmerman
Analysis : Talk about overachievement .
Under new manager Manny Acta a year ago , the hopelessly undermanned Nationals ( seriously , Matt Chico was their top starter ) still found a way to win 73 games and avoid the East basement for the first time since 2003 .
How did they do it ?
Well , for one thing , they made clever use of cheap pickups like Dmitri Young , Ryan Church , and Ron Belliard on offense , and they also fashioned together the 4th - best bullpen in the NL out of Chad Cordero and a bunch of afterthoughts ( Jon Rauch , Saul Rivera , Jesus Colome , Ray King ) .
All told , Acta 's managerial acumen and a series of surprisingly shrewd moves by GM Jim Bowden added up to keep a Nationals team that was pretty awful on paper out of last place .
Looking to 2008 , there are a few new faces here ( Lastings Milledge , Paul Lo Duca ) to replace the departed ( Church , Brian Schneider ) , but for the most part it 's the same cast of characters that Washington trotted out a year ago ...
With one exception : righty starter John Patterson hopes to finally be healthy after 2 injury - riddled campaigns .
You may not think Patterson 's return is a big deal , but for Washington 's rotation ( which ranked 15th out of 16 teams in ERA a year ago ) he could be a major shot in the arm , having posted a 3.13 ERA in 198⅓ innings during his last full season .
Overall , the Nats still have plenty of room for improvement , but the offense should be better in '08 ( thanks to Ryan Zimmerman 's continued development , the Milledge pickup , and a full season of Wily Mo Pena ) , and the pitching could see big gains if Patterson returns to form and just one of their inconsistent starters steps up .
Do n't expect Washington to contend anytime soon , but do n't expect them to be an easy ' W ' for New York / Atlanta / Philadelphia anymore , either .
Upside : 79 wins
Downside : 67 wins
Projected Record : 71-91
739 Runs Scored ( 4.56 per game , 12th )
838 Runs Allowed ( 5.17 per game , 15th )
Team MVP : Hanley Ramirez
Analysis : " Like the cleaning of a house ... It Never Ends . "
I could , of course , be talking about Jeffrey Loria 's continual quest to get Miami - area taxpayers to pay for his new stadium ...
Or I could just as easily be referring to Florida 's nasty habit of trading their talent away for prospects right when it gets a little too expensive for their owner 's miserly tastes .
Either way , the endless cycle is never broken for the Marlins , who just this offseason repeated a scene that 's happened all too often in their short history , dealing their best hitter ( Miguel Cabrera ) and their best pitcher ( Dontrelle Willis ) to Detroit for a handful of promising -- but more importantly , cheap -- youngsters .
As a result , the Fins are long on potential but will likely be very short on immediate returns , especially in 2008 .
Thanks in large part to super - stud SS Hanley Ramirez , their lineup is not all that bad , with Dan Uggla , Jeremy Hermida ( third time 's the charm ! ) , Josh Willingham , Mike Jacobs , and Cody Ross also checking in as above - average hitters .
Beyond that group , though , there 's literally no one else on the roster who can hit , meaning that their bench is going to be a major weakness -- unless Gonzo decides it 's 2001 again or something .
On the pitching side , youth will certainly be served ( hello , Andrew Miller ! ) , but that 's been the case for the past two seasons , with mixed ( at best ) results .
The bottom line is this :
While there 's an outside chance that Florida copies the '06 Marlins and turns in an unexpectedly good performance in ' 08 , Loria is paying for a $ 15 million ballclub , and odds are that 's exactly what he 'll get -- at least until Miller , Cameron Maybin , & Co. reach their full potential ...
At which point they 'll probably be traded for cheaper , younger talent .
The cycle never ends in South Florida , does it ?
Upside : 74 wins
Downside : 66 wins
NL Central
Projected Record : 88-74
818 Runs Scored ( 5.05 per game , 4th )
750 Runs Allowed ( 4.63 per game , 7th )
Team MVP : Alfonso Soriano
Analysis :
Well , two years later , that pick finally worked out ... ( BTW , since they finished first , does this mean you have to eat two hats , Manny ? )
Not that it was of much consolation to the Cubs ' long - suffering fans when the team was unceremoniously dispatched by the Diamondbacks in the NLDS , but Chicago 's 2007 season represented a breakthrough of sorts , in that they did n't pin their hopes on the health of Kerry Wood & Mark Prior for the first time in ages .
As a result , they allowed themselves to rework their pitching staff without those two in mind , and ended up ranking 2nd in the NL in fewest runs allowed , their best showing since 2004 .
Looking forward , all of the principal characters are back , the defense is still very strong , and although this staff might regress in general ( anybody think Ted Lilly is a legit 3.83 ERA guy ? ) , the Cubs should still be above - average on the run-prevention front in '08 .
Offensively , they 're also going to be pretty solid -- the somewhat - maligned Alfonso Soriano deal worked out about as well as you could have expected a year ago , and Chicago made another big splash for an OF this offseason when they inked Japanese star Kosuke Fukudome to a 4 - year , $ 50 million contract .
Along with Derrek Lee , Aramis Ramirez , and unheralded 2nd - year C Geovany Soto , Soriano and Fukudome give the Cubbies one of the better lineups in the league , and the bench is n't bad , either .
All told , there are n't many glaring holes for Chicago on either side of the ball ...
Milwaukee may be something of a vogue pick to surpass them in the Central , but the Cubs are ( narrowly ) the better team right now -- so unless Milwaukee fixes their problems , I think Chicago will be good for 85 - 90 wins and another division crown .
Upside : 90 wins
Downside : 83 wins
Projected Record : 84-78
804 Runs Scored ( 4.96 per game , 6th )
773 Runs Allowed ( 4.77 per game , 8th )
Team MVP : Prince Fielder
Analysis :
It 's fair to say that the Brew Crew exceeded expectations a year ago -- their young offensive stars blossomed and they were able to take advantage of a relatively weak division to stick around in the playoff race until late September .
But what will this team do as an encore ?
Even after adding Kosuke Fukudome , Chicago does n't look much better than an 85 - 90 win team , so the Central is certainly ripe for the picking again .
The question is whether or not Milwaukee has the pitching and defense to outpace the Cubs , especially in the late innings of close games .
Last year 's closer Francisco Cordero took Cincy 's free - agent $ $ , and Doug Melvin was eventually forced to replace him with Eric Gagne ... Gulp .
And the rest of the bullpen is mediocre at best , unless Derrick Turnbow can overcome his career - long battle with inconsistency .
At least the rotation -- led by Ben Sheets and Yovani Gallardo -- is reasonably solid , especially if Carlos Villanueva can complete his transition from relief duty to starting .
But much of the Brewers ' success or failure rides on their defense , which was sixth - worst in baseball last year .
There are reasons to believe they 'll be better in ' 08 : Ryan Braun , last year 's chief offender , will start the year in LF , and his replacement at third , Bill Hall , has a much better record at the hot corner than at his old position ( CF ) .
2B Rickie Weeks and 1B Prince Fielder will still be undermining their pitchers on balls hit to the right side of the infield , of course , and new C Jason Kendall is a human green light behind the plate , but the juggling of Hall / Braun and the addition of Mike Cameron should at least marginally improve the Brewers '
D. And that may be all this team needs , since their offense will once again rank near the league 's top 5 ( thanks in no small part to Fielder and Braun ) .
Run differential - wise , Milwaukee was about 4 games worse than Chicago last year , and they had a few very glaring flaws ( defense and relief pitching ) , the first of which was at least partially addressed over the offseason .
Will that make up the difference ?
Well ... probably not .
But Milwaukee will definitely be in the mix again as the season comes to a close , and if Chicago slips up at all , the Brewers could very well capture the Central title in '08 .
Upside : 87 wins
Downside : 81 wins
Projected Record : 77-85
779 Runs Scored ( 4.81 per game , 7th )
822 Runs Allowed ( 5.07 per game , 12th )
Team MVP : Aaron Harang
Analysis : Going into 2008 , the Reds could go either way .
They were morally a 75 - 76 win team in 2007 , and in the NL ( especially the Central ) , that means they 're just a break here or there away from being in the thick of the playoff race .
They 've got two rotation anchors in Aaron Harang and Bronson Arroyo , and potential future stars in RHPs Homer Bailey and Johnny Cueto .
Over the winter they plucked solid closer Francisco Cordero from their division rivals in Milwaukee .
They 've got quality hitters like Adam Dunn , Edwin Encarnacion , and Ken Griffey , Jr. , with more on the way ( Jay Bruce , Joey Votto ) .
1B Scott Hatteberg hit .310 last year , 1B Brandon Phillips hit .288 with 30 HR , and as a team they ranked 3rd in HR , 5th in slugging % , and 6th in walks in 2007 .
And finally , over the offseason , they added proven manager Dusty Baker .
The pieces are there to make a run in this division ... right ?
Um , not exactly .
In reality , Harang is their only good starter ; Arroyo is merely a LAIM now , Bailey might not be ready yet after a groin injury derailed his age - 21 season , Cueto 's ETA is probably midseason '08 or even 2009 , and Dusty 's going to ruin all of their careers anyway .
Cordero improves what was a brutal bullpen last year ( frankly , it'd be hard for them to get any worse ) , but the rest of the relief corps is still lacking , and their defense still sucks ( it was actually worse than Milwaukee 's last year ) .
Meanwhile , the offense seems more imposing than it actually is ( they only ranked 7th in runs ) , Hatteberg and Phillips are primed for regressions , there 's no way Griffey plays 144 games again , and Dusty 's been promising that he 'll cut down on those awful " base - clogging " activities like walks .
Depressed yet , Cincy fans ?
The sad part is that Cincinnati has talent ( now and especially on the way ) , and they 're really not that far from competing in the Central .
But for every positive step they take forward , there 's something like the Kearns - for - Majewski trade or the Baker hiring waiting in the wings , ready to set them back .
Add it all up , and there 's just not enough here for the Reds to be a factor in the division race ; worse yet , much of the blame for that fact falls at the feet of their own management .
Upside : 80 wins
Downside : 73 wins
Projected Record : 76-86
737 Runs Scored ( 4.55 per game , 13th )
784 Runs Allowed ( 4.84 per game , 9th )
Team MVP : Roy Oswalt
Analysis : Welcome to limbo , that awful place between rebuilding and contending .
Like the Chicago White Sox , their opponents in the 2005 World Series , the Astros have fixated on that brief moment of glory ever since , abstaining from making any wholesale changes even as the club 's foundation aged and ultimately crumbled .
All along the way they deluded themselves into the vain notion that they were still contenders , until one day they woke up and found themselves staring at a 72 - 73 win team with no prospects for the future .
Tragic ?
Sure .
Preventable ?
Absolutely .
But it would take self - honesty , something owner Drayton McLane has n't employed with regard to his ballclub in decades .
And the cycle of self - deception continued this offseason , when Houston made Ed Wade their GM ( seems fitting ) , retained the inexperienced Cecil Cooper as manager , signed Coors Field product Kaz Matsui , and traded away what few pitching prospects they had left in exchange for Miguel Tejada , Jose Valverde , and Michael Bourn , as though somehow these moves would turn back the clock and make them contenders again .
But in reality , they 'll only serve to stave off the total , inevitable collapse for just a few more seasons .
Beyond Roy Oswalt and Valverde , there 's still no pitching .
Other than the 4 - headed monster of Tejada , Lance Berkman , Carlos Lee , and Hunter Pence ( three of whom are 32 and signed to awful contracts ) , there 's still nobody who can hit .
And there 's still zero plan for the future .
You know , eventually they 're going to have to rebuild in earnest ...
But until then , count on plenty of mediocrity in Houston -- and plenty of denial .

Team MVP : Albert Pujols
Analysis :
Well , that was quick .
One year after a surprise World Series victory , and two years removed from back - to - back 100 - win seasons ( the culmination of a run of 6 straight 85 + win campaigns ) , the Cardinals ' roster now bears little resemblance to the perennial contender that former GM Walt Jocketty built in the first half of the decade .
The problem with declining teams like this is usually aging , but that 's not really the case here -- St. Louis was generally a veteran - laden outfit throughout Jocketty 's tenure , while the 2008 opening day lineup features only 2 players ( Troy Glaus , Adam Kennedy ) over age 30 .
No , the Cards ' problem is n't that they 're getting older , it 's just that their stars are injury - prone , plus the younger players they 've brought in over the past few seasons are n't very good and they 're already in their primes ( meaning they 're not going to get any better ) .
Aside from the incomparable ( but injured ) Albert Pujols , St. Louis ' only above - average hitters are Glaus , Chris Duncan , and maybe Ryan Ludwick , Josh Phelps , & rookie Brian Barton -- maybe .
Otherwise , this offense is littered with a lot of Cesar Izturis types , which is n't exactly the greatest formula for scoring runs ( especially if Pujols ' torn elbow ligament hampers his performance or costs him playing time ) .
St. Louis ' pitching situation is equally tenuous ; erstwhile ace Chris Carpenter is not slated to return from elbow surgery until midseason , and the rest of the rotation is either injury - riddled ( Mark Mulder , Matt Clement ) or flat - out pedestrian ( Braden Looper , Joel Pineiro , Kyle Lohse , Anthony Reyes , et al ) .
The bullpen is not all that bad , having posted a 4.00 ERA a year ago ( NL average was 4.06 ) , but there 's little reason to hope that the starters and offense can give them meaningful leads to defend .
The bottom line : with this team in full decline , look for the 2006 World Series to become more and more of a distant memory for Cards fans as the 2008 season goes on .

Team MVP : Jason Bay
Analysis : Yep , another year , another sub - 70 win season for Pittsburgh ...
That 's 15 straight losing seasons for the franchise , in case anyone is still keeping track , and there are n't a whole lot of reasons to think they wo n't make it 16 in 2008 .
But let 's start with the positives :
On paper , the Bucs have a quartet of relatively gifted young starting pitchers in Tom Gorzelanny , Ian Snell , Paul Maholm , and Zach Duke , and they 've got two solid bullpen arms in closer Matt Capps and situational lefty Damaso Marte .
Oh , and Jason Bay & Adam LaRoche are a couple of reasonably good middle - of - the - order hitters .
So okay , those were the positives .
And the negatives ?
Well , pretty much everything else .
Despite Bay / LaRoche and the high - average Freddy Sanchez , this offense is just weak -- they ranked 11th in OBP and 12th in SLG a year ago , and their three best hitters will be entering the decline phases of their careers any season now ( all are 28 or older ) .
Meanwhile , on the run-prevention front , Maholm and Duke each took steps backward in 2007 , 4th starter Matt Morris ' skills are in freefall ( as evidenced by his brutal 2nd half a year ago ) , the non-Capps / Marte portion of the bullpen is not really cut out for pro baseball , and their defense is just bad .
Pittsburgh may have finally dumped GM Dave Littlefield ( in favor of former MLB chief labor counsel Frank Coonelly ) , but Littlefield 's fingerprints are still all over the Pirates ' 2008 roster , and that can only mean one thing : another embarrassingly bad season of baseball in the Steel City .

Team MVP : Jake Peavy
Analysis : Unless you 're the Mets , it'd be pretty hard to miss the playoffs in a more heartbreaking fashion than the Padres did in 2007 , blowing three straight win-and - you 're - in chances : September 29th ( they were one strike away from clinching ) & 30th vs. Milwaukee , and October 1st 's one - game playoff against Colorado ( in which they were just 3 outs from the win ) .
Coming off of that debacle , San Diego now must try to pick up the pieces and move forward against a division that could be the most hotly - contested in baseball .
Luckily , they boast the best pitching staff in the bigs , thanks to the strong starting 1 - 2 - 3 of Jake Peavy ( your 2007 NL Cy Young Award winner ) , Chris Young , and Greg Maddux , as well as a lights - out bullpen that has a number of good options ( cough , Heath Bell ) even if declining closer Trevor Hoffman 's inevitable collapse comes sooner rather than later .
But , then again , the problem has never been pitching for the Padres -- the question is always whether or not their lineup can supply enough runs to make a difference , especially in offense - killing Petco Park .
And as is usually the case with this team , there 's nothing about the hitting that particularly jumps out at you ( their best offensive player is zero - time All - Star Adrian Gonzalez ) ... but the good news is that they should n't be any worse than they were a year ago , which at least ought to be enough to keep them in the mix out West .
Every year , you look at San Diego and wonder how this team remains competitive , but every year they 're right there at the end .
Despite their collapse last fall , 2008 should be no different -- on either count .

Team MVP : Brandon Webb
Analysis :
To an even greater degree than the Seattle Mariners , the D - Backs managed to stay one step ahead of Pythagoras throughout the 2007 season , finishing with 90 wins and an NL West crown despite having been outscored by 20 runs -- a differential that should have earned them 79 wins and a spectator 's view of the playoffs , not an eventual NLCS berth .
But unlike the poor Mariners , who are bound to feel the full force of the Johnson Effect in 2008 , Arizona will probably not be called to account for their lucky ways a year ago .
Why ?
Chiefly because they have something that Seattle does n't : young talent , and with it the opportunity to legitimately be much better than they were a year ago .
It all starts with the pitching staff , a group that tamed Chase Field to post the 4th - best ERA in the league last season , and one which only got better over the winter when they added ex-Oakland ace Dan Haren in exchange for a handful of prospects .
Haren , together with 2006 NL Cy Young Award winner Brandon Webb and 5 - time Cy Young recipient Randy Johnson , gives ' Zona one of the better rotations in the sport , and the bullpen should be able to hold its own again despite losing closer Jose Valverde in a trade with Houston .
The offense is more problematic , however ; despite the run-friendly environs of Chase , the Diamondbacks finished 3rd to last in the NL in scoring ( with only 5 regulars posting a better - than - average OPS ) , and did little over the offseason to bolster their lineup .
Fortunately for Arizona , though , the majority of their key players last year were 26 or younger -- meaning there 's a very good chance that this offense improves ( and perhaps significantly ) in '08 simply by virtue of another year of development .
If that is the case , then watch out for Arizona as a serious pennant contender ...
It 's very rare for a team which exceeds expectations by so much to play even better the following season , but with their mix of strong pitching and burgeoning offensive talent , the D - Backs may have happened upon the perfect formula to do just that .

Team MVP : Brad Penny
Analysis :
When you think about all of the talent that has passed through L.A. over the past two decades , it 's absolutely inexcusable that the Dodgers have won just a single solitary playoff game since their World Series championship in 1988 .
But despite the organization 's vast resources and storied history , Los Angeles ' chronic front - office incompetence has continually hamstrung their on - field efforts -- a trend which has never been more obvious than under the reign of GM Ned Colletti , whose obsession with veterans and twin penchants for redundancy and wasting money have undermined the strong player development system built by his predecessors , Dan Evans and Paul DePodesta .
The infamous Juan Pierre signing pretty much symbolizes Colletti's tenure in L.A. -- the Dodgers would be successful if they would only give their talented prospects a chance , but instead they sign a veteran who is 1 ) vastly overrated , 2 ) dramatically overpaid , and 3 ) totally unnecessary , and then proceed to give undeserved playing time to said veteran in a desperate attempt to justify the signing .
This is the " Dodger Way " ?
Please .
Branch Rickey must be spinning in his grave .
Let 's be clear on one thing : with L.A. 's talent , they ought to easily win the West in 2008 .
Their pitching staff is right up there with the best the NL has to offer , thanks to a deep rotation featuring Brad Penny & Derek Lowe , as well as a solid bullpen led by Takashi Saito & Jonathan Broxton .
They also boast plenty of young hitting talent like Russell Martin , James Loney , Andre Ethier , Matt Kemp , Andy LaRoche , and others ...
But what good is that young talent if many of them are intentionally being blocked by veterans ?
While the Dodgers have more than enough tools to succeed , they probably can't hope for anything better than third or fourth place as long as management ( aka Colletti ) continues to undermine their efforts at every turn .

Team MVP : Matt Holliday
Analysis : After a run like Colorado had last September and October , what can you possibly do as an encore ?
The Rockies certainly caught fire down the stretch in 2007 , winning 21 of 22 games en route to the franchise 's first - ever World Series appearance , and their pitching ( long Colorado 's weak link ) was especially impressive during the run , allowing just 4.38 runs per game over the final two months of the regular season .
However , that incredible stretch run makes it easy to gloss over that fact that , before the streak , the Rockies were on pace for just 83 wins , which would have left them watching the playoffs on TV instead of playing in October .
It also makes it easy to ignore the fact that their staff pitched at a level that they probably can't sustain going forward : almost all of their pitchers '
ERAs outperformed what you would expect based on their component skills , and many played much better than their track records would indicate , which suggests that the Rockies ' improved pitching performance ( the main catalyst for their success in ' 07 ) may have merely been an illusion .
If that is the case ( does anybody really think they can sustain a 4.32 team ERA , 8th - ranked defense or not ? ) , then Colorado is a lock to backslide in ' 08 , especially given the competitive division in which they play .
As always , this offense should be among the best in the league ( courtesy of Matt Holliday , Todd Helton , & Co. ) , but the fact of the matter is that the Rockies ' entire season hinges on whether or not their pitching staff can hold on to the gains they made last season .
If they can , Colorado will make another strong bid to win the West ; if not , expect them to regress to the .500 form they showed before starting their remarkable late - season streak .

Team MVP : Matt Cain
Analysis : 2008 marks the end of an era for the Giants , that much is perfectly clear .
And with regard to He Who Must Not Be Named , I fear that I have no choice but to invoke the old Branch Rickey quote about Ralph Kiner : " We finished last with you , and we can finish last without you . "
Finishing last is exactly what the San Francisco Giants are going to do in 2008 ( aka " 1 A.B. " ) , because although GM Brian Sabean has been able to assemble one of the NL 's best pitching staffs , his insistence on surrounding the now - departed Bonds with veteran hitters who can't , you know , hit has left this lineup in complete shambles .
Among SF starters , only 1B Dan Ortmeier is under the age of 30 ; three are 36 ( Rich Aurilia , Ray Durham , Dave Roberts ) , and SS Omar Vizquel will be 41 when he returns from his knee injury in late April .
The Giants ' advanced age would be okay if any of them could swing the bat , but San Fran turned in the NL's worst offensive performance ( adjusted for park ) a year ago in spite of Bonds ' fantastic 1.045 OPS .
Now they move forward sans Bonds , and with no viable prospects ( other than Nate Schierholtz ) on the way , so there 's basically no chance that SF is n't going to be one of the worst offensive teams in recent memory .
Their pitching staff is n't half bad , almost entirely thanks to the solid rotation 1 - 4 of Barry Zito , Matt Cain , Noah Lowry , and Tim Lincecum , but no rotation on earth could make up for the Giants ' offensive impotence .
It 's sad , really ; they spent so many years and so much money ostensibly trying to put together one last run with Barry Bonds , and now that he 's gone they have no direction , no offense , and no hope for anything but one of the worst records in the NL .
They say that all good things must come to end ( say what you will about Bonds , he was a very good hitter ) , and San Francisco is about find out firsthand what happens after the end comes .
One thing 's for sure : it 's not going to be pretty .
