The champ exposes it to Dan Wetzel :
Despite his immense size and years of performing as a big character in pro wrestling , Lesnar , 32 , is a soft spoken guy .
He 's a farm kid from South Dakota , who now lives up here , amidst the rolling hills and fishing lakes a couple hours drive northwest of the Twin Cities .
He 's most comfortable with down - to - earth people he 's known for years .
His 10 - week training camp is run by his full - time coach , Marty Morgan , who worked with Lesnar at Minnesota .
One training partner is UFC fighter Chris Tuchscherer , who after his last fight immediately worked three weeks running a tractor on a 10,000 - acre farm in North Dakota .
...
He , his wife and infant son live on a secluded , wooded plot of land .
A second - grade daughter from a previous relationship lives in this 10,000 - population town .
It ’s why he ’s here .
" I see her as much as the court allows , " he said .
Family is everything to him .
He ’s one of the few athletes you ’ll ever met who not only speaks about trying to be the best father , but also the best husband .
Then he appears to back it up .
His hobbies are hunting and fishing and working his farm .
" Fighting is not my life , " the 32 - year - old says .
" My family is my life . "
Washington ( CNN ) --
If President Obama decides to send the 40,000 additional forces to Afghanistan as requested by Gen. Stanley McChrystal , a rough estimate by the Pentagon projects the cost could be an additional $ 20 billion a year , according to a senior Pentagon official .
The official said the Defense Department comptrollers office has told Congress that based on rough estimates , the total cost of keeping an individual service member in the war zone is now about $ 500,000 a year .
That includes the costs of personnel operations and maintenance costs , some equipment and hazardous duty pay .
The actual costs could be higher , because the estimate does not include the cost of constructing additional facilities , providing support forces such as military intelligence assets that may be based outside Afghanistan or replacing damaged weapons or equipment .
The official emphasized that until there is a formal troop plan , the costs are just estimated .
The official would not be identified because the estimates are not official .
The ongoing review of the strategy for Afghanistan continued Friday , with Obama meeting with Defense Secretary Robert Gates ; Adm. Michael Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ; and the heads of the four military services .
The heads of the Army and Marines , who provide the bulk of troops for the war , have expressed concern that if they send a large number of additional troops , they will have to cut down on the time troops spend in between deployments , known as " dwell time . "
Marines have only about 8,000 troops they can add without impinging on dwell time .
The Army has about 12 brigades , or approximately 48,000 soldiers , that are not deployed or committed to deploy .
Regardless of the number of troops being sent , a deployment will be phased over time because of the lack of facilities in the country to house and support a large deployment , the official said .
McChrystal 's plan calls for sending a majority of the forces he is requesting to the south , especially to reinforce Kandahar and Helmand provinces , and the region around Kabul , several military and Pentagon sources said .
McChrystal also intends to reserve a number of forces for training Afghan forces , officials said .
But one official noted that if that plan is put into effect , additional forces would be needed to be sent to areas that the Taliban might then flee , such as the northern region .
Natalie Morton died in hospital following a cervical cancer jab at school A girl who was vaccinated against cervical cancer died from a malignant tumour of the chest and not from a reaction to the jab , it has emerged .
Natalie Morton , 14 , died after being given the injection at the Blue Coat Church of England School in Coventry .
Deputy coroner for Coventry Louise
Hunt said the vaccine was not thought to have been a contributing factor .
A pathologist said her undiagnosed condition was " so severe that death could have arisen at any point " .
Natalie collapsed less than two hours after being given the Cervarix vaccine on Monday and was pronounced dead at Coventry 's University Hospital .
Her death sparked concern among pupils and parents and on Tuesday HPV1 Cervarix vaccinations were temporarily suspended by some schools and primary care trusts .
The deputy coroner , who opened and adjourned the hearing at Coventry Magistrates '
Court , said : " It appears that Natalie died from a tumour in her chest involving her heart and her lungs . "
The inquest was told that the tumour had " heavily infiltrated " her heart and extended into her left lung .
' Beautiful smile ' Home Office pathologist Alexander Kolar gave the official preliminary cause of death as tumour of the chest .
Natalie 's mother Elaine Bullock and stepfather Andrew Bullock paid tribute to her outside the court .
They said she was a " kind and fun-loving teenager with a beautiful smile " .
We have seen the flowers and the messages of love and support
Stepfather Andrew Bullock Mr Bullock said : " We now know that Natalie 's death was the result of a serious underlying medical condition and most probably nothing to do with the vaccine that she had at school . "
Her stepfather said Natalie was " a wonderful daughter , sister and granddaughter " .
Mr Bullock added : " We understand that further tests are being carried out to discover the exact cause of Natalie 's death . "
Natalie 's stepfather and mother expressed their gratitude to Blue Coat School head teacher Julie Roberts and her staff , and also thanked paramedics and hospital staff .
" We have seen the flowers and the messages of love and support laid at the cross in the school grounds , " her stepfather added .
Precautionary measure Cervical cancer vaccination programmes in UK schools were resuming on Wednesday .
It is thought about a million girls have already safely received the Cervarix jab .
More than 1.4 million doses have been given out , of which there have been more than 4,600 suspected reactions reported , according to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency .
The government has said it has great confidence in the safety of its cervical cancer vaccination programme .
Before the preliminary results from the autopsy on Natalie were known , the vaccine 's manufacturer voluntarily initiated a recall of one batch of vaccine as a precautionary measure .
But health experts have stressed that the vaccine is safe , estimating the chance of developing a severe , life - threatening reaction to it is around one in a million .

CBS has a solid lineup all around , but they canceled a few shows so they need to fill in those slots .
They deviated from their usual crime shows so they are taking a slightly larger risk this year .
NCIS : Los Angeles
This spin-off of the immensely popular crime procedural attempts to capture the same audience that brought the original to ratings success .
Based on the 2 episodes of NCIS that featured the cast of the new show , I doubt it can come anywhere near the original , but with a few crossover characters , it will do just fine .
I 'm sure hardcore fans of NCIS like me will be a little disappointed , but I expect this to be a ratings success .
It comes on right after NCIS , and the audience will have to be enticed by another NCIS , so almost all will stay and watch .
The Good Wife
Starring Julianna Margulies as a wife of a disgraced Congressman , I see huge potential for the show .
It 's a legal drama set with a large backdrop of a family drama .
From the trailer , I really liked what I saw and I 'll definitely be watching the first few episodes .
It has the 10 PM slot after NCIS : LA so it should have a big lead - in .
I do n't expect this to bring NCIS like numbers , but I still expect respectable numbers that can bring a renewal .
The thing to be the most worried about is CBS itself .
Last season , it totally jumped the gun by canceling Eleventh Hour , a great show all around , just because it did n't have the right retention from CSI .
Three Rivers
We get it , everyone loves Alex O’Loughlin and Moonlight should n't have been canceled .
That does n't mean CBS can throw him onto the screen and expect the show to work .
Organ donations ?
After the story about organ harvesting in New Jersey , it feels so macabre .
I do n't know how they will cajole people into giving up organs to save another without offending someone .
Not every story will involve a dead person with viable organs , some organs will come from a dying person .
I 'm sure it can touch on ethical questions , but we do n't see a show based on euthanasia .
To make matters worse , CBS put it on Sunday ; I 'm sure The Unit fans will be pissed to see this .
I expect a short life for this show .
Accidentally on Purpose
Jenna Elfman ?
Ok ...
The trailers I 've seen do n't look too great , but there 's not much to say about the show .
CBS has some pretty mediocre comedies do well in the ratings while ABC comedies that were much funnier like Scrubs and Better Off Ted did horrible .
CBS is looking to expand their total dominance and another comedy can only contribute to it .
My prediction :
Not that funny , good ratings .

Wow , I was kind of surprised of how yesterday 's ratings played out .
ABC destroyed all competition first with a 4.1 by Flash Forward and then a gigantic 6.7 by Grey 's Anatomy .
The biggest surprise to me was how much Fox fell with all the new competition .
Bones had a respectable 2.7 while Fringe fell to a low of 2.3 .
I 'm sure Fox did not expect Fringe to do as well as it did last season with the American Idol lead - in , but a 2.3 is horrible especially for Fox and is nearing the area of cancellation .
NBC was also crushed with Parks & Recreation getting 1.8 .
The Office did the best out of the NBC shows with 3.8 and Community struggled to keep The Office viewers with 2.8 .
The Jay Leno show survived with 1.7 .
CBS did not have its usual dominance with CSI getting 4.1 and The Mentalist getting 3.4 .
The Mentalist is going up against Private Practice next week , so expect a Mentalist rebound .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Using advanced computer modeling and statistical analysis , a University of Texas at Austin linguistics professor has found that toddlers develop their own individual structures for using language that are very different from what we traditionally think of as grammar .
" Grammars have different forms in development , " says Colin Bannard , assistant professor in the Department of Linguistics .
" We should n't assume a child 's grammar is anything like our traditional notion of what grammar is . "
In a study released today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Bannard and Elena Lieven and Michael Tomasello , two colleagues working at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , developed a computer program to analyze 60 hours worth of conversations that two English - speaking toddlers — Brian and Annie — had with their parents after turning two and again after turning three .
The computer model did not assume the children knew any of the basic rules of language , such as the use of nouns and verbs .
Instead , it used the toddlers ' early conversations after each birthday to predict the structure of their subsequent conversations .
Rather than adhering to the kinds of rules for English linguists have identified , the toddlers developed their own basic formulas for speaking with slots into which they could put particular kinds of words .
At age two , those formulas — which were different for each child — were found to predict the children 's subsequent speech better than a more traditional grammar .
Many researchers have long believed that even young children 's earliest language derives from an understanding of an abstract grammar that includes categories like nouns and verbs and a set of rules for combining them to produce sentences .
" How exactly a child learned these was considered something of a mystery and so it was declared by some that they must be innate , " Bannard says .
" However there is increasing evidence that children 's path to grammar is a gradual and piecemeal process . "
The findings also show that , between the ages of two and three , children learn to better understand and apply the adult rules of grammar , particularly by using verbs more flexibly .
This is the first major study of children 's language development that uses advanced computer modeling to analyze , understand and predict children 's utterances based on daily recordings of their language use .
" One thing that is very important about this work is Dr. Bannard 's sophisticated use of computational and statistical techniques to analyze child language data , " says Richard P. Meier , chair of the Linguistics Department .
Bannard hopes to use such methods more extensively .
" Here we have a technique for modeling grammar I 'd like to apply to more children , to look at them more continuously from age two to age three , to apply rigorous statistics to learn what a child knows , " Bannard says .

Friends are encouraging Fox News founder Roger Ailes to run for president in 2012 .
| Photo by Reuters Close
Friends and associates are encouraging Fox News chief Roger Ailes to jump into the political arena for real by running for president in 2012 , top sources tell POLITICO .
" Ailes knows how to frame an issue better than anybody , and that 's what we need now , " says one Ailes friend who is encouraging the Fox founder , chairman and CEO to seek the Republican nomination to run against President Barack Obama .
Ailes , 69 , has an aggessive , winning personality that made Fox News a huge success — and a huge target for liberal critics .
Frank Luntz , the well - known Republican pollster , said Ailes could be a force if he makes the run .
" I have known Roger Ailes for 29 years , " says Luntz .
“ No one knows how to win better than Roger . "
Talk of an Ailes run , which informed sources said is based on more than mere speculation , could escalate the White House war with Fox war in wildly unpredictable – and fun – ways .
It was Ailes who recently held a private meeting with top White House adviser David Axelrod to ease tensions .
The meeting was not a success .
Shortly after , the White House stepped up its attack on Fox – and Fox has proudly fired back .
Fox executives are relishing the public spat – so much so that virtually every on - air personality talks about it , and Sean Hannity has made it a central part of his show ’s promo .
The biggest reason : ratings at Fox are through the roof .
From his official bio : “ Roger Ailes has been Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of FOX News Channel since 1996 , Chairman of Fox Television Stations and Twentieth Television since 2005 and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of FOX Business Network since 2007 .
Prior to joining the Company , Mr. Ailes was President of CNBC from 1993 to 1996 and served as President of America ’s Talking , an information talk channel that later became MSNBC . ”
As a legendary Republican political consultant in an earlier career , Ailes helped engineer victories for Ronald Reagan in 1984 and George H.W. Bush in 1988 .
John Stirling thought he would never recover the use of his left arm A man from East Sussex whose arm was re-attached after he sliced it off in a chainsaw accident has returned to work .
John Stirling , from Telscombe Cliffs , slipped while using the chainsaw in the garden of his home a year ago .
He underwent 14 hours of emergency surgery after a neighbour put the limb in a bag containing frozen pastry .
" I 've been extremely lucky ... it 's an old fashioned spade and fork for me [ in the garden ] from now on , " said Mr Stirling , who works at Newhaven Marina .
Recalling the accident on 29 September , he said : " It happened in seconds and I knew that my jumper was caught , and I actually closed my eyes and thought I hope this stops before it does any damage .
Dead weight " I felt a searing pain ... and I opened my eyes and the arm was gone - it was on the lawn .
" So I had to move very quickly to stem the blood and then go for help . "
His neighbour Steve Francis came to his aid after Mr Stirling kicked on his door .
John lost his forearm in a chainsaw accident
He dialled 999 , tied a belt around the arm and retrieved the rest of the limb from the garden .
Thanks to his quick actions , doctors at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead were able to save the severed limb , re-attaching it during two lengthy operations .
" First of all I thought I 'd lost it for good ... in the early days it was just a dead weight , " Mr Stirling said .
But after several months the feeling in his arm and fingers started to return .
" Surgeons did warn me that the nerves might not grow at all and I 'm just incredibly happy and glad that it all turned out great , " he said .
Mr Stirling said he had not quite got the full use of his arm back , but he had started to drive again and his consultant was optimistic .
" My expectations now are for an amazing recovery , " he said .

JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
An archaeological dig in Jerusalem has turned up a 3,700 - year - old wall that is the largest and oldest of its kind found in the region , experts say .
The wall is built of enormous boulders , confounding archaeologists as to how ancient peoples built it .
Standing 8 meters ( 26 feet ) high , the wall of huge cut stones is a marvel to archaeologists .
" To build straight walls up 8 meters ... I do n't know how to do it today without mechanical equipment , " said the excavation 's director , Ronny Reich .
" I do n't think that any engineer today without electrical power [ could ] do it . "
Archaeologist Eli Shukron of the Israel Antiquities Authority added , " You see all the big boulders -- all the boulders are 4 to 5 tons . "
The discovered section is 24 meters ( 79 feet ) long .
" However , it is thought the fortification is much longer because it continues west beyond the part that was exposed , " the Israel Antiquities Authority said in a news release .
It was found inside the City of David , an archaeological excavation site outside the Old City of East Jerusalem on a slope of the Silwan Valley .
The wall is believed to have been built by the Canaanites , an ancient pagan people who the Bible says inhabited Jerusalem and other parts of the Middle East before the advent of monotheism .
Watch report on the discovery of the ancient wall »
" This is the most massive wall that has ever been uncovered in the City of David , " Reich and Shukron said in a joint statement about the find .
It marks the first time " that such massive construction that predates the Herodian period has been discovered in Jerusalem . "
It appears to be part of a " protected , well - fortified passage that descends to the spring tower from some sort of fortress that stood at the top of the hill , " according to the joint statement .
The spring " is located in the weakest and most vulnerable place in the area .
The construction of a protected passage , even though it involves tremendous effort , is a solution for which there are several parallels in antiquity , albeit from periods that are later than the remains described here . "
Such walls were used primarily to defend against marauding desert nomads looking to rob the city , said Reich , a professor at the University of Haifa .
" We are dealing with a gigantic fortification , from the standpoint of the structure 's dimensions , the thickness of its walls and the size of the stones that were incorporated in its construction , " the joint statement said .
Water from the spring is used by modern inhabitants of Jerusalem .
" The new discovery shows that the picture regarding Jerusalem 's eastern defenses and the ancient water system in the Middle Bronze Age 2 is still far from clear , " Reich said .
" Despite the fact that so many have excavated on this hill , there is a very good chance that extremely large and well - preserved architectural elements are still hidden in it and waiting to be uncovered . "

For several years , the U.S. military has been working on a 30,000 - pound superbomb that can penetrate and destroy what the military calls " hardened targets " : Command bunkers or WMD facilities shielded by concrete and buried deep underground .
Now it looks as if the Pentagon is speeding delivery of the bomb , formally known as the Massive Ordnance Penetrator , or MOP .
The Associated Press ' Anne Gearan reports today that the Defense Department awarded a contract worth around $ 52 million to speed up integration of the bomb aboard the B - 2 Spirit stealth bomber .
According to the story , the MOP could be ready for B - 2 delivery as early as next summer .
So why the rush ?
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell offered a bland statement about the world being a dangerous place , but it 's tempting to see this as a response to Iran 's newly revealed nuclear site , buried deep inside a mountain near Qom .
Gearan described the MOP " Plan B for dealing with Iran " if the diplomatic approach fails .
In fact , the Defense Department actually wanted the thing to be ready for delivery last year .
The Defense Threat Reduction Agency began testing the MOP capability in 2007 , But as Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told AP , development of the bomb was slowed by about two years because of budgetary issues .
Still , there are some very realistic scenarios on the horizon .
In a similar vein , the United States and Israel are moving ahead with a major air - defense drill next week that will test ballistic missile interceptors that would be essential in any conflict with Iran .
The drill , called Juniper Cobra , has taken place every other year since 2001 .
But as the Jerusalem Post reports , the exercise will involve the test of two U.S. systems that are the cornerstone of the revamped U.S. missile defense strategy :
The Army 's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense and the Navy 's Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system .
Israel 's Arrow missile - shooter will also be part of the exercise .

ABU DHABI GRAND PRIX
Venue : Yas Marina Dates : 30 Oct - 1 Nov 2009 Coverage : Comprehensive live coverage of Friday practice , Saturday qualifying and Sunday 's race - which starts at 1300 GMT - across BBC TV , radio and online platforms .

McLaren 's Lewis Hamilton will start the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in pole position after dominating qualifying at the final race of the season .
Hamilton , who has appeared throughout the weekend to have an edge over his closest rivals , headed the Red Bulls of Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber .
Brawn 's Rubens Barrichello , fighting with Vettel for second in the championship , will start fourth .
The Brazilian is ahead of team - mate and new world champion Jenson Button .
Hamilton , who became Formula 1's youngest world champion in 2008 , struggled in a poor car at the start of the season .
BBC SPORT'S FUEL - ADJUSTED GRID ( with projected race first pit stops * ) 1 Hamilton ( lap 17 of 55 ) 2 Vettel+0.496secs ( lap 19 ) 3 Webber +0.721 ( lap 18 ) 4 Trulli +0.721 ( lap 18 ) 5 Barrichello +0.971 ( lap 16 ) 6 Button +1.001 ( lap 17 ) 7 Heidfeld +1.186 ( lap 19 ) 8 Kubica +1.196 ( lap 15 ) 9 Rosberg 1.388 ( lap 19 ) 10 Buemi+1.651 ( lap 18 ) * Calculated on the weight of fuel left in cars after qualifying had finished Full Abu Dhabi GP qualifying results
But he and his team are right back on form and , after an hour - long session which started in daylight but finished under a setting sun with the floodlights on , the 24 - year - old landed his 17th career pole in 52 races with a lap almost 0.7 seconds quicker than second - placed Vettel .
" It 's never easy , but it was definitely as fun as it looked , " he said .
" The car is the best it has been all year .
It was a smooth lap , and it just kept getting better and better . "
" The place is just stunning .
They all said it would be a great event , but it 's mind - blowing .
I hope we can put on a great show tomorrow . "
Button , the man who has deposed Hamilton as champion , has not been on pole since Monaco in May and will attempt to win his first race since Turkey in early June with four of his strongest rivals in front of him .
" Was that satisfactory ?
No , of course not , " he told BBC Sport .

If Hamilton has any rivals for victory , it looks like being the Red Bull drivers
" Qualifying was really good ... [ but then ] in Q3 I had massive vibrations and I do n't know why .
I do n't know if it's to do with the brakes or the tyres .
Hopefully we can sort it out because that would be a nightmare in the race . "
Most drivers struggled to find early grip on the lavish and expensive new track , but that should not prove a real problem on Sunday as more and more rubber gets laid down during the sport 's first - ever twilight race .
In double world champion Fernando Alonso 's final appearance for Renault before he leaves for Ferrari , the Spaniard suffered the worst qualifying session of his underwhelming season to finish down in 16th .
But he was optimistic he will be able to end his seven - year career racing for the French team with a positive result .
" Hopefully tomorrow we can have a good race with plenty of overtaking manoeuvres , " he told BBC Sport .
" The track is quite wide so there should be places to get past people . "
After stopping with transmission problems in the second session , Hamilton 's team - mate Heikki Kovalainen qualified only 13th - and he was demoted a further five places when it emerged McLaren would have to change his gearbox .
Speaking about the effects of driving as the natural light gives way to artificial light , Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen - who will start Sunday 's race from 11th - said it was not a major factor .
" You do n't really notice because the lights are so strong , " he said .
" It does n't make any difference really . "
Vettel is aiming to cement his second place in the drivers ' championship by finishing ahead of Barrichello on Sunday .
" It 's a great way to start the last race of the year , " said the German .
" Both of us [ he and Webber ] are a little surprised at the gap to Lewis , but he has been strong all weekend .
" It 's been difficult to match him , but let 's see the fuel loads and let 's see on Sunday because we 've good race pace . "
Webber added : " Today is the story of the second half of the championship as Lewis has been strong , and Brawn have been there as well . "
Fuel loads , which help to give a better picture of race pace and pit - stop strategy , are as yet unknown .
But the view across the paddock is that Abu Dhabi 's inaugural race is Hamilton 's to lose .
" He 's come with a point to prove , " said McLaren team boss Martin Whitmarsh .
" He 's scored more racing points than anyone else in the second half of the season .
Lewis wants another win and so do we . "

What makes the director oftick ?
Drawing Fumito Ueda out on the subject is n't precisely easy -- on inspiration , he says , " I 've gotten this question many times , but I actually do n't intentionally think about inspiration .
" The Sony - based creator is known for his careful approach to gaming , as seen in his trilogy of titles - andfor the PlayStation 3 and the upcoming , much - awaitedfor PlayStation 3 .
As referenced , there 's obviously a very deliberate method to Ueda 's style of game design .
And with that in mind , Gamasutra spoke in depth to him at Tokyo Game Show to try and get a handle on that process , in a rare interview : Fumito Ueda :
Well , there 's a significant relationship between the main character controlled by the player , and then the AI character -- Yorda for Ico , the Colossi , and also the horse in , and init 's the beast -- but I do n't have an intentional plan or some big concept , or anything like this .
But I think , maybe , I 'm thinking that there 's something that can be said about relationships , between the AI and the player , that can only function in the computer entertainment world .
FU : You 're exactly right -- I exactly agree with you .
I think that I tried to sort out within myself what exactly can be done only through video games .
I think one way to use the computer is to use it like dice in The Game of Life , or something like that .
But I do n't think that 's the most effective way to use the computer ; I think it 's having AI , or having characters that have some sort of personality to them .
I think that 's the way to use computers .
FU : It 's not that I particularly like younger characters , or something like this , but I think it 's really trying to figure out a cohesion with the game design , and what would be the most persuasive form of expression .
And having a younger age was the answer that I reached .
FU : Of course it 's different for each title , but something that they have in common would be that to really illustrate or communicate that the world that you see is real .
That it 's a really existing world , and to actually have this reality to the world that 's in the screen .
FU : It 's not that we do n't do it at all -- create this background setting -- but I think that perhaps compared to other teams , we do n't do it as much .
So I think maybe you 're referring to background setting situations .
But really , compared to the amount of data information of the setting , we actually have more information about the actual details contained in the particular scene , or particular screen shot ; in order to create this actuality , reality , tangibility to the screen .
So , less background setting , more detail in the actual image .
FU : That 's exactly correct .
I think somebody said that " God is in the details , " and that 's really what I 'm looking at .
FU : I 've gotten this question many times , but I actually do n't intentionally think about inspiration .
Meaning that I do n't really value or cherish it , inspiration , and specific sources of inspiration ; rather , the reason why it looks the way it does is because of game design , and the necessity of game design -- the constraints of level design .
FU : It 's what you said .
Actually building it , and seeing how it looks -- and then also looking at if it's a place that players would easily get lost in , and place some kind of landmark , or some kind of guide post , or something .
If it 's a dark setting , then open some windows .
And also , then , to make it visually , aesthetically enjoyable , and pleasing .
FU : Actually , that is true , that sometimes we do have a visual image first , and then go into the level design -- I mean , what you described .
But actually , for , all the stages were made as individual , separate spaces , and then they were compressed together , and somehow made so that they had some compatibility , cohesiveness .
FU : I do have an interest in motion control -- just the technology itself -- but I do n't think that perhaps it is most compatible for the themes that I 'm looking for now .
So , the motion control is a new , involved form of input to the game , but I actually have a stronger interest in what enhancements can be made to the output , so ... FU : Actually I do n't really feel the enhancement of the PS3 through the AI , because we do n't really use such complex AI .
Actually I feel more the enhancement in the information density ; how much information can be put onto the screen , in terms of the details , and how much more we can have .
Everywhere he goes promoting " Capitalism : A Love Story , " whether it's to gab with Jay Leno , Charlie Rose or Tavis Smiley , or even take the stage at his own movie premiere , Michael Moore wears his trademark baseball cap .
It 's his one and only fashion accessory , his way of reminding us that he 's just one fleck of DNA -- or one good film - school class -- away from being a tubby auto worker on the assembly line in Flint , Mich .
I 'll bet Moore would wear a baseball cap to the White House .
So what was the heavyweight occasion that inspired Moore to lose the cap and doll himself up in a coat and tie ?

The 62 newly proposed meteor showers have names like the Microscopiids and the beta Camelopardalids .
“ It got a little tedious to give them all new names , ” says team leader Peter Brown .

Every now and again , biologists turn up a bonanza of new species deep in the ocean or in remote corners of the Earth .
But astronomers usually have to make do with a trickle of new discoveries , spotting a rare supernova here or a couple of backwards planets there .
Now , researchers in Canada report finding an incredible 62 new meteor showers , displays of ‘ shooting stars ’ that recur every year when Earth passes through the trail of debris left behind by a comet or asteroid .
“ I was surprised to find so many new ones , ” says team leader Peter Brown of the University of Western Ontario .

He credits the wealth of discoveries to the nature of his survey , which detects incoming debris about 10 times as small as can generally be seen by eye , catching objects about 0.1 millimetres across .
The survey , based near London , Ontario , uses radar to detect the trail of ionised gases produced as the debris particles slam into the atmosphere at blistering speeds .
The survey measures the paths of the debris particles , allowing researchers to trace their orbits around the sun – and potentially track down their parent bodies .
“ The central reason for looking at these streams is to trace them back to their origins , ” Brown told New Scientist .
‘ Archaeological record ’
Over seven years of observations , the project has identified 117 annual meteor showers , of which 62 have never been reported before .
Interestingly , the team found that about half of the 117 observed streams follow orbits similar to those from other meteor showers .
That bolsters previous research suggesting that the parent objects – mostly comets – likely broke up into smaller bodies that also shed debris trails – a break - up process that can occur over and over .
“ In some cases , we can still trace [ the trails ] back to some parent objects ; in others , we ca n’t see an obvious parent , ” says Brown .
For example , his team found half a dozen streams linked to Comet Encke , the parent body of the well - known Taurid meteor shower .
The 62 newly proposed showers join nearly 300 others that are awaiting confirmation by the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) , which to date has officially recognised 64 meteor showers .
Peter Jenniskens of the SETI Institute in California , who heads up the IAU group tasked with naming meteor showers , says the new finds will be a boon to science : “ Each shower is an archaeological record of some comet ’s past activity . ”
( CNN ) -- A radical Islamist leader in Somalia said Sunday that a suicide attack that killed 21 African Union peacekeepers was the right thing to do .
A relative walks past caskets containing the bodies of Burundian soldiers .
Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys said Thursday 's attack was meant to defend Islam .
" The Islamic religion permits such kinds of attacks if they are against known enemies and in the defense of the religion , but there are people who distort that explanation , " Aweys said , addressing hundreds of people during a religious sermon at Elashabiyaha , a suburb of Mogadishu .
Suicide bombers , disguised in two U.N. - marked vehicles , rammed through the security gate of the mission 's headquarters , which is attached to Mogadishu 's airport .
They detonated explosives just as Somalia 's transitional government and mission representatives concluded a high - level meeting inside the compound , said Nicolas Bwakira , the African Union 's special representative for Somalia .
The attack killed four Somali civilians and 17 Ugandan and Burundian soldiers , including the mission 's second - in - command , Burundian Maj .
Gen. Juvenal Niyonguruza , he said .
The force commander , Ugandan Maj. Gen. Nathan Mugisha , was among the 40 wounded .
He assumed command of the African Union Mission in Somalia -- known as AMISOM -- last month .
Al - Shabaab , the Islamist militia with ties to al Qaeda , claimed responsibility for the attack , according to the African Union .
The strike happened days after U.S. special forces targeted and killed a senior al Qaeda operative in southern Somalia .
Analysts hailed the death of Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan as a major blow to al Qaeda 's efforts to work with Al - Shabaab to try to gain a foothold in the lawless country .
Aweys , a rival of current Somali president Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , condemned the killing of Nabhan .
" The U.S. government is responsible for all problems on the Muslim nation particularly on the Somalis , " he said .
Aweys heads the Hizbul Islam ( Party of Islam ) armed group which is allied with Al - Shabaab and opposes the presence of Ethiopian forces in Somalia .
The African Union has a 3,400 - member peacekeeping force in Somalia , made up of troops from Burundi and Uganda .
It operates under a U.N. mandate to support Somalia 's transitional federal government .
The peacekeeping force is charged with protecting key government and strategic installations in Mogadishu , including the port , airport and presidential palace .
It is the de facto military force of the weak , transitional Somali government .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , is unlikely to close by the Obama administration 's deadline of January 2010 , two senior administration officials said late Friday .
U.S. military personnel walk a road at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , in July .
They cited legal complications for the delay , but said they were still optimistic about shutting the detention facility for terrorism suspects soon .
The announcement represents a blow to the president , who signed an executive order and set the deadline with great fanfare during his first week in office .
During a signing ceremony at the White House on January 22 , Obama reaffirmed his inauguration pledge that the United States does not have " to continue with a false choice between our safety and our ideals . "
The president said he was issuing the order to close the prison camp in order to " restore the standards of due process and the core constitutional values that have made this country great even in the midst of war , even in dealing with terrorism . "
The delay may provide fodder for Republicans such as former Vice President Dick Cheney , who has argued that shutting the Guantanamo prison would make the United States less safe .
He said Obama should have had a detailed plan in place before signing the order .
" Even White House officials are now acknowledging that there is still no alternative that will keep Americans as safe as housing detainees at that secure facility off our shores , " Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- Kentucky , said in a written statement .
" Americans and a bipartisan majority in Congress will continue to reject any effort to close Guantanamo until there is a plan that keeps Americans as safe or safer than keeping detainees in the secure detention center , " McConnell 's statement said .
At its peak , the Guantanamo prison population exceeded 750 , all men .
More than 500 have been released , most into the custody of other countries .
The senior administration officials insisted the White House is making progress in finding third - party countries to accept the remaining detainees .
Approximately 2,200 staff members work there , from all branches of the U.S. military plus civilian employees .

L. Ron Hubbard famously ( supposedly ) said the way to make a million dollars is to start a religion .
But like so many lurcrative frauds before it , the immense corruption scandal that upended New Jersey politics yesterday is a powerful reminder that piggybacking on an old religion works even better .
Start a synagogue like Congregation Sheves Achim , pictured above courtesy The Jewish Channel , and you do n't even need a congregation to get into the lucrative business of racketeering and money laundering !
At least 96 other nonprofits are registered to the address of Sheves Achim , where Rabbi Mordechai Fish laundered over half a million dollars for the FBI , taking a pretty sweet 15 % cut for his holiness .
A child who answered the phone at the house was reportedly unaware it was a house of God , and The Jewish Channel was apparently too polite to ask whether he'd found any wads of cash stuffed into any of his Apple Jacks boxes .
So Jim and I were working late last night at the Compound , developing new and exciting ways to make State of Affairs the place to be on the World Wide Web ( no , I ’m not kidding , and yes , there is some really cool shit coming down the pipe ; stay tuned ) .
We were getting a lot done , but Jim is only recently back from South Africa and I think he came down with a touch of typhoid fever while he was there , so he was a little out of sorts – and I have n’t slept a solid night in over a month – so we decided to take a break and turn on the TV for a while .
As usual , that turned out to be a mistake of legendary proportions .
In North America there ’s a television station called TLC .
Once upon a time , that acronym stood for “ The Learning Channel ” , but as it turns out , those days are long , long over .
I remember back in the day my family would watch programming on TLC because it was informative ( go figure ) and entertaining .
It was a lot like the Discovery Channel or the National Geographic channel ; lots of documentaries and “ how - it ’s - made ” shows that appealed to a wide demographic and made up for the sitcom - or - talk - show pabulum that accounted for most of the rest of the available programming in the mid-90s .
Then , towards the end of the 90s and the beginning of the new century , new shows started creeping into their daily lineup .
At first it was a logical step forward : the first of the new breed I remember seeing were the earliest of the “ how - to ” shows : home renovation , cooking , that kind of stuff .
I was into it because it was still informative ; it still showed me how to do things I did n’t necessarily already know how to do .
I watched , rapt , as some dude expertly patched a hole in drywall or installed a sink , and I literally took notes when the cooking lady prepared some kind of elegant - yet - simple pasta - based dish “ for any occasion ” ( even back then I had ladies to impress , you see ) .
So even though TLC was moving away from the straight - up educational programming I ’d become accustomed to , I kind of liked the new direction .
I lost track of TV for a good long time in the early 2000s , because I was in school and could n’t afford cable .
Rarely if ever would you see me staring at any screen other than that of my desktop PC because I was constantly in a state of balancing essay - writing time and work time , and the off time I did get was spent hunched over my guitar .
Writing university English essays is a draining and intellectually damning process , and the last thing I wanted to do when I was n’t working was try to expand my knowledge of the world , so TLC was off my list .
A few years later I was dating a girl who loved TLC more than life itself – and no , I ’m not really exaggerating at all .
She sat me down one afternoon for a TV marathon , mostly to keep me away from work for a while , and I relaxed on the couch with a rum and coke , awaiting what would doubtless be a stimulating few hours ’ worth of intelligent television .
Yeah .
Sure .
Believe that and I got some prime beachfront real estate in New Orleans I ’d love to sell you .
First on the docket was my girlfriend ’s favourite show of all time : a reality - esque series called “ What Not To Wear ” in which some dude and his pointy female cohort are hired by the friends and associates of the fashion - challenged to repair the wardrobes of the subject in question .
Said person is ambushed by the hosts and their camera crew and told ( on national TV ) that , in the opinion of their closest friends and family , their taste in clothing makes them look like an unwashed hobo doubtless infected with one or more social illnesses .
What follows is an hour ’s worth of public humiliation in which the hosts rifle through the subject ’s closet , passing haute - couture judgement on every piece of clothing they come across , turning up their noses and casting off what they deem unfit for public viewing .
The subject is even confined to a mirrored changeroom in which he or she is made to put on some of the offending garments for the express purpose of the hosts ’ amusement : they gleefully point out how this - or - that pair of pants makes the wearer ’s ass look fat , or how their favourite teeshirt is “ like , so 1985 ” et cetera .
The subject is then dragged to a local fashion district where he or she is forced to dress like a middle - class yuppie ( thankfully on the show ’s credit card ) ; often a makeover , haircut or mani / pedicure is included in this process .
All the while the show ’s hosts go into spasms of orgasmic delight over every new outfit and accoutrement , waxing poetic on how the change in wardrobe will positively influence the subject ’s life .
At the end of the show , the parties responsible for this shaming ritual gather to see the effects of their castigation first - hand .
The subject is paraded around like a prized pet and the assembled “ friends ” gasp and clamour and cheer over the so - called improvements that have been made .
The subject is forced to admit the change is for the better , and the hosts traipse off arm - in - arm towards their next unwitting target .
Holy Jesus Tacked - Up Christ on a billboard .
I watched two episodes of this travesty .
The first detailed a guy whose girlfriend and family decided he dressed too much like – well , a guy – to be considered appropriate in today ’s image - conscious metrosexual paradigm .
So they ditched the teeshirts , jeans and ball caps he was used to wearing for tailored shirts , designer slacks and a Ross Gellar haircut that was still all the rage at that time .
He wound up leaving the show with an armful of bullshit he was supposed to use from then on – facial exfoliant , hair gel , moisturizers and even a lufa .
I did n’t even know what a lufa was before watching this show , and I can confidently say I could have lived the rest of my life in blissful ignorance .
This guy went from Average Joe to Metroboy in one fell swoop , and in bearing witness to this pointless emasculation , a little part of me died .
It ’s one thing if you choose to take that much care in your daily grooming – I ’m not passing judgement – but to be told this is the way it must be was a little too much for me .
The second episode was even worse .
Now I ’ll admit the female subject was n’t my picture of typical beauty by any stretch : her wardrobe choices consisted of ratty Iggy Pop teeshirts , torn blue jeans and a haircut reminiscent of the feral children of the early 1900s .
But she was by far the most happy - go - lucky person I ’d ever seen on television .
She was genuinely hurt when the hosts showed up and informed her everyone she cared about thought she looked like hammered shit , and as the episode wore on , her depression only deepened .
They gave her a video camera to record a daily journal in her hotel room at the end of each gruelling day of shopping , and each night her beer consumption went up another notch .
The third day ended with her weeping openly into the camera , proclaiming “ this is the first time in my life I ’ve ever been self - conscious about my appearance . ”
I could have reached through the screen and strangled the life out of that skinny - fuck host and his bitchy sidekick .
Needless to say , I ’m not dating that particular girlfriend anymore .
I was aghast that she could derive so much entertainment from what amounted to a fashion stockade on national TV .
It ’s one thing if people sign up to make assholes out of themselves on television – I reference “ American Idol ” as the obvious example – but to be set up for humiliation , to be the butt of a bad joke for the rest of your life through no fault of your own ; well , I have to say that ’s just about the worst thing ever .
Or at least I would have thought so had I not kept watching TLC .
Let ’s go through the gamut , shall we ?
Jon & Kate Plus 8
I do n’t think I ’ve ever seen a more disgusting display of Western excess as I have in this show .
These people are famous for – what ?
Taking too many fertility drugs and cranking out eight kids when one would have sufficed ?
And let me tell you something else – I saw the end of that series coming a mile away .
Apparently , the rash of reality television shows that end in tragedy have n’t taught people that putting a camera crew in your home 24 hours a day will bring ruination on your family .
Sure enough , Jon and Kate are splitting up amidst a hailstorm of gossip - column speculation .
What they ’re speculating about is baffling to me : from the few episodes I was subjected to , I was able to glean that a ) she ’s a mean - spirited bitch , b ) he ’s a spineless sycophant and c ) their kids are all going to grow into completely fucked - up adults .
Speculate away : Alex James has discovered the answer .
Reality TV sucks .
Table for 12
Jon and Kate with the volume cranked .
Why not move the whole show to Utah and see what it really means to have a big family ?
18 Kids and Counting
Okay , Arkansas is close enough .
I can just see the network executives sitting around puffing cigars and drinking scotch .
“ Well , “ Jon and Kate ” has huge ratings , but now they ’re getting divorced .
“ Table for Twelve ” is like “ Jon and Kate ” , only better because there are four more kids .
And now we need another show to fill the prime - time spot .
Are you thinking what I ’m thinking ?
Eight was good … twelve was better .
How about – you ready for this – a family of eighteen ? ”
I can only assume a self - congratulatory circle - jerk ensued .
Well done , you corporate whores .
Not one , not two , but three shows about abnormally - sized families .
All airing concurrently .
Who ’s doing your program planning ?
Rick Berman ?
Little People , Big World
Yep , it ’s exactly what you think it is .
Following the exploits of a midget couple and their regular - sized children .
Talk about gratuitous pandering and shameless exploitation of the physically disabled ( differently abled ?
What you like , hippie ) .
Plenty of heartfelt moments , most of which involve the trials of not being able to reach things on high shelves .
Not to state the obvious , but I really would n’t shed a tear if this series got cut a little short .
The Little Couple
More of the same : pint - sized newlyweds minus the jumbo order of offspring .
Did n’t we say all we needed to say about Little People with the first show ?
Did we need to tag along for the wee wedding ?
If I wanted to watch a show about a severely - challenged married couple I ’d go stream reruns of that Jessica Simpson disaster .
If I did n’t know better I ’d say TLC was coming up short on ideas .
( Okay , I ’ll stop . )
LA Ink
I …well , I ’d love to castigate this show , but essentially it ’s Kat Von D spending her time being heart - breakingly attractive and drawing really amazing shit on the bodies of her clients , all of whom are entertaining for one reason or another , be it endearingly or because they ’re dumbasses who think they have a chance with Kat Von D .
And I ’m learning about tattooing .
Yeah .
I ’m learning about tattooing .
This one gets a pass .
Because I ’m learning .
About tattooing .
Really .
Throw into this mix a bunch of one - off Lifestyle tear - jerking spotlights on children with horrendously unfortunate physical ailments ( “ Child Frozen In Time ” about a girl who stopped ageing at two or three years , or “ Mermaid Girl ” about a girl who…well , who looks like a mermaid ) , and you ’ve got yourself a recipe for – at best – mediocre television designed to appeal to walking stereotypes of bored housewives and disenfranchised teenage girls with gossip fetishes ( if my ex- girlfriend is any indicator ) .
All of this was enough to set my teeth on edge , as regular readers of this blog would likely figure .
But the one that last night , sitting on Jim ’s couch , took the proverbial cake – and not just the cake , the entire dessert table – was this fucking travesty of modern television :
Toddlers and Tiaras
Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the bottom of the barrel .
It is my greatest wish that future generations will not somehow discover taped footage of this skidmark on the underwear of contemporary media and judge people like me on its content , because this is exactly what you ’re afraid it is .
It ’s a televised reality show about candidates in a beauty pageant for girls not yet old enough to bleed from anything other than a skinned knee .
Well , actually , it ’s not really a show about these pint - sized future anorexics .
If we ’re going to be honest , it ’s a show about their mothers : those greedy , grasping Kim Catrall clones , with a tarnished May Queen crown rusting away in a display case in the anteroom of their posh mansions in Rosedale , and an undeserved sense of entitlement .
I would explain in greater detail , but I ’d rather give you the straight skinny right from the horse ’s mouth .
Here ’s the direct quote from the website ’s “ about ” section :
“ On any given weekend , on stages across the country , little girls and boys parade around wearing makeup , false eyelashes , spray tans and fake hair to be judged on their beauty , personality and costumes .
Toddlers and Tiaras follows families on their quest for sparkly crowns , big titles , and lots of cash .
The preparation is intense as it gets down to the final week before the pageant .
From hair and nail appointments , to finishing touches on gowns and suits , to numerous coaching sessions or rehearsals , each child preps for their performance .
But once at the pageant , it ’s all up to the judges and drama ensues when every parent wants to prove that their child is beautiful . ”
I ’m going to go out on a limb and make a sweeping judgement call : these are horrible people .
No , seriously .
There ’s no joke coming .
These mothers deserve to be rounded up , locked in a cage , jacked up on diet pills and cosmopolitans , given bladed weapons , and made to fight to the death .
Now that would be entertaining .
This is the same shit I saw my friends dealing with in grade school .
I was in class with a lot of aspiring hockey players ( it ’s Canada , what do you want ? ) and of all the guys I knew with aspirations of playing in the NHL , only one of their fathers was a cool guy .
He used to tell my friend Shawn ( who was a very talented goalie ) that if he wanted to play hockey – that was cool .
If he wanted to go be an engineer or a plumber or a university professor , that would be cool too .
He could do whatever he wanted and his dad would support his decision .
The rest of those asshole dads did nothing but pile pressure on their sons in an effort to recapture what glory was once theirs , when they “ almost made it to the big leagues ” before sustaining some practice injury and being forced to take a desk job for the rest of their miserable lives .
It ’s called “ living vicariously ” , and it ’s a fucking crime .
These evil mothers are no different .
Is n’t it enough that half the teenage girls in this day and age suffer from depression , eating disorders and a whole laundry list of other mental and physical ailments thanks to the pressure our culture puts on them to look just like Jennifer Aniston or Angelina Jolie ?
You ’re going to stuff them into a leotard or some kind of slinky dress , apply makeup with a masonry trowel and make them parade around on a catwalk , competing with other girls to find out who ’s prettiest – when they ’re five fucking years old ?
Oh , it gets better .
Here are some of the fun things TLC ’s website informed me the “ teeny beauty queens ” ( read : children ) use to up the ante and prove they ’re the sweetest piece of ass on the playground .
Butt Glue
Oh , where to start .
Apparently , this adhesive is used to keep the girls ’ swimsuits in place .
Will come in extremely handy when they spend the rest of their formative years being harassed by every sexual predator in their area code .
Fake Eyelashes and Nails
You know something ?
These accessories do n’t look good on their hasbeen redneck mothers , and they ’re certainly not going to look good on them either .
Hairpieces
I ’m having trouble getting through this list .
What happened to bobs and ponytails ?
I have a sister , and if she ever got it in her head to start wearing hairpieces at that age ( or if my mother ever insinuated it would be a good idea )
I ’d jack both of them immediately for the good of the race .
Flipper
From the website ( because I did n’t know what the hell these things were ) :
“ Contestants use temporary clip - on or snap - in teeth to enhance a crooked smile or cover missing teeth . ”
Funny thing about being five ; you tend to start losing teeth .
That ’s , you know , a natural part of childhood .
Unlike flippers .
Straws
Ostensibly to protect lipstick finish from sippy - cup overflow , they might as well get used to taking their lunches through thin pieces of plastic – that way , the rolled - up twenty dollar bills they ’ll use later in life wo n’t seem so foreign .
Skin Shimmer
I ca n’t go on .
I ’m about to have an aneurism .
To the mothers of “ Toddlers & Tiaras ” — do yourselves , your children , and my sanity a favour , and please kindly go lie down in traffic .
A grateful nation will thank you .
What kind of culture is TLC promoting here ?
Girls this age should be , I do n’t know , playing with Barbies or something ( I do n’t really have a frame of reference ; my younger sister was far more interested in my Ninja Turtles than her Barbies as a child – she grew up to be an auto mechanic , incidentally .
And yes , she has a boyfriend before you go there , you bigots ) .
They certainly should n’t be forced to essentially play the dancing monkey for their depraved children and whatever social rejects consider this bullshit “ entertainment ” .
Like I said at the beginning of this diatribe , I do n’t watch an awful lot of television ( though Jim and I have both written on the subject before ) , and the few channels I do watch are still dedicated to providing me quality programming ( alternative news , documentaries and Star Trek , typically ) .
I ’m very sorry to see TLC sell their collective souls to the highest bidder and start producing this brain - rot fuckery to be consumed like so many Big Macs by the unwashed masses of the Western world .
All I can say is this : when “ Trading Spaces ” was the high point of your broadcasting history of the last ten years … well , as the internet meme goes , you ’re doing it wrong .
Boycott this bullshit .
Fuck TLC .
Turn off your TV , read a book , quit judging everybody around you , and love your children .
Now if you ’ll excuse me , I have to go return this box to the soap factory .
ALEX JAMES EDIT :
One of my coworkers at the Compound just sent me a link about TLC ’s newest addition to their shit - festival of rock - bottom programming : MY MONKEY BABY .
I ’m tapped folks .
I ’m seriously fucking tapped .
I ’m going to go drink myself into a defeated stupor and try to forget I ever saw this .
In just two weeks , on Oct. 22 , Microsoft ’s long operating - system nightmare will be over .
The company will release Windows 7 , a faster and much better operating system than the little - loved Windows Vista , which did a lot to harm both the company ’s reputation , and the productivity and blood pressure of its users .
PC makers will rush to flood physical and online stores with new computers pre-loaded with Windows 7 , and to offer the software to Vista owners who wish to upgrade .
With Windows 7 , PC users will at last have a strong , modern successor to the sturdy and familiar , but aged , Windows XP , which is still the most popular version of Windows , despite having come out in 2001 .
In the high - tech world , an eight - year - old operating system is the equivalent of a 20 - year - old car .
While XP works well for many people , it is relatively weak in areas such as security , networking and other features more important today than when XP was designed around 1999 .
After using pre-release versions of Windows 7 for nine months , and intensively testing the final version for the past month on many different machines , I believe it is the best version of Windows Microsoft ( MSFT ) has produced .
It ’s a boost to productivity and a pleasure to use .
Despite a few drawbacks , I can heartily recommend Windows 7 to mainstream consumers .
Like the new Snow Leopard operating system released in August by Microsoft ’s archrival , Apple ( AAPL ) , Windows 7 is much more of an evolutionary than a revolutionary product .
Its main goal was to fix the flaws in Vista and to finally give Microsoft customers a reason to move up from XP .
But Windows 7 is packed with features and tweaks that make using your computer an easier and more satisfying experience .
The new taskbar shows small previews of many windows and allows for larger previews .
The new taskbar shows small previews of many windows and allows for larger previews .
Windows 7 introduces real advances in organizing your programs and files , arranging your taskbar and desktop , and quickly viewing and launching the page or document you want , when you want it .
It also has cool built - in touch - screen features .
It removes a lot of clutter .
And it mostly banishes Vista ’s main flaws — sluggishness ; incompatibility with third - party software and hardware ; heavy hardware requirements ; and constant , annoying security warnings .
I tested Windows 7 on 11 different computers , ranging from tiny netbooks to standard laptops to a couple of big desktops .
These included machines from Lenovo , Hewlett - Packard ( HPQ ) , Dell ( DELL ) , Acer , Asus , Toshiba and Sony ( SNE ) .
I even successfully ran it on an Apple Macintosh laptop .
On some of these machines , Windows 7 was pre-loaded .
On others , I had to upgrade from an earlier version of Windows .
In most cases , the installation took 45 minutes or less , and the new operating system worked snappily and well .
But , I did encounter some drawbacks and problems .
On a couple of these machines , glacial start - up and reboot times reminded me of Vista .
And , on a couple of others , after upgrading , key features like the display or touchpad did n’t work properly .
Also , Windows 7 still requires add - on security software that has to be frequently updated .
It ’s tedious and painful to upgrade an existing computer from XP to 7 , and the variety of editions in which Windows 7 is offered is confusing .
Finally , Microsoft has stripped Windows 7 of familiar built - in applications , such as email , photo organizing , address book , calendar and video - editing programs .
These can be downloaded free of charge , but they no longer come with the operating system , though some PC makers may choose to pre-load them .
In recent years , I , like many other reviewers , have argued that Apple ’s Mac OS X operating system is much better than Windows .
That ’s no longer true .
I still give the Mac OS a slight edge because it has a much easier and cheaper upgrade path ; more built - in software programs ; and far less vulnerability to viruses and other malicious software , which are overwhelmingly built to run on Windows .
Now , however , it ’s much more of a toss - up between the two rivals .
Windows 7 beats the Mac OS in some areas , such as better previews and navigation right from the taskbar , easier organization of open windows on the desktop and touch - screen capabilities .
So Apple will have to scramble now that the gift of a flawed Vista has been replaced with a reliable , elegant version of Windows .
Here are some of the key features of Windows 7 .
New Taskbar :
In Windows 7 , the familiar taskbar has been reinvented and made taller .
Instead of mainly being a place where icons of open windows temporarily appear , it now is a place where you can permanently “ pin ” the icons of frequently used programs anywhere along its length , and in any arrangement you choose .
This is a concept borrowed from Apple ’s similar feature , the Dock .
But Windows 7 takes the concept further .
For each running program , hovering over its taskbar icon pops up a small preview screen showing a mini-view of that program .
This preview idea was in Vista .
But , in Windows 7 , it has been expanded in several ways .
Now , every open window in that program is included separately in the preview .
If you mouse over a window in the preview screen , it appears at full size on your desktop and all other windows on the desktop become transparent — part of a feature called Aero Peek .
Click on the window and it comes up , ready for use .
You can even close windows from these previews , or play media in them .
I found this feature more natural and versatile than a similar feature in Snow Leopard called Dock Expose .
You can also use Aero Peek at any time to see your empty desktop , with open windows reduced to virtual panes of glass .
To do this , you just hover over a small rectangle at the right edge of the taskbar .
Taskbar icons also provide Jump Lists — pop - up menus listing frequent actions or recent files used .
Desktop organization : A feature called Snap allows you to expand windows to full - screen size by just dragging them to the top of the screen , or to half - screen size by dragging them to the left or right edges of the screen .
Another called Shake allows you to make all other windows but the one you ’re working on disappear by simply grabbing its title bar with the mouse and shaking it several times .
File organization :
In Windows Explorer , the left - hand column now includes a feature called Libraries .
Each library — Documents , Music , Pictures and Videos — consolidates all files of those types regardless of which folder , or even which hard disk , they live in .
Networking : Windows 7 still is n’t quite as natural at networking as I find the Mac to be , but it ’s better than Vista .
For instance , now you can see all available wireless networks by just clicking on an icon in the taskbar .
A new feature called HomeGroups is supposed to let you share files more easily among Windows 7 PCs on your home network .
In my tests , it worked , but not consistently , and it required typing in long , arcane passwords .
Touch :
Some of the same kinds of multitouch gestures made popular on the iPhone are now built into Windows 7 .
But these features wo n’t likely become popular for a while because to get the most out of them , a computer needs a special type of touch screen that goes beyond most of the ones existing now .
I tested this on one such laptop , a Lenovo , and was able to move windows around , to resize and flip through photos , and more .
Speed :
In my tests , on every machine , Windows 7 ran swiftly and with far fewer of the delays typical in running Vista .
All the laptops I tested resumed from sleep quickly and properly , unlike in Vista .
Start - up and restart times were also improved .
I chose six Windows 7 laptops from different makers to compare with a new MacBook Pro laptop .
The Mac still started and restarted faster than most of the Windows 7 PCs .
But the speed gap has narrowed considerably , and one of the Lenovos beat the Mac in restart time .
Nagging :
In the name of security , Vista put up nagging warnings about a wide variety of tasks , driving people crazy .
In Windows 7 , you can now set this system so it nags you only when things are happening that you consider really worth the nag .
Also , Microsoft has consolidated most of the alerts from the lower - right system tray into one icon , and they seemed less frequent .
Compatibility : I tried a wide variety of third - party software and all worked fine on every Windows 7 machine .
These included Mozilla Firefox ; Adobe ( ADBE ) Reader ; Google ’s ( GOOG ) Picasa and Chrome ; and Apple ’s iTunes and Safari .
I also tested several hardware devices , and , unlike Vista , Windows 7 handled all but one smoothly .
These included a networked H - P printer , a Canon ( CAJ ) camera , an iPod nano , and at least five external flash drives and hard disks .
The one failure was a Verizon ( VZ ) USB cellular modem .
Microsoft says you do n’t need external software to run these , but I found it was necessary , and even then had to use a trick I found on the Web to get it to work .
System Requirements : Nearly all Vista PCs , and newer or beefier XP machines , should be able to run Windows 7 fine .
Even the netbooks I tested ran it speedily , especially with the Starter Edition , which lacks some of the powerful graphics effects in the operating system .
( Other netbooks will be able to run other editions . )
If you have a standard PC , called a 32 - bit PC , you ’ll need at least one gigabyte of memory , 16 gigabytes of free hard - disk space and a graphics system that can support Microsoft technologies called “ DirectX 9 with WDDM 1.0 . ”
You ’ll also need a processor with a speed of at least one gigahertz .
If you have a newer - style 64 - bit PC , which can use more memory , you ’ll need at least two gigabytes of memory and 20 gigabytes of free hard disk space .
In either case , you should double the minimum memory specification .
Aero Peek lets you see your desktop by making your windows transparent .
Aero
Peek lets you see your desktop by making your windows transparent .
Installation , editions and price :
There are four editions of Windows 7 of interest to consumers .
One , a limited version called Starter , comes pre-loaded on netbooks .
A second , called Professional , is mainly for people who need to tap remotely into company networks ( check with your company to see if you need this ) .
A third , called Ultimate , is mainly for techies who want every feature of all other editions .
Most average consumers will want Home Premium , which costs $ 120 for upgrades .
The system for upgrading is complicated , but Vista owners can upgrade to the exactly comparable edition of Windows 7 while keeping all files , settings and programs in place .
Unfortunately , XP owners , the biggest body of Windows users , wo n’t be able to do that .
They ’ll have to wipe out their hard disks after backing up their files elsewhere , then install Windows 7 , then restore their personal files , then re-install all their programs from the original CDs or downloaded installer files .
Then , they have to install all the patches and upgrades to those programs from over the years .
Microsoft includes an Easy Transfer wizard to help with this , but it moves only personal files , not programs .
This painful XP upgrade process is one of the worst things about Windows 7 and will likely drive many XP owners to either stick with what they ’ve got or wait and buy a new one .
In my tests , both types of installations went OK , though the latter could take a long time .
Bottom line : Windows 7 is a very good , versatile operating system that should help Microsoft bury the memory of Vista and make PC users happy .
Correction :
The edition of Microsoft ’s Windows 7 operating system aimed at business users is called Windows 7 Professional .
This week ’s Personal Technology column erroneously stated it was named Business .

The motive is strategic .
America is weaning itself off imported energy at breakneck speed .
It will not again be held hostage by oil demagogues , or humiliated by states that cannot feed themselves .
Those Beijing students who laughed at US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner may not enjoy the last laugh .
The US is the agricultural superpower .
Foes will discover why that matters .
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Ask Evan Williams whether Twitter ought to be trying harder to identify ways to make money , and the founder of the short - burst messaging network just laughs .
" It 's funny , " he says , in a mid-October interview in the young company 's warehouse - like offices in a gritty part of San Francisco 's South of Market neighborhood .
" People think we 're back here in the office looking around saying , ' Where is that business model ?
Is it in the couch cushions ? '
There 's a very logical process we 've gone through , and you could say we 've set the wrong priorities .
But if you look at building long - term value , then generating cash is n't necessarily the highest priority . "
This messy matter of moneymaking is polarizing for a company that has in every other possible way far exceeded anyone 's expectations .
Twitter , the communications platform that launched in 2006 , has become more than just a hot tech startup .
It 's a cultural sensation , having amassed 55 million unique monthly visitors worldwide and become a fixture of the international zeitgeist , from protesters in Iran to flood victims in the Philippines .
Yet it has n't collected any meaningful revenue , nor is it in any hurry to do so .
Twitter 's top executives , Williams and co-founder Biz Stone -- who together hold slot No. 5 on Fortune 's 40 Under 40 list -- appear completely unconcerned that three years into its existence Twitter remains a pre-revenue company .
Critics in the tech industry are anywhere from baffled to outraged by this seeming insouciance .
Even Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) , whose business model was n't well understood for years , started collecting some cash almost immediately and never raised additional venture capital after a single , $ 25 million stake in 1999 .
Twitter , by contrast , has raised more than $ 150 million -- most recently a $ 100 million slug valuing the company at $ 1 billion -- with nary a hint of what business it thinks it 's in .
If Williams and Stone are unrushed , perhaps it 's because they know the most about the beast they 're trying to tame .
According to Williams , it 's far more important to build the site well than it is to hit up advertisers or other would - be customers who want access to the presumably lucrative stream of information made up of what Twitterers post in 140 characters or less .
It also helps that Twitter 's financial backers exude calm .
" I 'm way more interested in how we get 100 million or more people using it than how we make money , " says venture capitalist Fred Wilson , whose Union Square Ventures was the first VC firm to back Twitter .
" It does n't cost much to operate the business , and we have a pile of cash now that funds the business for a long , long time . "
Adds another early investor , Ron Conway : " You 'd never collect $ 100 million from people if you did n't think you could monetize .
It 's understood . "
Those challenges make Williams and Stone tech industry tweeners .
Having been around the block a few times -- Williams founded early blogging service Blogger and sold it to Google in 2003 -- they are neither fresh - faced college dropouts ( though Williams did not , in fact , ever graduate from the University of Nebraska ) nor seasoned executives who have run companies the size they expect Twitter to become .
However long it takes to get to 100 million users , Williams seems intent on scale first , profit later .
" We are spending our time trying to create the best technology and product for as many users as possible , " he says .
" That 's where all our value is going to come from . "
In other words , not from under the couch cushions .

Early adopters of Sony 's new PSPgo hardware will be rewarded with a free copy of Gran Turismo PSP , Sony Europe 's Andrew House has revealed at the Gamescom Sony conference in Cologne .
The incentive will be handed out to early adopters of the PSPgo in PAL regions , who register their console between October 1 and October 10 .
Once registered , these users will be able to download a free , full copy of the game .
Also announced at the Sony conference were new ' Minis ' PSP games of 100 MB or less in size .
These bite - sized games are expected to attract increasing numbers of game developers to the system , as well as offer gamers a wider choice of low - priced titles .
One of the largest mountaintop removal projects in the country was warned of an upcoming permit veto Friday by the Environmental Protection Agency .
A letter from the EPA ’s regional administrator William Early to the Army Corps of Engineers outlined the agency ’s concerns and concluded that there is “ a high potential for downstream water quality excursions under current mining and valley fill practices . ”
The veto , if it goes through , represents a big victory for conservation activists in West Virginia , who have rarely seen the EPA step in when it comes to pollution from mountaintop mining .

Spruce No. 1 mine , managed by Mingo Logan Coal Co. , is probably the most monitored mine in the U.S. , having gone through an Environmental Impact Statement ( EIS ) conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers .
Located in Logan County , in the heart of the coal - mining Appalachians , the Spruce Mine “ as currently configured would bury more than seven miles of streams , ” according to the EPA ’s assessment .
The EPA ’s decision was based on the extensive deterioration of the watersheds , and especially the stream valleys , associated with the Spruce Mine .
According to Ken Ward Jr. of the Charleston Gazette , “ a full third of the streams in the Little Coal watershed are impaired and nearly as much of the Coal is impaired , ” due to the mining operations going on there .
“ Similar data from nearby streams associated with existing mining operations strongly suggest that construction of the Spruce No. 1 mine has potential to cause or contribute to impairments downstream , ” Early states in the letter .
Early ’s letter gives the Corps and Mingo Logan Coal two weeks to respond before the agency kicks off a public - comment period , the next step in the legal process for the EPA to overrule the corps ’ decision to grant the Spruce Mine permit .
Environmentalists have been fighting the Spruce Mine operation for more than ten years .
The proposal in 1998 for a 3,110 - acre strip mine came from Arch Coal Co. , and would have buried ten miles of stream valleys .
That permit was blocked by the district court , and the parcel of land was shifted to a non-union subsidiary , Mingo Logan Coal .

The use of this type of veto has been exceedingly rare since it was created with the Clean Water Act of 1972 .
Though 80,000 proposals are processed annually , only 12 permits in 37 years have ever been denied .
The EPA ’s decision against Spruce Mine and the Mingo Logan Coal Co. is part of the Obama administration ’s campaign to minimize environmental degradation caused by mountaintop removal practices .
UK grocery retailers and suppliers could save at least 1 billion over the next five years , just by pooling their data and ironing out inconsistencies , according to new research .
The " Data Crunch " report from supply chain standards body GS1 compared the product data held by suppliers stored on supermarket systems , finding there were inconsistencies in what should have been identical information in 80 per cent of cases .
Using IBM technology , over a million records were analysed from the four largest supermarkets in the UK - Tesco , Sainsbury 's , Asda and Morrisons - as well as product suppliers Nestle , Unilever , Proctor & Gamble and Mars .
Mike Coupe , a product director at Sainsbury 's , said that the retailer was looking at the implications of the report with a view to putting systems in place , to keep its data more accurately and more in " real - time " than it had done in the past .
" Customer demand for information will increase hugely and having a common data set which will work will make a big difference to the efficiency of the industry , " he said .
The report concluded that retailers and suppliers needed to consider adopting Global Data Synchronisation ( GDS ) techniques already in use in countries elsewhere in Europe , the US and Australia .

Pale - coated deer mice usually live on sandy soils
A tiny pale deer mouse living on a sand dune in Nebraska looks set to become an icon of biology .
Within just a few thousand years , generations of the mice have evolved a sandy - coloured coat camouflaging themselves from predators .
Most striking is that these mice acquired the mutation for pale fur naturally , then rapidly passed it on .
That makes the fast - evolving deer mouse one of the best examples yet studied of " true " natural selection in action .
Deer mice are one of the most abundant and widespread mammals in North America .
Ours is a very complete story .
We 've been able to connect changes at DNA level to the ability of deer mice to survive in nature
Dr Catherine Linnen Usually the mice have a dark coat , which enables them to blend in with dark soils and avoid being seen by predators such as owls and hawks .
But at Sand Hills in Nebraska , pale - coated mice abound .
" We decided to investigate the striking contrast between mice living on the pale Sand Hills and mice living on darker soils just a few miles outside , " says Dr Catherine Linnen of Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts , US .
" We were also intrigued by the fact that Sand Hills had formed within the last 8,000 to 15,000 years , which implies the light colour of the Sand Hills mice became advantageous only recently . "
Fair gene Linnen and colleagues at Harvard and the University of California at Berkeley have now worked out exactly how the mice evolved so quickly .
They have published the details in the journal Science .
They discovered that the light coat colour is coded by a single gene , dubbed Agouti .
This is expressed at a higher amount , and for longer , than the genes that code for dark hair .
Most animals known to quickly evolve new features do so by expressing a variation of a gene that already exists , rather than evolving a new type of gene altogether .
But the researchers found that the Agouti gene only appeared among wild deer mice in Sand Hills around 4,000 years ago , just a few thousand years after dark mice colonised their new home .
That means it first evolved 8000 generations of mice ago .
The darker , more usual coat colour
They also ascertained that this new gene has since become very common among the Sand Hills mice .
" The light gene was n't in existence , so the mice had to " wait " until a particular mutation occurred and then selection had to act on that new mutation , " says team member Professor Hopi Hoekstra , also of Harvard University .
" It 's a two part process .
First the mutation has to occur and second , selection has to increase its frequency . "
The researchers say it is the first time that it has been possible to document the appearance of a gene , its selection and subsequent spread through a population of wild animals .
And that has allowed them to estimate the " strength " of the natural selection pressure .
Having light coloured fur gives the paler Sand Hills mice a 0.5 % survival advantage .
" It does n't seem that much , but multiplied over thousands of individuals over hundreds of years , it makes a huge difference , " says Prof Hoekstra .
" Ours is a very complete story , " adds Dr Linnen .
" We 've been able to connect changes at DNA level to the ability of deer mice to survive in nature . "
Rival icon
In some respects , the dune - living deer mice are similar to the famous peppered moths of northern England .
For decades , the peppered moths ( Biston betularia ) have been heralded as one of the best - examples known of a wild animal adapting to its environment due to natural selection .
Originally , most peppered moths were lightly coloured , to blend with the lightly coloured bark of trees .
Due to widespread pollution caused by the Industrial Revolution , soot blackened the trees and newly conspicuous lightly coloured moths were picked off by predators , a selection pressure that triggered the rise of more dark coloured moths .
" In both species , changes in colour evolve rapidly due to selection by visually - hunting predators , " says Prof Hoekstra .
But the study by Dr Linnen and Prof Hoekstra 's team takes our undertaking of natural selection to a much deeper level .
The selection pressure on the moths was technically artificial , caused by pollution produced by people .
Whereas the selection causing the pale mice is truly natural .
What is more , the scientists have found the gene responsible , and worked out exactly how long it took to evolve and take hold in the population .
" Despite the fact that the peppered has been an icon of ' evolution in action ' , we do not yet know the genetic changes involved , " says Prof Hoekstra .
" Once researchers find the pigmentation gene responsible for moth colour change , they can do the same types of analyses we have done .
It will be really interesting to compare these estimates between mice and men . "

Ahead of September 's Non-Farm Payrolls report , Goldman Sachs ( GS ) is ominously lowing their numbers .
Via ZeroHedge :
Downgrading Our Sept Payroll Forecast
BOTTOM LINE :
We are changing our forecast for the September change in nonfarm payrolls to -
250,000 from - 200,000 .
We continue to think that the unemployment rate will be reported at 9.8 % .
KEY POINTS :
1 . The latest data points on the US job market have been disappointing on balance , including the Monster index of on - line hiring , the ISM employment index , consumers ’ assessments of job availability , and the total number of individuals receiving continuing claims for unemployment insurance , including those for extended benefits .
Accordingly , we now expect nonfarm payrolls to be reported at - 250,000 in tomorrow ’s labor market report for September versus a previous forecast of - 200,000 .
2 . Although many of the same indicators would suggest a larger increase in the unemployment rate than the 0.1 - point we have been expecting , the new information is not quite enough to warrant a change , especially since the 9.7 % reported for August rounded up to that level .
However , risks lie to the side of a higher figure .
User registration is currently not allowed .
Such a gloomy scenario could be resolved by incorporating epistemic games in the learning process .
These games put students in roles like journalist , engineer , or city planner , and ask them to offer their solutions to real world problems .
By including such games in the learning process , education facilities can prepare the youth for tomorrow in a detailed manner .
After gaining certificates , students can easily face any interview .
Also , they can demonstrate their problem solving capabilities in their respective fields .
As well as solving the problem of unemployment , science can help education facilities with in - depth and thorough learning that will remain in the memory of students forever .
There has been an ongoing debate –
Why is science good for humanity ?
Most of the people involved in the debate question the misuse of technology by humans .
These folks corner science citing the dangers of weapons and technology .
However , you ca n’t attribute science for any misuse or wrong - doing .
Science is a means to develop technology and techniques for the betterment of human beings .
You may remember that , in early September , we heard rumblings of Portland - based television station KATU getting into the hyperlocal blogging game .
Now , as Oregon Media Central reports , the KATU community sites are live and accessible to the public .
And while this traditional media foray into typically grassroots reporting and blogging represents an “ it ’s about time ” moment — and a move that validates what many local bloggers have been doing for years — it ’s worth taking a look at what the KATU blogs are going to be covering .
The KATU blogs closely represent the model of Portland - based Neighborhood Notes .
One which divides the beats into geographic regions of Portland .
Although KATU ’s blogs do n’t appear to get down to the neighborhood level , as of yet .
They are currently covering the following beats :
Each site carries its own blog and RSS feed , allowing readers to hone in on the specific areas that interest them .
And at this point , they ’re promoting them fairly heavily with a pop-up on the KATU site .
As an aside , I think there ’s going to be some interesting content developed here .
But I was more interested in keeping track of more of a macro level — without having to subscribe to a ton of different feeds .
So , using the magic of Yahoo !
Pipes , I crated up a bunch of the different RSS feeds into a single feed .
I thought you might like that kind of thing too .
If so , here you go .
I ’m happy to share :
Blogging beats are n’t the only concepts KATU is borrowing .
In addition to KATU created content , they ’re looking for local writers to contribute content , as well .
Likely without compensation for the writers .
Good , bad , or indifferent ?
So what ’s this mean for the local blogs — like Neighborhood Notes , OurPDX , ThePortlander , and others — who have already been covering these beats ?
And what ’s it mean to traditional publications like The Oregonian , The Portland Mercury , Willamette Week , and the Portland Tribune and its cadre of various local newspapers ?
Who knows ?
It could mean nothing .
I mean , blogging is n’t all it ’s cracked up to be .
And as anyone who has tried it knows , it ai n’t as easy as it looks .
It ’s anyone ’s guess as to whether or not these new entrants will be able to keep up the day to day grind .
Just as more importantly , it ’s hard to say — at this early juncture — whether or not they will be able to cultivate the community required to make their blogs something more than what they ’re already delivering .
Or it could mean that these small grassroots efforts are not long for this world .
Their efforts and community could be quickly subsumed , as traditional media types start encroaching on their territory .
Beating them to stories , advertising , and the ever - important reader who trusts them .
But I tend to take a more positive outlook .
I remain convinced that — first and foremost — traditional media entering the hyperlocal arena validates that the market exists .
And that ’s a good thing for everyone .
What ’s more , it creates opportunities for traditional and grassroots media to form some interesting alliances .
In some Portland metro area communities we know there are already well - established neighborhood blogs .
These are great sites and great resources .
However , just like there are many media sources and voices , we believe we can also become a go - to resource for you and your community .
And it seems like Fisher — KATU ’s parent company — may be thinking about the community efforts in a similar way .
“ We could actually help grow traffic for other neighborhood blogs by providing links and creating partnerships , ” [ Fisher Interactive manager Troy ] McGuire said .
“ Not everyone is seeing that opportunity . ”
No doubt , KATU is just the first of what will be many traditional media outlets to make the leap into the hyperlocal blogging .
But how the lumbering media giants participate in the world of blogging remains to be seen .
Whatever the case ,
It will be interesting to see how this space evolves .
Both in Portland and elsewhere .

Top Five Uses for Flash Selection Maps
With the emergence of web technologies such as Flash and Ajax for use in web development , Internet visitors have become more savvy and accustomed to interactivity on the web .
They like to see color changes and dynamic features when clicking and / or mousing over objects on a website .
The era of the static website is over .
These days interactivity is in !
Add user interaction to your website by using interactive flash maps .
Click on the Map above for a demo of the USA Flash Map
Popular items or components used for website navigation are geographic selection maps or flash maps .
Flash maps allow users to select a geographic area to click through to a relevant web page or to drill down further getting a closer or more focused view of the area .
A great example of interactive maps is Google ’s Earth .
You can zoom all the way down to street view .
Google provides an API for integration with external websites .
Integrating Google Maps in your website usually requires the help of an experience programmer with scripting and integration skills .
The cost to integrate Google Maps can become price when you consider the programming costs required .
Another option is to use a simple flash map .
For example a USA Flash Map will allow your visitor to click on a state , view details such as sales figures , sales reps , etc. and link through to a page specifically for that state .
Additionally , some USA flash maps have a built - in drill - down feature that will drill into each state with county boundaries .
Others allow you to place pinpoints or retail locations on the maps .
Most Flash Maps are built using Adobe Flash .
However , when developed do not require the expertise of know Flash and action script .
Most Flash Maps are controlled by an external text XML file or database .
This allows individuals with no expertise in Flash or Action script to customize the map for easy use in presentations and websites .
There are many great uses for Flash Maps including :
Link to Retail Locations
Flash maps are sometimes used to identify or list retail locations based on region or state .
Users can select a state or country to go to another web page or zoomed - in flash map for more detailed listings of retail locations or store fronts .
Sales Rep Maps
Flash maps can also be used to demonstrate sales representatives per region .
For example , a pop -up text window with the appropriate sales representative contact information can be displayed on mouse - over .
Distributor Maps
Flash selection maps can be used to display a list of Distributors and their information .
Distributors can be listed on a click - through page or through the use of a pop - up text box .
Educational Aide
Flash maps are a great learning tool .
Geography students of all ages can use an interactive map to learn the geography of the United States and other countries around the globe .
Real Estate Maps
Possibly one of the most common uses for interactive flash maps is in real estate websites .
Real estate agent sites and directories use flash maps on a regular basis for navigation through to show home sale listings by USA state and county .
There is no limit to the usefulness of a good flash map .
Flash maps are used across all industries for many purposes .
Should you find yourself in need of a map to help users navigate a website , consider using a flash map .
With the options and ease of customization available , flash maps are great way to add interactivity and easy navigation to your site .
The top commanding officer in Afghanistan has revealed a belief that “ rampant government corruption ” has given the Taliban and al - Qaeda an edge in the war .
The conclusion came in a recent secret document put together by Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal , U.S. officials told the Associated Press .
Though the document requests more troops , it warns that more troops may not prevent the Taliban from taking back Afghanistan .
ADVERTISEMENT
Corruption in Afghanistan became public knowledge after the presidential election in Afghanistan was revealed as rigged by independent election observers .
Fraud investigations discovered that 1.1 million ‘ questionable votes ’ were given to President Hamid Karzai , and that the subtraction of these votes was enough to push Karzai below 50 percent .
Though McChrystal states that fewer troops will bring less risks , he believes that any new deployment has a high risk of failure .
The report outlines three deployment options , the largest hypothetical deployment being one of 80,000 new soldiers .
There are now 67,000 American troops in Afghanistan , with 1,000 more coming in December .
McChrystal prefers the ‘ compromise ’ option of a 40,000 troop increase .
One U.S. military official alluded to talks with the Obama administration over whether or not it is possible to ‘ surge ’ enough troops into the country to stop crucial corruption .
Officials spoke on condition of anonymity with the Associated Press because they were not authorized to discuss publicly .
President Obama announced today that he would decide on a war strategy and a fixed number of troops “ in the coming weeks . ”
His focus is on “ making sure we ’re doing a good job in building capacity on the civilian side . ”

The UN - sponsored Electoral Complaints Commission in Afghanistan has determined that after fraudulent ballots are thrown out , incumbent Hamid Karzai received less than 50 % of the vote , forcing him into a runoff with challenger Abdullah Abdullah .
Karzai is now expected to accept on Tuesday that he must face a second round of elections , though over the weekend he was making noises about standing firm and refusing to accept the ECC verdict .
This intransigence probably in itself delayed President Barack Obama ’s decision on whether to send more troops to Afghanistan , since he could hardly decently do so to support a corrupt and discredited government that stole the election no less surely than had Ahmadinejad in Iran .
Update Karzai just formally acquiesced in the runoff , which has been set for November 7 .
CBS reports this morning on the pressure applied to Karzai by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. John Kerry .
ITV reports on the downside of having a runoff election in Afghanistan , including the potential for violence .
When the runoff is held this fall , it will exclude many Afghans who live in snowy places or high altitudes , since winter is arriving in some of the country .
There is also danger of Pashtun - Tajik violence , since the two ethnic groups are backing different candidates .
Aljazeera English has video on the ECC decision and its tussle with the local , Karzai appointed electoral commission .
On Iranian official television , outspoken MP George Galloway debates Dr Michael Williams , an Afghanistan expert at Royal Holloway College who has advised President Obama .
Galloway argues that people are dying like flies in Afghanistan and that hopes for “ developing ” the country by military might are ‘ doomed . ’
End / ( Not Continued )
Most people hope they ’ll die by passing in their sleep , in a peaceful setting , or maybe surrounded by loved ones .
But for the victims of these 15 executions , that could n’t be further from reality .
Whether it ’s being set on fire inside of a tire or having your limbs slowly cut off , these deaths are sure to make you cringe .
I ’d say “ enjoy ” , but that would be a little weird .
Instead , let ’s just say , try not to yak on your keyboard !
15 . Buried Alive
Being buried alive starts out our list of executions .
Dating back to times B.C. , this punishment has been used for individuals as well as groups .
The victim is usually tied up and then placed in a hole and buried .
One of the most recent and disturbing uses of this form of execution was the Nanjing Massacre during World War II , when Japanese soldiers buried groups of Chinese civilians alive in what was referred to as the “ Ten Thousand Corpse Ditch ” .
14 . Snake Pit
One of the oldest forms of torture and execution , snake pits were a very common form of capital punishment .
Convicts were cast into a deep pit with venomous snakes , dying after the irritated and poorly fed snakes attacked them .
Several famous leaders have been said to die this way , including Ragnar Lodbrok , the Viking warlord , and Gunnar the king of Burgundy .
Some variation on the traditional snake pit is being thrown into a small pool of water containing water snakes .
13 . The Spanish Tickler
This torture device was commonly used in Europe during the Middle Ages .
Used to tear open the victim ’s skin , this weapon could rip through anything , including muscle and bone .
The victim was tied up naked , sometimes in public , and then the torturers begin mutilating them .
Usually starting on the limbs and working inward , the neck and face were always saved for last .
12 . Slow Slicing
Ling Chi , translated as “ slow slicing ” or “ the lingering death ” was described as the death by a thousand cuts .
Practiced from 900 AD to 1905 , this form of torture and execution is similar to The Five Pains , but drawn out over a much longer period of time .
The torturer slowly cuts and removes several body parts , extending the victims life and torture as long as possible .
According to Confucian principle , a body that is cut into pieces cannot be whole in the spiritual afterlife , making the form of execution one that still tortures the victim in the afterlife .
11 . Burning at the Stake
Death by burning has been used as a form of capital punishment for centuries , often associated with crimes such as treason and witchcraft .
Today it is considered cruel and unusual punishment , but before the 18th century , being burned on the stake was common practice .
The victim is tied to a large stake , frequently in the center of town or anywhere with onlookers and then lit on fire .
It is considered one of the slowest ways to die .
10 . Necklacing
Commonly practiced in South Africa , Necklacing is unfortunately still quite common today .
Necklacing consists of a rubber tire , filled with gasoline , being forced around the victim ’s chest and arms , and then being set on fire .
Necklacing essentially causes the body to be turned into a melted mess , which is why it comes in at number 10 on our list .
9. Execution by Elephant
In South and Southeast Asia , the Elephant has been a method of capital punishment for thousands of years .
The animals were trained to execute two ways .
Slowly , in a prolonged manner , dismembering and torturing or by Crushing , which killed the victim nearly instantly .
Usually employed by royalty , these elephant assassins only heightened the fear of royalty to the common people , proving that they even had the ability to control wild animals .
The concept was eventually adopted and finessed by the Roman military to deal with deserting soldiers .
8. The Five Pains
This form of Chinese capital punishment is a relatively easy concept to grasp .
It starts with the victims nose being cut off , then one hand and one foot , and finally , the victim is castrated and cut in half across the waist .
Inventor of this punishment Li Si , a Chinese Prime Minister , was eventually tortured and then executed this way .
7. Colombian Necktie
This method of execution is one of the goriest .
The victim ’s throat is slashed , often with a knife but really any sharp object would do , and then their tongue is pulled out through the open wound .
During La Violencia , a Colombian period of history fraught with killing , this was the most common form of execution .
It is used mainly to intimidate others who encounter the body after the fact .
6. Hanged , Drawn , and Quartered
The penalty for high treason in England , to be hanged , drawn and quartered was a common occurrence during medieval times .
Although it was abolished in 1814 , this form of execution was responsible for hundreds , perhaps even thousands , of deaths .
The process was as follows .
First , the victim is dragged on a wooden frame , called a hurdle , to the place of the execution .
Second , the victim is hanged by the neck for a short period of time until nearly dead ( hanged ) .
Third , the disembowelment and castration occur , where afterward , the entrails and genitalia are burned in front of the victim ( drawn ) .
Finally , the body is divided into four separate parts and beheaded ( quartered ) .
5. Cement shoes
Introduced by the American Mafia , this method of execution involves placing the victim ’s feet inside of cinder blocks and then filling them with wet cement and then throwing him or her into the water .
This form of execution is still practiced today , and even created the term “ someone who sleeps with the fishes ” as a euphemism for the dead .
4. Guillotine
The guillotine is one of the most notorious forms of execution .
Made up of a razor sharp blade attached to a rope , the victims head was placed in the middle of the frame and then the blade dropped with efficiency , causing the person to be decapitated almost instantly .
The guillotine is a seemingly humane method of execution until you consider that people potentially are still alive for a few moments following the act .
Crowds have reported that people who had been guillotined would blink their eyes or mouth words shortly after their heads had been cut off .
Experts theorized that the swiftness of the blade had little impact on the brain , and did n’t cause loss of consciousness .
One doctor even reported witnessing a man ’s execution , and when he called the prisoner ’s name after his head was detached , the prisoner made eye contact with him , even focusing his pupils .
It must be pretty weird to know that your head is no longer attached to your body !
3. Republican Marriage
The Republican Marriage might not be the most gruesome death on this list , but it is certainly one of the most interesting .
Originating in France , this form of execution was common in Revolutionary France .
It involved tying together two naked people , a male and female usually of a similar age , and drowning them .
In some cases , usually where water was n’t available , the couple would be run through with a sword .
2. Crucifixion
This ancient method of execution is one of the most well known methods , obviously mainly due to the execution of Jesus Christ .
Crucifixion consists of the victims hands and feet being nailed into a wooden cross and then being hoisted into the air .
The victim is then left to hang there until death , which usually took days , and often meant dying of thirst before anything else .
1. The Brazen Bull
The Brazen Bull , sometimes known as the Sicilian Bull is one of the cruelest methods of torture and execution out there .
Designed in ancient Greece , solid brass was cast into the shape of a hollow bull , with a door on the side that opened and latched .
To begin the execution , the victim was placed inside of the brass bull and a fire was set underneath .
The fire was heated until the metal was literally yellow , causing the victim to “ roast to death ” .
Yum .
The bull was designed so that the screams of the victim would come out sounding musical for the enjoyment of the executioner .
Naturally enough , the inventor of this form of punishment ended up being executed inside of the Bull , which was all too predictable .
You live by the horns , you die by the horns .
While this is a tough list to rank , we feel comfortable putting The Brazen Bull in the top spot .
The Department of Homeland Security 's Privacy Office has approved the controversial searches , copying and retention of laptops , PDAs , and other digital devices without cause at U.S. borders .
Travelers could soon start seeing notices from the Privacy Office , which last week released a report supporting the right of customs agents to conduct such searches .
The 51 - page Privacy Impact Assessment also supported the right of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to copy , download , retain or seize any content from these devices , or the devices themselves , without assigning any specific reason for doing so .
Also , while in many cases searches would be done with the knowledge of the traveler in some situations , the report says , " it is not practicable for law enforcement reasons to inform the traveler that his electronic device has been searched . "
In arriving at the assessment , the Privacy Office argued that such searches of electronic devices were really no different from searches of briefcases and backpacks .
They are needed to interdict and investigate violations of federal law at U.S. borders and have been supported by courts in the past , the assessment said .
That conclusion is sure to rile privacy and civil rights advocates , who have been vehemently protesting such border searches for about two years .
They have argued that searches of electronic devices without any reasonable cause are very different from similar searches of backpacks and other items by customs agents , because unlike with briefcases and packs , electronic devices are capable of storing far more data , including personal and business data some that could be highly personal or protected .
The Association of Corporate Travel Executives and other groups have warned of potential security breaches when corporate data contained in a laptop or PDA is downloaded by a customs agent as part of a border search .
Similar concerns have been raised about data involving client and lawyer privileges , intellectual property , and other sensitive information .
Last week , the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the DHS after an attempt to get information on such searches from the DHS had failed to elicit a response from the agency .
In it , the ACLU asked DHS to disclose details on the criteria it uses for selecting passengers for such searches , and the number of such searches it has carried out so far .
The ACLU suit also sought information on the number of devices and documents that have been retained by the DHS following such searches and the reasons for their retention .
A similar suit was filed last year by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Asian Law Caucus .
In its analysis , the Privacy Office noted some of the privacy concerns that have been expressed over its border searches .
The report conceded that a person who would not mind a briefcase being inspected by a customs agent might feel that a laptop search " increases the possibility of privacy risks due to the vast amount of information potentially available on electronic devices . "
Nevertheless , making such devices exempt from customs inspection would create a dangerous loophole " for those seeking to break the law , the report said .
A traveler 's claim of privilege or statement that something is personal or business related , " does not preclude the search , " the report said .
It pointed to a process that needs to be followed when customs and immigration agents conducted such searches and the notice that needs to be provided to travelers whose devices may be retained or seized .
The report also highlighted the measures currently in place for sharing data with other federal agencies , and ensuring that any data that is copied and retained is properly protected -- including via encryption where needed and " storing in locked containers . "
It mentions a process for destroying any data that is not needed within a maximum of 21 days from when it was collected .
Lillie Coney , associated director with the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC ) , said that the Privacy Office ;s support for " very general , non-specific " searches of electronic devices was troubling .
" They are every vague on intent , or any rational cause why people might be pulled [ for such searches , ] " she said .
" They do n't talk about data retention or about restricting access to the purpose for which they information is collected . "
She also said such searches within U.S. borders would be considered unconstitutional and in violation of privacy rights .
What the DHS is saying is , " because you happen to go through a border your citizenship rights magical disappear to fo into a state where it doesnt exist , " Coney said .
" That 's a big problem . "
Clue fans bored with Colonel Mustard with the lead pipe can now move beyond the mansion with CLUE : Secrets & Spies , an international espionage edition of the classic detective game .
The mission here is not impossible and the new Clue comes with a new real - time tech twist : Hasbro says it is the first board game in the company ’s history to use cellphone text - messaging in gameplay .
Agent Mustard , Agent Scarlet and the rest of the colorful Clue characters are now on assignment to thwart C.L.U.E. ( Criminal League for Ultimate Espionage ) and take down the evil Agent Black .
At the beginning of the game , players check in at Hasbro headquarters via text from their own cellphones .
As the game proceeds , Hasbro sends six text messages back to move the action along .
An ultraviolet decoder , included with the game ’s activity cards and other pieces , also reveals information .
CLUE : Secrets & Spies sells for $ 25 at www.hasbro.com/clue.
The text - messaging element is optional and Hasbro is committed to supporting it through December 2011 .
The cost of the text - messages are n’t included — which could be a clue itself as to why the phone bill is so high for enthusiastic players without unlimited text - message plans .
Clarke Carlisle turned 30 on Wednesday and the dates tattooed on his forearms – his wedding day and young son's birthday – reveal that he is in what the psychologists like to call a " good place " now .
Here is a footballer with a sense of perspective , who admits that he sometimes reads more than is good for him : he 's nailed every one of the Jack Reacher detective novels by Lee Child and a fair few by David Baldacci .
" I go through phases with a writer , " he says .
" It 's indicative of a person with an addictive personality . "
He throws out this piece of self - analysis nonchalantly but it resonates through the silence of the trophy room at Turf Moor , where Carlisle is talking ahead of the sound and the fury of tomorrow 's Blackburn / Burnley clash , a local derby which makes the Buenos Aires superclasico and Manchester equivalents seem like a picnic .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Carlisle might be one of the most reflective and erudite players in the game – absorbed by the emergence of Barack Obama ; contemplating a PGCE and career in teaching when his playing days are over – but addiction almost took away everything from him .
The story of his alcoholism – curled up and hungover on the way to Colchester in his QPR days , manager Ian Holloway ordering him off the coach and the defender reaching his Damascene moment 24 hours later when propping up a bar awaiting his side 's result on the BBC videprinter – is one to inspire any other player seeking redemption .
In the end , the Sporting Chance clinic saw him through .
" It 's a period of deep reflection and you 're digging all the dirt inside , " Carlisle says of his journey out of the darkness .
" When you 're at that point , there 's a lot of dirt . "
Carlisle can see so much more clearly now that everyone wants a piece of his inner clarity .
His appearance on Match of the Day 2 earlier this month was effortlessly impressive and a TV studio place looks like his for the taking .
( He will embark later this year on the postgraduate course in broadcasting run for players by the former Sheffield Wednesday full - back Lawrie Madden at Staffordshire University . )
He has also taken up an ambassadorial role for Kick it Out , football 's equality and inclusion campaign which begins its " One Game , One Community " weeks of action this weekend .
Carlisle 's struggles with racism pale in comparison with the obstacles the last decade has thrown his way , which include a shattered knee playing for QPR that left surgeons uncertain whether he would walk again .
What racial abuse there has been , he has blanked out .
" It 's the odd shout here and there which you can hardly make out , " Carlisle says .
But memories of the way his own family ostracised his father , Mervin , and mother , Rose , for the mixed - race marriage they embarked on as teenagers a generation ago lives with him .
" Our parents did well to shelter us from it and whenever we did do family things they were always happy , smiley , " he says .
" I 'm not sure if that was just to keep the kids happy .
It might sound a bit mushy but my biggest influence was my father .
He stuck true to his beliefs .
He loved my mum and he stood against both families .
He and mum were a veritable Romeo and Juliet back in that time . "
The world has certainly turned since the days when Mervin Carlisle braved the bigotry to play semi professionally for Southport and Morecambe and then in the local Preston and District League .
Those Carlisle wants to reach as an ambassador this weekend are young black players , not the few remaining white bigots .
" Rather than taking up a battle , we need to lift the thoughts and ambition of young black players and make them believe they can achieve things .
It 's a different perspective but a more positive one . "
The kind of philosophy which makes you wonder how on earth Carlisle could have fallen so far , once he had disregarded the quiet insistence of his headmistress at Balshaw 's School in Leyland , Lancashire , that his mathematics made him Oxbridge material and embarked on a career in football .
The prospects seemed auspicious for a time , when Gerry Francis whisked Carlisle from Blackpool to QPR after glowing scouting reports from Iain Dowie and the defender found himself playing for England Under - 21s alongside John Terry , Alan Smith , Paul Robinson and Ashley Cole .
It was when he sustained an injury in a game against Fulham that a different fate began to grip him .
The lay - off took Carlisle into several of his addictions , some of which were less damaging than others .
One was Channel 4's Countdown and he still remembers his audition for a place on the show .
He reported to the Travelodge at Euston station and , with all due modesty , was convinced that his mathematics – the strongest of his 10 A - grade GCSEs – would see him pass muster .
" I just choked , " he says , grinning at the memory now .
" What really hurt me the most was that the numbers were my forte and I did n't get one numbers one right .
[ Then in the word puzzles ] I was thinking ' there is a big word here ' rather than building up logically .
I looked for the big one and failed miserably . "
The going was n't quite so tough on the Britain 's Brainiest Footballer show , which his agent showed him a flyer for .
" I wanted to answer on maths but they could n't come up with decent mathematical questions for the format , " Carlisle says .
" So they asked me ' what else would you want ? '
I thought human biology .
I 'd been in the treatment room for long enough and I did all right at GCSE . "
He beat such cerebral talents as Alan Brazil and Malcolm MacDonald to the title but has never taken that achievement terribly seriously .
" The best bit was when I went to sit with the QPR fans at Northampton and they started singing ' Carlisle is a genius ' to the tune of ' Go West ' .
That was such a brilliant moment . "
The same can't be said of the way that drink began to grip him at that time .
Even now , Carlisle can't share all of the reasons why he , from a solid , aspirational , God-fearing background , the son of a Christian youth worker who counselled on drug and drink addictions , got into drink but he soon found his relationship with his daughter , Francesca , suffering along with his football .
" There was a multitude of reasons , which all accumulated – a lot of them personal , a lot of them incidental , " he says .
" A sequence of bad positions got me into it and I can't even remember all of them .
I do n't know if I 've just got a bad memory but my long - term recall is unbelievably bad .
My wife and I talk about this all the time . "
Holloway was an important part of his redemption , guiding Carlisle into the hands of the Sporting Chance clinic , founded by Tony Adams , where he stayed for four weeks .
" A number of managers could have said ' right , that 's it ' and you 'd have been on your bike , out of the door .
It was Olly I put my trust in , " he says .
So too , his wife , Gemma , whom he first met shortly before going into the clinic .
" I wrote to her a couple of times when I was in there .
When I came out I was supposed to stay single for a year but that did n't happen !
We 've come through the other side . "
Eventually , Carlisle returned to Holloway 's side but the north always called .
He moved to Leeds United to be nearer Francesca , who was living with her mother in Preston , and after two seasons with Watford there was a £ 250,000 move to Burnley .
He and his wife became practising Christians during his Watford spell and are currently searching for a church near their new family home in Ripponden .
Their son , Marley , is nearly two .
Carlisle understands more about himself now .
" Being intelligent or literate makes no difference if you are unfulfilled deep down , " he says .
" I 'm able to identify my traits for what they are and to be open about them .
Sometimes I tell my wife things she really does n't need to know but she understands that I trust her most . "
Salvation has also brought opportunities he dared not even wish for .
It seemed his only Premier League experience would be the few games he played for Watford when they were already relegated in 2007 , yet his performance in Burnley 's 1 - 0 defeat of Manchester United at Turf Moor was a defining one .
The memory of the occasion excites him , but no more so than that of watching Obama 's presidential election victory eight months earlier .
" My grandfather came over on the boats from the Dominican Republic , " he reflects on this .
" He would never have thought to see a black or mixed - race leader of the free world . "
The player 's talk of writers is just as animated , too .
Those Jack Reacher novels were something special – " I do love that rogue figure who has the talents which are not apparent to the naked eye " – but the title of one of his favourite Baldaccis seems far more significant .
It is Total Control , a quality Carlisle is finally regaining in his life .
Lancashire hot pots : Derbies that have boiled over
Few football rivalries inspire as much animosity , ill will and tension as that between Blackburn Rovers and Burnley .
The clubs first met in 1888 and the east Lancashire derby has , in recent times , been marred by violence and vandalism .
* April 1983 : Second Division
Blackburn 2 Burnley 1
At the height of hooliganism in English football , this league match at Ewood Park boiled over .
Visiting Burnley supporters caused the game to be halted for 15 minutes as they tore down the terracing and set fire to a roof at the Darwen end .
There were 33 arrests and 18 injuries .
The Clarets went on to be relegated at the end of the season .
* December 2000 : First Division
Burnley 0 Blackburn 2
A home defeat led Burnley supporters to embark on a destructive rampage .
Blackburn fans were held inside the ground for more than an hour after the end of the match for their own safety as Burnley fans tore through their own town centre , looting and damaging shops , resulting in 20 people being arrested .
* April 2001 : First Division
Blackburn 5 Burnley 0
Following the troubles in the reverse fixture earlier in the season , Lancashire police described the security operation around this tie as the biggest Lancashire had seen in recent football history .
It turned out to be a necessary precaution , as 39 fans were arrested following disturbances .
Rovers ' win helped them finish second and gain promotion into the Premiership , while Burnley finished two points off the play - offs .
* February 2005 : FA Cup fifth round
Burnley 0 Blackburn 0
A fractious clash ended without score but not without incident .
More than 400 police officers had been drafted in to help deal with the tensions .
Blackburn 's ever - popular Welshman Robbie Savage and defender Lucas Neill were confronted by a Burnley supporter who invaded the pitch .
In addition , 40 people were arrested for public order offences after the game .
Blackburn went on to win the replay .
* It is also rumoured that in 1994 Burnley considered twinning the town with Trelleborgs in Sweden .
The town 's team of part - timers had surprisingly knocked Kenny Dalglish 's Blackburn out of the Uefa Cup , in a season when they went on to win the Premier League .

Republicans had their Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska , and now Democrats seem intent on wrapping themselves firmly around Congressman Jack Murtha 's Airport for No One in Johnstown , Pennsylvania .
So much for changing the culture of spending in Washington .
Last week 53 Senators — including 51 Democrats — voted down an amendment by Republican Jim DeMint of South Carolina to stop spending federal funds on the airport that Mr. Murtha built with more than $ 150 million in federal subsidies and earmarks over the last ...
Jennifer Strange , a mother of three from suburban Rancho Cordova , died of apparent water intoxication hours after a failed attempt to win a Nintendo Wii video game system for her children in a promotion dubbed " Hold Your Wee for a Wii . "
The Sacramento County Superior Court jury concluded that Entercom Sacramento , which operates KDND - FM ( 107.9 ) " The End , " was negligent after ignoring several warnings that a morning show contest could have fatal consequences , according to KTXL - TV ( Channel 40 ) in Sacramento .
A tape of the program , known as the " Morning Rave " on KDND , revealed that the potential fatal effects of drinking too much water were raised during the course of the contest , with one on - air host mentioning the 2005 death of a college student during a hazing ritual in Chico .
A listener also called in to advise against the stunt .
Strange — one of 20 contestants — initially joked lightheartedly with the show hosts as she and the others chugged bottled water .
But as the hours wore on , it came down to Strange and one other woman contending for the grand prize , and she admitted to having a splitting headache and feeling wobbly .
Strange quipped on the air that " it looks like I 'm pregnant again . "
After finishing in second place , Strange rushed with contest winner Lucy Davidson to the station 's bathroom to vomit .
Strange called her employer to say she was too sick to come in and headed home .
Her mother discovered her body that afternoon .
[ Updated at 5:31 p.m. : Charles Sipkins , a spokesman for Entercom , said in a statement : “ Jennifer Strange ’s death was a tragedy .
Our hearts go out to all of her loved ones , including , in particular , her husband and children .
While legal restrictions preclude us from commenting further on the verdict , we respect the jury ’s decision and hope that it will assist the Strange family in coping with its loss . ” ]

Water transport European Union targets worldwide emissions limits on ships , airlines
United Nations talks in Copenhagen in December should demand that airlines cut emissions to 10 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and that shipping companies cut by 20 percent , ministers decided at a meeting in Luxembourg , according to EU diplomats .
The cuts should be put into action " globally in a manner that ensures a level playing - field " , according to a draft agreement organized for the ministers ' meeting by the Swedish government , current holder of the EU 's rotating presidency .
Ahead of the talks , diplomats said that the question of airline and shipping cuts was one of the most disruptive on the table .
Some member states argued that the EU should not commit itself to any emissions limits before other major economies have the same opinion .
The Swedish compromise stressed out that the targets of 10 and 20 percent should only be read as covering " negotiating purposes " in Copenhagen , not as an EU assurance to bring in such limits unilaterally .

Who lives in a house like this ?
James
May to stay in the world 's first house made entirely from Lego
While the outlook remains gloomy for much of Britain 's property market , here 's a house that should brighten things up .
James May 's colourful Lego home , complete with a fully plumbed Lego loo , bath and giant bed , is finally taking shape .
If building work goes to plan , it will be the world 's first full - size house made entirely from Lego - and the Top Gear presenter has promised to live in it .
Building blocks : James
May 's house of Lego , in the grounds of Denbies Wine Estate in Dorking , Surrey , should be finished in a few days ' time
The house , which started being built on the Denbies Wine Estate in Dorking , Surrey on August 1 , is due to be completed at the end of this week .
The TV presenter said : ' I 'm planning to stay there for two or three days , or until it falls down - whichever is sooner .
I 'm pretty relaxed about it , but will just have to be careful moving around .
' If I wake up buried under a pile of bricks , I 'll know it 's gone wrong . '
Through the keyhole :
The Top Gear presenter tries out a Lego window for size at the start of the project back in early August
Speaking from the vineyard , Mr May said : ' The idea first came up over a beer , when we were talking about what we would have built as kids if we had enough Lego .
' Your imagination is always bigger than your stockpile when you 're a kid .
' Up until now , the largest thing I 've ever built with Lego was probably a plane or a battleship , because that was all I could build with the amount I had . '
Safe as houses : Security man Charles Zierik helps build the world 's first home made entirely from Lego
Members of the public have been involved in the initial stages of building work and professional builders are now taking over , laying the bricks during a six - day construction process .
Over two million Lego bricks have been used so far .
The Lego house is being built as part of a new BBC series called James May 's Toy Stories in which the TV presenter takes Britain 's best - loved toys and uses them in new adventures .
Plastic fantastic :
The house will be filled with furniture made from Lego bricks including a toilet , bath and bed
May said : ' For too long now we have regarded the great toys as mere playthings .
' It 's time to use them to bring people together and achieve greatness .
And I bet it 'll be a right laugh as well .'
A rec ent attempt to build the world 's longest model railway stretching 10 miles from Barnstaple to Bideford , North Devon was thwarted amid claims th at vandals and thieves tampered with the track .
The presenter won an award for a Plasticine garden he created at the Chelsea Flower Show for an earlier show .
Turning website favicons in to 3D
The feedback I recieved from Reddit about locidesktop.com ( my hobby project ) was encouraging .
If you would like to join the beta program for locidesktop , please leave a comment below …
One of the comments pointed out that although there is a large choice of icons available , there is n't always a clear recognizable image for each site , and it would be nice if locidesktop would use ‘ favicons ’ .
I had considered using favicons previously , but rejected the idea because they are just 16x16 pixels in size , and I wanted to use large images for icons .
I did n't want blurry scaled icons either , and I may have abandoned the idea if a Reddit user had n't pointed me at this which recommended embracing the pixelated look of favicons for use at desktop icons .
I figured I could take this idea a step further and render 3D images from any given 16x16 image , using a combination of Python , Mako templates and Povray – the same combination of technologies I used for my ( now defunct ) 3D pie chart project .
I knocked up the scripts to pass the time on a long train journey recently .
The results were encouraging !
The image insert shows a few of the icons I generate with the first pass at this .
Some turn out better than others , but they would all work as recognizable icons .
The Code
The code is not too complex , and consists of a single Python script that uses Python Image Library to read an image and scan each pixel .
The results of the image scanning process are then passed to a Mako template , which produces a Povray scene file .
#!/usr/bin/env python import Image from math import * class Col ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , r , g , b , a = 1.0 ) : self .
r = r self .

Povray scene files are kind of like a half - way point between data and a programming language ; there are variables and expressions and some control structures , but when you combine them with a templating system , like Mako , it creates a remarkably flexible system where 3D images can be programatically generated .
The favicon template loops through the scanned image data passed to it by the script .
This data contains the location and colour of each visible pixel , which the template uses to generate a coloured cubiod in the scene , per pixel .
These cuboids combine to create a three dimensional version of the original icon image .

Felipe Massa says he is not ruling out returning to Formula 1 racing in the final grand prix of the season in Abu Dhabi .
The Brazilian returned to Ferrari's Maranello factory yesterday and began working on a technical programme as well as on his physical form .
He is expected to work with the simulator and then test a two - year - old F2007 with GP2 tyres later this month .
Speaking to Gazzetta dello Sport , the Ferrari driver said it would not be possible to return for his home race next week , but is not ruling out racing in the final event of the season .
" It would be too close to the limit , " Massa said of returning in Brazil .
" We 'll see for Abu Dhabi , we 'll need the FIA 's authorization .
It depends on this test [ with the F2007 ] . "
He added : " I perfectly remember how to drive .
My worry is n't to immediately get a good laptime , but just to run again .
In any case you need a good car and a good set - up . "
The Brazilian , out of action since his accident at the Hungarian Grand Prix , admitted he felt lucky to have walked away from it .
" The damage could have been very serious and , considering the way I feel now , I have no doubt : I was very lucky .
I 've often seen again the crash on TV and also myself with the injured eye immediately after .
It 's shocking , but I was asleep and could n't feel anything . "
Massa also welcomed Ferrari 's decision to hire Fernando Alonso as his team - mate for 2010 .
" He 's a really good driver .
We 'll be a good pairing and I hope to finish in front of him ! "
Left , right or center , there ’s two things nearly everybody in Hollywood agrees on :
There ’s no disease that ca n’t be cured by raising enough money and the state of Israel deserves unabashed support .
These days , sympathy for Israel puts the American entertainment industry at odds with much of the European film and academic communities .
In those circles , vehement criticism of Israeli policies toward the Palestinians and boycotts of Israeli scholars and artists have become almost fashionable .
( In cinematic London , Hamas militants are the new baby seals . )
Hollywood has mostly shrugged all this off , until this week , when it decided that an outbreak of anti-Israeli agitation in Toronto was bringing things a little too close to home .
Canadian documentary filmmaker John Greyson pulled his latest movie from this week ’s Toronto International Film Festival because he said the event ’s sister - city relationship with Tel Aviv was an implicit endorsement of “ the smiling face of Israeli apartheid . ”
A variety of entertainers -- including David Byrne , Julie Christie , Ken Loach , Jane Fonda , Viggo Mortensen and Wallace Shawn -- published a letter alleging that Toronto had become an agent of the “ Israeli propaganda machine . ”

Some people in Hollywood took these initiatives not as a disagreement with Israeli government policies but as an attempt to isolate and ostracize the Jewish state ’s vibrant , diverse and independent film community .
( If there really is a dirty word in Hollywood , it ’s “ blacklist . ” )
So former CAA agent Dan Adler , acting under the sponsorship of Los Angeles ’ Jewish Federation and United Jewish Appeal of Toronto , put together a counter ad that denounced the boycott demands in Thursday ’s trades .
“ We all spent a lot of time talking about the original protest letter , in the sense that it seemed to be going after the wrong target by attacking Israel and its film artists , ” Adler told The Times ’ Patrick Goldstein on Wednesday night .
“ When I sat down at my computer and started asking for people to sign on , all I got was passion and enthusiasm .
Everyone said , ‘ I ’m in , ’ and then , even better , added , ‘ Can I get you someone else ? ’ ”
The signatories do read like a who ’s who of Hollywood ’s elite with a cast that runs from the executive suites to the sound stages and cuts across generations .
Among those who signed on are Jerry Seinfeld , Seth Rogen , Robert Duvall , Halle Berry , Sacha Baron Cohen , Lisa Kudrow , Lenny Kravitz , Ed Zwick , Jason Alexander , Chazz Palminteri and David Cronenberg , as well as A - list producers and executives Ron Meyer , Jeffrey Katzenberg , Sherry Lansing , Neal Moritz , Jonathan Glickman , Nina Jacobson , Darren Star , Nathan Kahane and Gail Berman .

( There ’s even a precedent - setting credit for writer - director Michael Tolkin , who “ polished ” the ad ’s text .
Now , there ’s something the Writers Guild would like to see catch on . )
In a phone interview , former Paramount head Lansing said she and her husband , director William Friedkin , were upset that the Israeli filmmakers had been singled out for retribution , especially as the community starts the Jewish new year and High Holy Days .
“ These are independent filmmakers who are not working as the propaganda machine of the state of Israel , ” Lansing said .
“ It ’s dangerous to -- in any way -- turn the film festival into a political event .
We do not want to return to the days of blacklisting . ”
Media mogul Haim Saban was blunt in his assessment .
“ The world always had anti-Semites , ” he said in an e-mail exchange .
“ It has now and always will , but the people of Israel always have , and always will live and prosper .
Sorry Jew haters .
You lose . ”

The criticisms of Israel , especially among European entertainers , has intensified since the Gaza war .
However , they argue that they are not against the Jews , as Saban suggests , but merely concerned about the innocent victims caught in the crossfire .
In January , singer Annie Lennox and comedian Alexei Sayle called for an end to the “ slaughter and systematic murder ” of Arabs in Gaza .
The pair was joined by a panel of public figures , which included Ken Livingstone , Bianca Jagger and George Galloway , in a news conference demanding that Israel stop its “ siege . ”
In posts on her blog and in the Huffington Post , Fonda -- who said she initially signed the Toronto letter because she too was concerned about the loss of innocent lives -- sought to clarify her position .
She admitted that she had not read the full text of the complaint before putting her name on it .
Advertisement
“ It was the outcry that ensued that caused me to study it more carefully , ” she said .
“ It was then that I saw that there were parts of it that I did not agree with .
. . . ”
She went on : “ Some of the words in the protest letter did not come from my heart , words that are unnecessarily inflammatory :
The simplistic depiction of Tel Aviv as a city ‘ built on destroyed Palestinian villages , ’ for instance , and the omission of any mention of Hamas ’ 8 - month - long rocket and mortar attacks on the town of Sderot and the western Negev to which Israel was responding when it launched its war on Gaza . ”
Fonda added : “ By neglecting to do this the letter allowed good people to close their ears and their hearts . ”
It ’s hard to believe that even Fonda ’s well - practiced backpedaling is going to temper the outrage in activist Hollywood , where attacks on Israel in almost any form are a non-starter .

A couple who sold their historic farmhouse to meet the costs of an 18 - year battle against an ancient law making them liable for repairs to a nearby church labelled the Church of England 's handling of the situation " disgraceful " .
Andrew and Gail Wallbank expressed relief after Glebe Farm in Aston Cantlow , Warwickshire , fetched £ 850,000 at last night 's auction , but will now have to foot bills totalling up to £ 600,000 stemming from their unsuccessful fight against the archaic covenant .
The Wallbanks have been told they must pay around £ 230,000 to repair the crumbling chancel of Aston Cantlow 's 13th century church and also face a legal bill of around £ 250,000 .
Speaking after they had seen the Grade II - listed Glebe Farmhouse go under the hammer at an eight - minute sale in Henley - in - Arden , the couple accused the Church of England of acting disgracefully during its efforts to force them to pay for the repairs .
Mr Wallbank said he had no regrets about battling against the obscure law , which rendered him legally responsible for repairs to the church when he inherited Glebe Farm in the 1980s .
The 69 - year - old , from Carno , Powys , said : " I felt what they were doing was so wrong that we had to take a stand against it .
" It was quite disgraceful the way the whole thing was handled - why they could n't have agreed to let us buy ourselves out ( of the covenant ) before I just do n't know . "
His wife , aged 62 , also criticised the church authorities for attempting to make them pay for the repairs and then defending their actions in the courts .
" It 's completely against Christian principles , " she said .
" As the auction was going on , I was thinking ' you are giving the church our house ' . "
The covenant , thought to date back at least to the reign of Henry VIII , was challenged by the Wallbanks on the grounds that it breached their human rights .
Aston Cantlow 's Church of St John the Baptist stands on an ancient Saxon site and is thought to be where William Shakespeare 's parents were married .
The earliest part of the present structure is the chancel , which dates back to the late 13th century and has been in need of repair since at least 1990 .

A team of a dozen lobbyists registered for the account and is working on the country ’s ascension to the World Trade Organization , removing a number of trade restrictions put in place by the United States and improving its image .
Nixon said that the impression of Kazakhstan created by British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen , who exploited ignorance of the little - known nation , was false .
“ Part of our job will be to change that perception , ” he said .
“ It has a rich history , a deep culture and is a key economic ally of the United States , ” Nixon said .
According to the contract , Policy Impact lobbyists hope to achieve several objectives for Kazakhstan in Washington over the next year .
For example , they will advocate for legislation that will repeal trade restrictions and will extend normal trade relations treatment to Kazakh products .
In addition , lobbyists will work to form a Central Asia Caucus on Capitol Hill .
And they will “ build a positive image of Kazakhstan ” through “ an aggressive earned media campaign , ” according to the contract .
That last objective will include placing at least four op - eds in “ prestige media , ” reaching out to think tanks and arranging trips to Kazakhstan for high - level U.S. government officials .
The firm also plans to monitor coverage by a list of “ writers known to be critical of the nation , ” which includes Fred Hiatt , the Washington Post ’s editorial page editor , and David Stern of the New York Times , according to the contract .
Kazakhstan will have a tough image to correct in Washington .
The most recent State Department human rights report says the country has had incidents of prisoner abuse , restrictions on freedom of speech and the press as well as evidence of government corruption .
Nixon is well aware of the nation ’s struggles and plans to emphasize the changes the former Soviet republic has made , including its initiative to extend religious freedoms to all of its citizens .
“ There is a lot of good going on .
It is part of our objective to make sure people understand it is a work in progress , ” Nixon said .

Is it time for Ken Silverstein to update his incredibly thought - provoking book Turkmeniscam : How Washington Lobbyists Fought to Flack for a Stalinist Dictatorship -- with a little humor ?
Or maybe just an honest warning to the government of glorious nation of Kazakhstan : save your money ; there 's not a lobbyist alive , not even among the den of notorious scam artists who populate the crooked right - wing firm founded by Haley Barbour , who 's going to be able to compete with Borat .
Just go with the flow .
Maybe even open a Borat - themed cultural park , if not in Astana , the capital , or Almaty , the biggest city , then perhaps in the Semipalatinsk Polygon ( now called Semey ) , the old Soviet nuclear weapon testing site .
“ People look at Borat and think this country is a backwater , that it ’s unsophisticated , ” said William Nixon , a former Reagan speech writer , now chairman and CEO of Policy Impact Communications , the lobbying firm that snagged the $ 1.5 million deal straight out of the pages of Silverstein 's book .
Nixon 's firm seems to be taking its game plan straight fromand I can't help but think they 're pissing in their pants when they talk with the sophisticated non-backwater Kazakhs .
This is one of the silliest things I 've ever read -- Nixon 's plans , not Silverstein 's fantastic book : Maybe the Kazakhs are following the outline of Silverstein 's book too .
In June of 2007 their sham parliament named the brutal dictator -- and former Soviet era Communist Party boss -- Nursultan Nazarbayev , president - for - life .
It has been reported that he maintains " strict control " over the country 's politics , while creating a right - wing think tank - inspired predator economy for hisfamily and cronies .
That " strict control " is maintained through strict censorship , rigging electoral farces , and killing political opponents and journalists .
Let 's see what these Central Asian fascists and the Inside - the - Beltway crooks they hired can do to combat this :

Why do conservative Christians in the US favour healthcare co-operatives ?
Speakers at the Family Research Council 's values voters summit this month unanimously opposed any government - run options , which they believe may lead to " European socialism " .
But they endorsed collectivism in another guise : health co-operatives .
This differentiation is the logical outcome of crass , Christian right exclusivity .
Manchester , my adopted home , is the birthplace of the British co-operative movement – a place , at the coalface of the industrial revolution , that experienced extreme inner city poverty and depravation .
A place where working - class people , struggling with a multitude of 19th - century problems in health and housing , collectively sought to help each other in times of crisis .
Co-operatives enabled those of like minds and similar situations to weather storms in which , through no fault of their own , good working men and women simply needed a little assistance : an illness that temporarily lowered the family income , the expense of healthcare and even funeral costs .
Co-operatives were a common - sense solution to the occasional crisis of the common man .
In a similar fashion , co-operatives seem one common - sense solution in America 's healthcare debate .
They offer an alternative to individually purchased private health insurance or to limited employee schemes with high deductibles , both of which are costly for the average citizen .
Healthcare co-operatives could bring together individuals , increasing their purchasing power and driving down the cost of health insurance .
It is n't the glorious NHS , but it 's a good idea with a solid history .
Of course , a part of that history is the context in which it was given birth .
The industrial revolution , as the coming of the age of capitalism , was the thesis to which the co-operative movement was the antithesis .
The individualism , the force of the market , produced a level of squalor , a level of personal insecurity and a fundamental disregard on the part of business , for the collective need .
For that moment in history , the most famous ( adopted ) Mancunian was named Marx .
He wrote much of his critique of capitalism as he sat watching the factories billow smoke into the Manchester air above and the sewers running through the streets below .
Co-operatives were a better alternative to parish councils .
Those traditional ports in a storm were overwhelmed by capitalism , and Protestant pragmatism led to prioritising poor relief .
The " deserving " poor were delineated from the " undeserving " poor .
Those deserving of help were those familiar to the parish councillors , those known to be of moral standing , those who could be trusted , upon receipt of help , to do better .
The landscape around Manchester is dotted with workhouses that gave refuge , employment and some education to those less deserving and more fitting for a life akin to indentured servitude .
For all their invocations of fear of " European socialism " , it is somewhat surprising to find American values voters endorsing a policy so anathema to free - market capitalism – a significant shift for those normally endorsing individual responsibility .
The ideological Petri dish for co-operatives was the recognition of the limits of individualism and capitalism .
Undoubtedly , values voters endorsing co-operatives would not share this ideological moment of conception .
So what is motivating this new - found recognition of the benefits of collective bargaining ?
Given their penchant for delineating categories of " us " and " them " – those who speak the Truth and those who do not speak with God 's voice – values voters seem more like traditional English parish councils , with a clear message of who is deserving and undeserving .
During a breakout session at the values voters summit in 2007 , Hillary Clinton 's healthcare plan was dismissed as a means for the " gay lobby " to ensure healthcare for all homosexuals – who , because of their sin , would eventually die of Aids .
In a session on " Obamacare " at this year 's summit , the Galen Institute 's Grace - Marie Turner advocated covering the uninsured by " allowing them to get healthcare through … church groups " .
A public option can be dismissed as it would mean using ( good ) taxpayer money to provide care for ( bad ) deviants avoiding responsibility for their moral and sexual choices .
If this seems far - fetched , think again .
The " health sharing ministries " of Medi-Share " brings Christians together to share medical bills with one another .
…
Your healthcare dollars go towards supporting healthy and biblical lifestyles " .
Each adult member must :
Have a verifiable Christian testimony indicating a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ , attend a fellowship of believers , regularly and actively support that ministry and live under the discipline of that body ; share the conviction that believers are to bear one another 's burdens according to Galatians 6:2 ; believe the biblical doctrine that their bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit and therefore are to be kept pure ; must not engage in sex outside of traditional Christian marriage ; cannot use tobacco or illegal drugs in any form , or abuse legal drugs or alcohol ; be a US citizen ( those serving abroad as missionaries may qualify ) .
Or maybe " as a reward to living a Godly and moral lifestyle " you prefer to purchase ChristiaNet Health Insurance – a " bill - sharing co-operative " that " caters to people opposed to paying for the high - risk , sinful lifestyles of the average American citizen " .
You may want to note that " tobacco use , excessive drinking , homosexuality and extramarital sex are strictly forbidden " and " anyone caught violating these specific exclusions can be dropped " and that " services do not pay for abortion or treatment of sexually transmitted diseases that were not contracted by being innocently overwhelmed and overpowered " .
Their company motto : " The fear of the Lord brings health to your body . "
So , like most things in politics , explanations are most often economic : follow the money .
Health follows directly from good morality , and unhealthy , immoral people will cost money .
Those at the values voters summit endorsing healthcare co-operatives can endorse a collective of those like - minded and similarly situated .
But without a public option , just like the parish councils of yore , those undeserving can be interned to God 's waiting room of residual care where they can await judgement .
This is not an outcome in the spirit of the co-operative movement , nor probably one endorsed by any holier spirit .

The latest battle over the “ hockey stick ” has taken quite a turn , one that may finally lay to rest all the absurd claims of its demise made by contrarians ( not to mention apparently libelous accusations of scientific malfeasance ) .
In previous posts , we discussed climate blogger Steve McIntyre ’s scurrilous accusations of “ cherrypicking ” against UK dendrochronolgist Keith Briffa , and summarized a a quick technical critique of McIntyre ’s work by a dendrchronologist known as Delayed Oscillator .
Now comes new evidence that McIntyre ’s accusations were completely false .
And not only that , one of the Russian researchers who actually control the raw tree - ring data that McIntyre was mistakenly hounding Briffa for , has apparently confirmed that utilization of a newer more complete Yamal data set has no substantial effect on Briffa ’s Yamal temperature reconstruction .
First let ’s review the accusations from McIntyre , as best we have been able to discern them [ Updated Oct. 7 to ensure it is understood these are the alleged actions ] :
Briffa allegedly failed to disclose and archive raw tree - ring measurement data sets for several years , despite an obligation to do so by the data disclosure policies of the journals that published his work , such as Nature and Science .
Briffa ( or someone else ) allegedly cherrypicked the 17 live tree - ring core samples used for the modern period .
( The term “ cherrypicking ” , of course , implies an intention to affect the result to match a preconceived notion , as seen at Wikipedia here and here .
“ Cherry picking can refer to the selection of data or data sets so a study or survey will give desired , predictable results which may be misleading or even completely contrary to actuality ” . )
Briffa also allegedly cherrypicked by failing to include other available tree - ring data from another site in the same region ( the Schweingruber chronology from Khadyta River ) , even though he had combined more geographically disparate series in other cases where sample sizes were low .
The “ proper ” chronology constructed from these two sites ’ data makes the hockey stick “ disappear ” .
Now McIntyre has posted part of an email from one of the original Russian researchers , namely Rashit Hantemirov , that sheds new light on all of McIntyre ’s contentions , to say the least .
( The email was not written to McIntyre , but was forwarded to him by an anonymous correspondent ) .
Low number of used for reconstruction subfossil series is explained by standardisation method ( “ corridor method ” ) .
We had to select the longest series .
The same concerns to living trees .
There are not much old living trees in this area ( in contrast to Polar Urals ) , therefore we used only 17 ( not 12 ) samples from living trees .
At that time we had close collaboration with CRU and I sent to Keith Briffa these raw data .
So , selection of samples has been made by me taking into account length of individual series as well as common requirements to increment cores ( exclusion samples with compression wood , rotten wood etc. ) .
As to reliability of recent increase in tree growth – we have updated our data using many additional subfossil and living trees and using RCS - method .
I.e. we used not only long series .
Therefore many ( 120 ) living trees have been used .
Finally , we have got almost the Briffa ’s result .
These results not published yet .
I ’m going to prepare paper at the end of this / beginning next year .
Some preliminary data you can find in some kind of report in Russian
vak.ed.gov.ru/common/img/uploaded/files/vak/announcements/biolog/2009/13-07/KHantemirovRM.pdf fig 2 – sample replication , fig 5 – temperature reconstruction ( smoothed by three filters – 50- , 100 - and 200 - year ) [ Emphasis added ]
As to the first accusation , it should be clear now if it were n’t already ( as one Eli Rabett and dhogaza have both shown ) that Briffa did not have control , or the right to distribute , the raw data .
The data belonged to the Russians ( Hantemirov and his co-author Shiyatov ) .
Not only that , but it appears they may not have even let Briffa have the complete data set , only the samples they used in their own work .
Why ?
It might be they had not yet published results using the complete data set , and were loathe to let Briffa do so before they did .
But it could also be that not all the living tree samples were available before ; the timeline for taking of the samples is not clear .
Whatever the details , McIntyre has been clearly barking ( and snarling ) up the wrong tree , so to speak .
[ Update , Oct. 8 : It turns out that McIntyre had the Hantemirov raw data all along – since 2004 ( h/t Craig Allen with more at Tim Lambert ’s Deltoid ) !
To quote one Steve McIntyre : “ You ca n’t make this stuff up ” . ]
As to the second accusation , it ’s true that the Russians pre-selected for age .
But they also eliminated some samples for other reasons .
More to the point , there is no evidence whatsoever that preselecting for age , necessary for the Russians ’ corridor method , would somehow skew the result towards a “ hockey stick ” shape , let alone that that was the intention .
( And , again , it ’s not even clear when additional younger living - tree samples were taken ; some or most may have been taken later ) .
But in fact , as Hantemirov explains , his application of the RCS ( regional curve standardization ) method to the larger live core data set now available , gives a result very close to Briffa ’s , as seen in Hantemirov ’s graphs below .
The Yamal hockey stick has magically repaired itself .
In my view , the third accusation is specious on its face , and the analysis and jerry - rigged chronologies proffered by McIntyre to support it simply do not hold up , as I discussed previously ( also see Delayed Oscillator for an analysis of the issues ) .
If McIntyre still thinks his versions of the Yamal chronologies have merit , then he should submit them to a peer - reviewed scientific journal , as many commentators have already noted .
[ Update , Oct. 8 : I added details about the Hantemirov document ( h/t Igor Samoylenko ) and translations of the figure captions ( h/t CM ) . ]
The Hantemirov manuscript is apparently “ in support of his application for the degree of doctor of science ( DSc ) , the highest post - graduate academic degree ” in Russia and is entitled “ Dynamics of tree vegetation and climate change in the north of Western Siberia in the Holocene ” .
Now this manuscript has been cited before to prove various things .
But at least one commentator ( named “ bill ” ) at WattsUpWithThat and Bishop Hill had noticed lurking hockey sticks :
Here ’s another interesting dissertation with descriptions of the Yamal trees and environment : [ link not repeated ]
From the same document a hockey stick !:
Figure 18 - of change in the mean temperature of summer ( deviations from the average ) , smoothed by 50 - year filter , and the dynamics of polar timber line
And , lo and behold , here is Figure 18 :
Figure 18 : Change in mean summer temperature ( as anomalies from the mean ) , smoothed with a 50 - year filter , and dynamics of the polar tree line .
[ Left Y axis : Latitude ; Right Y axis : Temperature ; X axis : Years ( BCE CE ) ]
The tip of the hockey stick “ blade ” ( based on a 50 - year instead of 21 - year filter ) , is still a full 1 deg C above the MWP ( Medeival Warm Period ) peak .
Here is Fig 2 ( “ sample replication ” i.e. samples by year ) , showing the 120 living living tree cores from the late 1990s thinning back to 40 over the last couple of centuries ( pale line ) , together with fossil sample count ( bold line ) :
Figure 2 : Distribution of the number of tree samples used for climate reconstruction based on year - ring width ( the thin line shows the share of samples from living trees ) .
Y axis : Number of samples ; X axis : Years ( BCE CE )
So clearly there are enough samples to pass the any reasonable “ climate audit ” , at least for the period of greatest interest .
And here is Figure 5 , described as “ temperature reconstruction ( smoothed by three filters – 50- , 100 - and 200 - year ) ” :
Figure 5 : Reconstruction of summer temperature on Yamal .
The data are shown as anomalies from the mean value after smoothing with 50- , 100 - and 200 - year filters .
On the lower graph , the dotted line shows the linear trend in temperature change from 5150 BCE to 1850 CE .
Here ’s the 50 - year filtered reconstruction for the last 1000 years or so ( upper righthand part of the previous chart ) .
Yep , it sure looks like the hockey stick is still unbroken .
[ Update , October 7 : It ’s probably worth repeating , of course , that there may be more hockey sticks lurking in a paper pointed out previously by both Delayed Oscillator and myself .
And who knows , maybe this paper is related to the work in the above Hantemirov “ report ” .
Anyway , the abstract of the new paper in Global Change Biology from Esper et al , entitled “ Trends and uncertainties in Siberian indicators of 20th century warming ” states :
Despite these large uncertainties , instrumental and tree growth estimates for the entire 20th century warming interval match each other , to a degree previously not recognized , when care is taken to preserve long - term trends in the tree - ring data .
[ Emphasis added ]
Naturally , Hantemirov is one of the co-authors .
Obviously this is recommended reading for anyone who is seriously interested in dendrochronology issues .
Later , Oct. 7 : I had to see myself , and as one might have guessed , it turns out the focus is on methodology issues rather than on millennial reconstructions .
The authors claim to have largely resolved the “ divergence problem ” through judicious application of RCS , and in doing so find broad agreement between the instrumental and proxy record during the “ entire 20th century warming interval ” , as stated in the abstract .
It appears to be a great step forward for dendrochronology and confirmation of the direction of previous evidence . ]
Meanwhile , Lorne Gunter of the National Post has decided to scramble to the front of the contrarian procession with yet another idiotic diatribe , entitled “ The Myth of the Hockey Stick ” .
Among many passages requiring retraction would appear to be Gunter ’s libelous conclusion :
Mr. McIntyre has now discovered that Prof. Briffa kept reducing the number of trees from which he used results , so that after 1990 , his calculations were based on just 10 trees from the whole of his sample of scores of trees .
And after 1995 , they were based on just five .
This Prof. Briffa justifies on the need to standardize findings to make them comparable .
He may be right .
But when Mr. McIntyre plugged more of Prof. Briffa ’s data into the calculations , the hockey stick broke again .
The 20th century was not particularly warm .
That loud crack you just heard is the tree limb starting to snap from under Gunter and the rest of the contrarian know - nothings .
Let the backpedalling begin .
Or climbdown , as the case may be .

A study performed at Edinburgh University , Scotland has shown that aspirin may do more harm to your health than good .
Generic aspirin
The research at the university in Scotland was to assess the effects of taking aspirin on a daily basis where no prior or existing medical conditions would merit its prescription .
The researchers monitored 3,350 patients aged between 50 – 75 , who were thought to be at risk of heart disease , but did not show any significant symptoms at the start of the study .
Over an eight - year time period , 181 of those people taking aspirin had heart attacks or strokes .
More than 3,000 men aged 50 – 75 were randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of aspirin or a placebo pill and were watched over the eight year time period .
There were 34 major bleeds in people taking aspirin , or 2 % , in comparison to 1.2 % of those who took the placebo .
The Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis ( AAA ) have found that the routine use of aspirin does not prevent vascular disease or conditions and the use of it " could not be supported . "
Some prescription Placebo tablets used in scientific research and medical practices .
Peter Weissberg , a professor at the British Heart Foundation , the company which was partly responsible in funding for the trials said , " we know that patients with symptoms of artery disease , such as angina , heart attack or stroke , can reduce their risk of further problems by taking a small dose of aspirin each day .
The findings of this study agree with our current advice that people who do not have symptomatic or diagnosed artery or heart disease should not take aspirin , because the risks of bleeding may outweigh the benefits .
Because it 's been around for a long time , people think , ' It must be safe and it ca n't do any harm ' .
They are taking it ' just in case ' but it 's much more dangerous than some other drugs that people get concerned about , like statins . "
Professor Gerry Fowkes presented the research from the University of Edinburgh at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Barcelona , Spain , which was attended by more than 30,000 heart specialists .
" Our research suggests that aspirin should not be prescribed to the general population , although it does have benefits for people with established heart disease or other conditions , " stated Fowkes .

( Media - Newswire.com ) -
In 1995 , a good computer chip had a clock speed of about 100 megahertz .
Seven years later , in 2002 , a good computer chip had a clock speed of about three gigahertz  a 30 - fold increase .
And now , seven years later , a good computer chip has a clock speed of ... still about three gigahertz .
Four or five years ago , chip makers realized that they could n't make chips go much faster , so they adopted a new strategy for increasing computers ' power : putting multiple " cores , " or processing units , on each chip .
In theory , a chip with two cores working in parallel can accomplish twice as much as a chip with one core .
But software developers tend to see their programs as lists of sequential instructions , and they 've had trouble breaking up those instructions in ways that take advantage of parallel processing .
Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Saman Amarasinghe and his colleagues at MIT 's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab are giving them a hand .
In the past , computer science researchers had hoped that sequential programs could be converted into parallel programs automatically .
" I spent a good part of my life trying to do that , " says Amarasinghe .
But Amarasinghe has now come to the conclusion that " if you want to get parallel performance , you have to start writing parallel code . "
At a high level , he believes , programmers will need to specify which tasks performed by their programs can run concurrently .
" Just writing anything parallel does n't mean that it 's going to run fast , " Amarasinghe says .
" A lot of parallel programs will actually run slower , because you parallelize the wrong place . "
And determining when to parallelize , and which cores to assign which tasks , is something that computers can do automatically , Amarasinghe believes .
Amarasinghe divides his group 's work on multicore computing into two categories : tools to ease programmers ' transition to parallel programming and tools to improve programs ' performance once that transition is complete .
Predictable parallelism
The first set of tools addresses one of the central difficulties of parallel programming : if several tasks are assigned to separate cores , there 's no way to be sure which will be completed first .
Most of the time , that 's not a problem .
But occasionally , different cores have to access the same resource  updating the same stored value , for instance , or sending data to the monitor .
Depending on which core reaches the resource first , the program 's behavior could be quite different .
Even given the exact same inputs , a multicore program may not execute in quite the same way twice in a row .
That 's a nightmare for developers trying to debug their programs .
To find a bug , developers run their programs over and over , with slight variations , to localize problems to ever - smaller blocks of code .
But those variations do n't convey any useful information unless the rest of the program behaves in the exact same way .
Amarasinghe and his grad students Marek Olszewski and Jason Ansel designed a system to make multicore programs more predictable .
When a core tries to access a shared resource , it 's assigned a priority based not on the time of its request but on the number of instructions it 's executed .
At any point during a parallel program 's execution , any two cores will have executed about the same number of instructions .
But if one core has had to , say , access a little - used value in a distant part of the computer 's memory , it might have fallen slightly behind .
In those cases , the researchers ' system gives it a chance to catch up .
Once it 's reached the same instruction count , if it has n't issued a higher - priority request for the shared resource , the first core 's request is granted .
That waiting around means , of course , that the program as a whole will run more slowly .
But in experiments , the researchers determined that , on average , a software implementation of their system increased program execution time by only about 16 percent .
For developers , that 's a small price to pay for reliable debugging .
Moreover , if the ability to count instructions were built into the cores themselves , the system would be much more efficient .
Indeed , Intel  which has demonstrated eight - core chips at trade shows  is talking with Amarasinghe about funding further research on the system .
" A lot of other people have this alternative approach , " says Krste Asanovic , an associate professor at the Parallel Computing Lab at the University of California , Berkeley .
" You kind of just run it [ the parallel program ] however it runs and then try and record what it did so then you can go back and replay it . "
But with the MIT system , he says , " You do n't have to worry about recording how it executed because when you execute it , it will always run the same way .
So it 's strictly more powerful than replay . "
Maximizing multicore
Amarasinghe's lab has two projects that fit into his second category  tools that optimize the performance of parallel programs .
The first deals with streaming applications , such as video broadcast over the Web .
Before your computer can display an Internet video , it needs to perform a slew of decoding steps  splitting the data stream into parallel signals , performing different types of decompression and color correction , recombining the signals , performing motion compensation , equalizing the signal , and so on .
Traditionally , Amarasinghe says , video software will take a chunk of incoming data , pass it through all those decoding steps , and then grab the next chunk .
That approach , says Amarasinghe , squanders the inherent parallelism of signal - processing circuits .
As one chunk of data exits each decoding step , the next chunk of data could be entering it .
StreamIt , a language developed by Amarasinghe 's group , allows programmers to specify the order of the steps but automatically determines when to pass how much data to each step .
" If you have some kind of specification document , they 're all written in block diagrams " that illustrate a signal - processing path as a series of sequential steps , Amarasinghe says .
" When they write to [ the programming language ] C , you lose those blocks . "
StreamIt , by contrast , " is very close to the original thinking , " Amarasinghe says .
" Other people had talked about stream programming , but StreamIt was really putting everything together in a language and compiler tool chain so people could actually write streaming programs , " says Asanovic .
" So I think the language design and compiler tool chain that followed from that was pretty influential . "
The group 's other parallel - computing project helps programs adapt on the fly to changing conditions .
Often , Amarasinghe explains , a programmer has several ways of tackling a particular task .
There are , for example , many common algorithms for sorting data , with names like quicksort , insertion sort , radix sort , and the like .
But the algorithms perform differently under different circumstances .
Quicksort is often the best choice , but not " when the data is very small , " Amarasinghe says .
With huge data sets , however , radix sort may work even better than quicksort .
That variability is compounded when the algorithms are being assigned to different cores .
So Amarasinghe 's group has designed another language that asks the developer to specify four or five different methods for performing a given computational task .
When the program is running , the computer automatically identifies the most efficient method .
It might seem that that approach would lead to bloated programs .
But Amarasinghe points out that when a typical program executes , it devotes much more memory to storing data than it does to storing instructions .
" Something like a sort is , like , five lines of code that work on arrays with billions of elements .
So making five lines of code 25 is not a big issue , " he says .
It does require some added work on the programmer 's part .
But " there 's no free lunch : you wo n't get nice multicore performance by doing nothing , " Amarasinghe says .
" Believe me , we 've been trying for 50 years . "

Kucinich : Will We Stand for the People or the Insurance Companies ?
Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) today made the following statement about the health care debate in America :
“ Providing health care to all Americans is the moral responsibility of our government , consistent with the Preamble in the Constitution .
Yet we are being told that it is not possible to have the kind of single payer health system which every industrialized democracy in the world has .
“ We compromised on single payer by backing a public option , and now we are being asked to compromise the public option with negotiated rates .
In conference , we will likely be asked to compromise negotiated rates with a trigger .
In each and every step of the health care debate , the insurance companies have won .
If they get hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxpayer subsidies , they get to raise their premiums , and increase their co pays and deductibles , while the public is forced to pay for private insurance , then the insurance companies win big .
“ If this is the best we can do , then it is time to ask ourselves whether the two - party system is truly capable of representing the American people or whether the system has been so compromised by special interests that we ca n’t even protect the health of our own people .
This is a moment of truth for the Democratic Party .
Will we stand for the people or the insurance companies ? ”

The recession is over .
We have been told so by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research , the Recruitment and Employment Confederation and a succession of bank economists .
Only it does n't feel that way to most people in the country , suffering from cost cutting in their jobs and uncertainty in their outlook .
That is the problem with economists .
" Making a speech on economics , " President Lyndon Johnson once remarked , " is a lot like pissing down your leg .
It seems hot to you , but it never does to anyone else . "
In economic terms we may indeed be emerging from the downturn .
Strictly speaking a recession is when you have several successive months of contraction .
Recovery is when you record an increase , however small .
Most economists – although not all ( the IMF remains more gloomy ) would say that this is now occurring at last in the UK , somewhat behind most of the rest of the world , and that the third quarter of the year should show some sort of rise .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Following on from that , there is the whole argument over whether the recovery is real or illusory , whether it is v-shaped or " double - bottomed " and whether unemployment will get better or lag behind .
If all that feels somewhat unreal to the average citizen , so it should .
It is unreal .
Economics may give you a statistical picture of what broadly is happening to output and activity in an economy .
What it does n't tell you is how it feels to experience a massive jolt like the credit crunch and how that affects spending , saving and confidence – the factors necessary for self - sustaining recovery .
The public in this case have good cause to sense two things about the economy at the moment .
One is that the worst of what had been predicted has not happened .
The second is that the recovery is still very far from being certain .
The banks have been saved and are doing reasonably well again ( rather too well in the eyes of those who would have wished them to suffer more ) .
Output has dropped , unemployment has risen .
But the fall in interest rates has made borrowers considerably better off than they were a year ago .
Consumption has held up to a surprising degree .
Stock markets have risen by record amounts .
But for the recession to be over for ordinary people would mean that they feel secure in their job , expect an increase in their wage , believe that the cost of mortgages will remain low and that they can save safely for their retirement .
They can , if politicians were honest , be confident of none of these .
The factors behind the recovery so far have been largely temporary in nature .
Most businesses met the first signs of the downturn by reducing stocks as rapidly as possible .
In recent months they have had to restock as the warehouses emptied .
But at some point that will stop unless demand really races forward , which it is n't .
The rise in car sales has been boosted by the scrappage scheme , due to end next March .
Consumption has been helped by a drop in the VAT rate planned to cease at the end of the year .
Interest rates have been held low by a massive injection of public funds into the banks and a printing of money that cannot go on forever .
The stock market rise has been fuelled by investors seeking quick returns amongst distressed priced shares , not in the expectation of higher returns from companies .
Exports have been helped by a rise in the Chinese economy almost entirely fed by state spending which is now being reined in .
Confidence , of course , can lead to its own virtuous circle of rising demand feeding back into the economy with renewed investment and recruitment .
But , so far , that is not happening .
Governments may huff and puff about the failure of the banks to lend to business but the banks face the same problems as their corporate customers – where is sustained demand going to come from ?
It 's all very well boosting car sales with scrappage , but over the future will people buy as many cars as now and what kind of cars ?
Will people eat out and travel as much given rising prices ?
So much of investment in the past decade was driven by the sense of ever increasing demand that its sudden halt has led not just to a feeling of a pause but a sense of fundamental reconsideration of where growth will , and should , come from over the future .
Without that certainty , private investment remains unforthcoming .
What investment there is almost entirely fed by public expenditure , the very area which all parties now seem to be agreed will have to be cut if government debt is to be reduced .
To economists this raises the heated question of whether and when to take the foot off the inflationary brake .
If the recession really is over , you should be taking the foot off the accelerator for fear of stoking inflation ( not a great threat at the moment , it should be said ) .
If growth is still fragile , then you need to keep the foot down .
To politicians – at least in this country – the debate has come to be all about how far you can and should cut back public expenditure .
For the opposition , the problem is to appear tough whilst not looking callous should the recession not be over .
For the Government , there is a quandary .
If the economy is recovering , then action to pull down the debt is all the more pressing but if the recession is n't over then they will be held responsible for that .
It 's a peculiarly barren argument .
Even if the case for continued reflation were overwhelming , the reality is that the Government cannot keep spending without hitting a ceiling of what outside investors are willing to fund .
And that point , in the case of Britain , appears to have been reached .
But equally well , cuts in public spending will only serve to deepen the recession , and the hole in the Government 's finances , should the recovery not continue .
What is needed is clear but politically difficult .
It is for the Government , and opposition parties , to set out the alternative scenarios about the recovery , a plan to help revive private sector investment and an " exit strategy " for restoring the public finances in a way that will convince the markets .
It wo n't make for comfortable reading but at least it will chime in with what the public senses to be the case .
The downturn may be easing but the recession is n't over , not in the terms they understand it .

Chemical reactions rarely go from start to finish in a single step , as intermediates form during the transition between starting materials and final products .
For example , when our bodies synthesize proteins , a new amino acid does n’t just merge into a growing chain of amino acids .
Instead , the formation of the bonds between amino acids in a protein ( a peptide bond ) involves a complex coordinated effort among different RNAs and enzymatic sites .
If you ’ve ever taken a course in organic or physical chemistry , you ’ve seen firsthand that we expend as much effort on studying how a reaction occurs as we do on figuring out its eventual outcome .
Reactions are n't movies that you can freely pause or slow down to observe sequential steps , so chemists have employed a variety of clever techniques to work with the limitations .
Scientists can radioactively label molecules to track reactions , or they can make it easier to monitor reaction progression by slowing down molecular motion through temperature reduction or placing chemicals in a kinetically impeding molecular capsule , just to name a few options .
Building on past techniques , Makoto Fujita ’s laboratory at the University of Tokyo combined X - ray crystallography with reactions trapped in cavities to directly capture structural data of reaction intermediates .
The authors use this to create an X - ray snapshot of a rarely seen intermediate in this week 's issue of Nature .
While crystals appear nonporous to the naked eye , crystalline networks have minute spaces that could confine chemicals and even act as a reaction flask for certain chemical transformations .
Fujita ’s group reasoned " the pores of a crystalline network would also provide kinetic stabilization and hence enable direct observation by X - ray crystallography of trapped intermediates , providing structural and mechanistic information . "
In other words , as a reaction progresses in a crystalline pore , an intermediate stage could be stabilized and observed before the reaction goes to completion to become the final product .
( X - ray crystallography can determine the identity and arrangement of atoms in a compound , providing a picture of the chemical structure . )
To test their idea , the authors decided to study the formation of a Schiff base , a textbook reaction that is important for many biochemical processes .
During the synthesis of a Schiff base ( also known as an imine for the chemists out there ) , an unstable intermediate called a hemiaminal is formed , but only exists very briefly , making it difficult to examine .
Fujita ’s group formed this intermediate in a zinc iodide based crystal by reacting the two starting materials , an amine and an aldehyde , within the crystalline pores .
They first formed the crystal with an amine as a guest molecule that lies within the pores and then placed the crystal in the X - ray instrument .
They cooled the crystal down to 215 K ( - 58?C ) and gently flowed an aldehyde solution over it for 10 minutes .
To trap the intermediate that was formed , they further cooled the crystal to 90 K ( - 183 ?C ) and collected structural data using the X - ray instrument , obtaining a snapshot of the hemiaminal intermediate .
After gathering the hemiaminal configuration , the authors warmed the crystal to 270 K ( - 3 ?C ) and allowed the reaction to advance for 30 minutes .
After cooling the crystal to 90 K again , they collected data and acquired the structure of the Schiff base , the final product .
The structure of the hemiaminal intermediate is rarely observed , but it has been studied before by trapping it in an enzyme pocket that stabilized it and extended its life .
But enzymes are very specific and difficult to adapt for different molecules , while crystals are likely to be more generally useful .
Thus , Fujita ’s group has provided an important demonstration that utilizing crystalline pores can successfully provide the structure of a reaction intermediate .
With that said , there are still limitations to what can be monitored using Fujita ’s method .
For example , they can only study reactions that can be adapted to work in a crystalline pore without destroying the crystal host , and do n't experience altered reactivity in the constrained space .
Nevertheless , quite a few reactions would fit the necessary criteria , and other types of crystals can be developed to further increase the range of this technique .

America now has more military personnel in Afghanistan than the Red Army had at the peak of the Soviet invasion and occupation of that country .
According to a Congressional Research Service report , as of March of this year , the U.S. had 52,000 uniformed personnel and another 68,000 contractors in Afghanistan — a number that has likely grown given the blank check President Obama has written for what ’s now being called “ Obama ’s War . ”
That makes 120,000 American military personnel fighting in Afghanistan , a figure higher than the Soviet peak troop figure of 115,000 during their catastrophic 9 - year war .
Just this week , General McChrystal , whom Obama appointed to command American forces in Afghanistan , is talking of sending tens of thousands more American troops .
At the height of the Soviet occupation , Western intelligence experts estimated that the Soviets had 115,000 troops in Afghanistan — but like America , the more troops and the longer the Soviets stayed , the more doomed their military mission became .
We ’re also heading into the same casualty trap as the Soviets did .
This summer has been the deadliest in the eight - year war for American troops .
While the number of uniformed Americans killed in combat in Afghanistan may seem comparatively low — just over 800 , most of those since 2007 — the Soviets also suffered relatively light casualties .
Between December 1979 and February 1989 , just 13,000 Soviets were killed in Afghanistan , a seemingly paltry figure when you compare it to the 20 million Soviets killed in World War Two , and the millions upon millions who died in the Civil War and Stalin ’s Terror .
Unlike America , Russians have a reputation for tolerating appalling casualty figures — and yet the war in Afghanistan destroyed the Soviet Empire .
Which only proves that crude number comparisons explain nothing at all in warfare today , particularly when that war is an occupation of an alien environment like Afghanistan .
Why has n’t anyone pointed out that America ’s troop commitment now exceeds the Red Army ’s ?
For some inexplicable reason the corporate media has decided to shuffle the figures and exclude the US military contractors from the total figure of US military personnel .
It makes no logical sense — we still count the Hessians among the British forces in the War of Independence .
It ’s as if the only thing left that Americans are capable of is accounting fraud — the only talent we perfected over the past decade was how to move all the bad numbers off the official books , as if it ’s become an instinctive reflex .
But just as those accounting tricks did n’t change all those banks ’ and funds ’ insolvency , so the American media ’s troop - counting tricks , in which contractors are “ off books , ” ca n’t make the disaster in Afghanistan disappear .
We ’re already more deeply invested in our Afghanistan war than the Russians were , and as we head into our ninth year — the magic number for when the Soviets pulled out and their empire collapsed — President Obama is dragging the country deeper into that disaster .
( Moreover , if you add in all the NATO personnel — useless as they are as a “ fighting ” force — the number of Western troops already far exceeds the number deployed in the Soviet Union ’s “ unwinnable ” war . )
Kiwi coalition grunts hamming it up next to old abandoned Soviet tank
The Afghanistan War has somehow escaped most of America ’s attention .
People just assumed that since Obama is a decent guy with a sharper mind than Bush ’s , he must know what he ’s doing in Afghanistan , and his intentions ca n’t be bad — so why bother paying attention , when we have all these other problems here at home ?
Besides , war is n’t a fun topic anymore .
Thanks to Bush and Cheney , any talk of war is a total bummer , whether you ’re from the right or the left .
And Americans do n’t like bummers — instead , America is always “ moving on ” from its bummers .
Nothing bums Americans out more than losing wars , which helps explain why Afghanistan is the most we ’ve - moved - on subject of our time .
The problem is that you ca n’t move on from something while it ’s still a problem — but try telling that to a nation of delusionals .
Remember how long after Vietnam it took for for Americans to “ move on ” and get their war appetite back on ?
It took a decade before we could talk about ‘ Nam again , and that probably would have gone on longer if it was n’t for the kick - ass performance by Robert Duvall as Col Kilgore stirring a new generation ’s blood lust .
( For a taste of just how cinematic this budding tragedy could be , click here to check out these amazing photos . )
We suffered then from “ Vietnam Syndrome , ” which was a strange way of assigning a mental illness to a totally rational aversion to invading far - away countries .
This time it ’s going to be even worse , though : given our 0 - 2 war record this decade , and the shameful way that America ’s pseudo - imperialists snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in Iraq and Afghanistan , like a nation of Bill Buckners , it ’s no wonder no one here wants to talk about Afghanistan .
Since we ’ve already long ago “ moved on ” from Afghanistan , it means that our agony of defeat there will be far more painful than anything we ’ve experienced before .
The most frustrating thing is how obvious this catastrophe is : Obama is leading America into a predictable sequel of superpower - loses - in - hellish - Third - World - quagmire : he ’s doubling down troops in a war fewer people understand , a war that ’s growing increasingly unpopular as the casualty count accelerates ; investing more into a corrupt regime which just stole elections in a way that would make the hardliners in neighboring Iran blush ; suicide bombers are being directed by the Afghan Defense Ministry to blow up American journalists , leading to a dusty version of the ol ’ “ who ’s in charge here ? ” “ I thought you were ” ; and now , the American right wing — the only thing that approximates a real opposition this country — is having a collective Walter Cronkite moment , with George Will of all people leading the call for the West to pull its forces out now in order to limit the defeat ’s damage .
George fucking Will as the conscience of our nation ?!
This must be what Marx meant by tragedy turning to farce .
And through it all , the Russians must be enjoying America ’s decline more than anyone , after all the gloating we did over their downfall : in our two nations ’ ongoing Tom & Jerry Show , America ’s looming defeat is shaping up to be Russia ’s revenge on America ’s revenge for what Russia did to America in Vietnam .
Which reminds me of an interview a couple of years ago I did with a former top Soviet advisor to the puppet Afghan government ’s General Staff , Pyotr Goncharov .
I was still in Moscow then , and I was working on a story to counter the then - popular neocon meme that Iraq was n’t really the disastrous war that its critics said it was because after all , “ only ” 4,000 Americans died there .
A lot of Russian nationalists still argue that they could have won the war in Afghanistan and that it was n’t going so badly , given the low body count–and yet the empire collapsed there .
I was curious why even a police state like the Soviet Union collapsed , and what lesson America could learn from that .
And this is where it got strange , because the first thing Goncharov said to me when I met him was , “ I just want to say to you that what the Americans are doing in Afghanistan is perfect .
You ’re doing everything right that we did wrong over there .
You ’re not making any of our mistakes , and with my experience there , I can only commend you . ”
Goncharov told me he was the top Soviet advisor to the Afghan regime ’s joint chiefs of staff from 1986 - 9 , the year of the pullout , and today he is a leading military analyst on Afghanistan issues for state RIA - Novosti .
He was n’t interested in my line of questioning about why low body counts are so devastating to superpowers — instead , all he wanted to talk about was what a great man John McCain is .
“ Everything he proposes for the war in Afghanistan is exactly right .
He really knows what he ’s talking about , ” Goncharov said .
Then his otherwise cheerful face took on a confused almost dour expression : “ But I have to ask : is it really possible that Americans will elect Barack Obama ?
Because this would be a disaster for the world .
If Obama is president and he withdraws from Afghanistan , the whole world will pay , much worse than we all paid after the Soviet pullout .
It ca n’t really be possible that Obama will win , could it ?
I ca n’t believe America would do that . ”
Now we know how it really turned out : Barack Obama won the presidency , but in terms of dealing with Bush ’s war legacy it may as well have been McCain .
Because Obama ’s Afghanistan
War policy is indistinguishable from McCain ’s , which is why McCain has nothing but good things to say about Obama ’s conduct of the war .
I always wondered after that interview with Goncharov what his reasoning was for supporting another Republican president , given the disaster America suffered under Bush : did he want America to get sucked into Afghanistan and collapse like his country did , out of vengeful spite ?
Or was Goncharov being sincere , as I think he was ?
My guess is that Goncharov really wanted McCain and genuinely liked him , because McCain was someone a military man like Goncharov could understand .
And anyway , as intelligent and refined as Goncharov was , he proved what Obama is proving today : we never learn from our mistakes , as much as we pretend we do .
Call it “ Afghanistan Syndrome ” : Twenty years ago , Afghanistan was Russia ’s “ Vietnam ” ; today , Afghanistan is becoming America ’s “ Afghanistan . ”
Obama is walking into this disaster like one of the doomed victims from the Scream series : everyone , including the protagonists , knows that it ’s going to be a disaster , everyone ’s seen the script so many times they can recite it from heart .
And yet Obama ’s leading the nation into the trap all over again .
And Obama ca n’t even be compared to LBJ , who at least managed to give millions of Americans Medicare .
What will Obama ’s legacy be ?
The PPIP program ?
Protecting AIG ’s bonuses ?

In recent years scientists have made synthetic versions of key parts of the cell , such as chromosomes and ribosomes .
Now researchers have developed the first working artificial prototype of an “ organ ” of a human cell — the Golgi apparatus .
Made up of a network of sacs piled together like a stack of pancakes , the Golgi apparatus chemically modifies proteins to help make them stable and functional , and it helps to manufacture complex sugars .
But it remains one of the most poorly understood organelles .
“ The sacs are fluid and constantly change shape , so it ’s difficult to get a handle on , ” explains Robert Linhardt , a chemist at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute .
“ And while we know the general direction of the flow of vesicles between stacks , we do n’t really know what cargoes they ’re carrying . ”
To better dissect how the Golgi apparatus works , Linhardt and his colleagues created a synthetic version of it , designing a square - millimeter - size lab - on - a- chip to mimic the assembly line of enzymes that modify a biomolecule within the Golgi apparatus .
The sample molecules are attached to magnetic particles suspended in a watery droplet 300 billionths of a liter in size and placed on the chip .
When the desired location on the chip for those molecules is electrically charged , it attracts the droplet and causes it to flow there .
A larger magnet under that spot can keep in place the magnetic particles attached to the biomolecules .
In this way , the drop can be moved through chambers loaded with an assembly line of enzymes , sugars and other raw materials .
In experiments with an inactive precursor of heparin , a widely used blood thinner , the scientists discovered their device could quickly and efficiently modify the anticoagulant to make it functional , findings they detail in the August 12 Journal of the American Chemical Society .
The researchers suggest that an artificial Golgi could lead to a faster , safer method of producing heparin than current techniques , which employ animal tissue .
Scientists have experimented with building up cells piece by piece for decades , including the creation of simple artificial cells in the form of bubbles made of synthetic cell membranes , to better understand how life on earth might have began .
In 1997 researchers devised the first artificial human chromosome .
And earlier this year molecular technologist George Church of Harvard University and his colleagues developed artificial ribosomes — bodies inside each cell that make proteins based on instructions from DNA — that functioned under cell - like conditions .
Linhardt and his co-workers plan on creating a synthetic endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) as well , the organelle into which ribosomes are studded and where protein synthesis and folding take place .
“ We ’d even like to integrate an artificial Golgi and ER together , ” Linhardt says .
“ We ’re basically taking pieces of a cell and making them on electronic chips , ” with the hope of moving to even more complex systems .

Editors ' preface :
Who has rights to the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River ?
Zionists cite biblical passages in which God awarded them Eretz Yisrael , the Land of Israel , in perpetuity in his covenant with the children of Israel .
Muslims make a counter - claim based in part on verses of the Qur'an that describe the Jews in terms of contempt and in part on rulings in Muslim law that reject Muslims relinquishing rule over a territory under Muslim rule to nonbelievers .
But other Muslims cite different Qur'anic verses in support of the Jewish claim .
The conflict has a religious quality that makes it the more difficult to resolve .
The Middle East Quarterly commissioned two essays presenting different views of the Qur'an and its passages dealing with the Holy Land and Jews .
The first author , Robert Spencer , argues that Islamic law has not recognized and will never recognize Jewish rights to this territory .
In a second essay , Muhammad Al - Hussaini , a Muslim scholar , understands the text of the Qur'an to award the Holy Land to the Jews for all time , and he holds that Muslims can be convinced of this interpretation .
The Kotel , popularly known as the Wailing Wall , here circa 1927 , is a wall that once stood outside Herod 's Temple .
Jews are not allowed to pray on the Temple Mount itself .
Jerusalem is not once mentioned by name in the Qur'an or in Muslim prayers .
The status of Israel has become a pivotal issue in all talks about the Middle East .
Israel 's legitimacy rests , not just on United Nations resolutions or Zionist aspirations , but , for many , on Biblical narratives and the historical connections of Jews with the Holy Land .
A minority of Muslims find justification for the Zionist enterprise equally in the Bible and the Qur'an and believe that the Qur'an offers divine sanction for the establishment of a Jewish state in southern Syria .
However , the majority cite other Qur'anic verses and passages from the Hadith ( purported records of the Prophet Muhammad 's actions and sayings ) , stating the exact opposite .
This second , negative attitude toward Jews is expressed in sacred texts and in the body of Shari'a ( Islamic law ) where Jews , like all non-Muslims , are assigned a status that does not permit their becoming rulers over Muslims or over Muslim territory .
Traditionally , this has not been an issue .
Under the different Muslim empires , Jews were kept firmly in their place and represented no sort of threat to the ruling order .
It is only in the modern period that this has become a burning issue .
Thus , the transition from the Ottoman Empire to the British Mandate to modern Israel has been as much a religious as a political clash .
The Arab onslaught of 1948 was religiously motivated , as is modern opposition to Israel by Islamist groups .
The Hamas charter asserts that " the Islamic Resistance Movement [ i.e. Hamas ] regards Palestine as an Islamic Waqf consecrated for future generations until Judgment Day . "
A waqf is a religious endowment bestowed by God .
Consequently , " neither it , nor any part of it , should be squandered : Neither it , nor any part of it , should be given up .
Neither a single Arab country nor all Arab countries , neither any king or president , nor all the kings and presidents , neither any organization nor all of them , be they Palestinian or Arab , possess the right to do that .
Palestine is an Islamic Waqf land consecrated for Muslim generations until Judgment Day . " [ 1 ]
The charter is not unique :
It represents a mainstream view among Muslims today .
In contrast , several Muslim spokesmen have recently claimed that the Qur'an promises Israel to the Jews and that the claims of Hamas , Hezbollah , and allied groups are illegitimate on Islamic grounds .
[ 2 ]
This is a comforting message , which some of these spokesmen have taken to Jewish audiences , reinforcing the idea that the Islamic jihad imperative against Israel is simply the province of a tiny minority of extremists and that the voices of reason , moderation , and Qur'anic authenticity will eventually prevail .
Muhammad al - Hussaini's Liberal Stance
Among these scholars is British - based imam Sheikh Muhammad Al - Hussaini , who asserts that early Muslim intellectuals recognized that Israel belonged to the Jews .
" You will find very clearly that the traditional commentators from the eighth and ninth century onwards have uniformly interpreted the Koran to say explicitly that Eretz Yisrael [ Heb. The Land of Israel ] has been given by God to the Jewish people as a perpetual convenant [ sic ] .
There is no Islamic counterclaim to the Land anywhere in the traditional corpus of commentary . " [ 3 ]
Although an extremely comforting message to supporters of Israel , it is not true and is based on a partial and inaccurate reading of the Qur'an .
Hussaini bases his argument primarily upon Qur'an 5:21 in which Moses declares : " O my people , enter the Holy Land which God has prescribed for you , and turn not back in your traces , to turn about losers . " [ 4 ]
He then cites the classic Qur'an commentator Muhammad ibn Jarir at - Tabari ( 838-923 ) , who explains that this statement is " a narrative from God … concerning the saying of Moses … to his community from among the children of Israel and his order to them according to the order of God to him , ordering them to enter the holy land . " [ 5 ]
Tabari is not unique in this .
Another respected Muslim exegete , Ibn Kathir ( 1301 - 73 ) , says about Qur'an 5:21 that the Jews " were the best among the people of their time .
...
God states next that Moses encouraged the children of Israel to perform jihad and enter Jerusalem , which was under their control during the time of their father Jacob .
Jacob and his children later moved with his household to Egypt during the time of Prophet Joseph .
His offspring remained in Egypt until their exodus with Moses .
They found a mighty , strong people in Jerusalem who had previously taken it over .
Moses , God 's Messenger , ordered the children of Israel to enter Jerusalem and fight their enemy , and he promised them victory and triumph over the mighty people if they did so . " [ 6 ]
But that is not the end of the story .
Ibn Kathir then says that the Jews " declined , rebelled , and defied his order and were punished for forty years by being lost , wandering in the land , uncertain of where they should go .
This was their punishment for defying God 's command . "
In contrast , " The Muslim Ummah [ community ] is more respected and honored before God , and has a more perfect legislative code and system of life , it has the most honorable Prophet , the larger kingdom , more provisions , wealth and children , a larger domain and more lasting glory than the children of Israel . " [ 7 ]
The idea that the " glory " of the children of Israel was not lasting explains why Hussaini 's exegesis is incomplete .
He quotes Tabari , saying that God wanted the children of Israel to enter the Holy Land but stops short at the rest of what the Qur'an says about them .
But he argues that this promise is lasting , basing his comments on the nature of the Qur'an itself as understood in traditional Islamic theology : " It was never the case during the early period of Islam … that there was any kind of sacerdotal attachment to Jerusalem as a territorial claim .
Jerusalem is holy but Mount Sinai is more holy .
Sinai is mentioned far more often , and Jerusalem is n't actually mentioned [ in the Qur'an ] by name . " [ 8 ]
If this exegesis is correct , why does the Islamic world from Morocco to Indonesia manifest such hostility to Israel ?
Why have so few Muslims noticed that God wants the Jews to possess the Holy Land ?
One answer is that Hussaini 's primary authority , Tabari , has more to say about the Jews .
Qur 'an 2:61 says of some Jews who rebelled against Moses that " abasement and poverty were pitched upon them , and they were laden with the burden of God 's anger ; that , because they had disbelieved the signs of God and slain the Prophets unrightfully ; that , because they disobeyed , and were transgressors . "
Qur'an 9:29 directs
Muslims to " [ f ] ight those who believe not in God and the Last Day and do not forbid what God and His Messenger have forbidden — such men as practice not the religion of truth , being of those who have been given the Book — until they pay the tribute out of hand and have been humbled . "
" Those who have been given the Book " is the Qur'anic term for Jews and Christians , and the tribute ( jizya ) is a poll tax levied upon the People of the Book in an Islamic state .
Tabari discusses 2:61 in the context of 9:29 , emphasizing that this tax was meant to be humiliating :
Abasement and poverty were imposed and laid down upon them , as when someone says " the imam imposed the poll tax ( jizya ) … on non-Muslim subjects , " or " The man imposed land tax on his slave , " meaning thereby that he obliged him [ to pay ] it … God commanded His believing servants not to give them [ i.e. , non-Muslims ] security — as long as they continued to disbelieve in Him and his Messenger — unless they pay the poll tax to them . [ 9 ]
Conversion or Submission of Jews
The principle that Muslims must not give the Jews security unless they convert to Islam or pay the jizya directly contradicts Hussaini 's assertion that they were to possess the land forever .
A people that may never have security unless it converts or submits to the rule of others cannot have a land to rule by itself .
The idea that " good Jews " are those who convert to Islam is deeply rooted in Islamic tradition .
In the 1970s , Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi , currently the grand sheikh of Cairo's Al - Azhar University and the leading authority for Sunni Muslims today , wrote a 700 - page treatise , Jews in the Qur'an and the Traditions , in which he concluded :
[ The ] Qur'an describes the Jews with their own particular degenerate characteristics , i.e. killing the prophets of Allah , corrupting His words by putting them in the wrong places , consuming the people 's wealth frivolously , refusing to distance themselves from the evil they do , and other ugly characteristics caused by their deep - rooted lasciviousness … only a minority of the Jews keep their word .
…
[ A ]ll Jews are not the same .
The good ones become Muslims , the bad ones do not . [ 10 ]
The Jews and Christians who do not believe in Muhammad as a prophet will find that " shame is pitched over them ( like a tent ) wherever they are found , except when under a covenant ( of protection ) from Allah and from men . " [ 11 ]
This probably refers to the dhimma , the contract of protection under which Jews and Christians live as subject peoples under Islamic rule .
However , even if one understands it to refer to the covenant that God made with the Jews to give them the Land of Israel , the Qur'an also says that they broke their contract :
So for their breaking their compact we cursed them and made their hearts hard , they perverted words from their meanings ; and they have forgotten a portion of that they were reminded of ; and thou wilt never cease to light upon some act of treachery on their part , except a few of them .
Yet pardon them , and forgive ; surely God loves the good - doers . [ 12 ]
Being thus accursed , the Jews are not the legitimate heirs of the promise made in Qur'an 5:21 .
The true heirs are those who have remained faithful to God ( i.e. , the Muslims ) , not those whom he has cursed ( i.e. , the Jews ) .
Even this is not the full extent of Qur'anic anti-Semitism .
The Muslim holy book contains many passages that form the foundation for hatred of Jews that exists independently of the actions of contemporary Jews or the State of Israel .
The Qur'an portrays the Jews as the craftiest , most persistent , and most implacable enemies of the Muslims .
The Qur'an is supplemented by the Hadith , purported records of the Prophet Muhammad 's actions and sayings .
Some hadith predict that at the end of the world , in the words of Ibn Kathir , " the Jews will support the Dajjal ( false messiah ) , and the Muslims , along with ' Isa [ Jesus ] , son of Mary , will kill the Jews . " [ 13 ]
The idea that the end times will be marked by Muslims killing Jews comes from Muhammad himself , who said , according to a hadith , " The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews , and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say : ' O Muslim !
There is a Jew hiding behind me , so kill him . ' " [ 14 ]
This hadith is a favorite motif among contemporary jihadists .
On March 30 , 2007 , Hamas spokesman Ismail Radwan said on Palestinian Authority television :
The Hour [ resurrection ] will not take place until the Muslims fight the Jews and the Muslims kill them , and the rock and the tree will say : " Oh , Muslim , servant of God , there is a Jew behind me , kill him !
Continuation of Qur'anic Anti-Semitism
A vivid illustration of the Qur'an 's enmity toward the Jews and how contemporary Islamic spokesmen echo it , came in 2004 from Islam Online , a website founded by the internationally influential Sheikh Yusuf al - Qaradawi .
Although Qaradawi has won praise from Islamic studies professor John Esposito for engaging in a " reformist interpretation of Islam and its relationship to democracy , pluralism , and human rights , " that reformist impulse does not carry over to Qaradawi's view of Jews ( he has justified suicide bombings against Israeli civilians ) , or the anti-Semitism he has allowed to be published on Islam Online . [ 15 ]
In 2004 , the site posted an article entitled , " Jews as Depicted in the Qur'an , " in which Sheikh ' Atiyah Saqr , former head of the Fatwa Committee at Al - Azhar University and Seminary in Cairo , depicts Jews in a chillingly negative light , illustrated with quotations from the Qur'an . [ 16 ]
Among other charges he levels at the Jews , Saqr says that they " used to fabricate things and falsely ascribe them to God " ; they " love to listen to lies " ; they disobey God and ignore his commands ; they wish " evil for people " and try to " mislead them " ; and they " feel pain to see others in happiness and are gleeful when others are afflicted with a calamity . " [ 17 ]
Though he offers many examples of the alleged evil traits of the Jews supported by the Qur'an , Saqr does not mention the notorious Qur'anic passages that depict an angry God transforming Jews into apes and pigs .
The first of these depicts God telling the Jews who " transgressed the Sabbath …
Be you apes , miserably slinking ! "
It goes on to say that these accursed ones serve " as a punishment exemplary for all the former times and for the latter . " [ 18 ]
The implication is that today 's Jews are bestial in character and are the enemies of God , just as the Sabbath - breakers were .
Tantawi has called Jews " the enemies of Allah , descendants of apes and pigs . " [ 19 ]
Saudi sheikh
Abd al - Rahman al - Sudayyis , imam of the principal mosque in the holiest city in Islam , the Masjid al - Haram in Mecca , has said in a sermon that Jews are " the scum of the human race , the rats of the world , the violators of pacts and agreements , the murderers of the prophets , and the offspring of apes and pigs . " [ 20 ]
Yet Hussaini actually asserts that the Muslims who oppose his perspective have no Qur'anic case , asserting that " no fundamentalist , no matter how hard they try , can overrule the existing tradition to say there is , in fact , an Islamic counterclaim to Eretz Yisrael . " [ 21 ]
The Qur'anic evidence above explains why mainstream Muslim voices and prominent Muslim leaders never invoke Qur'an 5:21 to argue that Muslims ought not to be waging jihad against Israel .
This is simply not a mainstream view or one that most of those who are familiar with the totality of the Qur'an would ever advance .
It gives Jews and all supporters of Israel hope , yes , but only a false hope .
Muslims can get beyond anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism only by forthrightly acknowledging that the Qur'an and Sunna do , indeed , teach that the Jews are accursed and are to be warred against .
Muslims must explicitly formulate theological frameworks that reject literalism in this regard .
To deny that the Qur'anic evidence actually says what it does , however , is only to allow the endemic and pandemic problem of Islamic anti-Semitism to continue unchallenged .

In August , Dutch anti-piracy outfit BREIN won its case against The Pirate Bay , and the court ordered the defendants to block access to Dutch visitors .
The case was appealed today and rightly so .
It appears that the evidence presented by BREIN was faked in an attempt to mislead the court .
In an attempt to take The Pirate Bay offline , BREIN took three of the tracker ’s ‘ founders ’ to court .
BREIN won the case and Fredrik , Gottfrid and Peter were ordered to block Dutch users within 10 days or face thousands of euros each day in penalties .
After the verdict was made public , the three defendants immediately announced they would appeal .
Lawyer Ernst - Jan Louwers represented the Pirate Bay defendants in the appeal today , and he revealed that BREIN brought in documents that are apparently faked in an attempt to mislead the court .
BREIN submitted a report on Reservella to the court .
Reservella is the company that planned to sell The Pirate Bay to Global Gaming Factory , and according to the report that was apparently written by UK company Experian , one of the Pirate Bay founders is the company ’s CEO .
However , the defendants lawyer presented several facts that showed that the report is not what it claims to be .
“ The report is an attempt to mislead the Court , ” Louwers said , adding that the Court should reject it since it ’s “ fake , deceptive and completely unreliable . ”
The lawyer went on to argue that the anti-piracy outfit is merely trying to save face , and that BREIN will do all it can to succeed in their crusade against the three defendants .
He then goes through a list of several points that show why the evidence is fabricated .
First of all , the Experian report on Reservella seems to have copied the Whois data of the Pirate Bay domain .
It lists defendant Fredrik Neij as the CEO and the formation date for the company is identical to the date when the domain was registered .
This makes no sense , as Reservella was founded less than a year ago according to official information from the Seychelles Government , and Neij is not linked to the company as the report claims .
If that is n’t enough already , the company ID number as reported in the document is incorrect , and the claims that Fredrik Neij is a citizen of the Seychelles are even more absurd .
Former Pirate Bay spokesman Peter Sunde is outraged by BREIN ’s attempt to cheat their way into a victory , and will press charges against BREIN and its director Tim Kuik .
“ I consider what they have done as criminal .
Much more severe than any ‘ aiding with potential copyright infringement ’ could ever be , ” he writes , adding “ Maybe then we can finally have the real criminals shut down and put in jail ! ”
In his writeup Peter himself sums up various other points showing that the document is apparently false .
All in all there seems to be clear evidence that the report is highly inaccurate .
Even if all the errors can be attributed to the research company , BREIN should have known better since they have been tracking The Pirate Bay ’s every move for years .
Developing story …
KABUL ( AP ) 
The head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan acknowledged Sunday that there was " widespread fraud " in the August presidential election but refused to give specifics or lay blame to avoid influencing the ongoing recount .
Kai Eide appeared before reporters to respond to allegations by his former deputy , Peter Galbraith , that the Norwegian diplomat had sought to cover up evidence of massive fraud allegedly committed on behalf of President Hamid Karzai during the Aug. 20 balloting .
Galbraith , the top- ranking American in the U.N. mission , was fired Sept. 30 by U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon after the widely publicized dispute over how to deal with the fraud charges , which threaten to discredit both the Afghan government and the international strategy for combating the Taliban insurgency .
During a news conference , Eide said he could " only say that there was widespread fraud " and that " any specific figure at this time would be pure speculation " until the recount is complete .
Eide said Galbraith 's allegations against him " have affected the entire election process . "
Eide was flanked by ambassadors from the United States , Britain and France in a silent show of international support for the U.N. mission and its embattled leader .
Last week , Galbraith said he was sticking by his allegations .
He accused the United Nations of failing to exercise its responsibility to oversee the Afghan elections , adding that " the flaw that took place in Afghanistan was preventable . "
Eide addressed Galbraith 's allegations in detail for the first time Sunday .
He said he decided to try to open a number of polling stations that Galbraith wanted closed because of security concerns .
The American said keeping them open risked fraud .
But Eide argued that shuttering them would deny a large number of people the opportunity to vote and create " an important element of potential instability in the country . "
Many stations in insecure areas in the south returned results that have been deemed suspect .
Eide also addressed a charge that he tried to cover up fraud by telling U.N. staffers not to pass on information they had about ballot - stuffing or low - to - nonexistent turnout in some areas .
Eide said that the U.N. gave election officials and fraud investigators all the information that they deemed credible , but did hold back information that came from phone calls from second - or thirdhand sources , many of whom changed their accounts repeatedly .
Eide said both he and the U.N. mission have suffered from the accusations , and that the charges have also " heightened the temperature " of discussions about elections , making it harder to convince people that the process will be fair .
The Obama administration and its international allies had hoped that the election would produce a legitimate partner to help reverse the gains made by the Taliban , which have exploited public discontent over corruption and lack of services .
Instead , the election has widened the gap within the coalition of Afghan groups that oppose the Taliban .
Preliminary results released last month showed Karzai winning the election without about 54 % of the vote .
But a recount , expected to be completed this month , would force a runoff with second - place finished Abdullah Abdullah if Karzai 's totals fall below 50 % .
Once the election results become clear , President Barack Obama is expected to complete a review of Afghan strategy and decide whether to accept a recommendation by his top commander here , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , for up to 40,000 more troops .
Among the options under review is a plan to maintain U.S. troop numbers at their current levels and shift the focus to missile strikes and special operations against al - Qaeda leaders , including those sheltering in neighboring Pakistan .
In the latest fighting , U.S. and Afghan forces stormed a mountainside compound in eastern Afghanistan before dawn Sunday and killed more than a dozen militants in a compound used by an al - Qaeda figure , according to the U.S. military .
The fighting in eastern Kunar province started overnight when the troops pushed into targeted compound in the hopes of capturing those inside , said U.S. military spokeswoman Capt .
Elizabeth Mathias .
They quickly came under fire , sparking a clash in which more than 12 insurgents died , she said .
There were no casualties among the allied troops or civilians , Mathias added .
Provincial government spokesman Gen. Khalilullah Zaiyi said 18 insurgents were killed in the fighting in Mano Gai district , in the Pech valley .
Some militants were detained , Mathias said .
She did not have information on whether any al - Qaeda operatives were among those captured or killed , nor did she give the name of the terrorist commander believed to have used the compound .
Also Sunday , four Afghan soldiers were killed when their vehicle struck a bomb in Paktia province , police said .
Meanwhile , the Japanese foreign minister made a surprise visit to Kabul on Sunday , making him the first Cabinet - level official of Japan 's new government to visit Afghanistan .
Katsuya Okada was meeting with President Hamid Karzai and other officials during the one - day trip to discuss the strengthening of Japanese efforts to help stabilize the country , said Fumio Shimizu , Japan 's deputy ambassador in Afghanistan .
Japan has committed to paying all Afghan police salaries for six months and is funding a number of infrastructure , agriculture and education projects .
But Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has said his government plans to discontinue Tokyo's refueling mission in the Indian Ocean in support of U.S. - led forces in Afghanistan by January .
" Sending troops is not necessarily the only way you can provide support , " Okada said .
Okada is scheduled to head to Pakistan when he leaves Kabul .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Global warming will leave the Arctic Ocean ice - free during the summer within 20 years , raising sea levels and harming wildlife such as seals and polar bears , a leading British polar scientist said on Thursday .

Peter Wadhams , professor of ocean physics at the University of Cambridge , said much of the melting will take place within a decade , although the winter ice will stay for hundreds of years .
The changes will mean the top of the Earth will appear blue rather than white when photographed from space and ships will have a new sea route north of Russia .
Scientists say evidence of melting Arctic ice is one of the clearest signs of global warming and it should send a warning to world leaders meeting in Copenhagen in December for U.N. talks on a new climate treaty .
“ The data supports the new consensus view -- based on seasonal variation of ice extent and thickness , changes in temperatures , winds and especially ice composition -- that the Arctic will be ice - free in summer within about 20 years , ” Wadhams said in a statement .
“ Much of the decrease will be happening within 10 years . ”
Wadhams , one of the world ’s leading experts on sea ice cover in the North Pole region , compared ice thickness measurements taken by a Royal Navy submarine in 2007 with evidence gathered by the British explorer Pen Hadow earlier this year .
Hadow and his team on the Catlin Arctic Survey drilled 1,500 holes to gather evidence during a 280 - mile walk across the Arctic .
They found the average thickness of ice - floes was 1.8 meters , a depth considered too thin to survive the summer ’s ice melt .
Sometimes referred to as the Earth ’s air - conditioner , the Arctic Sea plays a vital role in the world ’s climate .
As Arctic ice melts in summer , it exposes the darker - colored ocean water , which absorbs sunlight instead of reflecting it , accelerating the effect of global warming .
Dr Martin Sommerkorn , from the environmental charity WWF ’s Arctic program , which worked on the survey , said the predicted loss of ice could have wide - reaching affects around the world .
“ The Arctic Sea ice holds a central position in our Earth ’s climate system .
Take it out of the equation and we are left with a dramatically warmer world , ” he said .
“ This could lead to flooding affecting one - quarter of the world ’s population , substantial increases in greenhouse gas emissions .... and extreme global weather changes . ”
Britain ’s Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband said the research “ sets out the stark realities of climate change . ”
“ This further strengthens the case for an ambitious global deal in Copenhagen , ” he added .

You have until October 28 to learn French because French TV France 2 ’s “ L’objet du scandale ” with Guillaume Durand will air a historic debate over the official version of the 9/11 events .
On one side : 4 people with the hard task to defend the official version .
On the other side , Jean - Marie Bigard , Mathieu Kassovitz , Éric Laurent and special guest Niels Harrit will tell France and the world why they do n’t support the official theory and why they find it disturbing .
This is already a victory for the Bigard / Kassovitz camp who challenged the French media to organize a fair debate over 9/11 after being vilified by many French journalists because of their positions on 9/11 .
They have been called many names and even received death threats .
But no serious journalist was able to challenge them on their positions and to seriously make a case against them based on facts .
Now will be their chance , and like Bigard mentions in the below video , “ good luck to them . ”
This is also a victory for the 9/11 truth movement because the official US government conspiracy theory is supposedly not debatable .
That ’s what Bush said .
That ’s also what Obama said many times .
The very fact of having a real open public debate , wherever that is , proves that the subject is debatable .
And it needs to be debatable .
The day we stop debating important topics is the day we surrender freedom .
Not only is it debatable , but the 9/11 truth movement is growing faster than ever — worldwide — and nothing will stop it .
We hope a fair public debate will soon move to the US media as well .
Pundits recently backed away from Charlie Sheen ’s offer of a fair public debate on CNN ’s Larry King .
Are they scared they wo n’t be able to defend the official conspiracy theory ?
This time Bigard and Kassovitz will both be in very good company .
Éric Laurent , great reporter and international politics specialist wrote a book in 2004 called “ La face cachée du 11 septembre ” ( lit : the hidden face of September 11 ) .
He also wrote books about the Kosovo war , the banking system , oil , Iran , along with the worldwide acclaimed Bush ’s Secret World : Religion , Big Business and Hidden Networks .
Laurent appeared on the French TV talk show “ Tout le monde en parle ” with Thierry Ardisson in 2003 , in which he defended his book on 9/11 in a 32 minute interview .
A great interview , with great questions and a fair treatment .
Laurent knows about 9/11 inside and out .
As if these three were not enough to create a very powerful debate over 9/11 , a special guest will join their rank .
Niels Harrit , is the lead author of the 2009 published scientific paper entitled Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe along with scientists Kevin Ryan and Steven E. Jones .
It will be Harrit ’s first appearance on French TV .
We wish good luck to all participants and we can’t wait to see this debate .
Most of all , we really would appreciate those who will defend the official theory to actually try to support their claims with real arguments instead of throwing names at their opponents .
Calling us Holocaust deniers wo n’t help your cause .
The Holocaust was real .
Rwanda was real .
And if there is one thing you should learn from these horrible events is that questioning the power structures is a sign of health in a society .
So get over it , we ’ve heard you say it many times over and just between us , you look anything but intelligent when you hide behind this mask .
We will try to post the video here with English subtitles as soon as we can after the debate .

( I ’ll be posting this on both of my blogs , since it ’s partly about health , partly about politics and current events .
Pretty convenient for me , since I ’m in play rehearsals and do n’t have as much time to write . )
There are a lot of proposals to “ fix ” health care floating around , all with various cost predictions – most of which are probably about as accurate as the predictions provided by a magic 8 ball .
Whatever price tags you ’re seeing now , just triple them in your mind .
That way , the actual cost will only be double what you expected .
I have my own proposals to address the rising costs of health care .
And unlike the proposals coming out of Congress , I do n’t need thousands of pages to explain them .
Better yet , my proposals are n’t based on the theory that the best way to bring down health - care costs is to spend another trillion dollars or so .
In fact , my proposals would actually save the taxpayers money .
Seriously , they would .
And I ’m not talking about the kind of pie - in - the - sky “ We ’ll spend billions on this program now , but it will save money in the long run ” nonsense that usually comes out of Washington .
( If just half of the “ save money in the long run ” predictions I ’ve heard in my lifetime had come true , we ’d be running huge surpluses right now . )
Nope , I ’m talking about real , spend - less - money savings .
Here ’s how the federal government can realize those savings :
Stop telling us what to eat , and admit that the earlier attempts to tell us what to eat were a mistake .
Stop subsidizing corn and other grains .
These proposals would produce both short - term and , more importantly , long - term savings .
The short - term savings are based on a principle of economics that ’s so stupidly simple , even the average congressman can grasp it : if you stop spending money , you end up spending less .
For decades , the federal government has been employing people whose job is to tell us what they think we should eat .
In addition to their salaries , taxpayers also pay for the dubious research they conduct and the mountains of literature they produce and distribute .
I say “ dubious ” because the primary purpose of the current research seems to be to prove that their previous advice was n’t actually wrong … which it was .
We do n’t need these people .
And for reasons I ’ll explain shortly , we would ’ve been better off without them .
The taxpayers also foot the bill for billions of dollars in annual farm subsidies .
These subsidies were enacted in the 1930s as a “ temporary ” solution to the price shocks and instability of the Great Depression – which apparently never actually ended .
In our continuing efforts to lift ourselves out of the Great Depression , we now provide wealthy corporations like Archer Daniels Midland with subsidy payments .
Same goes for “ farmers ” like Scottie Pippin , the former star forward for the Chicago Bulls , who without government checks would no doubt have to strap his trophies to the top of a rusty old truck and seek work in California .
But even as the country struggles to escape the effects of the stock market crash of 1929 , it ’s probably time to end those subsidies .
And we’d be healthier if we did , again for reasons I ’ll explain shortly .
In the meantime , we ’d save billions – instantly .
Once again , for the benefit of any federal policy - makers out there : if you stop spending money , you end up spending less .
The long - term savings are based on another economic principle that ’s not stupidly simple , but merely logical , so at this point we ’ll probably lose any government policy - makers who happen to stumble across the blog .
But here it is anyway :
When lots and lots of people get sick , health - care costs go up .
I know , I know … you probably thought we ’re just as healthy as ever , but the insurance companies keep jacking up their rates simply because nobody ’s had the political will to stop them .
The fact is , the profit margin in the health - insurance industry is pretty much what it ’s always been : around 3 % .
( Actually , a report I saw recently said it ’s dropped to about 2.2 % in recent years . )
Insurers are n’t creating the spiraling cost of health care ; they ’re just passing it along to us in the form of spiraling premiums .
We can sit in town hall meetings and shout all we want about pre-existing conditions , levels of reimbursement , co-payments , deductibles , portability , public versus private competition , and the true number of the uninsured .
None of that changes the simple fact that when people get sick enough to require medical care , someone is going to pay for it .
Shifting the cost of being sick from one group of people to another does n’t reduce the cost ; it just sticks someone else with the bill .
The only way to reduce to the real cost of medical care ( aside from refusing to treat sick people , which is n’t a good idea ) is to require a lot less of it .
We require much more medical treatment than we should largely because the federal government told us what we should eat , and by gosh , we listened .
As you already know if you ’ve seen Fat Head or read Good Calories , Bad Calories , the only macronutrient we consume more of now than in previous generations is carbohydrates .
( We ’ve actually cut back on fat , especially men . )
This did n’t happen by accident .
It was the result of a senate committee on nutrition , headed by George McGovern , who believed everyone should switch to a low - fat , high - carbohydrate diet to prevent heart disease .
Plenty of researchers and scientists , including the head of the National Academy of Sciences , tried to tell the committee they were wrong – but McGovern knew he was right because his own doctor said so .
( With that kind of authority backing you , it ’s just a waste of time to wait for actual scientific proof . )
And so , with a big push from the McGovern committee , the FDA and the USDA , the low - fat , high - carb diet became the rage .
We became a nation of fat - phobic grain and sugar eaters .
Meanwhile , the federal government made it cheaper for us to eat sugar and starch through massive grain subsidies .
As the old farmer told the stars of King Corn , “ You could n’t make any money growing corn if not for the government payments . ”
Those government payments are the reason we feed cattle corn instead of letting them eat grass as nature intended .
Subsidies are the reason high - fructose corn syrup is in half the products you ’ll find in the grocery store , including bread .
Dirt - cheap subsidized corn is the reason for Big Gulps and endless refills at the soda dispenser .
And here ’s the happy result of all that government involvement in food and nutrition :
Nearly one - fourth of all senior citizens have type II diabetes .
Just think of the impact on Medicare expenditures .
Diabetes is n’t just a disease ; it ’s a driver of many other ailments , including kidney failure , blindness , heart disease , cancer and Alzheimer ’s .
Diabetes puts senior citizens in wheelchairs .
It puts them in assisted - care facilities .
And as a harbinger of health - care disasters yet to come , type II diabetes is even showing up in adolescents now .
That never used to happen .
You are paying the toll for the diabetes epidemic even if you ’re in fine health and have private insurance .
Your taxes , of course , pay for all those diabetes - related Medicare costs – but so do your health - insurance premiums , whether you realize it or not .
You ’ve probably seen media stories about hospitals charging $ 10 for an aspirin .
Perhaps you were even outraged at the very idea .
But there ’s a reason hospitals put $ 10 aspirins on your bill : Medicare , expensive as it is , does n’t actually cover the full cost of many treatments hospitals are required to provide .
So they make up for the Medicare deficits with $ 10 aspirins and other exorbitant charges – all billed to your insurance .
Much , if not the majority , of our ever - increasing health - care costs are driven by chronically high blood sugar and diabetes .
But diabetes is n’t like the swine flu .
We are n’t catching it from each other .
We do n’t need to spend billions of dollars to develop a type II diabetes vaccine .
What we need is for officials in Washington to stop beating up on the health - care industry , and instead call a giant press conference to make an announcement like this :
Ladies and gentlemen , the nutrition advice we ’ve been handing out since the 1970s was clearly wrong .
You could even say it was dead wrong .
Saturated fats are not and never have been the cause of heart disease and cancer .
And let ’s face it , fat is delicious .
We scared you away from a taste your body loves , and we feel really stupid about that .
We especially feel stupid about recommending corn-oil margarine .
It tastes awful and it promotes inflammation .
It ’s not a natural food , despite the picture of the hot - looking Native American lady on the box .
It turns out we should have been warning you about sugars and starches all along .
Those are the real problem .
So please , embrace your fatty foods .
Enjoy your meats , your eggs , your cheeses , and be sure to drizzle lots of butter on your vegetables .
We were at least right about the vegetables .
But we were totally wrong about grains .
They ’re not a natural food for humans , and you should try to cut back on them as much as possible .
And to encourage you to do so , we ’re going to cease all farm subsidies so the price of grain - based foods will reflect the actual cost of production .
We suspect a lot of corn farmers will choose to retire or grow other crops , and we wish them well .
Again , we ’re very sorry , and we have all turned in our resignations .
Thank you , and enjoy your dinners .
No , this would n’t solve the problem overnight .
Millions of people are already sick .
Somebody is going to pay to treat them .
But we could at least prevent future generations from developing the same diseases .
That alone would stop the spiral .
Then , with the cost of health care held in check by actual health , we could resume debating about who ’s going to pay for the costs of treating injuries and illnesses that are n’t caused by metabolic syndrome and diabetes .
I have a feeling it would be a much more civil discussion .
Lower bills tend to have that effect on people .
They arrested our friend , so the cannabis celebration was brought inside the Keene police lobby yesterday , as the Sentinel ’s Anika Clark reports :
Supporters of marijuana legalization took their fight with a law directly to the law Sunday as they lit up in the Keene Police Station lobby .
They puffed .
They cheered and laughed .
They left .
But not before one of them yelled at a department employee who was working behind a front window .
One of the rally - goers had just been released without being charged , after being arrested for smoking what he said was nothing more than mint leaves .
But activist Sam A. Miller said , “ What they smoked inside the police station today , that was real . … I could tell from the smell . ”
Activists have gathered for more than a week to smoke at 4:20 p.m. — a number identified in marijuana subculture with the drug .
Sunday ’s police station smoke circle sparked no arrests from a department Lt. Shane C. Maxfield said had a limited staff on a Sunday afternoon .
Meanwhile , as the activists vow to continue their pro-pot protest indefinitely , local residents are left to wonder :
What ’s next ?
“ I really believe tomorrow will be a bigger and better day for entertainment , ” said Patricia A. Byrnes , whose apartment is near the rally ’s epicenter on Central Square .
Byrnes has been watching the protest daily and says she does n’t like what she sees .
“ All I feel is sadness that we have come to this point , ” she said .
“ There ought to be a better way of getting our points across . ”
One way , according to Mayor Philip Dale Pregent , is working through the established channels of government .
“ At this point , I do n’t think that ( the activists ) have a real mission … in regard to how they want to go about helping change the situation , ” he said Sunday evening .
“ They ’re just doing a lot to attract attention right now , and I do n’t think that that gains them much of anything . ”
But with attention comes awareness , according to Miller , a Free State Project activist who has been filming the protests .
Asked why he does n’t move his protest efforts to the seat of government in Concord , Miller said , “ I ’m here . ”
He also pointed to the back - and - forth discussions the Keene City Council has had about sending a resolution to urge lawmakers to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana as evidence of how sluggish the governmental process can be .
While councilors spend weeks debating whether to send what he called a “ letter , ” Miller said , “ people are sitting in concrete boxes in prison over this drug war that ’s a failure . …
I do n’t want to believe that the best answer is to use the system and hope that in the next decade or so , these laws will be repealed . ”
Free State Project activist Ian Bernard echoed him .
“ I can say that for me and many other activists , we ’re not going to beg permission from politicians to live as free men and women , ” he wrote in an e-mail .
“ We ’re just going to do it . ”
In the meantime , the spectacle has drawn a refrain of honking from drivers showing their apparent support .
But it ’s also drawn flak from others .
Erik Olsen , a 17 - year - old student at Keene High School who checked out Sunday ’s rally , said that while he supports marijuana legalization , the belligerent attitude many activists have taken toward police “ is not even remotely helping the cause . ”
Resident David Curran rode his bike to the police station Sunday and told activists he does n’t have a problem with their movement .
But he described the torrent of profanity he ’d just had to listen to as they marched past his house .
Jay Patterson , 35 — who is about to move to downtown Keene from Peabody , Mass . — watched the gathering from the corner of Central Square Saturday .
“ I think that it ’s a little inappropriate , ” he said .
While people have the right to freedom of expression , Patterson added , “ the getting - in - the - cops ’ - faces stuff is n’t really that cool . ”
A man , who declined to identify himself but said he formerly served in the military , also took issue with the American flag that ’s been tagged with the words “ Legalize Freedom ” and what appears to be a marijuana leaf .
“ They need to stop , ” he said .
“ That flag is freedom , not marijuana . ”
But many activists show no signs of letting up .
A man who has declined to identify himself — but was the one who put the 4:20 sign on the Central Square statue and was the person arrested and then released Sunday — indicated to WMUR - TV that the protest would continue “ every day until they end the drug war and free all drug prisoners . ”
There has been talk of pro-pot activists attending the next scheduled City Council meeting on Oct.
1 . And according to Bernard , a Keene contingent will be heading to Manchester to take part in a similar protest he said is starting today .
“ I do n’t imagine it will be too popular when it ’s really really cold out , but it ’s my understanding that it ’s intended to continue on a daily basis ” in the Elm City , he said .
And as activists ’ smoking slogan proclaims them to be lighting up “ in remembrance of lost liberties , ” one 18 - year - old Keene resident said he’d be protesting until they ’re regained .
The teenager — who said he ’d been in and out of the court system on marijuana - related charges since he was 14 — declined to give his full name .
“ It ’s my body , it ’s my choice for me , ” he said of his continued cannabis use .
As for whether he ’ll lose steam when temperatures fall , he said , “ I ’ll put on my coat . ”

Unlike his boss , the Chancellor knows that , now more than ever , the public expects honesty from its politicians about the measures that will be needed to wrench us out of our present economic predicament .
It is always risky for politicians to be candid about the pain that lies ahead , which is why Gordon Brown , Mr Sunshine himself , chose to condemn the Tories in The Daily Telegraph yesterday as " pessimists " , and why the Tories are already embroiled in an argument over their figures with the National Institute of Economic and Social Research .
But the much riskier option , in the wake of the expenses scandal , at a time when the political class is held in wretchedly low esteem , would be to try to conceal the truth , or be , as the late Alan Clark would have put it , economical with the actualité .
At this moment in political history , that would be , to put it mildly , a false economy .
British banks have just five working days to show they have " got it " .
On Saturday , they must submit to the regulator – the FSA – their planned bonus awards , widely estimated to total £ 6 bn .
Prince Andrew may have said in an interview that he regards this sum as " minute in the scheme of things " , but , as the economy still falters and unemployment rises , it was clear last night that the banks will grant themselves their billions in an increasingly hostile atmosphere .
George Soros ( below ) became the latest high - profile figure from the world of finance to condemn the bankers , and call for watertight restrictions on their activities yesterday .
He said : " Banks are actually getting hidden subsidies of enormous amounts because of their ability to borrow at effectively zero , and buy 10 - year government bonds at 3.5 per cent .
So those earnings are not the achievement of risk - takers .
These are gifts , hidden gifts , from the Government , so I do n't think those monies should be used to pay bonuses .
So there 's a resentment which I think is justified . "
And , as increasing numbers wonder why the United States ' decisive action to cap bonuses in firms taking public money has not been matched in Britain , there are now signs of a hardening of attitudes towards bankers inside the City .
The Square Mile grandee Sir David Walker , The Independent on Sunday understands , is now expected to call for them to be banned from paying guaranteed bonuses in his forthcoming report on corporate governance .
He is believed to have been impressed by the growing acceptance among big institutional investors , and even the banks themselves , that paying out huge salaries and bonuses may have exacerbated and contributed to the banking crisis .
One source said : " Everyone knows the levels of bonuses are quite insane .
None of the banks dare break ranks and stop paying such big bonuses because they are frightened traders will jump ship to another bank , or overseas .
That 's why many actually want to be told what to do . "

Sir David , whose report is due on 26 November , has received a flurry of submissions from the industry , most of which have argued for bank boards to take a much tougher line on how pay is structured because , they argue , the big pay awards may have pushed traders – particularly in proprietary trading – to take bigger risks than they should .
Remarkably , many of the complaints he received from the City , including those from non-executive directors on bank boards , were that they felt powerless to stop banks paying out such big bonuses .
Last week , it was reported that Royal Bank of Scotland , which has received £ 20bn of public money and fired 15,000 staff since the start of the recession , aims to pay £ 4 bn - £ 5 bn in bonuses .
Goldman Sachs , which has benefited from US government support , will pay its staff worldwide up to £ 14bn in bonuses , averaging around £ 400,000 for each of its 5,500 London staff .
And ministers have also been contacted privately by bank chairmen and directors asking for guidance on pay because of worries about public hostility over bonus levels .
One banker said : " Many are terrified because they do n't know what to do .
Some want to cut bonuses , but they do n't want to be the first to do it in case it drives staff either to rivals or overseas .
But they also know that changes have to be made and want leadership from government . "
These developments come at the end of a week in which Mervyn King , Governor of the Bank of England , attacked the way banks have exploited being seen as " too big to fail " .
He was critical of how high - risk trading was conducted by banks which knew they could rely on a publicly funded safety net .
" The past two years , " he said , " have shown how dangerous it is to let bankers play with fire . "
His frustration was contrasted with the situation in the US , where regulators last week announced tough , immediate and non-negotiable action on bonuses .
The Federal Reserve plans to regulate bonus payouts from banks forced under its control after they took cash handouts from the bailout programme .
And America's " pay tsar " is looking to impose a cap of $ 500,000 on cash salaries received by executives at affected firms .
Executives seeking more than $ 25,000 in special benefits , such as club memberships or company cars , will have to ask the government for permission .
In Britain , such decisive action has been talked about , but not taken , leaving the Government looking like customers impotently waving their arms while a counter clerk , smug behind the security glass , refuses to correct an error .
Yesterday , Gordon Brown repeated what has so far seemed an empty recital of good intentions and so - far unheeded warnings .
In his weekly podcast , he said : " We must bring financial markets into closer alignment with the values that everybody holds : hard work , responsibility , integrity and fairness . "
The singers from this familiar hymn sheet – Mr Brown , the Chancellor , Alistair Darling , and Lord Myners , the Financial Services Secretary to the Treasury – are relying both on Sir David 's report and the eventual enactment of policies agreed at the G20 .
The UK 's big - five banks and 11 other foreign banks , such as Goldman , have already signed up to FSA and G20 pay - guideline principles , which could see bonuses clawed back in future years .
According to Lord Turner , chairman of the FSA , the regulator has " a range of levers " to block " excessive bonus payments " .
But what these levers are is a mystery to many .
Public impatience with the unhurried progress of such reforms has been rising , and will not have lessened in the past few days with the disappointing news on the British economy .
Far from showing a little growth , as the Treasury expected , it actually shrank , with all that this implies for public finances .
The present record £ 175 bn in net borrowing is likely to rise as tax receipts fall short of predictions , and estimated benefit payments increase .
Overall , the country is now in the longest recession since records began in 1955 .

What is significant about the signals being picked up by this newspaper is that this mood of anger at the bankers , and their disconnection from the world inhabited by the rest of the economy , is being echoed by the likes of Mervyn King and George Soros .
In an interview with the Financial Times , Mr Soros said there was a need to regulate payments to employees , even if that meant banks found it hard to retain talented risk - takers .
He said : " That would push the risk - takers who are good at taking risks out of Goldman Sachs into hedge funds , where they actually belong , because hedge funds take risks with their own capital , not with deposits and not with government guarantees . "
Additional reporting by Greg Walton
Q&A : Why is the bloated bonus culture coming back ?
Why are banks making such huge profits now ?
Because markets are active again .
Interest rates are at a historic low so banks borrow cheap and lend high .
Governments have issued debt , companies have raised capital and got involved in deals again while currency markets have fluctuated .
Banks love volatility – that 's how they can charge their fat fees .
Why have the PM and the Chancellor failed to stop excessive bonuses ?
Because they 've been got at by big investment banks , which have persuaded them that tougher pay regulations will close down the City and force bankers – and their chunky tax receipts – overseas .
Politicians are also waiting for plans such as the G20 guidelines to kick in .
The Financial Services Authority 's proposals , due in January , will force banks to put more money aside as capital , and cut profits paid out in bonuses .
What about the US ?
The US pay tsar , Kenneth Feinberg , will order pay cuts at seven of the institutions that got bail - out cash .
He wants big caps on the total pay of their top 25 executives and another 75 or so other high - earners .
Will this be effective ?
Depends .
Feinberg 's new rules will depress salary levels if they go far enough .
The biggest influence on pay will be if the new G20 rules on linking pay to tougher risk management are adopted .
Will bankers leave in droves if large bonuses are stopped ?
And leave their four - storey comfort zones in Kensington and Chelsea ?
Some will be tempted to leave .
So what ?
How does the bonus system work ?
Typically , top investment banking staff are paid a base salary of £ 80,000 - £ 100,000 a year .
Each banker operates his own profit and loss account that includes the cost of his salary , screens and overheads .
This , together with a share of other corporate costs , is then deducted from the revenue , and he or she will be paid a proportion of the profit .
Should we split banks into retail and investment entities ?
Yes .
At the moment investment banks can use the capital of the retail side of the bank to leverage up their dealings .
The Governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King argued that unless we do split the " casino " activities of investment banks from the utility lending banks , we are heading for another crash .
Do bankers understand the wider impact of their excessive payments ?
Some do , some do n't and many do n't care .
Most think they should be paid as much as they can get away with .
Should a windfall tax be imposed on banks – or bankers ?
No , not yet .
Better to make sure all the latest initiatives from the FSA , G20 and in Sir David Walker 's forthcoming report are put into force as swiftly as possible .
If they are , then there will be tougher capital adequacy ratios , new limits on how boards pay staff and a possible ban on guaranteed bonuses .
Why are banks not lending ?
Because they are terrified sheep .
A decade ago they indulged in a frenzy of lending fuelled by cheap money .
Today , they have masses of cheap money but they do n't want to lend it because they are scared they wo n't get it back .
Margareta Pagano
Is it fair that investment bankers in London will once again pocket vast bonuses when small businesses struggle for loans ?

There was little doubt that Double Fine 's Brutal Legend was going to get slapped with an " M " rating by the ESRB .
This is a game based off of heavy metal culture -- sex , drugs , rock n' roll ... an Iron Maiden album cover brought to life .
So when the ESRB got their glimpse of the game 's juciest bits , they walked away with a lot to say .
In fact , the description found on the ESRB
Web site is without a doubt the longest we 've ever read .
It talks of " ' face - melting solos ' ( literally melting enemies ' faces ) , " and " dominatrixes . "
It mentions main character Eddie Rigg 's hot rod that bowls over enemies , " resulting in blood effects and more heads and limbs getting chopped off . "
There 's an enemy whose tight , bondage gear outfit reveal buttocks and breasts .
The words " f*ck , " " sh*t , " and " d*ck " are tossed around liberally .
In other words , this may very well be the best greatest videogame ever made .
Hit the jump to read the full ESRB description .
This is an action adventure / role - playing game that tells the story of Eddie Riggs , a roadie who is transported to a mythical world of heavy metal rock .
Eddie is armed with a guitar and a double - headed axe , which players can use to slash and dismember enemies .
Players can also perform " face - melting solos " ( literally melting enemies ' faces ) , meet humanoid creatures dressed like dominatrixes and brandishing whips , and liberate an army of rockers from a life of oppression .
Although the storyline is often irreverent and whimsical , the depictions of violence are somewhat intense : Undead humanoids are dismembered with an axe ( sometimes in slow - motion ) ; a " Steel - Quilled Blade " causes human enemies to explode into gibs that rain down ; machine guns , missile launchers , and sub woofers can be used to kill druids and other fantastical creatures .
Eddie can also run over dozens of enemies with his hot rod , resulting in blood effects and more heads and limbs getting chopped off .
During the course of the game , characters sometimes engage in suggestive dialogue intended for comedic effect ( e.g. , " Maybe with all your feedback , you guys could just blow me over the gorge " and " Playtime 's over .
Now let 's get back to the orgy " ) .
Players will also encounter " Skull Rakers " clad in bondage gear and amazon - like warriors dressed in leather outfits that partially reveal buttocks and breasts .
Strong profanity ( e.g. , " f*ck , " " sh*t , " and " d*ck " ) can be heard in the dialogue
Medicare Physician Services
GAO
August 2009
GAO found that Medicare beneficiaries experienced few problems accessing physician services during its period of study .
Very small percentages of Medicare beneficiaries–less than 3 percent –reported major difficulties accessing physician services in 2007 and 2008 .
The proportion of beneficiaries who received physician services and the number of services per beneficiary served increased nationwide from April 2000 to April 2008 .
Indicators of physician willingness to serve Medicare beneficiaries and to accept Medicare fees as payments in full also rose from 2000 to 2008 .

Comment :
By Don McCanne , MD
In the debate on health care reform we hear that physicians are leaving the Medicare program because they cannot continue to accept the low fees paid by the government .
Not true , according to this new GAO report .
Physicians are more willing to serve Medicare beneficiaries and to accept Medicare fees as payments in full .
Some might use this finding to support a public option paying Medicare rates , but it is a much more powerful argument when used in support of a single payer , Medicare for all , national health program .
Unlike the private insurance plans , Medicare pays enough , but not too much , though appropriate revisions are a continuing work in progress – as it should be .
Taking an iconic video game character and reverse - engineering it as a prototype is a delicate task .
Let 's look at a few of the concepts drawing that eventually led to the Big Daddy of BioShock 2 .
These concept art shots appeared yesterday on The Cult of Rapture BioShock website , they were presented as a way to sort of get into the heads of the developers at 2 K Marin , seeing what they kept and what they scrapped in coming up with the final design for the game 's protagonist .
Between the first BioShock and the sequel , you 've seen a lot of concept art for Big Daddies .
The logic behind this concept art went beyond different designs and suit combinations .
The artists had to imagine what the very first Big Daddy would have on him — this Big Daddy had to feel like he was a rough draft or a work - in - progress , an amalgam of Big Daddies to come .
The first Big Daddy was a test case , and in making the perfect prototype , 2 K Marin drafted many , many prototypes themselves .

Almost perfect .
Chris Broughton , 28 , made national news when he showed up to protest a speech by President Barack Obama in Phoenix , Arizona with an AR - 15 automatic rifle slung over his shoulder and a handgun .
While Broughton claims that his ( apparently legal ) actions were not meant to threaten the president , there was more to the story than a single citizen ’s dubious actions and pronouncements .
Local print and television coverage in Phoenix , and bloggers all over the country , have led the way on an interesting and important story of religion and politics that has been almost entirely ignored by the traditional media .
Here is what they missed .
The night before Broughton ’s fifteen minutes of fame , he attended a fiery Sunday sermon by his pastor , Rev. Steven L. Anderson , at Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe , Arizona .
Rev. Anderson , also 28 , explained not only “ Why I Hate Barack Obama , ” but also why he and God both want the president dead .
“ When I go to bed tonight , ” Broughton ’s pastor declared , “ Steven L. Anderson is going to pray for Barack Obama to die and go to hell . ”
He even goes so far as to claim that :
God appointed [ Obama ] to destroy this country for the wickedness of the United States of America .
God appointed him because that ’s what our country has turned into .
That ’s who we deserve as a president .
And yet , even though we may deserve Obama , Anderson urges his congregation to pray for the president ’s death , issuing imprecatory prayers and repeatedly asking God to kill the president .
Most dramatically , and in an interesting shift to the passive voice , he said Obama “ ought to be aborted ” because the president is pro-choice , and therefore a “ murderer . ”
Despite all this Anderson has insisted to reporters that he was not calling for vigilante violence .
Ditto for Broughton , who told a reporter for the Phoenix New Times : “ I do n’t care how God does it , I ’m not going into further detail than that , ” said Broughton .
“ It would be better now than later . ”
“ However it happens , I ’m going be happy that it happens , ” he continued .
“ I ’m gonna be a happy man … I would rejoice . ”
While our national media and political culture often succumb to the temptation to classify people who take extreme political acts , particularly of violence , as lone nuts , in fact such people are not necessarily either nuts or alone .
Even when acting individually ( as Chris Broughton did when he brought an automatic weapon to an Obama speech ) , they are frequently operating out of a particular religious , cultural , and political context .
Absent the distraction of a horrific crime , the story of Chris Broughton and Steven L. Anderson provide a perfect example .
In fact , Broughton had discussed his act in advance with Anderson , who praised him afterwards , writing “ Good job , Chris ! ”
At a teabagger rally in Arizona , Anderson denounced both the Republican and Democratic Parties , declaring without a hint of irony that Obama , the “ worst president ” in American history , is “ selling us into slavery and serfdom . ”
Further research revealed Anderson ’s involvement in the Constitution Party , the third largest “ third party ” in the United States .
In a June speech to the state convention of the Arizona Constitution Party , he introduced himself ( in addition to being pastor of a church ) as the owner of a “ firearms business ” operating in “ several states ” and closed with a plea for an American government based on God ’s laws as set out in the biblical book of Deuteronomy .
The Constitution Party ( which has tended to be the political home for people with views strikingly similar to Anderson ’s ) is frequently dismissed as a fringe party of little electoral consequence , even though its significance lies elsewhere .
It is in fact a steaming hotbed of far - right factions with theocratic , vigilante , and sometimes revolutionary ideas whose like - minded members get together to make their plans , just like any other organized faction in American public life .
The party says it is 100 % pro-life and pro-gun .
Many of the party ’s early leaders were Christian Reconstructionists , or were heavily influenced by Reconstructionism , including party founder and three - time presidential candidate Howard Phillips .
Reconstructionism is a theocratic systematic theology whose seminal thinker , the late R.J. Rushdoony , spoke at the Constitution Party ’s founding convention and was a longtime advisor to Phillips .
Reconstructionism was one of the significant theological catalysts for the modern religious right ; a movement , like other social and political movements throughout history , that has transcended party identification .
The Constitution Party has also been a political home to a wide array of militia proponents , including one of the movement ’s leading theorists , Larry Pratt head of Gun Owners of America ; Rev. Matthew Trewhella , founder of Missionaries to the Preborn ( who has urged parents to buy each of their children “ an SKS rifle and 500 rounds of ammunition ” for their church militia ) ; Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry ( who ran as a Constitution Party candidate for Congress in 1998 , but who has since become a Republican ) ; and even Rev. Michael Bray , a convicted felon and longtime leader in the Army of God .
Like the Reconstructionists , Anderson believes in the death penalty for homosexuality , and the death penalty for abortion ( which is of course understood to be murder ) .
And these points are highlighted in the sermon he gave the night before Obama ’s speech in Phoenix :
… you ’re going to tell me that I ’m supposed to pray for the socialist devil , murderer , infanticide , who wants to see young children and he wants to see babies killed through abortion and partial - birth abortion and all these different things — you ’re gonna tell me I ’m supposed to pray for God to give him a good lunch tomorrow while he ’s in Phoenix , Arizona ?
Nope .
I ’m not gonna pray for his good .
I ’m going to pray that he dies and goes to hell .
But no one should come away from this story without a sense of the depth and breadth and virulence of the views being expressed or that Anderson sees his views as anything other than the truth and an effort at common sense .
Fortunately , diligent bloggers have been on the case , notably TPM Muckraker , Crooks and Liars ’ Dave Neiwert , Pam Spaulding , PFAW ’s Right Wing Watch , and the excellent reporting of the Phoenix New Times .
Interestingly , nationally syndicated liberal radio talk show host Alan Colmes conducted a particularly penetrating interview .
When Colmes asked Anderson what his response would be if someone killed Barack Obama in response to his sermon , he replied : “ I would n’t cry about it . ”
Colmes said to Anderson : “ You want the president dead … ” “ Absolutely , ” Anderson agreed .
“ Now that does n’t mean I ’m gonna kill him .
But you know what ?
I believe he should reap what he ’s sown . ” “ [ Obama ] deserves to die , because he ’s a murderer . ”
“ I ’m not going to take responsibility for other people ’s actions , ” said Anderson .
“ You know , it ’s ridiculous how I ’m supposed to be held accountable for what anyone who listens to my sermons does . ”
In fairness , Anderson says he also thinks that George W. Bush and Dick Cheney also deserve to die for their alleged crimes of torture and the deaths of a million Iraqis in a war he opposes .
But lest anyone think that such views betray a kind of moderation , his views on homosexuality , which may one day make him a contender for the mantle currently held by the infamous Rev. Fred Phelps , will probably check any such temptation :
Anderson claims among other things that all gay people are “ predators ” who are “ infecting our society ” ; that they are on a “ rampage ” ; that the disease is “ exploding in growth . ”
He claims that homosexuals “ recruit ” via , among other things , child rape and molestation and that God commanded that homosexuals “ should be taken out and killed . ”
“ [ E ] very good king of Israel , ” he claims , either “ got rid of ” or “ exterminated … the sodomites … ”
He rhetorically asks “ how do we stop it ? ” remarking only that “ they have no natural predators , ” leaving it to the imagination of the listener as to what might be done .
He is an artful demagogue who seems to be well aware of the line between wishing homosexuals and the president to be murdered , and directly calling on anyone to act .
In the course of another sermon he angrily denounces the United Methodist Church because , as he puts it , “ ten percent of their preachers are queers ” :
“ I ’ll stand behind the pulpit call them the fag that he is .
I am here to preach the Bible . ”
Anderson ’s anger is hair - raising as he shouts : “ I am not going to stand by … and let faggots run the church !
It ’s bad enough that we ’ve got a bunch of faggots running the government ! ”
It might be tempting to dismiss Anderson as the meaningless leader of a small congregation whose post - controversy service drew , by his own account , only forty - nine .
But he says such extraordinary things all the time — as his effective and demagogic appearances at teabagger rallies and other venues of the far right have shown — and it does n’t take large numbers of people , acting singly or in cell groups , to commit horrific acts of violence in God ’s name .
Virulent ideas , and a will and a capacity to carry them out , are all that matter .
We have seen many such cases in recent years in which at some point , actions meet the demands of the words of leaders with particular ideas about what God may require .
Late - Night Snacks : Worse Than You Think |
EVANSTON , Ill . ---
Eat less , exercise more .
Now there is new evidence to support adding another " must " to the weight - loss mantra : eat at the right time of day .
A Northwestern University study has found that eating at irregular times -- the equivalent of the middle of the night for humans , when the body wants to sleep -- influences weight gain .
The regulation of energy by the body 's circadian rhythms may play a significant role .
The study is the first causal evidence linking meal timing and increased weight gain .
" How or why a person gains weight is very complicated , but it clearly is not just calories in and calories out , " said Fred Turek , professor of neurobiology and physiology in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and director of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Biology .
" We think some factors are under circadian control .
Better timing of meals , which would require a change in behavior , could be a critical element in slowing the ever - increasing incidence of obesity . "
The findings could have implications for developing strategies to combat obesity in humans , as the United States and the world battle what has been called an " obesity epidemic . "
More than 300 million adults worldwide are obese , including more than a third of American adults .
Details of the obesity study , which was led by Turek , was published online by the journal Obesity .
" One of our research interests is shift workers , who tend to be overweight , " said lead author Deanna M. Arble , a doctoral student in Turek 's lab .
" Their schedules force them to eat at times that conflict with their natural body rhythms .
This was one piece of evidence that got us thinking -- eating at the wrong time of day might be contributing to weight gain .
So we started our investigation with this experiment . "
Simply modifying the time of feeding alone can greatly affect body weight , the researchers found .
Mice that were fed a high - fat diet during normal sleeping hours gained significantly more weight ( a 48 percent weight increase over their baseline ) than mice eating the same type and amount of food during naturally wakeful hours ( a 20 percent increase over their baseline ) .
There was no statistical difference between the two groups regarding caloric intake or the amount of activity .
Over a period of six weeks , both groups of mice were allowed to eat as much high - fat diet as they wanted during their daily 12 - hour feeding phase .
( Much like many humans , mice have a preference for high - fat food . )
Since mice are nocturnal , the 12 - hour feeding phase was during the day for those fed during normal sleeping hours and during the night for those fed during naturally wakeful hours .
Food was not provided during the other 12 hours of their day .
Our circadian clock , or biological timing system , governs our daily cycles of feeding , activity and sleep , with respect to external dark and light cycles .
Recent studies have found the body 's internal clock also regulates energy use , suggesting the timing of meals may matter in the balance between caloric intake and expenditure .
The researchers next plan to investigate the molecular mechanisms behind their observation that eating at the " wrong " time can lead to weight gain .
The National Institute on Aging and the National Institute and the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute supported the research .
The title of the Obesity paper is " Circadian Timing of Food Intake Contributes to Weight Gain . "
In addition to Turek and Arble , other authors of the paper are Joseph Bass , Aaron D. Laposky and Martha H. Vitaterna , all from Northwestern .
History remembers Benito Mussolini as the Italian dictator who ruled his country with fear and forged a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany .
But now a previously unknown area of Il Duce 's CV has come to light : his brief career as a British agent .
Archived documents have revealed that Mussolini got his start in politics in 1917 with the help of a £ 100 weekly wage from MI5 .
Mussolini , then a 34 - year - old journalist , was not just willing to ensure Italy continued to fight alongside the Allies in World War I by publishing propaganda in his paper .
He was also willing to send in the boys to '' persuade ' ' peace protesters to stay at home .
Mussolini's payments were authorised by Sir Samuel Hoare , an MP and MI5 's man in Rome , who ran a staff of 100 British intelligence officers in Italy at the time .
Cambridge historian Peter Martland , who discovered details of the deal , said : '' Britain 's least reliable ally in the war at the time was Italy after revolutionary Russia 's pull - out from the conflict .
Mussolini was paid £ 100 a week from the autumn of 1917 for at least a year to keep up the pro-war campaigning - equivalent to about £ 6000 ( $ A10,400 ) a week today . ''

Maoists have a presence in more than 200 districts of India The Indian government has agreed on a new tactic to fight Maoists who are operating in several states .
Officials say state police are to take the lead in co-ordinating operations against the Maoists , while central forces are only to lend assistance .
The decision came hours after at least 17 policemen were killed in a battle with Maoist insurgents in the western state of Maharashtra .
India says that Maoist insurgents pose its biggest security threat .
They operate in many states and say they are fighting for the rights of the poor and landless .
Remanded Maoists have a presence in over 223 of India 's 600 - odd districts across 20 states , according to the government .
Around 70,000 central paramilitary troops along with elite commando and special forces will be deployed in the upcoming operation against the rebels .
The troops will be provided cover by the army and armoured air force helicopters .
A senior government official told the BBC that the operation is to be launched within weeks to " wipe out the top leadership " of the rebels and secure some 40,000 sq km of territory that is being held by them .
The government believes there are less than 20 top rebel leaders , nearly 30 commanders , and some 12,000 cadres .
A senior home ministry official pointed out that last month the government managed to arrest top Maoist leaders Amit Bagchi and Kobad Ghandy , taking the total number of arrested " politburo members " to seven .
The Maoist leadership has consistently maintained that their strength has been " overestimated " by the government .
What is not contested is that areas where the insurgents wield most influence are mostly poor and dominated by tribes people .
They are also areas widely seen as being rich in mineral wealth which the Maoists say is being handed over to corporate firms while the poor remain deprived .
A massive security operation against the rebels will be launched soon
The government has come to the conclusion that development work can take place in the affected areas only after the rebels are defeated .
A recent statement by the Maoist leadership called upon its armed cadres to paralyse government functioning , attack and kill police and paramilitary soldiers and destabilise administrative functioning .
There have been over 1,400 cases related to violence by Maoists between January and August , according to official records .
Nearly 600 civilians have died over that period .
In the latest attack on Thursday evening , a group of Maoists attacked a police station in Gadchiroli district in Maharashtra .
At least 17 policemen , including a top commander , were killed in the battle .
It was not clear whether the rebels suffered any casualties .
Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh told police chiefs last month that a campaign against the rebels had failed to produce results .

Love world - wide popular lahmacun aka Turkish pizza ?
Flatbread topped with spicy ground meat and veggies ?
These Mini Lahmacuns are mini versions of it with a much softer crust .
They make a perfect appetizer !
Origin Of Turkish Lahmacun
This is one of the most popular traditional Turkish fast food .
It ’s originally from an Eastern city of Turkey , Sanliurfa .
Now you can find lahmacun restaurants all around the country and not surprisingly , the owners of almost all these restaurants are from Sanliurfa .
And generally they serve lahmacun only , not any other dishes .
As people from this small city love hot pepper , the original lahmacun is too hot for the people in the West of Turkey to eat .
Then they decided to serve two versions of lahmacun in their restaurants in this part of the country : with and without hot pepper .
In these restaurants , there are also red pepper flakes in small bowls on each table .
If you are n’t sure whether you can eat hot lahmacun or not , you can order one without pepper and when it comes to table , you can sprinkle red pepper flakes according to your taste .
Types Of Lahmajun
The shape of lahmacun may change depending on its region .
Originally , classic lahmacun is so thin with a crispy texture and as big as a serving plate .
It may be either round or oval in shape .
However , in the region of Mersin , there is a very small version of lahmacun .
It is called fındık lahmacun because of its small size .
Findik lahmacun is a term used in other parts of the country to differentiate between two versions .
Findik ( fındık ) means hazelnut and this word is generally used to show how small something is .
This lahmacun is as small as a saucer and I find it cuter than the big one .
And unlike the big version , findik lahmacun is not crispy as it ’s not that thin .
I do love both versions , but this small one is more advisable to make at home .
You can eat it with a big pleasure even the following day as it ’s still soft .
However , the big and thin ones are better eaten once they are cooked .
Cultural Background Of Mini Lahmacuns
In Mersin ( A Southern city of Turkey ) and its small towns like Tarsus , there are special bakeries just for cooking lahmacun in stone ovens .
Women prepare the topping mixture at their homes and generally their husbands take the mixture to such a bakery and ask when it will be ready .
They come back to take the cooked lahmacuns at the time he is given .
He pays the money and leaves a few of them to bakery people .
As you see , this is an easy way of making lahmacun , you just prepare the topping and the rest of the work is done for you at bakeries .
However , if you ’re not living in that part of Turkey , but still want to make findik lahmacun , you ’ll find its recipe below .
This is again a recipe from mom .
I learnt this recipe as a child as we used to make lahmacun together at the weekends .
Serve As An Appetizer
Even though the origin of findik lahmacun is Tarsus / Mersin , it ’s now served in most restaurants in big cities , but not as a main dish .
Because of its small size , people generally have it as an appetizer while waiting for their order .
As a person who knows the original version , I must say that these small appetizers are not completely the same as the original one .
They are as crispy as big lahmacun whereas the original findik lahmacun has a softer texture as I explained above .
While there are six to ten findik lahmacuns in a portion in Tarsus , restaurants in other cities serve one or two before the main dish .
Different From Pizza
You may find that lahmacun looks like a pizza , but there is a big difference between them .
A pizza is sliced and it can be eaten with a knife and fork while you do n’t need knife or fork to eat lahmacun .
Put some parsley leaves , squeeze lemon , wrap it and it ’s ready to eat .
Although it is served sliced in some restaurants today , it ’s not the right style to eat lahmacun .
I think this shows an inevitable effect of some international dishes on local dishes .
How To Make Mini Lahmacuns
First , prepare the yeast .
Mix the yeast with warm water in a small bowl and wait until you see foams .
Put the flour in a mixing bowl and pour the yeast in the center .
Mix them together using a fork .
Then , add in milk , olive oil and salt .
Knead it until you have a soft dough .
If the water is not enough , add little more .
It should n’t be too sticky .
Now , put the dough in a bowl , cover it and let it rest for about 15 minutes .
Meanwhile , prepare the topping mixture .
Mix the ground beef with all the topping ingredients .
Now , assemble the dough and the topping .
Pick small pieces from the dough and roll them out one by one as big as a saucer .
They must n’t be too thin .
Place them on a lightly oiled baking sheet .
Divide the topping mixture on these evenly pressing on them with your hand .
And cook them for 10 minutes .
Serve hot with some parsley leaves and lemon wedges .
We put a few parsley leaves on it , squeeze lemon on it and fold it to eat .

Sanjeev Arora , MD is professor of medicine , director of Project ECHO , and executive vice - chair of the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center , Albuquerque , NM .
Please give me an overview of Project ECHO .
Project ECHO stands for Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes .
Our mission is to develop the capacity to safely and effectively treat chronic , common and complex diseases in rural and underserved areas and to monitor outcomes .
It ’s funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , the New Mexico legislature , and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation .
We started this project about five and half years ago to treat hepatitis C , which is a global health problem affecting 170 million people worldwide , of which 3 - 4 million are in the US .
In New Mexico , we had 28,000 patients who had hepatitis C . In 2004 , less than 5 % had been treated because there were n’t enough specialists in rural areas to treat them .
There were 2,300 prisoners who were diagnosed with hepatitis C and none had been treated .
We had the highest rate of chronic liver disease / cirrhosis deaths in the nation , so it ’s twice the national average .
The disease was treatable and it can be cured .
Hepatitis C has six main kinds of virus .
If people had Genotype 1 , we could cure them about 45 % of the time .
If they had other kinds of genotypes , we could cure them about 80 % of the time .
The problem was that if patients were given this kind of treatment , which consisted of weekly injections and daily pills , they got severe side effects .
100 % of patients became anemic .
Their white cell count went down .
About a quarter of them got depressed .
Primary care doctors did n’t feel comfortable treating this disease .
There were n’t any specialists in the rural areas and in prison .
That was the problem that we were trying to solve .
Rural areas of New Mexico are a very underserved area for healthcare services .
Thirty - two of 33 New Mexico counties are listed as Medically Underserved Areas .
Fourteen are designated as a Health Professional Shortage Areas .
We said we could use this new model to develop the capacity to safely and effectively treat hepatitis C in all areas in New Mexico and to monitor outcomes .
We felt , if we could do that , then we would have a model to treat complex diseases in rural locations and developing countries .
We developed a partnership between the University , the prisons , health department , Indian Health Service , and community clinicians who were willing to treat hepatitis C in rural areas .
ECHO ’s model is based on four key ideas .
One is the use of technology to leverage scarce healthcare resources which may exist only at a university or in a tertiary care center .
We use a disease management model , where we focus on improving outcomes by reducing variation and processes of care .
We create a best practice protocol for treating hepatitis C and then we share it widely with our partners .
We all manage off the same label .
This is to improve quality .
The third key idea is case - based learning .
That ’s when a rural provider goes to medical school or residency .
They learn from real patients and mentors .
When they go to the rural area and a new disease like hepatitis C gets discovered in 1989 , they ’re expected to read books and then treat this disease .
They do n’t feel comfortable because it ’s a very complicated disease .
So we said , “ Why should we not bring case - based learning back into the lives of the rural provider by co-managing patients with them ?
We have a centralized database to monitor outcomes . ”
We train physicians , nurses and pharmacists in hepatitis C .
Then we conduct these telemedicine clinics , which we call Knowledge Networks .
Many rural clinicians sign on simultaneously onto an interactive video network with specialists from the university .
One by one , they present patients with hepatitis C to experts at the university .
The specialists at the university help them manage these patients , tell them what to do , what tests to order , what treatments to take , and help them manage side effects of treatment .
They come every week , once a week , for a couple of hours and present their patients .
This creates a learning system which we describe as a Learning Loop , where these clinicians learn from each other as much as they learn from university specialists .
They also learn from short didactic presentations .
We give the rural providers no -cost CME credits .
We give nurses credits for participation because they are learning from experts at the university .
We like to improve their professional satisfaction and we give them access to multiple specialists at the same time .
Everybody gets the chance to present their patients .
We use all different kinds of technology , including videoconferencing bridges , videoconferencing recording devices , and electronic records to enhance communication .
We described this first for hepatitis C , but it ’s applicable to any disease that is common , management is complex , new treatments are coming , high societal impact , if there ’s a serious outcome of a untreated disease , and if there ’s effective treatment .
We have a few concepts that make Project ECHO work .
One is we are trying to provide the same level of care at a community health center as we give at a university .
We can do this by means of technology , best practice protocols , and case - based learning .
From the Pareto Principle , the 80/20 rule , if you create Knowledge Networks for just a few diseases , you can have a huge impact on healthcare .
You do n’t need to have Knowledge Networks for 500 diseases to have a huge impact .
A few diseases account for most of the morbidity and mortality .
We use the concept of a Force Multiplier .
Because of the specialist shortage in rural areas , we can use existing community clinicians like nurse practitioners and physician assistants and enable then to provide the same level of care as specialist , therefore multiplying the capacity for specialty care in rural areas .
One challenge that comes up is that there is not only a shortage of specialists in rural areas , there ’s also a shortage of primary care doctors .
This is the next generation of Force Multiplier , which essentially shows you that we are training now community health workers and medical assistants and nurses also in these chronic diseases so they can be part of the chronic disease management team to help the primary care clinicians .
Existing methodology for training and development of widely distributed learners has major limitations .
They tend to be expensive and out of sight , out of mind .
You call them in for a conference into your city , spend thousand of dollars , they go back , and they forget what you have taught them .
In our model , we help them apply this knowledge and , using technology , we can do this training at a much lower cost .
Also , we do n’t have the problem of knowledge obsolescence because it ’s a weekly interaction where we are slowly making them experts .
We also have a prison peer education program where we train prisoners in New Mexico to teach other prisoners about hepatitis C .
We have 15 separate areas in which we have Project ECHOs going on : hepatitis C , cardiac risk reduction , asthma , rheumatology , chronic pain , substance abuse , high - risk pregnancy .
Some are supported by the Robert Wood Johnson foundation .
We have many others .
Overall , we have more than 140 programs around the state .
With hepatitis C , we have done 375 HCV Telehealth Clinics .
More than 3,500 patients have entered the HCV disease management program .
We have provided thousand of hours of CME credit at no cost to clinicians .
We ’ve taken community clinicians and assessed their skills and abilities on different domains of hepatitis C care .
On the question of , “ What is your ability to treat Hepatitis C patients and manage side effects ? ” , on a scale of one to seven , they were two out of seven when they started and it went up to 5.2 in 12 months alone .
So , very major improvements occur as they engage with us in this learning process .
Asking if they could serve as a local consultant for hepatitis C in their clinic and area , it went from 2.4 to 5.6 .
Overall competence went from 2.8 to 5.5 .
When asked if this kind of activity is of moderate or major benefit to them , it ranged from 94 % to 98 % .
Subsequently , we did a hepatitis C trial in which we compared the care in the university to the care in the rural areas and prisons by primary care clinicians .
Rural primary care clinicians deliver hepatitis C care that is as safe an effective as a university clinic .
We can also improve access to care for minorities .
Almost 69 % of our patients in the ECHO groups are minorities , versus much fewer in the university .
The potential benefits of the model are improved quality and safety , improved access for rural and underserved patients , workforce training and force multiplier , improving professional satisfaction and retention , cost effective care by avoiding excessive testing and travel , preventing cost of untreated disease , for example , liver transplant , and integration of public health .
In 2007 , applications were sought for disruptive innovations in healthcare , new models that would change healthcare nationally and globally .
This was sponsored by ASHOKA Foundation and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in a disruptive innovations contest .
Project ECHO was selected a winner among 307 applications from 27 countries .
We were one of three winners selected .
Using technology , best practice protocols , and co-managing patients with case - based learning is an effective way to safely and effectively treat chronic , common and complex diseases in rural and underserved areas and to minor outcomes .
This is the first program I ’ve heard of where the goal was n’t just to turn over patients to experts sitting on the other end of a monitor , but rather to educate and make local practitioners self - sufficient .
Has anybody else done that ?
We do n’t know of anybody that has done it the way we do it .
Basically , that is why it was selected , probably , as the most disruptive innovation in healthcare .
Commonly , technology has been used specifically in healthcare by telemedicine , where there ’s a specialist at the university and there ’s somebody in the rural area connected by camera .
That does n’t lead to the force multiplication that we ’re talking about .
We ’re interested in long - term capacity expansion of care .
In the passage of time , these healthcare providers become less and less dependent on us as they become good at it .
We are not aware of this model anywhere .
Healthcare reform always talks about who ’s going to pay and who will be covered , but nobody has addressed the issue of having enough practitioners of the right types in the right places .
Are you getting interest from the government or insurance companies about how they might use this model ?
We have not focused so far on publicizing at all .
This is the first initiative .
We got a very large grant from Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and they hired a PR firm , which I think reached you .
So I think that this is just the beginning , really .
Very few people know about this program in the way you have just learned about it .
We have treated tens of thousands of patients through this methodology , but our focus has been on service , not so much on policy work or convincing healthcare providers .
But we hope that some of the work you and your colleagues will do will help us get there .
We think that this is a very valuable tool for healthcare reform because we can train , not only primary care physicians , but community health workers to become experts in very common diseases like obesity and hypertension and diabetes .
Because of the shortage of primary care clinicians , how do you take care of all the chronic disease that is going on everywhere ?
We thought , if we trained the teams of the primary care clinicians in these very common problems , we ’ll do a better job .
When a community health worker is used as a sole diabetes educator — that is , no doctor , no nurse , no certified diabetes educator — HbA1c can drop by 15 % .
Comparing the care provided by a community health worker and a nurse practitioner in the community versus a university - based primary care clinician , the community - based care does twice as good .
We asked ourselves , “ Why is this community health worker intervention effective ? ’
These people live in the community .
They understand the culture .
They walk two moons in the patient ’s moccasins .
They appreciate the economic limitations of the patient and they often know family and can engage other the social resources .
But most importantly , they spend more time with the patient .
If you are trying to change a diabetic or and obese patient ’s behavior and doctor spends four 15 - minute sessions with them over the course of a year , it ’s hard to do that , whereas somebody like community health worker can spend seven one - hour sessions for one - tenth of the cost and actually make a bigger impact .
We have developed two tracks .
The first one has already launched , the second one is in preparation .
The first one we call the CHW Specialist Training Track , where we take these community healthcare workers and train them in diabetes , obesity , hypertension , cholesterol , smoking cessation , and exercise physiology .
Then , over time , they start interacting with us on these Knowledge Networks until they really become experts in a very narrow area .
This specialty CHW program uses low - cost technology to take specialty training to CHWs , promotoras , CHRs , and medical assistants where they live .
It has a very narrow focus but deep knowledge , standardized curriculum .
We give them ongoing support via Knowledge Networks .
They become part of the disease management team .
Basically , the point that I was trying to make to you with reference to your question is , in healthcare reform , we have to train a much larger health workforce so that doctors work in teams , rather than individuals trying to solve the big problem .
I ’m interested in your statistic on how well the community - based caregivers were able to do what they do .
Do you think that would be true outside your population of the underserved or on a Indian reservation ?
Is it translatable to the rest of the United States ?
There are some places in the United States where you have a highly trained work force , for example , Manhattan or Boston .
There are hundreds of certified diabetes educators .
So the moment somebody comes to you , you can refer them to a nutritionist , diabetes educator , or podiatrist .
You do n’t need a community health worker — you ’ve got super experts doing all this work .
But when you go to a prison , a rural area , an Indian Health Service facility , there are n’t any certified diabetes educators .
They do n’t exist .
The nurses there are not experts and there ’s a shortage of primary care clinicians who are trying to see 25 patients a day and do it all themselves .
In that setting , or in inner city areas whether it be south of Chicago or Bronx … I think where there ’s a shortage of these healthcare resources , these models are particularly effective .
We ’re not trying tot change healthcare where there ’s doctors on every street corner and every other health professional fully supplied .
Our mission is to provide world class healthcare in cost effective ways in areas where there is n’t enough healthcare workforce .
It seems that there ’s not much ego involved .
You ’re not saying that your organization or your doctors have to get all the credit .
You ’re just saying , “ We ’re going to help you and help the patients . ”
It must be hard to convince people that you do n’t have a vested interest .
I think the fundamental issue with Project ECHO , as you have alluded to , is that we have to be willing to break the monopoly of knowledge that exists .
The knowledge gets monopolized otherwise .
Breaking that monopoly and sharing it freely for public benefit , without necessarily charging anybody for it , doing it at low cost on public dollars , would be much more cost effective .
What if President Obama came to you and said , “ This works .
This is where we want to go .
We want to take this national . ”
How would you go about doing that and what would it cost ?
I think the first thing that would happen is one would have to create some kind of a federal granting mechanism to academic medical centers around the country , in which we would essentially ask them to consider a different mission .
Right now , academic medical centers do three or four things .
They basically provide very high quality tertiary care , but they also train doctors and nurses .
These federal grants that would be provided to these academic medical centers would ask them to essentially refocus their mission to training a much larger workforce in America to manage chronic disease in a highly cost - effective way .
That is , finding out what is the lowest cost person who can be trained to provide education , behavioral change , and foot exams to diabetics in rural areas without having to have them travel .
Right now , people in New Mexico have to travel sometimes five hours to come to an academic medical center .
Most of the academic medical centers are being financed right now by the clinical revenue generated by all these patients travelling .
If you redirect clinicians , these highly educated specialists , from providing direct care one on one to instead enabling the workforce around the state in their rural areas to provide world class care by setting up these Knowledge Networks , you can actually get a much more cost effective healthcare system and get much better outcomes at much lower cost .
It means re-thinking how we do healthcare , so it would mean reconfiguration .
In order for the federal government to be able to support such an effort , they would need to support this transition in the mission of academic medical centers .
I think if federal granting mechanisms were available , large numbers of institutions like ours would jump at the opportunity because they want to do this kind of work if they are made financially whole .
Steve Ballmer Says Blu Ray Coming to XBox [ Update ]
[ Update : As noted by XBox Live ’s Larry Hyrb , Microsoft “ have no plans for Blu - Ray ” on the XBox 360 and states that Ballmer ’s quote was in reference to Blu - Ray add - ons for the PC .
Looks like the roller - coaster keeps on… rolling . ]
In an interview with Gizmodo , the Microsoft boss confirmed a tidbit that many thought was possibly dead : Blu Ray is coming to the XBox 360 in the form of an add - on accessory .
Stating that “ … you ’ll be able to get Blu- ray drives as accessories ” when asked if the format will be included in a future revision the news came as a bit of a shock to a Microsoft spokesman , who reiterated the company ’s drive towards streaming and the Zune video store above all .
Ballmer is known to drop company information at inopportune times , often blowing cover on upcoming products like the Zune revisions or Natal release dates .
We ’ve contacted Microsoft for a follow - up comment .

Portsmouth have confirmed Avram Grant has returned to the club as director of football .
Director of football role confirmed
Portsmouth have confirmed Avram Grant has returned to the club as director of football .
revealed earlier that Grant was in talks with Pompey and now they have confirmed his return to Fratton Park .
Grant served in that role for just over 12 months alongside former manager Harry Redknapp before he departed for Chelsea in 2007 .
Grant eventually became Chelsea manager , succeeding Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge , and he guided the Blues to the UEFA Champions League final where they lost to Manchester United on penalties .
He left Chelsea soon after defeat in Moscow and he has not worked in football since , despite numerous links to jobs at both domestic and international level .
But less than 48 hours after Ali Al - Faraj took over from Sulaiman Al - Fahim , he has made his first major appointment by bringing in Grant .
Grant , who has signed a three - year contract with the South Coast club , revealed his delight at returning to Portsmouth .
" I am happy to return to the best league in the world , the English league , " he told Israeli website
At the start of one email , he admits he is going to use Google Mail to " keep my diary " as he does n't want to use work email " any more . "
He also admits that the stress over the health of the funds caused difficulty sleeping , and that he was taking Wellbutrin , a medicine use to treat depression .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
If you hold a Discover credit card , you 're in luck -- the company has decided to freeze interest - rate hikes until a new credit card consumer protection bill takes effect in February .
Chuck and Jeanne Lane of Ohio have excellent credit , but their monthly credit card bill more than doubled .
Bank of America was the first company to freeze its rates .
Both moves come after outrage over credit card companies jacking up rates , increasing minimum payments and raising penalty fees before the new consumer protection law -- which would bar sudden increases -- is phased in .
Rep. Betsy Markey , D - Colorado , and 17 other lawmakers sent letters to credit card banks asking them voluntarily to freeze their rates while Congress decides whether to move up the phase - in date for the new law to December .
Markey said a CNN report about Ohio couple Chuck and Jeanne Lane inspired her to act .
The Lanes said they did everything right but felt bankrupted by a sudden change in their credit card payments .
Watch more on the credit card outrage »
The Lanes have a low - interest Chase credit card that was sold as a way to consolidate large debts and pay them down responsibly over time .
The Lanes showed CNN that they have excellent credit , have never been late with a payment and in the last two years cut their outstanding balance in half .
They said they were shocked when Chuck opened their online statement to discover Chase had driven up their monthly payment from $ 370 to $ 911 .
" I was devastated , " Chuck Lane said .
When Lane called the bank to complain , he was told he could continue to make his old payment if he agreed to an ever - increasing interest rate .
" I told them this was the worst economic time in history practically , " he said .
" I work for a small company .
We have laid off 30 percent of our work force .
I just took a 10 percent pay cut this morning , and this is what you are going to do to us ? "
A Chase spokeswoman said the higher rate had nothing to do with the Lanes ' credit or payment history , but rather that the company doubled the minimum payments for more than 1 million cardholders in August because it wants them to pay down more of their principal .
In a statement to CNN , the company said tens of millions of Chase loans " have been paid back in less than 24 months " but a small percentage of customers have not made as much progress and " our desire is to have these balances paid back in a reasonable period of time . "
Joe Ridout , an advocate with Consumer Action , said , " Truly , this is the the single most abusive credit card change in terms that I 've ever seen . "
Ridout described the tactic as bait - and - switch because Chase sold the cards as low interest and now is making the card unaffordable to many customers unless they switch to a higher interest rate .
" This is a very bogus compromise , and what the bank should really do is honor their original promises . "
Ridout said .
Chase told CNN it has no plans to follow Discover 's lead .
Wells Fargo plans to raise credit card interest rates 3 percent .
Consumer Action is fielding hundreds of complaints from consumers who are seeing their banks raise rates , minimum payments and penalty fees before the new law takes effect .
" It 's really touched off a chase to the bottom among credit card banks , " Ridout said , " because they know that after that date it will be much more difficult to change the terms when a cardholder pays on time and commits no infractions . "
But the industry insists it 's not trying to skirt the new law .
Scott Talbott , vice president with the Financial Services Roundtable , said the companies he represents are " struggling in a tough economy and trying to provide credit for consumers . "
The reasons the rates are going up or credit lines are decreasing are based on two factors : a change in behavior -- a missed or late payment , or exceeding credit limits ; and the economic times .
" We 're in a recession , so the general risk of nonpayment has increased across the board , so credit card companies are adjusting to that risk by increasing interest rates or decreasing credit lines , even if the customer has a perfect history , " Talbott said .
" A very small percentage may see an increase in their interest rate or a decrease in their line of credit . "
Besides the letter from Markey and her colleagues , Congress is looking at taking other action .
Reps .
Barney Frank , D - Massachusetts , and Carolyn Maloney , D - New York , have introduced legislation that would move up the date when the new protection laws take effect from February 22 to December 1 .
Banks said they need more time to update their computer programs to comply with the regulations .
And the Federal Reserve -- which decides the fine points of how the companies should comply with the law -- has yet to issue the final regulations .
Earlier this week , Sen. Carl Levin , D - Michigan , and three other lawmakers asked the Federal Reserve to begin collecting data on credit card practices so changes can be monitored and so Congress can see if card companies comply with the new law .
Some of this basic data -- such as the different terms offered to consumers , what credit costs consumers and how available is it -- has never been systematically collected .
And Congress will have another chance to beef up consumer protections when it takes up financial regulatory reform this year .
Lobbying by the financial industry is intense .
And Frank 's committee already has excluded a provision that the Obama administration proposed , which would have guaranteed consumers clear , simple options to choose from when they 're shopping for credit cards , mortgages and other credit products .
The Lanes said they 're deciding between paying the new minimum on their Chase card , or paying for surgery Jeanne needs next month and supporting Chuck 's son in college .
Jeanne Lane said she feels taken advantage of .
" I 've had this card since the early '90s , and I 've never missed a payment .
I have excellent credit , " she said .
She said she 's angry with her bank : " They have no respect for the American people .
All they think about is the almighty dollar for themselves . "
CNN 's Kevin Bohn and Emily Sherman contributed to this report .
All About Credit Card Debt
If you ever looked for song lyrics online , you know how most lyrics sites are .
Plenty of ads , popups , silly scrolling flash gadgets , bad punctuation , and no easy way to send in corrections .
Why not apply to lyrics the same community - driven editing model that has made Wikipedia so successful ?
LyricWiki.org has done exactly that , and more .
They have provided an API , making it easy for media players to query the database and fetch the lyrics for a specific song .
To get an idea of this project ’s success , check out these stats .
At the time of this writing , LyricWiki is the fifth largest MediaWiki in existence , and the largest wiki that is not a Wikipedia or Wiktionary .
What an inspiring example of a community built around the ideals of improving content and making information available .
What could go wrong ?
Well , how about this .
Who owns the copyright on song lyrics ?
Right , the artist who wrote them .
And who represents the artist ?
Right , a record company .
And what do record companies do to nice sites like LyricWiki ?
The following message appeared in the lyrics applet of my beloved Amarok earlier this week :
Unfortunately , due to licensing restrictions from some of the major music publishers we can no longer return lyrics through the LyricWiki API ( where this application gets some or all of its lyrics ) .
My first thought when seeing that was , “ Huh ?!
It used to work yesterday . ”
Apparently , less than 24 hours have passed between the announcement that developers need to change their applications , and the moment the LyricWiki API actually stopped working for retrieving lyrics .
In a way , this is a good thing .
I hope a lot of users put the pieces together and figured out who is really to blame .
Now let ’s see how Amarok handled the situation .
Within 12 hours , the bug report had a patch .
In the next two hours , the patch was tested , and a glitch was found and fixed .
The next day ( still less than 24 hours from the time the bug was reported ) , the patch was pushed to Git .
As an Amarok user observing this process from outside , I thought the turnaround time was pretty darn good !
Unfortunately , getting this fix to the users was not as quick and painless .
Since lyrics fetching is done in a script , there is no need to recompile Amarok .
Furthermore , we have KNewStuff for installing and updating scripts ( among other things ) .
So we are just a step away from allowing users to fix the lyrics problem using Amarok ’s Script Manager .
Why not take it ?
( Besides the fact that the script is not on kde - apps , another minor issue is that it only works for Amarok 2.1.1 and trunk .
Because of this , the script needs modifications to work with Amarok 2.1 , which is still shipped by Kubuntu .
But nothing that ca n’t be fixed in code in 5 minutes . )
Congrats to the Amarok team for being so close to greatness !
Amarok was one of the apps that switched me towards KDE in my early days with Linux ( the other one was K3B ) .
So I ’m glad to see it rocking even harder today .
Now let me return to LyricWiki for a minute .
Can someone enlighten me as to why the music publishers would impose such a restriction on them ?
If I were an artist and you came asking for my lyrics , I would gladly give them to you and thank you for listening to my stuff .
I ’ve heard of people selling music , but … selling lyrics ?!
I hope that as technology makes recording and distribution cheaper , more artists will take matters into their own hands and release their stuff independently .
PS .
If you are reading this on Planet KDE and wondering who I am , Hi !
I am doing a GSoC project in Akonadi / KMail , mentored by Thomas McGuire .
I may provide an update about that later , if the mood strikes .

We love beautiful photography .
In photos , beauty does n’t always come from an eye - catching combination of colors .
Also crucial are perspective , angle , composition and , most importantly , the idea behind the shot or the situation in which the shot was taken .
One interesting trend we have noticed recently is the use of a bird ’s - eye view to take photographs .
Modern photographers love to experiment with things and observe how people interact with their work .
Although not yet the most common trend , still , as new design styles come up and more and more photographers notice and make use of them , it promises to be an interesting area .
In this showcase , you ’ll find a variety of highly creative , beautiful , unique and inspirational photographs taken with a bird ’s - eye view .
We ’re not looking for you to follow any specific trend .
Rather , the aim here is to stimulate your creativity and inspire your imagination to forge your own photographic trend , because your work represents you and your brand .
By Yann Arthus - Bertrand
For those who do n’t know what a “ bird ’s - eye view ” is in terms of Web design , it is basically a view of an object from above , as though the observer were a bird .
It is often used to make blueprints , floor plans and maps .
The term is also used to describe oblique views , drawn from an imagined perspective .
Throughout history , great artists have always found new ways to express their creativity and spark new trends and techniques that set their work apart from the rest .
Defining art has become more critical because it is now more than ever a mode of communication or , more specifically , a well - defined platform for creativity .
There is no “ good ” or “ bad ” in art , only “ different . ”

How To Take Bird ’s - Eye Shots
You ’ll need to do two things to take photographs from the air .
You ’ll need to get the camera in the air , and then you ’ll need to trigger the shutter .
Platforms for bird ’s - eye photographs include fixed - wing aircraft , helicopters , balloons , blimps and dirigibles , rockets , kites , poles , parachutes , space satellites , etc .
Of these many possible ways , few are very common for taking such shots .
Only two of them are actually popular : balloons and kites .
Option 1 : A Balloon
Put your camera on a balloon .
Aerial photography from a blimp or balloon is a unique approach to getting difficult shots between ground level and 1,000 feet ( 300 meters ) .
Balloon photo systems are built with weight and ease - of - use as priorities .
Keeping weight to a minimum is necessary to reduce the size of the balloon required .
And make sure the equipment can be operated by one person .
You just need to hang your camera and trigger device below the balloon and wait for the right angle .
To read more , please check out the following articles :
Get on a balloon yourself .
The hot - air balloon is the oldest successful human - flight technology .
A hot - air balloon is just a big bag made of fabric in a neat shape .
Applied heat makes the gas inside expand and forces out some air .
This makes the air inside hotter and thinner .
With colder , heavier , denser air around it , the balloon now has buoyancy and can lift off .
To read more , please see the following article :
Option 2 : A Kite
Kite aerial photography .
Kite aerial photography ( or KAP ) uses the lifting power of a kite to provide an aerial camera platform .
From the air , the camera gains a new and refreshing perspective .
KAP seems to give the most compelling images from heights below those normally reached by aircraft .

If you ’ve been hurt in a serious accident , the physical pain is often just the beginning .
Spiraling medical bills , lost wages , insurance companies denying payment can all work together to make recovering from an injury all the more difficult .
If your injuries were the result of someone else ’s negligence , you need legal counsel .
The Grand Junction personal injury attorneys at Killian Davis Richter & Mayle , P.C. will make sure you get the compensation you deserve for your injuries .
We strive to provide effective and compassionate legal representation for every client in every case .
What Are the Most Common Causes of Injury ?
Unintentional personal injury is one of the leading causes of injury and death in the United States .
Nationally , unintentional injury is the fourth leading cause of death , responsible for over 130,000 deaths in 2013 .
Common causes of serious injury include :
Motor vehicle accidents
Bicycle accidents
Asbestos
Slip and falls
The debate over the best way forward intensifies in Washington .
Two key voices on the Hill and two experienced military leaders weigh in on the direction a new war strategy should take : Sen. Carl Levin ( D - MI ) ; Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) ; Gen. Barry McCaffrey ( Ret. ) ; and Gen. Richard Myers ( Ret. ) .

For quick clean ups , get some stainless steel wipes .
They 're sold at Target , Wal - Mart , etc ...
You just wipe in the direction of the grain and the fingerprints should be gone in seconds .
I also use the stainless steel spray , that works really well too .
It seems to put a coating on the surface so it does n't get so dirty so quickly .
I would n't use anything not made especially for stainless steel .
One lady I used to clean for used Windex , and her appliances after a while did n't look as good and they were harder to clean .
Vinegar is an acid and will etch the metal .
Hope this helps .
Good luck !
Raj Rajaratnam ( centre ) is accused of insider trading in 2007 A leading US hedge fund boss and five other people have been arrested on charges linked to insider trading .
Raj Rajaratnam , founder of the Galleon Group , and the other defendants , are alleged to have pocketed about $ 20 m ( £ 12 m ) in illegal profits .
They are said to have secured inside information regarding firms including Google , AMD , and Hilton Hotels .
Forbes magazine has featured Mr Rajaratnam on one of its rich lists and estimated that he was worth $ 1.3 bn .
Wiretaps Prosecutors claimed the insider trading also took place at the New Castle hedge fund and Intel Capital , the investment arm of microchip giant Intel .
Greed is not good - this case should be a wake - up call for Wall Street
US attorney Preet Bharara
The others charged in the case include Rajiv Goel , a director of strategic investments at Intel Capital ; and Robert Moffat , senior vice president in the systems and technology division of computer group IBM .
They are joined by Anil Kumar , a director at global management - consulting firm McKinsey & Co ; and Danielle Chiesi and Mark Kurland of New Castle Partners .
The insider trading is said to have taken place between January and July 2007 .
Mr Rajaratnam 's bail was set at $ 100 m ( £ 61 m ) despite a request by prosecutors to deny bail .
It was argued that Mr Rajaratnam was a flight risk , but his lawyer Jim Walden said : " A court 's going to learn there 's a lot more to this case .
There is no way that this man is going to flee . "
Mr Walden , called his client a " citizen of the world " , stating he has made more than $ 20 m ( £ 12.2 m ) in charitable donations in the last five years .
Unprecedented case US attorney Preet Bharara told a press conference that it was the largest hedge fund case ever prosecuted .
He added that it also marked the first use of court - authorised wiretaps to capture conversations between suspects .
" Greed is not good , " said Mr Bharara .
" This case should be a wake - up call for Wall Street . "
He added that anyone on Wall Street thinking of breaking the law should now be asking themselves " is law enforcement listening ? " .
Galleon Group , which has up to $ 7bn in assets under its management , said it had no knowledge of the investigation and intends to " cooperate fully with relevant authorities " .

* 35 pct expect to trim capital spending ( Adds quotes , background )
By Scott Malone
BOSTON , Sept 29 ( Reuters ) - U.S. chief executives are not ready to step up hiring or capital spending , though a majority expect sales to rise over the next six months , according to a Business Roundtable survey released on Tuesday .
The survey said 40 percent expect to cut U.S. jobs over the next six months , compared with 13 percent who expect to add them .
Some 35 percent expect to lower U.S. capital spending , more than the 21 percent who plan to raise it .
In a sign that they see the U.S. economy beginning to pull out of its worst downturn since the Great Depression , the majority -- 51 percent -- of CEOs expect their companies ’ sales to rise over the next six months .
" CEO 's are beginning to see an uptick in expectations for sales , which is good ; however , this demand has not yet translated into increased capital spending or hiring , " said Ivan Seidenberg , chairman and CEO of Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N , who also serves as chairman of the Roundtable .
Seidenberg said that an upturn in hiring would likely lag a resumption of growth in sales by about 12 to 18 months .
Caution was the dominant response on both hiring and spending , with the largest number of CEOs saying they expected their U.S. headcounts and capital budgets to remain flat over the next six months .
OUTLOOK FOR CONTRACTION
The Business Roundtable ’s quarterly CEO Economic Outlook Index rose to 44.9 in the third quarter , up from a reading of 18.5 three months ago , but below the level of 50 that separates growth from decline .
It has been negative for a year .
The index has snapped back sharply from its record low of negative 5 hit in the first quarter .
CEOs expect real U.S. gross domestic product to decline 0.9 percent in 2009 , up from their June view of a 2.1 percent decline .
Investors in recent weeks have become more convinced the U.S. economy is pulling out of a downturn , and the three major U.S. stock averages are now in positive territory year - to - date , though they are well below their pre-recession levels .
But Wall Street still has plenty to worry about , including an unemployment rate nearing 10 percent , leaving consumer spending , which accounts for the majority of U.S. economic activity , tepid .
Business Roundtable member companies , who were surveyed Sept. 2 to Sept. 18 , employ more than 10 million people and collectively generate over $ 5 trillion in annual revenue .

Click to enlarge - the game is gorgeous - you can zoom in to a surprising level
Click to enlarge - theres plenty to tinker with tactically
TBCDescribing ) to someone who has n't encountered it before is more than a little difficult , as it ’s so unlike anything else you ’ll have played .
It ’s not a conventional RTS by any means as once the action starts you have no control over what ’s happening on screen , but neither is it turn based .
In fact , the best description I ’ve heard was the one Joe used when first telling me about it – “ It ’s likewith giant space ships .
” While it ’s perhaps a little over simplified the analogy is startlingly accurate , withas much a management title as it is a strategy one .
You ’re the galactic commander of a gun totting fleet of space ships and tasked with thejob of engaging and defeating an opposing fleet of equally gun-loving enemies .
The only difference is that all the strategy - all the tinkering - is done prior to the actual battle , and once the lasers and missiles start flying , you ’re only able to sit and watch as fleets clash and your strategy either sinks or swims .
While this might sound a bit boring ( imagine playingas a mere spectator ) there ’s a surprising amount of technical and strategic depth involved in tinkering with and setting up your force to perfection before the battle , and it ’s here whereis currently at its best .
As well as picking and choosing your ships and their formation and individual tactics during the battle ( such as prioritising fighters , frigates or hulking cruisers as targets ) you 're able to design and build your own ships with which to make intergalactic war – a mechanic that soon becomes crucial .
Given a veritable toy chest of space faring war machines , you 're able to choose between a number of hull designs , each of which offer different tactic and logistical advantages .
Once the keel 's been laid down you 're then able to fully customise a ship 's loadout , from picking which weapons it should carry , to its level of defensive shielding , all the way down to its engines and crew compliment .
You see it ’s not just as easy as throwing the biggest guns onto the biggest ship and then sitting back to watch the fireworks .
You ’ll need to balance your ships ' power requirements , shielding , hull armour , targeting systems , weapons systems and the number of crew required to make the whole thing tick .
It might sound a bit complicated , but it ’s all managed from a very capable and simple to use ship creator , with more advanced weapons and upgrades for your ships unlocked as you earn honour from defeating scenarios with smaller and smaller fleets .
Building and tweaking your fleet soon becomes a lot of fun , and we quickly favoured tasking particular ships with different duties .
Heavy cruisers stacked to the gills with long range weaponry and minimal shielding and armour serve well as space artillery , mobs of torpedo laden frigates are handy for overwhelming enemy cruisers , Fighters equipped with fast firing lasers are vital escorts for larger ships and wings of torpedo laden bombers can crush an unprotected fleet .

The Church of Scientology is having a very bad week : First ABC's “ Nightline ” hammered spokesman Tommy Davis so hard about the sect ’s sci- fi creed that he stormed off the set .
( Watch Tommy Davis prematurely end his Nightline interview . )
Next , Paul Haggis , writer / director of 2004 ’s Crash , resigned from the church , slamming it for anti-gay bigotry .
Then a French court capped off the week by ordering the church to pay a $ 900,000 fine for defrauding its members .
Can Scientology weather the storms ?
This is just a slap on the wrist :
Yes , “ the Cult of Scientology is having a really , really bad week , ” says Ian O’Doherty in Ireland ’s The Independent .
But it was n’t barred from France , and the hefty fraud fine should n’t be a problem “ given how expert they are at bilking money from the gullible morons who buy into their claptrap . ”
“ All hail Xenu .
Or something . ”
This could split the church in two : While Haggis was critical of “ how the church is run , " says David Markland in Metblogs , his letter of resignation does not “ recant any of the core teachings or beliefs of scientology . ”
Could this furor provoke more former members of the Church of Scientology to “ create their own church ” but without the “ cultish tactics ” currently synonymous with the religion ?
“ A seachange brewing among Scientologist ”
Scientology just needs a reformation : “ Almost any religion can seem ‘ weird ’ ” if viewed from the right angle , says David Gibson in Politics Daily .
The real test for Scientology will be “ its ability to reform or adapt , ” like a “ ‘ real ’ religion . ”
That ’s why it 's important that Haggis did n’t pull down the temple like “ a classic apostate , ” but instead called out Scientology for failing to “ live up to its true calling . ”
Who knows ?
Maybe Haggis will be its Martin Luther .
“ Is Scientology a Cult ?
Is Paul Haggis the Next Martin Luther ? ”
Oh , let ’s just go see a movie !
Kirstie Alley , church member and frequent defender went into “ radio silence , ” says Movieline , but , under pressure from her fans , Twittered a statement reinforcing her own support of human rights — adding a few hours later , “ Helloooooooooooooo ... I ’m in the movies ...
We are going to see Paranormal [ Activity ] ... is it really scary ? ”

Omar al - Bashir has been attending the Libya summit The African Union says it will halt co-operation with the International Criminal Court over its decision to charge Sudan 's leader with war crimes .
President Omar al - Bashir was indicted over alleged atrocities in the Darfur region in March .
But delegates to an AU meeting in Libya agreed a resolution saying they would not co-operate in his arrest .
Analysts say the move means the Sudanese leader can travel across the continent without fear of arrest .
The Sudanese government has been fighting rebels in Darfur since 2003 .
The ICC has accused President Bashir of two counts of war crimes - intentionally directing attacks on civilians and pillage - as well as five counts of crimes against humanity , including murder , rape and torture , related to the conflict .
He denies the allegations , saying the state has a responsibility to fight rebels .
' Very clear '
In a statement , the AU pointed out that its request to the ICC to defer Mr Bashir 's indictment had been ignored .
ICC's BASHIR CHARGE SHEET
War crimes : Intentionally directing attacks against civilians Pillaging Crimes against humanity : Murder Extermination Forcible transfer Torture Rape
Profile : Sudan's Omar al - Bashir Q&A : Sudan's Darfur conflict
It went on : " The AU member states shall not co-operate ... relating to immunities for the arrest and surrender of Sudanese President Omar al - Bashir to the ICC . "
The statement was backed by many African leaders who , analysts say , see the ICC as an attempt by the West to interfere in their affairs .
Sudanese Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Alsamani al - Wasila welcomed the move , describing the resolution as " very clear " .
But , says BBC Africa analyst Martin Plaut , despite the Sudanese satisfaction a number of countries , including Chad and Benin , are reported to have expressed disquiet about the text .
It is also limited in scope , our analyst adds .
It does not ask the 30 African states that have signed up to the ICC to end their relationship with it .
Indeed , on the day this resolution was being passed , Kenya agreed explicitly to continue co-operating with the ICC , to prosecute those suspected of taking part in the violence that followed the December 2007 election .
The African Union decision is a blow to the court , but by no means a fatal one , our analyst says .
Kidnapped
In a separate development , two female aid workers have been kidnapped in Darfur , reports say .
The pair - from Uganda and Ireland - were both working for the Irish charity Goal .
They were seized from their compound in Kutum in northern Darfur by unidentified men , officials said .
It is the third time foreign aid workers have been kidnapped in Darfur since March .
The UN says 300,000 people have died and more than two million fled their homes since fighting erupted in 2003 between black - African rebel groups and the Khartoum government .

The free medical treatment is the result of the passage into law on June 4 of " Resolution 126 , " which offers transsexuals new identification documents -- no small matter !-- in addition to free sex reassignment surgery and hormonal therapy .
The legislation marks quite a revolutionary change for a country whose single recorded sex - change operation , according to news reports , occurred in 1988 .
My first thought was , " Does that include foreigners ? "
I do n't know the answer , but if so , they may find themselves inundated by North Americans tourists who either lack health insurance or whose policies exclude the surgeries from coverage .
The first week of June saw the beginnings of a dramatic reversal of decades of oppression toward transgender people in Cuba when the government of the new president , Raúl Castro , began offering free hormone treatment and sex - change operations for transsexuals .
The policy change is part of an enormous , albeit ongoing , transformation of Cuban society brought about in no small way by Former President Fidel Castro 's retirement from office in February of this year .
Props should also go to Mariela Castro - Espin , daughter of current Cuban President ( and Fidel 's brother ) , Raúl Castro .
Ms. Castro - Espin heads the National Center for Sex Education ( CENESEX ) , a government - funded body whose mission , according to Wikipedia , is to contribute to " the development of a culture of sexuality that is full , pleasurable and responsible , as well as to promote the full exercise of sexual rights . "
The center has played a prominent role in promoting tolerance of LGBT issues , as well as in AIDS prevention and education , and contraception .
Early news reports suggest that Resolution 126 adopts a fairly sophisticated and comprehensive approach to transsexuality , including recognition of the fact that not all of us want to have surgery .
[ emphasis mine ]
Resolution 126 , which was signed Jun. 4 by Public Health Minister José Ramón Balaguer , establishes the creation of a centre that will provide integral health care for transsexuals .
It will be the only institution in Cuba authorised to carry out gender reassignment therapy .
The decision also " legitimates the work of the National Commission for Integral Care of Transsexual People , " created by CENESEX in 2005 as the continuation of a multidisciplinary team that has functioned since 1979 , said Castro .
" This resolution establishes all of the aspects of care for transsexuals , including the operation for those who qualify and are interested , because not all transsexuals want the surgery , " said the sexologist .
The functions of the National Commission include drafting , implementing and coordinating the national policy on integral care for transsexuals , approving gender reassignment surgery on a case - by - case basis , promoting research and advising the Public Health Ministry on policy - making questions .
The new centre , meanwhile , will provide integral care , including pre and post - op interviews , diagnosis , treatment and follow - up for transsexuals undergoing sex change surgery as well as those who only receive hormonal treatment .
Let 's hope that this positive development marks the beginning of a dramatic change for the Cuban LGBT community as a whole .
During much of Fidel Castro 's reign , which began nearly half a century ago in January , 1959 , Cuba was an appallingly oppressive place for LGBT people .
Condemned by a culture that glorified " machismo , " effeminate gay men and transgender people were punished by being sent to rural prison farms and labor camps where they were brutally mistreated .
The terrible situation may have even helped spark the North American gay rights movement according to one writer , who says that newspaper accounts of the camps triggered the first pickets in front of the White House by gays and lesbians who held up signs asking , " Cuba persecutes gays ; Is the U.S. much better ? "
Again according to Wikipedia , homosexuality was formally decriminalized in Cuba in 1979 , yet that did n't stop hundreds ( maybe thousands ) of gay men ( and some women ) from fleeing Cuba a year later during the Mariel boat - lift , part of an estimated total of 125,000 Cubans ( described at the time as " undesirables and criminals " ) who fled the island seeking refugee status in the United States .
Many of these people set foot on our shores only to find themselves once again incarcerated for long periods of time with very slow due process -- but that 's another story .
While reports on the current situation differ depending on whether or not one is a Castro supporter or critic , it seems that prejudice and oppression toward the LGBT community in Cuba remain persistent .
A law prohibiting hassling " others with homosexual demands " ( Article 303a , Act 62 of the Penal Code of April 30 , 1988 ) which was modified in 1997 to read , " hassling with sexual demands , " continues to be disproportionately enforced against LGBT people .
LGBT organizations and publications , gay pride marches , and gay clubs are prohibited .
Wikipedia says that the only gay and lesbian civil rights organization , the Cuban Association of Gays and Lesbians , formed in 1994 , was disbanded in 1997 when its members were arrested .
Marriage remains restricted to the union of a man and a woman , and no alternative , such as civil unions or domestic partnerships , exists .
In theory , the best job in American politics is the President of the United States .
But the president ’s now got some competition : House Representative .
The Democratic - led House — in the middle of the biggest healthcare fight in a generation — has now trimmed their workweek to just two and a half days , leaving members of Congress plenty of time to ski or play golf .

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) promised after the Democrats won the House in 2006 and then after Obama ’s election this year that the House would hold longer workweeks .
But as the fall of 2009 wanes , the House has taken to starting on Tuesdays at 6:30 pm and adjourning “ before the sun goes down ” on Thursdays .
That certainly was n’t Hoyer ’s tune in 2006 , when he claimed that congressmembers were going to have to work five days a week .
“ I have bad news for you , ” Hoyer told reporters after the Democrats took over the chamber .
“ Those trips you had planned in January , forget ’em .
We will be working almost every day in January , starting with the 4th . ”
The Washington Post blared this headline Dec. 6 , 2006 : “ Culture Shock on Capitol Hill : House to Work 5 Days a Week . ”
But since the House returned from recess on Sept. 8 of this year , it has stuck around to vote on a Friday just once .
For what ?
Approving an a 5.8 percent increase in Congress ’ budget .

Republican lawmakers accuse Democrats of hypocrisy , as the liberal party had previously accused conservatives of having lackadaisical work schedules when they were in power .
Not everyone is turned off , however .
“ Two and a half days a week is plenty of time to consider the ideas coming out of this Democrat - led House , ” Rep. Roy Blunt ( R - MO ) , once a power - broker for former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay ( R - TX ) , told Politico .
“ Imagine the damage they could do with five - day workweeks . ”
House Democrats say they ’re not holding many votes because the legislation they ’ve already passed is backed up in the Senate .
The Democrat - led House has already approved climate change “ carbon cap ” legislation and a plan to reform Americans ’ healthcare options .

Hoyer spokesman Katie Grant invoked autumn leaves in her defense of congressmembers ’ curtailed hours .
“ Every fall we can count [ on ] two things :
The leaves change colors , and stories on the floor schedule change from Congress doing too much to [ Congress ] doing too little , ” Grant told Politico .
“ In fact , we have spent a great deal of time in session and gotten a tremendous amount of work done this year , and members are continuing to work both in Washington and their districts . ”
With up to 61 % of Americans , according to a recent poll , convinced that things are going badly indeed in Afghanistan and an official 9.8 % of Americans unemployed , Congress is set to respond .
This week , it 's slated to pass a $ 636 billion appropriations bill for the Pentagon that will include another $ 128 billion for our Afghan and Iraq Wars .
Meanwhile , the president and his advisors are about to consider the latest plan by our Afghan War commander , General Stanley McChrystal , to gainfully employ up to 40,000 more Americans in Afghanistan .
By the way , as in the Bush years , all dollar figures associated with the Pentagon budget and our wars should be considered underestimates .
Various military expenses like the upkeep of our nuclear arsenal are n't even in that budget .
Depending on who is doing the figuring , estimates of all U.S. defense - related expenditures -- and this first budget of the Obama era is already larger than the last monster one from the Bush era -- can run upwardsof a trillion dollars .
As for the war expenses , they invariably prove short of the mark and end up having to be supplemented .
When it comes to the Afghan War , this is practically guaranteed .
Being prosecuted many thousands of miles from home over long , often embattled , supply lines , it is proving staggeringly expensive .
According to one recent estimate , for instance , it costs more than $ 750,000 a year simply to keep a single U.S. soldier in the field , while the cost of delivering a single gallon of gas to the war zone is estimated at up to $ 100 .
And then , do n't forget the Afghan army .
Its U.S. - NATO upgrade program is already costing an estimated $ 8 billion a year and is clearly about to be expanded by the Obama administration .
As the Afghan government is essentially poverty - stricken , that means its army is going to be U.S. property for years to come .
Consider this a small introduction to TomDispatch newcomer Matt Bivens 's striking analysis of American investment practices .
Tom
There are many possible responses to the news that we have committed more than four trillion public dollars to Wall Street .
Mine is a roar of admiration .
Four trillion dollars !
Holy hell !
I did n't even know that was possible !
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
After all , the cost of World War II in inflation - adjusted dollars was $ 4 trillion .
This bailout thing is just getting started , and already we 've burned through that .
Without even noticing .
Certainly without rationing sugar or collecting scrap rubber or any of that nonsense .
Who 's the Greatest Generation now , baby ?
Admit it .
You feel it too .
Just imagine someone snatching your laptop off a table and throwing it , Olympic - discus style , hundreds ... and hundreds ... and hundreds of feet .
Sure , you 'd be upset ( and stuck with the bill ) .
But however briefly , you 'd feel admiration for the physical feat :
Look at that thing fly !
So it goes with our bailouts , wild tax cuts , and war budgets .
The money in play is staggering , but everyone acts like that 's something to mope about .
Where 's the excitement ?
Often , after reading an incomprehensible dollar figure , I 'll Google " What does a trillion dollars look like ? " to get myself fired up .
One example of where this takes you shows a million dollars ( pathetic , would n't fill a grocery bag ) , a billion ( interesting , I could fit it in a truck ) , and then a trillion .
( Wow , it spreads for acres !
Look at that tiny human included for scale ! )
It turns out that the United States can pick up that sort of weight and just smash it down on whatever the hell we want .
Like Optimus Prime with giant square green paper fists .
Slam !
Slam !
Yet we 've committed not one trillion dollars to the incompetent and / or corrupt , but more than four trillion dollars .
That 's according to a report to Congress from special inspector general Neil Barofsky , the overseer of the bank bailout program .
Technically , Barofsky adds , Wall Street 's IOU to you and me is at about three trillion dollars these days , since some of it 's been paid back .
Relieved ?
Do n't be .
As these tsunamis of public wealth pour out , ignore the slosh and focus on the order of magnitude .
The entire Gross Domestic Product -- the number reflecting all wealth generated in this nation for this year -- is only $ 14.1 trillion .
So whether the sum of our money that 's now their money is $ 3 trillion ( 1/5th of all wealth generated in America in a year ) or $ 4.7 trillion ( 1/3rd of all wealth generated in America in a year ) , it still means that , for a big chunk of the year , every single one of us was working for Goldman Sachs et al .
Barofsky 's report also suggests that Wall Street 's tab might ultimately work out to $ 24 trillion , which would be $ 80,000 per American , or $ 320,000 for a family of four .
But that 's , like , totally the worst - case scenario .
( Still , would n't it be impressive ?
I envision huge , five - foot - cubed , shrink - wrapped pallets of dollars dropping from the sky onto my neighborhood , smashing houses , crushing cars , killing beloved pets , blasting craters into asphalt streets .
Yeah ! )
Smallpox and Bikinis
And yet could we employ this financial muscle in a more constructive way ?
For an illuminating example , consider how we dealt with smallpox .
That airborne virus , with its fevers reaching 106 F and signature pus-filled skin eruptions , was the greatest killer of man ever known .
In the 20th century , smallpox killed more people than all of that bloody century 's wars combined .
In fact , if you tally the worldwide death tolls for World Wars I and II , the Korean and Vietnam wars , the Iran - Iraq war and the Mexican Revolution , the civil wars in China and Russia and Spain , and all the other wars of the last century , from Afghanistan to Zaire , the total is less than one - third of the smallpox death toll .
And that 's just a single 100 - year period , for a disease that disfigured Egyptian pharaohs , allied with Hernando Cortes to rout the Aztecs , left a young George Washington scarred , later stalked his Continental Army , and left Abraham Lincoln pale , weak , and dizzy as he delivered his Gettysburg Address .
And yet , in the 1960s , smallpox was targeted by visionary public health experts -- and in just 10 years it was gone .
An excellent new book by D.A. Henderson , the doctor who led the effort , tells the story : Smallpox : The Death of a Disease .
This was a signature achievement , up there with defeating the Nazis or walking on the moon .
To track down a virus in every corner of the planet , encircle it with vaccinations and kill it …
I began to wonder how many five - foot - cubed pallets of Benjamins the world had brought to bear .
After all , this was mankind 's greatest killer -- the Joker to our Batman , Lex Luthor to our Superman .
The amounts of cash flung about must have been awe - inspiring .
Chasing down the cost of the 10 - year eradication campaign was not easy .
Eventually , Dr. Henderson himself steered me to a 1,450 - page official history of smallpox maintained as a PDF in a sleepy corner of the website of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
The answer , hidden away on page 1,366 : $ 300 million .
Three hundred million ?
Not trillion ?
Not even billion ?
Such a tiny sum of money for such a tremendous feat ?
It 's like hitting a home run at Fenway Park using a chopstick for a bat .
The price paid to defeat humanity 's greatest foe would n't cover a 24 - hour day of Iraqi combat operations .
In Wall Street bailout terms , there 's no way to even talk about sums this tiny .
To do that , we have to go the level of overcompensated individuals .
So , sure , $ 300 million could eradicate history 's greatest killer of humans -- yet the same sum would n't cover the bonus pool for the executives of the insurance company AIG after its great meltdown .
It 's less than what just one man , Lehman Brothers CEO Richard Fuld , pulled down over the past 5 years .
It 's even more striking if you remember that this was a price tag for a worldwide program whose cost was shared by multiple governments ; and also a total cost over a 10 - year period .
To think about it in annual budgeting terms , it works out to $ 30 million a year .
Which is approaching the ridiculous .
Hell , the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue for 2006 featured a blond in a bikini of diamonds worth $ 30 million .
We Fight Over There So We Don't Have to Fight Here
These are sad economic times , sadder still when you consider the tsunamis of wealth going to waste : four trillion dollars for Wall Street welfare queens ; somewhere from one to three trillion for anyone affluent enough to own a top hat and a monocle ; another trillion or so ( and counting ) for our current military escapades abroad .
But it 's also just damned exciting .
Because , frankly , it 's a helluva lot of money we have to play with !
Even now , at one of our darkest economic hours , we could be performing miracles with the spare change left behind the national couch cushions .
If you 're an engineering type , you might prefer that those miracles involve shoring up our creaking national infrastructure .
Good !
Go write your own article .
I 'm a doctor so I 'll stick with medical possibilities .
Since the smallpox triumph , public health experts have been inspired to target other diseases for eradication .
One is polio , a virus known for paralyzing a minority of its unluckiest victims , among them former president Franklin D. Roosevelt ; two others are Guinea worm and leprosy , plagues dating back to the Bible .
The World Health Organization and the volunteer service organization Rotary International have spent two decades tracking down and vaccinating billions of people against polio .
They calculate that they 've prevented the paralysis of five million children worldwide .
Just this May , a 10 - day frenzy saw the immunization of more than 222 million children in Africa and Asia .
It was possible to watch the campaigners ' march through Africa on Google Maps .
Among the foot soldiers in that vaccine war : Ali Mao Moallim , who more than three decades ago became the last person on Earth to contract wild smallpox .
( Others have caught smallpox in the laboratory since . )
Think about that : inoculating 222 million children in 10 days .
For comparison , there are only about 80 million children in the entire United States .
Imagine inoculating every child in America in 10 days .
In 10 days , we could n't even get every voter in Florida to figure out whom they chose for president .
Not so long ago , polio roamed the globe , and each day would paralyze 1,000 children .
Today , there are only some hundreds of cases each year , mostly in underdeveloped areas of Africa and Asia .
The entire 21 - year slog has so far cost five billion dollars .
By comparison , Wall Street executive bonuses last year -- not salaries , but bonuses , for a single year that saw the whole mess collapse and the taxpayers handed the broom -- came to $ 18 billion .
If you look at the polio campaign costs on an annual basis , it 's about $ 240 million a year , or less per year than it has cost to occupy Iraq per day .
The United States has been polio - free since 1994 .
But if the polio campaign falters , the virus could return .
This , unlike Iraqi military operations , truly is a case of having to fight them overseas so as not to face them at home .
And why would the polio campaign falter ?
Because there are huge demands on the public purse and we must spend judiciously ; otherwise , Wall Street CEOs would have to pay for their own $ 87,000 area rugs and $ 68,000 credenzas .
( What 's a credenza ?
I had to look it up .
Turns out it's that sideboard thing you only see in the movies , where Wall Street villains keep their decanters of fine whiskey for toasting the paralysis of small children . )
Casting Out the Fiery Serpent
Consider another life - saving success - for - pennies program that 's evolving right now , in fact racing against polio to be the next public health triumph .
We are on verge of eradicating Guinea worm , a parasite believed to be the " fiery serpent " that torments the Hebrews during the Exodus .
Go read your Bible , it 's in there .
A female Guinea worm matures in its victim 's gut , growing two feet long .
Then , over a year marked by cramping , nausea , and fevers , it burrows out of the intestines , down through a leg , and to the skin surface .
A blister forms accompanied by a burning sensation -- hence the " fiery serpent . "
The agonized victim immerses the leg in water for relief ; on cue , the worm releases a cloud of larvae .
Others drink downstream , and the cycle repeats itself .
Treatment involves digging into a blister to seize the worm 's head , then extracting it over days to weeks by wrapping it around a stick -- a therapeutic image that some argue may have inspired the Rod of Asclepius , the physician 's symbol of a snake coiled around a staff .
Guinea worm still plagued millions when former President Jimmy Carter organized a charitable foundation and challenged his advisers to suggest a disease to stamp out .
They nominated Guinea worm : Humans are its only host , so if the cycle is broken in people , the parasite will be gone .
Thanks to larvicides , nylon water filters , and education , we are almost there .
Today , there are fewer than 5,000 recorded Guinea worm cases in six African countries .
The total cost of this 23 - year campaign to date has been $ 225 million .
Or less than $ 10 million a year .
This sort of chump change is so small , you can't even talk outsize salaries ; you have to focus on the tax breaks on those outsize salaries .
So , consider that the following celebrities have saved the following estimated sums each year on their taxes , courtesy of Bush - era tax cuts : movie producer Jerry Bruckheimer , $ 5.8 million ; L.A. Laker Kobe Bryant , $ 1.6 million ; rapper 50 Cent , $ 6 million ; real estate mogul Donald Trump , $ 1.2 million .
Imagine a sort of a Congressional reverse earmark -- one that canceled the Bush tax cuts only for Bruckheimer , out of punishment for Armageddon and Pearl Harbor -- and steered the resulting millions to disease control efforts .
Really , would any of these men notice the slightest changes in their lives if they returned to paying Clinton - era tax rates ?
When Curing Millions of Leprosy is " Failure "
But wait .
Are n't some of these public health campaigns wasteful failures ?
Sure they are .
Let 's look at one public health failure :
The drive to eliminate leprosy .
Caught early enough , leprosy can be cured today with the antibiotics dapsone , rifampicin , and clofazimine .
Over 25 years -- courtesy of Novartis pharmaceuticals and the Japanese Nippon Foundation -- these medicines have been handed out for free , and have cured more than 14 million people of the disease .
They work so well that the WHO now recommends integrating the world 's 250,000 known leprosy patients into primary - care settings , just like those with any other illness .
Treatment is so effective , in fact , that several years ago the WHO launched a campaign to eliminate leprosy entirely .
Ultimately it sank 15 years and about $ 200 million into the project .
( I cannot find a link for the $ 200 million figure , provided to me by WHO officials in e-mail correspondence . )
But there 's a logistical nightmare when trying to eliminate leprosy .
Other targets such as smallpox , polio , and Guinea worm exist in one reservoir only : sick humans .
Not so with Mycobacterium leprae , a bacterium that attacks skin and nerve cells .
Even today , we do n't know everywhere this bug lives .
It has been found in the oddest places : in armadillos in Louisiana and Texas , in the noses of healthy people in some parts of the world , and even in some soil samples .
Such a bug was never an easy target .
Even so , in 1991 , the World Health Organization vowed its " elimination " -- and then defined " elimination " to mean less than 1 case per 10,000 people .
At such a low background level , it was hoped , the disease might dwindle into irrelevance .
It has n't worked .
That 1 - in - 10,000 target was arrived at via politics and hopeful thinking .
It was achieved worldwide in 2000 , putting the WHO in the risible position of claiming " elimination ! " and then seeking more money to , like , eliminate it some more .
The organization was bitterly criticized .
Earnest , indignant treatises have been written noting that there is too little money to go around , and accusing the WHO of risking the credit of the more promising drives against polio and Guinea worm .
So , the anti-leprosy push was a $ 200 million failure .
Because it did n't eradicate leprosy .
It only cured 14 million people .
Of leprosy .
For half the price of an Alaskan bridge to nowhere .
Oddly enough , $ 200 million is reportedly the tax deferral enjoyed by former Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson -- he of bailout infamy -- when he joined the Bush cabinet as treasury secretary .
So there you have it , finally : For $ 200 million of public money we can take a walk in the footsteps of Jesus Christ himself , curing millions of leprosy .
A truly inspiring future is , as always , easily within reach , if we choose it .
Or we can just give Hank Paulson a tax break .
Maybe throw in a credenza by way of thanks .

Security researchers have identified a botnet that borrows an idea from steganography by burying commands in jpg images .
The DlKhora botnet , which is primarily geared towards downloading other strains of malware , encodes instructions so that the command and control server appears to be serving up image files , SecureWorks reports .
The server sets the HTTP Content - Type header to “ image / jpeg ” and prefaces the bot commands with a fake 32 - byte JPEG header .
The bot checks if the header matches and decodes the rest of the response to retrieve its commands .
The commands are encoded using a single byte XOR with 0×4 .
The botnet makes no attempt to pad files such that they resemble genuine image files , a factor that marks the servers used by DlKhora out for detection .
Malware installed by the botnet agent , as identified by SecureWorks to date , largely consists of ad hijacking nuisances .
Hackers need a method for passing instructions to the Trojan of compromised machines that form part of zombie ( botnet ) networks .
IRC channels used to be the preferred venue for command and control channel but recently this has changed with miscreants experimented with different control channels such as Google Groups , Twitter and now " image " servers . ®
" There were no thrills while he reigned , but neither were there any headaches .
He had no ideas , and he was not a nuisance . "
What Mencken said of Coolidge can be reversed in the case of Safire .
There were plenty of thrills , and after the thrills , the field was littered with casualties .
And he had tons of ideas .
He was keen to share them as soon as he thought them up .
The career that took him from public relations to propaganda to column - writing was a single seamless progression .
He treated these different lines of work as the same work ; and under his hand , they were .
He was interested in words , yet he has left behind no sentence or sentiment that people will quote in the future merely because it is true .
He never met a war he did not like .
He did all that he could to drum up several wars beyond the psychological means of his country and the world ; and his disappointment could turn to spite when a war that he wanted failed to materialize .
Jimmy Carter ’s refusal to bomb Iran in the years 1979 - 1980 was the greatest defeat of Safire ’s life .
His record on Vietnam ( both during and after ) , on El Salvador and Nicaragua , and on Iraq would be worth combing the archives of the New York Times to recover , simply as an exhibition of savage consistency .
Safire was not the originator of the psychology of the self - righteous onslaught , " ten eyes for an eye " — human nature found it long ago — but he was the American of his generation who almost made it respectable .
Did a terrorist set off a bomb in a café and five Americans die ?
Send in the Air Force and demolish a foreign capital somehow connected with that terrorist .
The flash of the violent gesture , for Safire , was more important than the justice of the action .
He became the leading practitioner of the gestural politics of journalism .
And in doing so , he revamped the accepted manner of the New York Times columnist .
No more the formality and reserve and the magisterial airs of a James Reston ; everything now had to be fast and sharp : keep the pot boiling and the gags popping .
He was the first man of the right to leaven his moralism with jokes .
With fun and " pace , " with plenty of euphemisms , and with calculated self - deprecation he did more than anyone else to legitimate a reactionary president , Ronald Reagan , as a new kind of centrist .
A considerable sleight - of - hand .
His columns fashioned from dialogues with Richard Nixon when living , and his channeled mock - dialogues with Nixon when dead , were a prodigy of bad taste .
A related genre he pioneered , the imaginary monologue of the man of power that aimed to reveal the motives of the powerful , betrayed Safire ’s curious want of invention .
He made no effort to convey the manner and savor of the person he ventriloquized .
The monologues all came out sounding like Safire ( just as the quoted persons in a Woodward political chronicle all sound like Woodward ) .
But this insider genre fitted the new Times like a glove .
Thomas Friedman and Maureen Dowd picked up the format and both now perform it with as little concern for tone and shading as Safire .
Perhaps the ruling passion of his life was a need for violent stimulants .
He sought , and craved , excitement — the thrill of the battle of everyday politics , the thrill of the slander and smear , the thrill of wars .
He was equally drawn to wars of the past , wars simmering at present , and wars in prospect for the future .
This love of gross sensations Safire aimed to impose as much as possible on his readers .
More important , he aimed to impose it on the men of power whom he wished to influence .
And often enough he succeeded .
Kenneth Starr , on the brink of quitting the Whitewater investigation , was rebuked by Safire in such humiliating terms that , rather than defy the columnist , he launched the country on the long march toward impeachment .
Safire attended to Nixon ’s post - retirement fame by shining as decent a light as could be thrown on it , and he kept Nixon ’s posthumous fame in as good repair as the facts allowed .
These exertions suggest a large investment of his own amour - propre .
He would not let anyone forget that he was part of the Nixon White House , but he encouraged readers to suppose that time spent there had been happy and not shameful .
Among living politicians , he cultivated a particular admiration for Ariel Sharon .
Has the oddness of this relationship ever been adequately noticed ?
A general who became the head - of - state of a foreign power , implicated in a brutal massacre , was puffed as a wise man by a popular American journalist .
Safire sought to persuade Americans that the adventurer of the Lebanon War was our old friend " Arik . "
His reports of phone conversations with Sharon , like the columns he devoted to the elevation of Sharon ’s achievements , have no precedent in American journalism , not even in the high days of Anglophilia when Winston Churchill evoked sentimental feelings beyond any warrant from his conduct .
In person , it seems that Safire was not a brawler ; no fighting stories about him have surfaced .
But he had the fondness of the born propagandist for " bloody noses and cracked crowns . "
He served in the army as a correspondent , during a time of peace , yet he loved the idea of combat .
The higher the stakes , the more zest it added to life .
He smashed hard without a second thought , and could be wrong with impunity , as Wen Ho Lee , Mohamed ElBaradei , and a multitude of others can attest ; and yet we are told that he was a pleasant fellow , and was known in after - years to dine with his victims .
As a writer , Safire is most often associated with the short bursts he wrote in speeches given by Vice President Spiro Agnew , before Agnew was forced to retire under a cloud of charges by the U.S. Attorney in Baltimore : extortion , bribery , tax fraud , and conspiracy .
" Nattering nabobs of negativism " was a phrase in a speech of November 13 , 1969 .
It suggested that critics of the Vietnam War were as rich as nabobs and as mindless as chattering apes .
A trick from the lower drawer of Kipling , it served its reckless purpose in heating the resentments of the time .
Safire ’s other best - known phrase , " an effete corps of impudent snobs , " had been given to Agnew to speak just a month earlier at the time of the October 15 peace moratorium .
Here the effect bordered on punning — a favorite device of his for disarming criticism — since effete brings elite into the ear without having to pay for the echo .
He turned out other squibs in the same mood that helped to corrupt the public mind , and to break the public peace in America at a time of internal strife .
His picture of the defense of civil liberties as " pusillanimous pussyfooting on the critical issue of law and order " has the true Safire touch — clever , punchy , alliterative , demagogic .
This pattern , by which zealous accusations are dealt out sharply , but mixed with a vein of buffoonery , is a staple of the far right in America that has never been properly described or accounted for .
It has been with us at least since the time of Senator Joe McCarthy ; and it would be surprising if William Safire in his early days did not nurse an admiration for McCarthy .
More polished than McCarthy or Nixon , and by the time of his death a lion of the establishment , Safire is the link that across four decades connects the political style of Joe McCarthy with that of Rush Limbaugh .
Under the heading " William Safire ’s Finest Speech , " it is now possible to locate , on line , a speech Safire wrote for Nixon which offers the most perverse imaginable illustration of political opportunism .
It was written to order for an occasion that never arose .
It said what Nixon ought to say in case the astronauts of Apollo 11 were stranded on the moon .
In this counter - factual elegy , drafted on June 18 , 1969 and sent to Nixon ’s aide H.R. Haldeman , the author of Safire ’s Political Dictionary , contrived to bury the dead while they were living .
" Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace . "
Thus , in the time he could spare from enlarging a war half a world away , Safire contrived to speak for the people of the planet in the voice of a truce from outer space : the astronauts would " be mourned by a Mother Earth who dared to send two of her sons into the unknown . "
A final blessing was uttered on behalf of a species now at last united in our prayers to the sky : " Every human being who looks up to the moon in nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind . "
A superstition , a kind of piety maybe , would have restrained many speechwriters from undertaking a preposterous assignment like this , no matter how warmly it was urged , no matter by how powerful a boss .
Yet the dying fall of the final clause epitomizes Safire ’s facility .
Rupert Brooke , a poet of the First World War , wrote in the opening lines of a poem that Safire must have learned in school , " If I should die , think only this of me ; /
That there ’s some corner of some foreign field /
That is forever England . "
Compare " some corner of another world that is forever mankind . "
He fished up the sob of the shining line from his stock quotations to send the astronauts to their eternal rest .
But consider the deeper poetry of the moment .
The man most gifted in his time at summoning a literate audience to twitch , heave , and submit to the voice in the megaphone without regard to the man behind the curtain , had been asked to bury the first explorers of space .
And what came into his mind ?
A paean of self - sacrifice lifted from the high age of Europe ’s empires .
The astronauts , as Safire saw them , were soldiers of the next empire .
It is good that they lived to make this speech unnecessary .
But it is good , too , in a way , that we have this speech — a lasting testimony of the limitless ambition of mere words .
Hunt Saboteurs Association News Release 4th September 2020
Mark Vincent and Ian Parkinson have abandoned their appeal over the sentence they received for releasing a captive fox to be hunted by the Kimblewick Hunt .
The pair had received 12 week prison sentences , suspended for 1 year , and community service after being found guilty of keeping a fox captive and inflicting suffering upon it in breach of the Animal Welfare Act .
Both men were employed by the Kimblewick Hunt at the time of the offence on 1st January 2019 .
The prosecution came about after footage was passed to the Hunt Saboteurs Association by the Covert Film Unit showing the two men releasing a captive fox to be chased and killed by the Kimblewick hunts hounds .
Their actions not only cause unnecessary harm to the fox but were also carried out to facilitate illegal hunting .
The footage was filmed on New Years Day 2019 when the hunt met at Moreton , Thame , Oxon .
It shows the hunt terrier men using draining rods to force the fox , that they ’ve been holding captive , out of a drainage pipe then being thrown into the wood for hounds to chase .
The terriermen can clearly be heard communicating with the huntsman agreeing when the best time is to release the fox which is given a brief head start so that the hunt riders experience a chase rather than a quick kill .
In her summing up the judge stated that it was high level , premeditated animal cruelty that had been done to facilitate illegal acts .
In mitigation she said the two men were clearly acting under instruction from those higher up in the hunt .
Lee Moon , Spokesperson for the Hunt Saboteurs Association , stated : “ It 's amazing that Vincent and Parkinson had the gall to even consider an appeal considering the strength of the evidence against them .
It has been clear throughout this whole process that the two men were disposable lackeys for the masters of the Kimblewick Hunt , none of whom have been brought to justice for the role they played in this awful incident .
In fact Mark Vincent , having served his purpose as a scapegoat for the hunt has now been disposed of and is now longer employed by the Kimblewick .
We still await any kind of investigation or censure by the Masters of Foxhounds Association but as we 've always made quite clear , this behaviour is commonplace in hunting and the only message the MFHA will be giving it 's members is – Do n't get caught .

For Immediate Release : August 5 , 2009
Contact : Henry Huber , Assistant Director of Communications
press@centerforinquiry.org - ( 207 ) 358-9785
Amherst , NY ( August 5 , 2009 ) — The best statistical portrait yet available of atheists , agnostics , humanists and other nonreligious Americans , based on data collected from nearly 6,000 respondents , has just been published in
Free Inquiry
magazine ( Vol. 29 , No. 5 , pps. 41-45 ) .
Luke Galen , an associate professor at Grand Valley State University ( Grand Rapids , Mich . ) , reported on the Non-Religious Identification Survey ( NRIS ) , which he conducted in conjunction with the Center for Inquiry , a secular think tank .
“ NRIS is the first study of its type to direct a full range of sociological survey questions to a population of ‘ nones , ’ as they have come to be known , ” said Thomas Flynn , editor of
Free Inquiry
. ( “ Nones ” are respondents who tell pollsters they identify with no religious tradition . )
“ For decades , pollsters and social scientists have used surveys to measure the religious beliefs and attitudes of believers .
We have mountains of data , from the substantial to the silly ; there ’s data on the nonreligious too , but it ’s far skimpier and suffers from having been collected accidentally . ”
This new survey reports that confident nonbelievers are more emotionally healthy with respect to “ fence sitters ” or religious doubters , shows that “ spirituals ” report less satisfaction with their lives than those who identify with other self - labels , and suggests that the common assumption that greater religiosity relates to greater happiness and life satisfaction is not quite true .
“ The nonreligious account for as much as 16.1 percent of Americans , yet social scientists still pay much more attention to distinctions within the religious portion of society , ” Flynn noted .
In general - population surveys , meaningful differences between distinct types of nonbelievers ( atheists , humanists , agnostics , etc. ) have often been neglected , with the broad category encompassing the nonreligious only included with the implication that they merely represent the “ absence of religion . ”
The NRIS explores the social and personal distinctions within the nonreligious population , including religious upbringings , social demographics , emotional stability , and preferred self - labels .
The study , which compiled the questionnaire results of 5,831 mostly U.S. respondents , also tested certain stereotypes often pushed onto secular people ( e.g. that the nonreligious are “ angry loners ” or “ asocial ” ) , and sought to discern the basis for variations , such as how “ spiritual ” individuals differ from “ religious , ” or how “ humanists ” differ from “ atheists . ”
Big - picture questions were addressed , such as why women tend to be overrepresented among the spiritual and religious , and why men likewise dominate the atheist and agnostic subset .
The study also shows how the label “ atheist ” — long taboo — is now supplanting others as the self - label of choice .

Watching the banality with which Laura Bush recently voiced her support for Sarah Palin inspired our rhetorical analysts to take a break from annotating and help readers translate ordinary English into the language of Laura — and other prominent Repubs .

Of Palin , Laura Bush said ,
Well I think that 's just something she needed to determine and she did .
And , you know , everyone has to respect the decision she made .
She , like a whole lot of people , other people that get into politics , find out it 's a great big world when you get in the politics and , um , I wish her the very best .

You too can achieve such blandness , and many other fun speech effects , with the many Republican translators below .
Laura Bush
In order to talk like the FFLOTUS ( which in Welsh means , " a breakfast dish made with cod " ) , simply replace every concrete noun with an abstract noun .
Then , replace every adjective with something positive , yet vague .
Here 's an example :
English :
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog .
Laura :
The terrific wonderful thing jumps over the great idea .
For extra verisimilitude , deliver all statements with a glazed - over , faraway expression , as though staring at a point three feet behind your interlocutor 's head .
Sarah Palin
The Sarah Palin translator is a little more complicated .
First , add to each sentence a metaphor or simile that is entirely unrelated to the topic at hand .
Next , add at least two superfluous prepositions or helping verbs .
Finally , include a mention of an Alaskan animal .
And obviously drop all the g's .
Observe :
English :
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog .
Palin :
The quick old salmon is doin some jumpin over that lazy grizzly bear over there , like a point guard stealin a snowmachine from a Cheechako .

Lindsey Graham
In Grahamese , all sentences begin with a disingenuous expression of support , and end with a condescending question .
To whit :

English :
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog .
Graham : Now I like you , you hear , but I have to tell you that the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog , do you understand that ?

Ann Coulter
Leave everything the same , but add something horrifically offensive as a parenthetical aside .

English :
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog .
Coulter :
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog ( who is stealing from hard - working American dogs , and deserves to be put down ) .

Finally , in the manner of " The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County , " we 'd like to translate Laura Bush into Sarah Palin and then back to Laura again .
Laura Bush :
Well I think that 's just something she needed to determine and she did .
And , you know , everyone has to respect the decision she made .
She , like a whole lot of people , other people that get into politics , find out it 's a great big world when you get in the politics and , um , I wish her the very best .

Sarah Palin :
Well I 've been thinkin that 's just somethin she 's going to be needin to determine , like a majestic moose bleedin to death in the Alaskan sunrise .
And , you know , every grizzly bear out there has to be respectin that decision she was makin , because that 's what separates the glaciers from the pitbulls .
She , like a whole lot of other people in this great country of ours , other people that have been gettin into politics , find out its a a great big hockey rink when you get in the politics , and , ya know , only the dead fish makes the basket .
Laura Bush : Terrific .

Sometimes , halfway through reading a paper , I wonder if the editors have been Sokaled ( if this is not a word , it really should be ) , fooled by a vaguely scientific - sounding parody .
This is one of those occasions .
Lorenzo Maccone , an itinerant physicist currently residing at MIT , has published a paper that claims to solve one of the trickier problems facing physics : why does time have a direction ?
Backing up a bit — all the laws of physics are time agnostic .
You can run time forward or backwards , and it makes no difference at all .
Literally , as far as physics is concerned , there is no reason why we experience time in the direction we do .
The exception to this rule is entropy , which always increases in a closed system .
Entropy is based on irreversible physical processes , where running time backwards does n't get you back to where you started , despite the fact that there are no physical laws that allow this to occur .
So , although we observe experimentally that entropy always increases , there are no known irreversible processes that can drive entropy .
Maccone has taken a slightly different view of this problem by looking at correlations .
Imagine I do something that increases entropy slightly , and my wife observes the results of my actions and records the consequent increase in entropy — we will leave the fight over who should tidy up the mess out of the story .
Now , I can choose a set of operations that can return the entropy to its previously low value .
However , doing so involves not just reversing my actions , but also reversing all correlated systems .
In other words , I have to wipe my wife 's memory of the event and her subsequent recording of it .
If she wrote it on a piece of paper , I have to wipe the paper clean etc , etc .
But at the end of it , there would be no record of the event ever having occurred .
The upshot is that entropy - decreasing events can occur , but can never be observed from within the system .
You can extend this to the universe , which may well be a closed system : we are within it and , even though events that reduce the entire entropy of the universe are possible , we can never observe such things .
How does this resolve the arrow of time problem ?
Well , put simply , running time in one direction allows records to be kept and events to be observed .
In the other direction , observation becomes impossible .
Therefore , although time could be running in either direction ( or , who knows , both directions simultaneously ) , it is only possible for any observer ( not necessarily a human one ) to experience time in the forward direction .
So , have we been Sokaled ?
Probably not .
Although Maccone has an unusual employment history , he is definitely a physicist with a publishing background on related topics .
Nevertheless , the pictures that appeared in my head when reading this paper were priceless .

Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) was on NBC ’s Meet The Press today where he said that Democrats are close to having the 60 votes that they need to move healthcare reform forward in the Senate .
Schumer said that the compromise that will lead to likely passage is a public option with a state opt out clause .
Here is the video :

When moderator David Gregory asked Schumer about having the votes to pass healthcare , he answered , “ I and others have been talking to liberal Democrats , moderate Democrats , conservative Democrats .
The liberals , they like it stronger , but they ’re willing to live with level playing field , opt - out .
The more moderate Democrats , there are some who actually like it .
As long as it ’s a level playing field , they ’re comfortable with it .
There are others who say that , “ I ’m not sure I like it , but I wo n’t hold up passage of the bill . ”
He said that the Democrats are close to having the votes that they need , “ I think we ’re very close to getting the 60 votes we need to move forward , and my guess is that the public option level playing field with the state opt - out will be in the bill .
But Leader Reid will make that decision after he talks to everybody several times . ”
Giving the states the ability to opt out of the public option will likely get even the most conservative Democrats on board .
Politically it moves the decision on the public option to the states , which resolves the dilemma that red state Democrats are facing .
On its face this is a good compromise , except the uninsured people in conservative states .
I would be amazed if the healthcare reform bill got more than two Republican votes in the Senate .
I suspect that they will still oppose the bill , because they believe that saying no is their path to electoral victory .
In the long term the opt out clause will move a hot button issue to the states , and it is a safe bet that the Republicans who oppose the public option , where it is popular will have to defend their opposition in future campaigns .
The Google Android system as seen on a Motorola Cliq .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Google 's Android operating system for mobile phones will be available on the Verizon Wireless network under an agreement the companies announced Tuesday .
The companies said Verizon ( VZ , Fortune 500 ) will introduce Android - based handsets within the next few weeks .
" The Android platform allows Verizon Wireless customers to experience faster and easier access to the Web from any location , " said Eric Schmidt , chief executive officer for Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) , in a statement .
The companies said they plan to develop " several " Android - based devices that will be pre-loaded with " innovative applications " designed by Google , Verizon and third parties .
Consumers will be able to buy the new products online and in Verizon retail stores .
The phones will be made by " leading handset manufacturers , " the companies said .
The terms of the agreement were not disclosed .
The partnership comes as competition in the smartphone market heats up between Verizon and rival AT&T ( T , Fortune 500 ) , which has an exclusive agreement with iPhone maker Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) .
The U.S. military commander in Afghanistan says he has evidence that factions of Pakistani and Iranian spy services are supporting insurgent groups that carry out attacks on coalition troops .
Taliban fighters in Afghanistan are being aided by “ elements of some intelligence agencies , ” Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal wrote in a detailed analysis of the military situation delivered to the White House earlier this month .
McChrystal went on to single out Pakistan ’s Inter - Services Intelligence agency as well as the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as contributing to the external forces working to undermine U.S. interests and destabilize the government in Kabul .
The remarks reflect long - running U.S. concerns about Pakistan and Iran , but it is rare that they have been voiced so prominently by a top U.S. official .
McChrystal submitted his assessment last month , and a declassified version was published Sunday on the Washington Post website .

The criticism of Pakistan is a particularly delicate issue because of the United States ’ close cooperation with Islamabad in pursuing militants and carrying out drone airstrikes in the nation ’s rugged east .
“ Afghanistan ’s insurgency is clearly supported from Pakistan , ” McChrystal wrote , adding that senior leaders of the major Taliban groups are “ reportedly aided by some elements of Pakistan ’s ISI . ”
The ISI has long - standing ties to the Taliban , but Pakistani officials have repeatedly claimed to have severed those relationships in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks .
More recently , the ISI has been a key U.S. partner in the capture of a number of high - level Al Qaeda operatives , including alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed .
But U.S. officials have also complained of ongoing contacts between the spy service and Taliban groups .
U.S. frustration peaked last year when Adm. Michael G. Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and other U.S. officials secretly confronted Pakistan with evidence of ISI involvement in the suicide bombing of the Indian Embassy in Kabul .

Since then , U.S. officials have sought to avoid public criticism of the Pakistani service as part of an effort to defuse tensions in the relationship .
Indeed , U.S. officials in recent months have said that the ISI had become more committed to the counter - terrorism cause after one of the service ’s own facilities in Lahore was the target of a suicide bombing .
McChrystal ’s comments are the first public indication in months that the United States continues to see signs of ISI support for insurgent groups .
Experts said elements of the ISI maintain those ties to hedge against a U.S. withdrawal from the region and rising Indian influence in Afghanistan .
“ There is a mixture of motives and concerns within the ISI that have accounted for the dalliances that have gone on for years ” with insurgent groups , said Paul Pillar , a former senior CIA counter - terrorism official .
Iran has traditionally had an adversarial relationship with the Taliban , and McChrystal ’s report says that Tehran has played “ an ambiguous role in Afghanistan , ” providing developmental assistance to the government even as it flirts with insurgent groups that target U.S. troops .
Advertisement
“ The Iranian Quds Force is reportedly training fighters for certain Taliban groups and providing other forms of military assistance to insurgents , ” McChrystal said in the report .
The Quds Force is an elite wing of the Revolutionary Guard that carries out operations in other countries .
McChrystal did not elaborate on the nature of the assistance , but Iran has been a transit point for foreign fighters entering Pakistan .
Experts also cited evidence that Iran has provided training and technology in the use of roadside bombs .
U.S. intelligence officials said Iran appears to calibrate its involvement to tie down U.S. and coalition troops without provoking direct retaliation .
Iran ’s aim “ is to make sure the U.S. is tied down and preoccupied in yet another theater , ” said Bruce Hoffman , a terrorism expert at Georgetown University .
“ From Iran ’s point of view , it ’s an historical area of interest and too good an opportunity to pass up . ”

Introduction About a year ago , I taught myself Turbogears ( version 1.0.7 at the time ) in order to write a small personal web - application for my own use .
Although I have very little web development experience , Turbogears was easy to use , and its power was apparent .
Recently I 've decided to make some improvements to my application .
However , in the meantime TG moved on to version 2.0 , and because of the many changes it came with , I had two options .
Either stick to the old TG version or learn what it takes to use 2.0 .
Since this is mostly a learning experience , it was a shame to just use an old version .
On the other hand , if I need to learn a new approach ( for 2.0 ) anyway , I could learn another framework , while I 'm at it .
This is how I got to Django .
I made up my mind to rewrite the application from scratch , and to learn the other large Python framework in the process .
This post summarizes some of my ( highly subjective ! ) thoughts about it , and how I see the differences between TG and Django .
Components
A big difference between TG and Django is in their basic architecture and philosophy .
Django is a monolithic framework with an ORM of their own , a templating engine of their own , and so on .
TG ties together several independent packages to do everything .
When I first started checking out the frameworks last year , this is what decided in favor of TG for me .
I figured that tying together several well - known and tested packages is a better approach .
If I 'll have to do something other than a web app in the future , I 'll be able to just reuse this knowledge and , say , use SQLObject ( TG's ORM in version 1.0.7 ) for other things .
The same with the templating engine and so on .
Django just looked like everything depends on everything else .
On the other hand , consider this .
TG 1.0.7 had SQLObject for the ORM , Kid for the templating and Cherrypy for the controller ( HTTP event handler ) .
TG 2 , on the other hand , has SQLAlchemy for the ORM , Genshi for the templating and Pylons for the controller .
Now , this is n't exactly persistent , and investing in becoming an expert in SQLObject would n't really pay off , would it ?
Django , being monolithic , has stayed much more consistent during its evolution .
Of course if you really want , you can use other components with Django - so if you really dig SQLAlchemy you can replace Django 's ORM with it .
It takes work , but it 's possible .
You can also use Django 's components outside of Django , if you really want to .
It 's less natural than with TG though .
That said , I have a feeling that Django can be a bit too inflexible when you need to really customize it .
It gives you less freedom than TG to against its " way " .
Documentation TG has nice documentation , but Django is simply in a league of its own - not only against TG , but against most Python libraries and frameworks .
Besides the excellent online docs , you also have a complete book for free online .
Since it 's the most popular Python web framework around , there 's also a lot of unofficial documentation and tutorials floating around the web .
To use TG you should really go through the docs of its components , so you have to look in many places .
For Django , it 's all in a single place , logically linked together .
Installation Django took much less time to deploy on my Bluehost account .
The installation took a couple of minutes and was very well documented .
TG was more trouble - it took a couple of hours to make everything work .
I suspect that this is , again , because TG consists of several components that should all be configured to work just right together .
Miscellanea
I really like Django 's urls .py approach : your URLs are in a separate file from your controller functions .
This has several benefits : ( 1 ) Things are more decoupled , which is always good - it helps reusability and maintainability .
( 2 ) The urls .py is a good " table of contents " for your website - it makes it simpler to find out quickly what is where ( I 'm talking about the developer , of course , not the user ) .

Django has a nice automatic admin , which I do n't recall in TG .
I like Django 's template language much more than Kid .
It has all the required features , is easily extensible through Python code and most importantly , is n't XML based like Kid .
Template languages are supposed to be aimed at designers and content editors - not programmers .
Thus , using XML for them kinda beats the cause .
Django's way is to have several applications in a single project .
This is n't natural for small applications - and in TG you do n't have to do it .
Django 's settings file is pure Python , which is far better than TG's INI file approach ( in version 1.0.7 - maybe it's been changed already ) .
The Man In The Bushes
A Saudi Prince -- who famously doubled down on Citigroup only to see his investments take a brutal beating during the worst of the financial crisis -- wants the U.S. to sell its 34 % stake in the financial giant .
The report which originated in Emerging Markets magazine , and was picked up by Reuters , has Prince Alwaleed bin Talal urging the U.S. government to sell its stake in the bank -- as soon as this year -- to boost investor confidence .
Reuters reports :

How was this controversial ?
In 2005 , Jamie Leigh Jones was gang - raped by her co-workers while she was working for Halliburton / KBR in Baghdad .
She was detained in a shipping container for at least 24 hours without food , water , or a bed , and “ warned her that if she left Iraq for medical treatment , she ’d be out of a job . ”
( Jones was not an isolated case . )
Jones was prevented from bringing charges in court against KBR because her employment contract stipulated that sexual assault allegations would only be heard in private arbitration .
Sen . Al Franken ( D - MN ) proposed an amendment to the 2010 Defense Appropriations bill that would withhold defense contracts from companies like KBR “ if they restrict their employees from taking workplace sexual assault , battery and discrimination cases to court . ”
Speaking on the Senate floor yesterday , Franken said :
The constitution gives everybody the right to due process of law ...
And today , defense contractors are using fine print in their contracts do deny women like Jamie Leigh Jones their day in court .
...
The victims of rape and discrimination deserve their day in court [ and ]
Congress plainly has the constitutional power to make that happen .
Easy call , right ?
Well , not if you 're a Republican , eager to protect a right of corporations to rape its employees .
Of the 40 Republicans in the Senate , only 10 voted for the Franken amendment , including all four women in the Senate GOP .
Of the six Republican males who voted for the amendment , all of them represented states outside the deep South -- Bennett ( UT ) , Hatch ( UT ) , Grassley ( IA ) , LeMieux ( FL ) , Lugar ( IN ) , and Voinovich ( OH ) .
The other 30 men , including luminaries like David Vitter , John Ensign , and John McCain , did n't think the amendment warranted passage .
This is interesting .
According to Republicans , a fake pimp and ho , reported to the police , was apparently so beyond the pale that they 've worked to strip ACORN of all federal funding .
But denying employees actual redress from gang rapes is no big deal ?
Will the GOP soon introduce a new Constitution Amendment that reads , " Congress shall make no law respecting the ability of corporations to gang rape their employees " ?
Is support for corporate gang rape already in the GOP platform , or does it need to be added at their next meeting ?
Is there a huge corporate gang rape lobby that is funneling millions into GOP pockets , or did they vote this way out of personal conviction ?
As predictably regressive as the modern GOP has become , it 's shocking to see that they still have the ability to shock .

American soldiers patrol in Kherwar district of Afghanistan .
( ( Nikola Solic / Reuters ) )
The top military commander in Afghanistan is expected to tell U.S. President Barack Obama that up to 80,000 more troops should be deployed to the war - torn country .
The NATO commander in Afghanistan , U.S. Gen. Stanley McChrystal , is scheduled to meet with Obama on Wednesday .
McChrystal has already submitted a still - secret document to the president that reportedly includes a direct request for additional troops for the Afghan mission and provides recommendations on the number of forces needed .
Pentagon
White House officials who have been briefed on the report told The Associated Press the three options contained in the document will be discussed at a high - level cabinet meeting and in a separate discussion between Obama and McChrystal on Wednesday .
NATO commander Gen. Stanley McChrystal leads a 103,000 - member force in Afghanistan .
The officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were n't authorized to discuss the report 's contents publicly , said one option calls for 80,000 more troops to be sent to the country .
An option of 10,000 to 15,000 troops and a compromise of 40,000 more forces are also contained in the report , the officials said .
Though each option still comes with high risk of failure for the Afghan mission , McChrystal argues in the report that fewer troops would bring a higher risk , the officials said .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced on Wednesday the U.K. is prepared to increase its forces to about 9,500 contingent on allies carrying their fair share of the deployment .
Obama said Tuesday that he will decide in " the coming weeks " on a war strategy and the troops needed to carry it out .
Though he said weighing military and security concerns are key parts of his decision , " another element is making sure we 're doing a good job in building capacity on the civilian side . "
Deadly mission
There are 67,000 American troops in Afghanistan , and 1,000 more are headed there by the end of December .
In the document McChrystal also concludes that corruption in Afghanistan could still allow terrorists to turn Afghanistan back into a haven .
Sending in additional troops would help secure Afghanistan but only in the short term , said Jay Parker , a Georgetown University foreign service professor and retired army colonel .
Troops alone can't fix the corruption , the root of the problem , he said .
Now in its ninth year , the war in Afghanistan has been increasingly deadly for NATO forces and faces waning public support in the United States and allied nations .
Some of Obama 's top advisers , chief among them Vice - President Joe Biden , favour significantly increasing the use of unmanned Predator drones and special forces for the kind of surgical anti-terrorist strikes that have been successful in Pakistan , Somalia and elsewhere .
A Lebanon - native who pretended to be an Islamic extremist at the behest of American authorities claims that the FBI took him off the trail of alleged 9/11 plotter Mohammed Atta right as a window of opportunity opened to catch him .
Were it not for the FBI ’s action , the informant says he is “ one million percent positive ” the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks could have been prevented .

Sophie is gone , but to fill in , Hardison becomes the grifter and boy does does he overstep .
After a security guard gets accused of helping diamond thieves , he turns to the team for help .
The man who owns the diamonds is doing insurance fraud , so Hardison poses a " The Ice Man , " the best thief alive .
The takes credit for Parker 's jobs and she is obviously trouble by this .
The owner 's goons grab Hardison to help them steal more diamonds while Nate poses as an insurance investigator .
Parker helps Hardison break into the vault and ends up trapping the goons and owner in for the police .
The plot was n't anything special , but the episode was very solid .
Aldis Hodge ( and Hardison ) did a great job with the accent .
He managed to keep it up the entire episode and was convincing .
I loved the interaction between he and Eliot , especially when Hardison pretended to beat Eliot up .
Parker was awesome doing what she does best : stealing things .
Beth Riesgraf really does a great job acting as a thief and looked great in those dresses .
Sophie who is in England was relied on by several of them .
Of course none of them wanted to others to know where they were getting help .
They definitely needed her , but they succeeded in the end without her though it was very difficult .
Could the team replace her with someone else and still be successful ?
Maybe if they found the right person they could , but realistically they need her .
The question is , does Sophie need them ?
I suspect her absence may be prolonged due to Gina Bellman 's announcement of her pregnancy earlier this year though it does make sense as an arc .
Maybe the writers are trying to hide the bump , maybe they 'll even get rid of her until next season .
There 's lots of questions right now and it 's worrying me .

Squiff writes to mention that despite being based on the Open Handset Alliance 's Android platform and using several open source components , HTC are effectively refusing to release the source for the GPL parts of their " Hero " Phone code , saying that they are " waiting for their developers to provide it . "
It has been called an " object of lust , " it 's beating the iPhone for awards , and it seems to be the first Android phone that really is " the phone to have , " to hear some people tell it .
It has also just become available in the US after a June release in Europe .
" Researchers have been showing for decades that fans or rock and rap are rebellious , and that fans of opera are wealthy and well - educated , but this is the first time that research has shown that personality links to liking for a wide range of musical styles , " he said .
Then The Graveyard Book came out .
It went onto the New York Times children 's bestseller list .
The children 's list is only ten places long .
Weeks went by .
It stayed there .
When it started to drift down , it won the Newbery Medal , and drifted up again .
And then , in defiance of all reason , it stayed there .
I told Elise Howard , my editor at Harper Collins , that if they could keep it at # 1 for four weeks , I would buy everyone at HarperChildren 's cupcakes .
They did .
I did .
( Actually , my agent , the amazing Merrilee Heifetz , paid at least 10 % of the cost of the cupcakes , and did much more than 10 % of the organising to make them happen . )
Somewhere in the cupcake madness Elise promised me that if The Graveyard Book managed to stay on the list for a year , she would bake me a pie .
It seemed unlikely , but then ...
... people kept buying it .
Last week was week 51 .
And we had drifted down , a place here , a place there , to our lowest position on the chart .
We were at number ten .
Below that , you are n't on the charts any more .
And suddenly , it became very important .
Firstly , 52 consecutive weeks is a lot more than 51 weeks , and secondly , PIE .
Elise was going to bake one .
( I am sure there are many people who edit books and also casually produce pies .
Elise , for all I know , may be one of these people .
I do not believe she is .
I liked to think that she was someone who , if The Graveyard Book stayed on the NYT Bestseller List for a year , would need to brush up on her pie-making skills , to navigate the unfamiliar twin territories of piecrust and filling .
It would be an adventure . )
I sent out a thing on Twitter , suggesting that if there was anyone who'd been putting off buying a copy of The Graveyard Book , this would be a Very Good Week to do it .
And then it was today .
Wednesday , when the previews of the Times list creep out to advanced subscribers .
And the whole house was on tenterhooks .
I was on tenterhooks , as sat and I signed sheets of paper for the Neverwhere Limited Edition .
My assistant Lorraine ?
Tenterhooks .
Her friend Betsy , Woodsman Hans ( who dug out a giant pond while I was away ) ?
Tenterhooks all the way .
The only one not on tenterhooks was Cabal , my big white dog , now back in his People Shooting Season orange cape , who could n't figure out why we were n't taking him for a walk , and was getting frustrated with the foolishness of people .
The phone rang .
Lorraine said , " It 's for you . "
I took the phone .
" Hello , " said Elise Howard , happily .
" What kind of pie would you like ?
I was thinking rhubarb ... "
The Graveyard Book had crept up to # 8 .
( And Odd and the Frost Giants had gone onto the list at # 5 . )
So we did our year , and I wrote an email to Riley Ellis saying You Were Right , and she wrote back to point out , very sweetly , that she 'd said 53 weeks actually .
So now Merrilee and I are plotting ways to send pie to HarperChildrens ( my initial plan of finding a bakery in New York that would enthusiastically make an amazing pie big enough to feed 125 people seems to have been sunk by real life ) and once again she will pay about 10 % of the price of the pie and she and her assistant Jennifer will do 98 % of the organising .
The Graveyard Book .
I had just returned from China .
I had a broken finger .
My dad was still alive .
Amanda and I were vague friends and project - buddies .
I thought I 'd written a good book , and hoped people would notice and like it , but none of the awards or recognition had happened .
And now I 'm planning my return to China in a few weeks , to wrap up the research for the China book .
I 'm writing again , and enjoying writing again ...

Several people wrote in telling me that I had it wrong in yesterday 's post and that there are n't bookshops in every little American Town where kids can buy books that have been removed from their school libraries .
Actually , I knew this already .
The last time I posted here about the lack of sarcasm marks in punctuation , people wrote in to tell me that there are Ethiopian languages that actually have a written sarcasm mark , intended to show the world that the person writing means the opposite of what he says .
So if anyone is translating this blog into Ethiopian , you 'll need to put sarcasm marks around that bit of yesterday 's post .
Ah well .
To make up for it , here is a link to a sane and civil ( and sarcasm - free ) letter from a librarian to a concerned parent , explaining why he does not plan to remove a book from the library shelves :

About eighteen months ago , at a party held by ex-HarperCollins CEO Jane Friedman , in LA , on the Fox Lot , a nice lady named Riley Ellis came over to me , introduced herself , and explained that she had read an advance copy ofand that in her educated opinion it would be at least 53 Weeks in the New York Times bestseller list .
I took this , at the time , as amiable Hollywood Hyperbole indicating that she had liked it .
While I 'd had books on the bestseller lists -- I 'd even had Number Ones -- nothing ever lasted more than 6 weeks .
The books went onto the list , drifted off , then carried on quietly selling forever .
Labels : banned books week , New York Times Bestseller , Pie mainly rhubarb but also enormous , What are tenterhooks anyway ?
Not safe for work .

York Region announced this afternoon that only the roughly 600 people in line at each of its two H1N1 clinic locations – 1 Villa Royale Ave. in Vaughan and 100 Eagle St. W. in Newmarket – will get the vaccine today .
The cut - off was made because it was determined it would take until the 8 p.m. closing to get all the people in line vaccinated , the region said in a news release .
People showing up now are being told to return to the clinics when they reopen at noon Thursday .
They are welcome to line up earlier .
The two York Region clinics will be open over the weekend , with a third clinic – at Sutton Kin Community Hall , 3 Fairpark Lane in Sutton – opening Monday .
Additional new clinics are planned .
Meanwhile , Dr. Barbara Yaffe , Toronto's associate medical officer of health , confirmed an outbreak of H1N1 at Mount Sinai Hospital at a press conference this afternoon .
Yaffe also said there is an increase of absenteeism in about 40 schools in Toronto , at which 15 are known to have an increase in influenza activity .
" The number of cases in Toronto is increasing significantly , " said Toronto chief medical officer David McKeown .
There have been 115 confirmed cases of H1N1 since the beginning of September ; 68 of those were reported last week .
That represents just the tip of the iceberg since most people are not being tested for the virus .
The City of Toronto is opening only two vaccination clinics tomorrow , not 10 as widely believed .
The two clinics are for priority groups only .
They will be at the North York and East York civic centres .
They will be followed by additional clinics for priority groups on Friday and Saturday .
See Toronto Public Health 's website for more information .
The entire complement of 10 clinics will open to the general public on Monday .

Caramba , otro año en que el Comité del Premio Nobel no reconoce a ningún mexicano .
Nos parece realmente incomprensible .
Desde 1995 en que se lo otorgaron a Mario Molina por su trabajo en química atmosférica , ni siquiera hemos estado cerca de mandar a alguien más a Oslo , o cuando menos a Estocolmo para recibir su presea y su cheque por un millón de dólares .
Siempre contenemos el suspiro pensando en que , ahora sí , Carlos Fuentes , nuestro escritor insignia , recibirá su premio de Literatura .
Pero siempre , nos quedamos frustrados .
Hay algo que no terminamos de entender .
Sabemos que no podemos aspirar a un Nobel de la Paz y revivir las glorias que tuvimos en 1982 , cuando se lo dieron a nuestro gran diplomático Alfonso García Robles por su trabajo sobre desarme nuclear , porque sería un poco difícil encontrar a algún mexicano - puesto que ya nos volvimos etnocentristas y nos olvidamos de los problemas que sangran al mundo- digno merecedor de un premio por la paz , cuando lo único que estamos haciendo es alimentar nuestra muy peculiar guerra civil derivada de la lucha contra el narcotráfico .
Ni siquiera hemos podido resolver la guerra declarada por el Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional , que tres presidentes han ignorado porque como ya no disparan sus fusiles - con los que mataron varios cientos soldados la noche en la que se alzaron - , ya no les parece importante cerrar esa herida que sigue sangrando .
No podemos utilizar a García Robles como un estandarte mexicano por el mundo .
Murió hace varios años , al igual que nuestro Octavio Paz , a quien le dieron el Premio Nobel de Literatura en 1990 .
Por eso utilizamos a Mario Molina para todo .
Presidentes y gobernantes lo llaman para adornar sus largas mesas de conferencias , seminarios y eventos especiales .
Los empresarios lo invitan para que pronuncie conferencias magistrales .
Todos buscan estar cerca de él , legitimarse a través de él .
Nos olvidamos que , lejos de ser el vivo reflejo de nuestro orgullo , debería de ser el espejo maldito de nuestras calamidades .
Mario Molina se graduó de ingeniero químico en la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México en 1965 .
A partir de ahí , empacó su equipaje y se fue a prepararse en universidades del mundo .
Su primera estación fue la Universidad de Friburgo , en Alemania , donde estudió e investigó durante dos años .
Partió de regreso a América y aterrizó en la Universidad de California en Berkeley , donde obtuvo su doctorado .
Fue maestro en otro campus de la misma institución , en Irvine , y más adelante se fue al Instituto Tecnológico de Massachusetts .
O sea , Mario Molina , que nació en el Distrito Federal , no es un producto que haya emergido de la cantera de conocimiento mexicana , que existe , pero que no tiene salida .
Mexicanos como Mario Molina abundan en el mundo .
Jóvenes que se fueron a estudiar y que tuvieron que quedarse porque en su país , simplemente , no tenían ninguna posibilidad real de aportar y seguir creciendo .
Cuando se fueron estábamos mal ; hoy estamos peor .
En 1998 se alcanzó el máximo de recursos invertidos en ciencia y tecnología en México , al llegar al 0,4 % del producto interno bruto , bastante lejos del ideal del 1 % .
Desde entonces se vino desplomando , oscilando entre el 0,32 % en el Gobierno de Vicente Fox , al 0,36 % en 2009 .
A ese ritmo , México iba a poder alcanzar el 1 % de inversión en ciencia y tecnología para el año 2042 , quizás cuando todos los países , o digamos , para no ser extremistas , una buena parte de naciones - incluidas la mayoría de las latinoamericanas - nos rebasarán y nos trasladarán de la vanguardia histórica en la región , al cabús en el ferrocarril del desarrollo .
Qué bueno que no lloramos en ese momento lo suficiente , pues no sobrarían lágrimas para lo que se vive ahora , en tiempos de crisis .
El presupuesto que presentó el Gobierno del presidente Felipe Calderón para 2010 en materia de educación , ciencia y tecnología , es políticamente una barbaridad .
En ciencia y tecnología el brinco hacia atrás es enorme : - 0,4 % de crecimiento .
En educación , las universidades públicas mexicanas recibirán una reducción en sus presupuestos de 6 % con respecto a lo que tuvieron el año anterior .
El rector de la UNAM , José Narro , que ha emprendido una batalla en el Congreso , seguido por sus colegas rectores del país , para lograr que los diputados reviertan los planes gubernamentales , se queja insistentemente de que se ha perdido el rumbo de la nación y con ello , la definición clara de prioridades .
En esos campos , México está cada vez más lejos de Brasil , pero también ha sido superado ampliamente por Costa Rica , Cuba o Venezuela .
La desinversión en educación , ciencia y tecnología repercute directamente en los niveles de competitividad mexicanos dentro del concierto mundial .
El coeficiente de inventiva de los mexicanos , que es de 0,05 es uno de los más bajos , y podríamos decir deprimentes si nos comparamos con el de Japón , que es el más alto , o el de España , que le sigue en segundo lugar , que alcanzan 28,84 y 21,89 respectivamente .
Hace poco más de 20 años , en la India se formuló una política pública en materia de educación , con énfasis en ciencia y tecnología , y una de las características de su educación superior ha sido el aprendizaje a distancia .
El presupuesto para la UNAM y otras 38 universidades públicas en el país para 2010 , por dar una analogía , elimina los recursos destinados a la educación a distancia .
Recientemente se dio a conocer el ranking anual de universidades que elabora The Times , Higher Education , donde la UNAM cayó al segundo lugar entre las instituciones de educación superior iberoamericanas , después de Barcelona .
Sigue arriba de todas las latinoamericanas , pero el dato relevante no es ello , sino que las universidades chinas , que hace cuatro años no figuraban en las primeras 200 , ahora ocupan siete lugares dentro de las mejores del mundo .
Cómo no vamos a extrañar un Nobel .
Los recursos para la educación , casi naturalmente , no da para maestros bien pagados , y mucho menos investigadores .
No es casual que algunos investigadores de renombre hayan preferido el camino de los medios de comunicación que el de abrir brecha y encontrarle al conocimiento la mejor cara en su aplicación .
Algunas de las mentes más lúcidas en la academia , ganan más del doble por escribir cuatro artículos periodísticos al mes , que por investigar .
El rector de la UNAM gana apenas si la mitad que un ex colega suyo que asesora a uno de los empresarios periodísticos más importantes de México .
Los medios no provocaron la distorsión , no nos confundamos , sino el abandono gubernamental a un diseño de país que le apuesta al futuro .
Pero esto no es nuevo .
Llevamos un década en desinversión en lo más importante que tenemos , y lo único que podría llevarnos en el futuro no sólo a entrar en la lucha anual por los Nobel , sino más importante , evitar en que cada vez nos rezaguemos más , alejándonos del desarrollo , de las oportunidades y , por supuesto , de un futuro .
It is a very easy thing to hate the United States of America right now .
But why ?
We stormed the beaches at Normandy , saved Europe from economic ruin with the Marshall plan ( thanks for paying off the loan , Norway .
Anybody else ?
Anybody ?
Bueller ? ) , invented the Internet , uprooted tyrants , and give foreign aid away like it was candy .
We want to be the good guys and thought we were .
Yet we just ca n’t seem to get any love these days .
How ’d we get here ?
Well … [ JFrater : as the representative of Listverse , I would like to say that we do n’t hate America – in fact , I had one of my greatest holidays there .
This list will no doubt cause a storm – be calm and debate nicely ! ]
10 Center of the Universe
The first reason : we act like the world revolves around us .
America presumes much for a country generously dated at 300 years old .
China has latrines ten times older than that .
A quick example : many countries play baseball , but only we have the “ World Series ” .
We ’re getting better about our egocentrism , but it ’s been a loooong time coming .
And do n’t get me started about our tourists .
Just smile and take the money - they ’re loud , but they ’ll be gone in a week .
9 We Win Everything
Okay , I ’ll concede Vietnam , tennis ( but we do n’t care ) and Kenyan marathon runners .
But we win damn near everything else , eventually .
The Space Race .
The Cold War . Tour de France .
The list goes on and on .
Even we hate the Olympics now that our professionals are allowed to participate straight up with the underaged / doping communist nations .
It ’s boring for us , but as a Red Sox / Bolton Wanderers fan , I know the angst that chronic losing against bigger and better funded opponents generates .
And if we do n’t have the best athletes / scientists / entertainers , we ’ll make sure they get a chance to immigrate while others wait in line .
That ’s gotta sting .
Oh , Yao Ming and Ichiro say “ Hi ” .
8 We Eat Everything
Why ?
Because we can .
Americans are the second fattest industrialized nation per capita ( sorry , Australia ) .
But as always , we make up for it in volume .
We can afford automobiles so we do n’t ride bikes or walk anywhere except for fun , and thanks to abundant agricultural surpluses , ANYTHING we want to eat is readily available from takeaway restaurants and convenience stores .
Some of our refrigerators could hide an entire human body .
And we like the fatty stuff , because fat tastes good .
This is NOT a good thing , and our global franchises ( KFC , McDonald ’s ) are already infecting nations that traditionally had healthier diets ( are you listening , Japan ? )
7 We Made and Have Nukes
The United States is the inventor and only wartime practitioner of nuclear weapons ( never mind that using them prevented an invasion that would make the Iraqi insurgency look like a blowjob .
“ Operation Downfall ” , the now - declassified US plan to invade Japan , estimated 1 Million American casualties alone ) .
Lax security protocols ( and clever spying ) spread the secret to the USSR and after that the genie got out of the bottle .
Many countries now have atomic weapons , and with no clear Cold War counterpart to US supremacy , the balance has shifted , and the peace dividend has not been kind post 9/11 .
6 Natural Resources
Though accounting for only 5 percent of the world ’s population , Americans consume 26 percent of the world ’s energy .
( American Almanac ) , and we are the world ’s largest single emitter of carbon dioxide , accounting for 23 percent of energy - related carbon emissions worldwide .
( U.S. Department of Energy ) .
This , while worldwide , some 2 billion people are currently without electricity .
( U.S. Department of Energy ) .
The good news is that among industrialized and developing countries , Canada consumes per capita the most energy in the world , and the United Sates is only second .
Italy consumes the least among industrialized countries ( that ’s because they still drive Fiats , which “ conserve ” energy by breaking every other day ) .
5 International Meddling
The United States has the most advanced army in the world .
We station our military in other countries at their “ request ” , which is a source of much seething and hurt national pride .
From Banana Republics , to the Cold War , to the War on Terror , we routinely interfere in the business of other countries to make the world safe for our interests , whether anybody asked for it or not .
Even if the intentions are both right and good , many countries resent our involvement in their affairs on sheer principle : they ’d rather f*** it up themselves .
Are you listening , North Korea ?
4 We Export Trash Culture
A thriving market economy and near total freedom of expression liberate Americans to pursue almost every endeavor imaginable , resulting in some of the greatest discoveries and inventions in the history of man , from the first practical light bulb to powered flight , polio vaccines , radio and TV , space exploration , the Internet , and unfortunately , everything in between .
So that means ubercrap like Jerry Springer and Britney Spears gets exported worldwide .
No , I ’m being too kind there – “ force fed ” worldwide .
Other cultures despise this with a mix of dread , envy , and loathing .
They ca n’t figure out how to cull the good from the bad out of this torrent ( neither can we , btw ) — but once it takes hold , it wo n’t let go .
This what the Islamic world fears most .
Tanks , they understand .
An educated , employed woman horny and clubbing on Friday night they simply can’t fathom .
And it scares the crap out of them .
3 It ’s Fashionable
Despite the hyperbole bandied online , strong political opinions wo n’t get your door kicked in at 3 AM like in the Gulag Archipelago .
There are no Stalinist purges or killing fields here .
And the FBI / CIA / ATF / DEA / PTA will not shoot you on sight simply because you speak against The Surge or march against the Economic Stimulus Plan .
But it ’s certainly fun to claim a fear of it !
You become an instant radical and feel intellectually enlightened to boot– patriotism is an uncritical , reflexive act , right ? – only a deep thinker would hate his country ( yet stay on to enjoy its privileges ) .
And do n’t worry about proof , because all that matters is the accusation .
Volume and conviction win the day , so toss that bibliography — grab half the story and make the rest up .
If you get caught in a logic box , claim satire .
Other countries see this lack of consequences and pile on .
2 We Do n’t Finish the Job
From Vietnam to Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinski to “ Mission Accomplished ” in Iraq to finding Osama Bin Laden , we seem to do most of the work , but keep a lot of things hanging on , never quite finished .
Eventually the answer makes itself known , but it usually takes time , and involves help from others after a lot of ( necessary ) heated discussions .
Maybe we should try this as as a first course of action more often …
1 We Act Unilaterally
We are a nation of doers , and our errors ( when they occur ) will be from acts of commission , not omission ( Hypocrisy Alert : Darfur ) .
Sometimes that ’s a great thing , like sending Kruschev ’s missiles back home , breaking Gaddafi ’s / Qaddafi ’s / Kaddafi ’s nuclear ambitions ( his nukes are now safely tucked away in Oak Ridge , Tennessee ) , or winning the Cold War .
Other times , it blows up in our ( and often , YOUR ) face .
Our attempts to spread democracy worldwide , intended to let others enjoy the same freedoms and advantages that we have , sometimes result in innocent people dying .
We must stop to remember the Somalia embassy , Madrid and Fiji and Lockerbie 101 bombings , along with the millions of nameless others who suffered and died in countries that are not free .
The US is the biggest face opposing these things that actually does anything ( not just talk , FRANCE .
You railed about Guantanamo but when it came time to release prisoners you took ONE . ) , but our allies often bear the brunt of our “ foreign ” wars , because the enemy cannot reach us .
That has changed recently , and while it has altered our perspective , it has not altered our resolve .
When Medea Benjamin stood up in a Kabul meeting hall this weekend to ask Masooda Jalal if she would prefer more international troops or more development funds , the cofounder of US antiwar group Code Pink was hoping her fellow activist would support her call for US troop withdrawal .
She was disappointed .
Ms. Jalhal , the former Afghan minister of women , bluntly told her both were needed .
" It is good for Afghanistan to have more troops – more troops committed with the aim of building peace and against war , terrorism , and security – along with other resources , " she answered .
" Coming together they will help with better reconstruction . "
Rethinking their position
Code Pink , founded in 2002 to oppose the US invasion of Iraq , is one of the more high - profile women 's antiwar groups being forced to rethink its position as Afghan women explain theirs :
Without international troops , they say , armed groups could return with a vengeance – and that would leave women most vulnerable .
Though Afghans have their grievances against the international troops ' presence , chief among them civilian casualties , many fear an abrupt departure would create a dangerous security vacuum to be filled by predatory and rapacious militias .
Many women , primary victims of such groups in the past , are adamant that international troops stay until a sufficient number of local forces are trained and the rule of law established .
( Read more about Afghan women 's concerns here . )
During their weeklong visit here , in which they met with government officials , politicians , ministers , women activists , and civil society groups , the small team of Code Pink members had hoped to gather evidence to bolster their call for US troop withdrawal within two years , and capitalize on growing anxiety back home about the war .
While the group has n't dropped its call for a pullout , the visit convinced them that setting a deadline is n't in Afghanistan 's interests , say Ms. Benjamin and fellow cofounder Jodie Evans .
" We would leave with the same parameters of an exit strategy but we might perhaps be more flexible about a timeline , " says Benjamin .
" That 's where we have opened ourselves , being here , to some other possibilities .
We have been feeling a sense of fear of the people of the return of the Taliban .
So many people are saying that , ' If the US troops left the country , would collapse .
We 'd go into civil war . '
A palpable sense of fear that is making us start to reconsider that . "
Code Pink says it will continue to oppose sending more troops to Afghanistan – a move facing heated debate in Washington – and advocate for more funding for aid and humanitarian projects instead .
The group 's visit coincided with a " peace trialogue " organized last week by the Delhi Policy Group that brought together women of Afghanistan , Pakistan , and India .
Some participants of the meeting , who have traditionally seen demilitarization as a key to peacebuilding , also faced strong opposition from local activists when they tried to include demilitarization in a statement published at the end of the gathering .
" In the current situation of terrorism , we cannot say troops should be withdrawn , " Shinkai Karokhail , an Afghan member of Parliament and woman activist , told them .
" International troop presence here is a guarantee for my safety . "

We asked professional chefs , teachers and cookbook authors this question : " If you could have only one cookbook , what would it be and why ? "
Their responses :
Karl Benson , owner , Cooks of Crocus Hills : " ' The Gourmet Cookbook . '
It 's comprehensive .
If you can think of it , they 'll have a recipe for it .
Sometimes you might need rice or beans , and they 'll have something that will get you there .
You might want to add something , but the recipes work . "
Ken Goff , instructor at Le Cordon Bleu : " ' Simple French Food , ' a seminal treatise by , in the estimation of many , the greatest author of cookbooks in the English language [ Richard Olney ] .
This book was used so extensively by me and most others I knew that my copy is ( and has been for many years ) in parts .
Discussion is sensible , recipes accurate and reflective of a real , basic yet sophisticated love of food in a very natural way that is not affected .
Raghavan Iyer , author of " 660 Curries " and proprietor of the upcoming OM restaurant : " I am a great fan of reference books since I not only read them for information , but also glean many ideas for recipes .
So I 'll say Alan Davidson 's ' Oxford Companion to Food . ' "
Manfred Krug , chef instructor at St. Paul College : " ' The Professional Chef ' from the CIA [ Culinary Institute of America ] .
It 's in , what , its eighth edition .
When I was there I trained on the fourth edition , which probably came out in 1970 or so .
It 's a little pretentious , because not everyone knows what a cheesecloth is or what a tammy is , or a drum sieve . "
Michael Rostance , executive chef at Broder 's Pasta Bar : " ' Mastering the Art of French Cooking , Vol 1. , ' by Julia Child .
I cut my teeth on this one .
Basic techniques to the most complex all in one volume . "
Jay Sparks , executive chef at D'Amico & Partners : " ' The Complete Robuchon ' [ by Joel Robuchon ] has great techniques , and the recipes really sing .

The Obama administration has released new deficit numbers , and they are not pretty .
The deficit for fiscal year 2009 , which ended Sept. 30 , came in at a record $ 1.42 trillion , more than triple the record set just last year .
In addition , future deficits are currently projected to total $ 9.1 trillion in the coming decade .
The political lines are being drawn .
Republicans cited record deficits as another reason to oppose Obama 's health care plan and other big projects .
" No more spending money we do n't have , " said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- Ky .
Rep. John Spratt , D - S.C. , countered that , " today 's figures are a result of the policies of the Bush administration , along with the cost of actions needed to address the recession and prevent even deeper economic problems . "
A year ago , as the financial crisis hit and the Bush administration prepared massive bailout plans , the deficit was $ 455 billion .
The Obama administration 's stimulus also contributed to the near $ 1 trillion higher deficit , as did lower government revenues in the wake of the recession .
" This year 's deficit is lower than we had projected earlier this year , in part because we are managing to repair the financial system at a lower cost to taxpayers , " said a statement from Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner .
" But future deficits are too high , and the president is committed to working with Congress to bring them down to a sustainable level as the economy recovers . "
Budget Director Peter Orszag said : " It was critical that we acted to bring the economy back from the brink earlier this year .
As we move from rescue to recovery , the president recognizes that we need to put the nation back on a fiscally sustainable path . "
An analysis from the Office of Management of Budget pointed out that the deficit is " roughly 24 % lower for the year than when the budget first set the forecast for 2009 , a fact due largely to the economic stabilization and recovery . "

The Republican Party launched a redesigned website Tuesday with a heavy emphasis on the social media tools that Democrat Barack Obama used so effectively to win the last presidential election .
Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said GOP.com , which stands for “ Grand Old Party , ” the party ’s nickname , will “ help Republicans compete in any race , in any state , at any time . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
However , the new Web portal is not without its share of problems .
“ Flying around Twitter this morning is a link to the new site ’s ‘ Future GOP leaders ‘ page , ” Talking Points Memo noted .
“ Instead of fresh faces , it the page lists ‘ 404 Error : This page could not be found . ' ”
A placeholder page that went up after the site ’s launch called for users to send an e-mail nominating future leaders .
One of the site ’s key features includes a list of so - called Republican heroes .
“ But the GOP may have muddled is message by including individuals who would scoff at today ’s Republican Party , ” Huffington Post reporter Sam Stein opined .
“ As pointed out by a Democratic source , the inclusion of baseball star Jackie Robinson on the list seems particularly egregious , ” Stein continued .
“ The former Dodger , who broke baseball ’s color barrier , was far from a die - in - the - wool conservative .
Robinson ’s ties to the GOP seemed more driven by a personal admiration for Nelson Rockefeller — the New Yorker who would end up being vice president under Gerald Ford — then it was core ideological convictions .
In his biography , Robinson said that as the Republican Party leadership tilted towards Barry Goldwater conservatives , he began to have ‘ a better understanding of how it must have felt to be a Jew in Hitler ’s Germany . ' ”

Another one of the GOP “ heroes ” the site lists is Hiram Rhodes Revels , a black man who in 1870 became a Republican U.S. Senator from Mississippi .
However , the new GOP.com neglects to add Revels ’ last name , simply labeling him “ Hiram Rhodes . ”
“ Even when the GOP tries to do something relatively docile , they ca n’t help but screw it up , ” scoffed the Florida Progressive blog , which caught the error .
“ They ’re not just the ‘ Party of No , ’ they ’re the Party of No Competence . ”
The Democratic National Committee was quick to pounce on the new site noting that the “ Accomplishments ” page on GOP.com does not list any accomplishments since 2004 .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Republican National Committee , in a statement , said the website will serve as a tool to mobilize grassroots supporters .
“ It will enable our supporters to communicate with each other and organize events both through GOP.com and various social media applications such as Facebook , Twitter , and MySpace , ” it said .

Australia 's kangaroo industry is worth about $ 270 million a year and until recently a major income stream came from the Russian market .
But the industry suffered a massive blow in August when the Russian government suspended imports , citing food safety concerns .
The industry is now struggling to cope , and wants the federal and state governments to help pay for an assistance package to restructure itself .
John Kelly , the executive officer of the Kangaroo Industries Association of Australia , says the industry has been forced to shed about 2,500 jobs across the country .
" Russia was taking about 60 per cent of industry productivity .
That was all of our low value , lower grade cuts , so it certainly was n't 60 per cent of industry from a monetary point of view , but it was a substantial market , " Mr Kelly said .
" Without markets to place that manufacturing meat , that low grade product into , we can't afford to process kangaroos just for their fillets .
So its importance outweighed the volume position I guess . "
Central and western Queensland , home to the largest number of registered kangaroo harvesters , are the regions suffering the most .
David Arnold , manager of the Remote Area Planning and Development Board , says many individual harvesters have lost their only source of income .
" A large number of individuals - let 's call them small business people - have had their major source of income [ taken ] from them , " he said .
It 's as simple as that and as an economic contributor to our region it 's having an impact on the region . "
Assistance
Mr Kelly says the problem is not insurmountable - it is just that the industry needs to restructure , and this cannot happen without government assistance .
Kangaroo harvesters want about $ 20 million in state and federal money to help people in the industry re-skill .
Mr Kelly says other industries receive assistance and he sees no reason that the kangaroo industry should not receive similar treatment .
" The clothing industry and the car industry and the banking industry , the building industry indeed have received substantial government support when they 've been in a similar position over the last 12 months , " he said .
" I guess we feel that the bush is worthy of similar support to the city from the Federal Government and indeed the state governments . "
Federal Agriculture Minister Tony Burke says the solution is not in an industry restructure .
He says the Government is trying to expand the export market .
" Something in the order of 65 per cent of all exports of kangaroo meat were going to one country and that country was Russia , " he said .
" Our focus is on trying to spread that risk .
We 're still negotiating with the Russians , trying to reopen that market .
" We 've had recent success in China in being able to get closer to opening up market access to kangaroo meat in China , but for an emerging industry , export industry like kangaroo meat , we believe the pathways to be opening up markets is not structural adjustment packages . "
Mr Burke has been pushing to reopen the Russian market as well , but has found the process a difficult one .
" In those meetings , there have n't been the capacity yet for Russia to be able to tell us precisely what it is they want changed which would then open the market , " he said .
Queensland 's Primary Industries Minister , Tim Mulherin , made no direct comment on the idea of a structural adjustment program but in a statement he indicated that there has been some action .
State authorities are holding consultations with harvesters to discuss food safety and market issues .
The proposed rules , which could take effect as early as 2011 , would place the greatest burden on 400 power plants , new ones and those undergoing substantial renovation , by requiring them to prove that they have applied the best available technology to reduce emissions or face penalties .
Ms. Jackson described the proposal as a common - sense rule tailored to apply to only the largest facilities  those that emit at least 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year  which are responsible for nearly 70 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States .
The rule would not , as critics contend , cover “ every cow and Dunkin ’ Donuts , ” Ms. Jackson said .
The move was timed to come on the same day that two Democratic senators , John F. Kerry of Massachusetts and Barbara Boxer of California , introduced global warming and energy legislation that faces a steep climb to passage this year .
The prospect of E.P.A. regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has generated fear and deep divisions within American industry .
Some major utilities , oil companies and other heavy emitters are working closely with Congress to ensure that a climate bill would circumvent E.P.A. regulation by substituting a market - based cap - and - trade system .
Others , led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers , have worked against legislation and threatened to sue if the E.P.A. tries to impose controls on emissions of heat - trapping gases .
Ms. Jackson said the proposed rule had been written to exempt small businesses , farms , large office buildings and other relatively small sources of carbon dioxide emissions .
But under the rule proposed Wednesday , the E.P.A. would assume authority for the greenhouse gas emissions of 14,000 coal - burning power plants , refineries and big industrial complexes that produce most of the nation ’s greenhouse gas pollution .
EDUCATION ON TWITTER EDUCATION ON TWITTER INDIANAPOLIS ( AP ) 
Two sophomore girls have sued their school district after they were punished for posting sexually suggestive photos on MySpace during their summer vacation .
The American Civil Liberties Union , in a federal lawsuit filed last week on behalf of the girls , argues that Churubusco High School violated the girls ' free speech rights when it banned them from extracurricular activities for a joke that did n't involve the school .
They say the district humiliated the girls by requiring them to apologize to an all - male coaches ' board and undergo counseling .
Some child advocates argue that schools should play a role in monitoring students ' behavior , especially when dealing with minors .
And the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that students can be disciplined for activities that happen outside of school , so long as the school can prove the activities were disruptive or posed a danger and that it was foreseeable the activities would find their way to campus .
But some legal experts say that in this digital era , schools must accept that students will engage in some questionable behavior in cyberspace and during off hours .
" From the standpoint of young people , there 's no real distinction between online life and offline life , " said John Palfrey , a Harvard University law professor and co-director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society .
" It 's just life . "
In the Indiana case , the ACLU argues that the district and Churubusco Principal Austin Couch went too far in banning the two sophomores from fall sports , requiring them to apologize to the all - male coaches ' board and undergo counseling after the photographs were circulated at school .
The lawsuit , filed in U.S. District Court in Fort Wayne , names Couch , the high school and the district as defendants and seeks unspecified damages .
No hearing has been scheduled .
Erik Weber , an attorney for the Smith - Green school district , said Couch was enforcing the northeast Indiana school 's athletic code , which allows the principal to bar from school activities any student - athlete whose behavior in or out of school " creates a disruptive influence on the discipline , good order , moral or educational environment at Churubusco High School . "
ACLU legal director Ken Falk insists the Churubusco case does n't warrant the punishment the district handed out .
" We all did things when we were sophomores in high school that can be construed as immature or problematic or whatever , but that is not the issue here , " he said .
" The issue is what possible impact this could have on the school environment , and the answer is none . "
The girls , identified only by their initials in the suit , took the photos during a sleepover with friends before school started this summer and posted them on their MySpace pages , setting the privacy controls so only those designated as friends could view them .
In the photos , the girls wore lingerie and pretended to lick a penis - shaped lollipop .
None of the photos made any reference to the school .
Weber declined to say how the photos reached Couch , but the suit contends that someone copied the pictures and shared them with school officials , and they eventually were given to the principal .
Couch initially suspended both girls from all extracurricular activities for the year but reduced the penalty to 25 % of fall semester activities after the girls completed three counseling sessions and apologized to the coaches board .
Palfrey , the Harvard professor , said privacy on social networking sites is an illusion , even if strict privacy controls are set .
Rick Hills , a New York University School of Law professor , said most courts have found that simply being able to access questionable material on campus is generally not sufficient proof that an activity was disruptive .
But he acknowledged courts have a long tradition of deferring to administrative agencies that make their own rules .
Teens who have done similar things in some states have faced prosecution , said Beverly Johnson , an Irvine , Calif. , attorney who serves on the board of Web Wise Kids , a nonprofit , online safety group .
A 14 - year - old New Jersey girl was arrested on child pornography charges in March for posting nude pictures of herself on MySpace .
The charges were later dropped after she agreed to counseling .
Other students have been expelled from school or lost scholarships , Johnson said .
The ACLU argues that the Indiana case is different .
They say the photos were a joke intended to be shared only with friends .
It wants the school district to expunge all references to the incident from school records and seeks to bar the school from taking similar action in the future .
" The problem is there 's a line drawn .
And the line is drawn as things that disrupt the school .
And outside of that , the school has no say , " Falk said .
" Imagine if everything teens texted back and forth to friends became fodder for school discipline . "
Palfrey , of Harvard , said schools have a right to regulate students ' online behavior but said the court will have to decide whether the students '
First Amendment rights were violated .
" The fact that it took place in cyberspace instead of in a classroom does n't mean you do n't enforce the rule , " he said .

I run a positive news blog over at www.yesterdaysfuture.net and wanted a place to post interesting stuff that comes to my attention without clogging up the pages of that site .
RIO DE JANEIRO , Brazil ( CNN ) -- A Brazilian TV host denies authorities ' charges that he orchestrated the murders of drug dealers and other criminals to generate sensational footage for his show .
TV host Wallace Souza is accused of ordering hits on criminal rivals and then covering the deaths for ratings .
Wallace Souza , a state legislator and former host of a police TV show called " Canal Livre , " also was a drug trafficker , officials say .
And to get rid of the competition -- and drive up ratings -- he would order that criminal rivals be killed and then would have his camera crews arrive first on the scene , authorities say .
" In truth , they went as far as creating acts , " said Thomas Augusto Vasconcelos , intelligence secretary for Amazonas state .
" It 's been determined that the crimes were committed in order to generate news for the program . "
Souza has denied the accusations , and his lawyer has criticized key testimony and questioned the investigation .
" In all the investigations carried out by the public minister and the police , up to now they have not presented any technical evidence of any type , " attorney Francisco Balieiro said on Brazilian TV .
State officials say Souza faces charges of forming a criminal gang , corrupting testimony , drug trafficking and illegal possession of firearms .
He remains free because of legislative immunity , officials say .
Watch report on Souza 's former show , charges he faces »
State Attorney General Otavio Gomes told the Agencia Folha news outlet that Souza 's gang has been linked to six slayings .
But prosecutor Pedro Bezerra told the news outlet he could not bring murder charges against Souza for lack of concrete evidence .
The Amazonas State Justice Tribunal , which held a hearing on the accusations , said the criminal complaint was based on testimony by former Souza associate Moacir Jorge da Costa .
After Jorge 's arrest , he talked about the gang 's reputed activities , including slayings .
Souza 's lawyer , Balieiro , said police and public ministry officials did not have standing to investigate the TV show host because he is a legislator .
Furthermore , Balieiro said , Jorge 's testimony was obtained in an irregular manner .
According to the state public minister , who brought the charges against Souza , the legislator 's son , Raphael , belonged to the criminal gang .
Raphael Souza has been convicted of homicide , drug trafficking and illegal gun possession .
Fifteen people connected with Souza , among them police officers and a chief , have been arrested .
Souza , a former police officer who left the force more than 20 years ago after being implicated in a fuel theft case , received the most votes of any candidate in the last election in Amazonas state .
His TV show went off the air last year after the investigation into his possible criminal involvement intensified .
He lives in the jungle city of Manaus , the capital of Amazonas state , a region of Brazil known for its prevalent lawlessness .
Souza would often rail on his lunchtime show about the killings and other atrocities being committed in the area .

Calling All Cars came out way back in May of 2007 , when the PSN was still young .
It was mostly well - received , and has a metacritic score of 77 .
Apparently , it is n’t being played enough to warrant that its multiplayer servers stay online .
If you log into the game ’s online component , you are greeted to this message by The Dispatcher .
On January 14th , 2010 , Calling All Cars ’ servers will be shut off forever .
So if you feel like playing this title online , you better get that out of your system within the next couple of months .
There is always splitscreen multiplayer , however , which is definitely a nice feature to have in this party game .

VAN98081306 - 13 AUG 98 - VANCOUVER , B.C. CANADA : A postcard size photo taken by Chief docks engineer Henry William Clarke of the Titanic leaving Southhampton Dock April 10 , 1912 on the river Test for her maiden trans - oceanic voyage .
The photo , one of the last taken of the ship , was donated to the Vancouver Maritime museum in 1968 by Clarke 's daughter Mrs. R.H. Hooper of Richmond , B.C. , where it languished in the museum 's photo collection for 30 years .
With the current resurgence of Titanic popularity Jim Delgado , the museum 's executive director dusted it off to make a larger copy print for the Titanic exhibit after verifying it 's authenticity with Ken Marschall , a Titanic expert and illustrator in Long Beach , Calif .

NEW YORK , Oct. 6 ( UPI ) -- A Titanic Memorial Cruise is scheduled to sail exactly 100 years after the ill - fated voyage on April 10 , 1912 , the cruise 's organizers said .
The memorial cruise 's ship , the Balmoral , will track the route of the Titanic , CNN reported Tuesday .

Leaving from Southampton , England , the Balmoral will arrive at the location in the North Atlantic Ocean where the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank three hours later , killing more than 1,500 of the 2,223 people onboard , Miles Morgan Travel , the trip 's organizer said in New York .
The Balmoral 's passengers will at that spot participate in a memorial service , then proceed to Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada to visit the burial places of some of the Titanic victims and complete their 12 - night trip in New York , where the Titanic had been scheduled to end its voyage , the trip 's organizer said .
Fares for the excursion begin at $ 3,900 , the organizer said .
Are the rapid advancements in technology and science , in artificial - intelligence and genetics , leading us to a moment in time — a technological singularity — where ultra- intelligent machines improve on their own designs , while we humans are free to edit our own evolution ?
Transhumanists believe so , and contemplate how technology might be used to enhance our mental and physical capacities .

Writing in The Daily Telegraph last week , Ed Miliband , Secretary of State for the Environment and Climate Change , made clear his commitment to ensuring there is a global deal in December .
" Lord Stern estimates that the long - term costs of failing to control climate change could be between 5 pc and 20 pc of GDP , " he said .
" Of course there are costs from acting too , but they are far less than the costs of not acting . "
( CNN ) --
A shooting at an LA Fitness gym outside Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , killed at least four people and wounded several others , a local official told CNN .
Authorities at the scene of a shooting at an LA Fitness gym near Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
The shooter , whose identity was not immediately released , was among the fatalities , said Gary Vituccio , manager of Collier township .
At least 10 shooting victims arrived at the three major hospitals in the area .
A spokeswoman for Mercy Hospital confirmed five female shooting victims arrived at the facility with multiple gunshot wounds .
Three were in serious condition , and two were listed as critical , she said .
Allegheny General Hospital received two wounded patients at its trauma center , a spokesman said .
Both of victims are women and were listed in fair condition , he said .
A St. Clair Hospital spokesman said three shooting victims arrived there Tuesday night ; two were in stable condition and one patient , who was shot in the chest , died at about 8:55 p.m .
It was n't clear whether the death at St. Clair was included in the fatalities confirmed by Vituccio .
Perry Calabro of nearby Bridgeville told CNN he was between racquetball games at the gym when he heard screaming and multiple gunshots .
He said he ran out and did n't see the gunman or others .
Other witnesses told CNN affiliate WTAE that the lights went out before they saw flashes in dark -- what they later realized was gunfire .
Witnesses told WTAE that a man unrecognized by the gym 's staff shot people in a Latin dance class .
A witness identified as Nicole told WTAE that about 30 women were in the class when " a middle - aged white male walked into the class .
He had a big gym bag . "
" He looked out of place in a class full of women , " according to the witness , who told WTAE the man put down the bag , turned off the lights and opened fire .
All About Pennsylvania • Murder and Homicide
What looked earlier in the day like a trial balloon being floated by someone in the White House regarding last night 's meeting with Senate leadership on healthcare reform is gaining legs .
Politico's Mike Allen reports that Obama told leadership his preference is for the Snowe Trigger .
CNN likewise reports that Obama 's preference is the trigger , because he wants to keep the bill " bipartisan . "
Both of these reports are unsourced , Allen just stating it as fact , CNN using the " source familiar with . "
Should they thus be totally discounted ?
No .
Not in the sense that it 's very possible that someone associated with the proceedings is trying to raise a little hell or at least a trial balloon or two by leaking this story to a couple of outlets , while others get a different story .
We should take these reports seriously particularly now , when Brian Beutler is confirming the story , reporting that multiple sources confirm it :
Multiple sources tell TPMDC that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is very close to rounding up 60 members in support of a public option with an opt out clause , and are continuing to push skeptical members .
But they also say that the White House is pushing back against the idea , in a bid to retain the support of Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) .
" They 're skeptical of opt out and are generally deferential to the Snowe strategy that involves the trigger , " said one source close to negotiations between the Senate and the White House .
" they 're certainly not calming moderate 's concerns on opt out . "
This new development , which casts the White House as an opponent of all but the most watered down form of public option , is likely to yield backlash from progressives , especially those in the House who have been pushing for a more maximal version of reform .
It also suggests for perhaps the first time that the White House 's supposed hands off approach that ostensibly allowed the two chambers in Congress to craft their own bill has been discarded .
If true , Obama is going to have some strong opposition in both the House and Senate .
An indication of that , and also a possible confirmation that there 's pressure coming from the White House on the trigger , comes in the form of a statement from Jay Rockefeller today :
In a statement issued apparently in response to news that the White House is leaning towards the so - called " trigger " approach , Sen. Jay Rockefeller ( D - W.V. ) said the following .
" Historically , ' trigger ' mechanisms have not been successful , and they are not a substitute for a strong public health insurance option , A ' trigger ' simply delays price competition , which in turn will delay affordability for consumers and moves us farther away from the goals of health care reform .
Already , we are seeing insurance companies threatening to game the system , by raising their prices in advance of reform .
The only way to curb price - gouging by health insurance companies is with real competition on day one -- that is the public option . "
So what is it , Mr. Obama ?
Public statements from various White House officials that " the public option is the best way to achieve choice and competition , " or we can hold off on that choice and competition a few more years because President Snowe does n't like the idea ?
This is indeed snatching defeat from the jaws of victory .
Reid is nearly there on cloture vote with the public option .
The only point here would be being able to call the thing " bipartisan . "
Guess what ?
No one outside of the Village gives a shit if it 's bipartisan .
Particularly the Democratic base that needs to be energized in 2010 for turnout .
Harry Reid is the one that is most at risk here .
He 's the one running for re-election in 2010 .
Pushing back against the President is n't going to be easy , but if he wants to keep his job , if he wants to keep strong majorities in both chambers of Congress , that 's exactly what he needs to do .

Long before little ghosts and witches filled plastic jack - o- lanterns with candy every Oct. 31 , ancient Celts celebrated the festival known as Samhain , Wikipedia tells us .
The occasion marked the end of the “ lighter half ” of the year and beginning of the “ darker half . ”
On this day , which became All Hallows ’ eve ( the day before All Saints Day ) , it was believed that the border between this world and the Otherworld became thin , allowing both harmless and harmful spirits to pass through to ours .
To ward off the evil spirits the Celts disguised themselves as wicked spirits by wearing costumes and masks , a tradition still embraced by today ’s trick - or - treaters .
According to a 2007 Pew Research survey , two - thirds of Americans ( 68 % ) completely or mostly agree that angels and demons are active in the world ( and not just on Halloween ) .
Just 14 % completely disagree with this idea .
Among religious groups , Mormons ( 88 % ) , evangelical Christian ( 87 % ) and members of historically black churches ( 87 % ) are the most likely to agree that angels and demons are active in the world .
Jewish Americans are by far the most likely to disagree that these spirits stalk the planet ( 73 % disagree with 52 % completely disagreeing ) .
Buddhists ( 56 % disagree ) , Hindus ( 55 % ) and the religiously unaffiliated ( 54 % ) are other faith groups disagreeing that angels and demons exist in our world .
Happy Halloween !

I ’m of two minds about taking up this theme , since stating what ought to be obvious but is nevertheless unpleasant and inconvenient is apt to get one branded as lunatic fringe .
Access journalism has created what is in many respects a controlled press .
And that matters because people are far more suggestible than most of us wants to admit to ourselves .
Let us start with the cheerleading in the media over Wall Street , and in particular , Goldman earnings .
Matt Taibbi , in “ Good News on Wall Street Means … What Exactly ? , ” tells us why this is so distorted :
It ’s literally amazing to me that our press corps has n’t yet managed to draw a distinction between good news on Wall Street for companies like Goldman , and good news in reality .
I watched carefully the reporting of the Dow breaking 10,000 the other day and not anywhere did I see a major news organization include a paragraph of the “ On the other hand , so fucking what ? ” sort , one that might point out that unemployment is still at a staggering high , foreclosures are racing along at a terrifying clip , and real people are struggling more than ever .
In fact the dichotomy between the economic health of ordinary people and the traditional “ market indicators ” is not merely a non-story , it is a sort of taboo — unmentionable in major news coverage .
The press has been on a downslope for at least a decade , as a result of strained budgets and vastly more effective government and business spin control ( and it was already pretty good at that , see the BBC series , The Century of the Self , via Google video , for a real eye - opener ) .
I met a reporter who had been overseas for six years , opening an important foreign office for the Wall Street Journal .
He was stunned when he came back in 1999 to see how much reporting had changed in his absence .
He said it was impossible to get to the bottom of most stories in a normal news cycle because companies had become very sophisticated in controlling their message and access .
I could n’t tell immediately , but one of my friends remarked in 2000 that the reporting was increasingly reminiscent of what she had grown up with in communist Poland .
The state of the US media became evident to me when I lived in Australia during the run-up and the first two years of the Gulf War .
I would regularly e-mail people in the States about stories I thought were important and I suspected might not be getting much play in the US .
My correspondents were media junkies .
85 % of the time , a story that had gotten widespread coverage in Australia appeared not to have been released in the US .
And the other 15 % , it did n’t get much attention ( for instance , buried in the middle of the first section of the New York Times ) .
And remember , Australia was an ally and sent troops to the Iraq .
Why does this matter ?
Because influence via the adept packaging of information and images is very effective .
The creator of the public relations industry , Edward Bernays , was the nephew of Freud and set about to use the subconscious to shape public opinion .
His books included This Business of Propaganda and Manipulating Public Opinion .
But it does n’t fit our self image of being masters of our own view to recognize that we might be swayed .
In his classic , Influence : The Art of Persuasion , Robert Cialdini describes how salesmen can adeptly use social conditioning and norms to elicit favorable responses .
Cialdini , a social psychologist , notes that even though he is aware of these techniques , he is unable to resist them .
One experiment from cognitive bias research assembles a number of people in a room together , but all save one are actors .
Everyone in the room is shown a series of lines and asked to say out loud which is the shortest ( the background design makes it a bit difficult to discern without concentrating a bit ) .
For the first five or six rounds , the actors ( and the lone experiment subject ) pick the shortest one .
Then , the actors start calling the LONGEST line the shortest one .
After a few round s of this ( and inevitably , the one not in on the game looks puzzled ) about one - third of the experiment subjects start agreeing with the crowd , even though that answer is clearly incorrect .
And there is boatloads of other evidence of suggestibility .
For instance , numerous studies have found that if a number of people tell an individual he looks tired or sick , he will start feeling tired or sick , as the case may be .
Back to the main theme : the media dares not say anything too negative about financial services firms or their government operatives lest they lose access .
The private sector has learned the lesson of the Bush Administration , that the threat of freezing a reporter out is a powerful weapon .
I have had some well connected readers tell of story ideas that they served up in some detail that the media would not touch out of fear of alienating their sources .
This is the sort of thing that one associates with banana republics , but we have been operating on that level for quite some time .
Not surprisingly , the government and large corporations were firmly in charge of the message during the crisis ( remember the gap between the MSM reporting and the anger in the populace over the TARP , which was finally noted ONLY when Congress responded to a barrage of calls and e-mails and voted down TARP v. 1.0 ? ) and perhaps more important , in pushing the , “ move past that car wreck , things are really better ” message .
From the Pew Research Center :
Three storylines have dominated : efforts to help revive the banking sector , the battle over the stimulus package and the struggles of the U.S. auto industry .
Together they accounted for nearly 40 % of the economic coverage from February 1 through August 31 .
Other topics related to the crisis have been covered much less .
As an example , all the reporting of retail sales , food prices , the impact of the crisis on Social Security and Medicare , its effect on education and the implications for health care combined accounted for just over 2 % of all the economic coverage .
Actions by government officials and business leaders drove much of the coverage .
The White House and federal agencies alone initiated nearly a third ( 32 % ) of economic stories studied through July 3 .
Business triggered another 21 % .
About a quarter of the stories ( 23 % ) was initiated by the press itself and did not rely on an external news trigger .
Ordinary citizens and union workers combined to act as the catalyst for only 2 % of the stories about the economy .
Fully 76 % of the datelines on economic stories studied during the first five months of the Obama presidency were New York ( 44 % ) or metro Washington D.C. ( 32 % ) .
Only about one - fifth ( 21 % ) of the stories originated in any other city in the U.S. , and about a quarter of those emanated from two other major media centers : Atlanta and Los Angeles …
Once the economic situation showed some signs of improvement — and the political fights over legislative action subsided — media coverage began to diminish .
After accounting for 46 % of the overall news coverage in February and March , for instance , coverage of the economic crisis dropped by more than half ( to 21 % of the newshole studied ) from April through June .
And in July and August , it fell even further ( to 16 % ) .
The clearest example came in cable news .
Once the political battles subsided , coverage fell by about two - thirds from March to April .
Notice even
Pew has fallen for the party line a bit .
The stock market rally started in March .
That is not a sign of economic improvement ( Krugman has said something along the lines of “ The stock market has predicted 20 of the past 9 recoveries . ” ) .
So what do we have ?
A media that predominantly bases its stories on what it is fed because it has to .
Ever - leaner staffing , compressed news cycles , and access journalism all conspire to drive reporters to focus on the “ must cover ” news , which is to a large degree influenced by the parties that initiate the story .
And that means they are increasingly in an echo chamber , spending so much time with the influential sources they feel they must cover that they start to be swayed by them .
It is less intense , but not dissimilar to the effect achieved when reporters are embedded in military units .
The journalists often wind up adopting the views of the people they associate with frequently ( I am sure readers will add more nefarious theories in comments , but the point here is a simple : an up the center description of what has happened to the media shows it has fallen under the sway of powerful interests ) .
Now how do we get to the propaganda part ?
Not only , per Taibbi , are we getting the view of the economy from the vantage of the bankers , as opposed to a broad swathe of the population , but we now we have the media ( well , this example is that odd hybrid , an MSM blog ) telling us there is no outrage .
From the Los Angeles Times ( hat tip JohnD ) :
Except for Michael Moore , whose new movie posits that capitalism is one big Ponzi scheme , the news Wednesday that banks are thriving and that Wall Street analysts are in line for big bonuses this year seemed to land with all the political weight of a dull thud .
Oh sure , the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said he ’ll soon hold hearings on executive pay at firms that got taxpayer bailout money , like AIG and Bank of America … .
But with the Dow Jones hitting 10,000 and the economy stepping back from the precipice of last fall ’s collapse , there was little of that tea -party outrage that might have been expected .
Have we moved on ?
Arguing that the country is now more concerned with Afghanistan and healthcare , the Wall Street Journal said of bonus outrage : “ That ’s so last March . ”
Maybe taxpayers have simply given up on Washington ’s efforts to corral Wall Street .
Now why is this sort of thing ( and the media was full of more subtle versions , of happy talk re Dow 10,000 and Goldman earnings ) more pernicious than it might appear ?
The message , quite overly , is : if you are pissed , you are in a minority .
The country has moved on .
Things are getting better , get with the program .
Now I saw the polar opposite today .
There is a group of varying sizes , depending on the topic , that e-mails among itself , mainly professional investors , analysts , economists ( I ’m usually on the periphery but sometimes chime in ) .
I never saw such an angry , active , and large thread about the Goldman BS fest today .
Now if people who have not suffered much , and are presumably benefitting from the market recovery are furious , it is n’t hard to imagine that what looks like complacency in the heartlands may simply be contained rage looking for an outlet .
But per the social psychology research , this “ you are in a minority , you are wrong ” message DOES dissuade a lot of people .
It is remarkably poisonous .
And it discourages people from taking concrete action .
I was surprised that some people bothered to comment on a post I put up yesterday , calling on people in the Chicago area to attend some peaceful demonstrations against the banking industry during the American Bankers Association national meeting , October 25 through 27 .
A few weighed in , saying ( basically ) “ do n’t bother ” .
I suppose it makes a difference whether one is old enough to remember the 1960s .
Because people in large numbers got out and protested , two sets of changes that seemed impossible came about : civil rights for blacks and an end to the US involvement in Vietnam ( if you read the histories , the military and intelligence experts were on the whole persuaded it was an unwinnable war , but it was seen as too costly to US prestige for America to withdraw ) .
And even if the effort you make narrowly is not successful ( does any one person ’s effort have much impact ? ) it breeds apathy and cynicism to suggest that doing nothing is the best course of action .
If nothing else , it is better for one ’s psyche to do what one can , however small , to make a difference .
Now America does not have a tradition of taking to the streets ; demonstrations and rallies historically are working class affairs .
But the middle class is on a path of downward mobility while the elites continue to take the cream .
The widening gap might waken some impulses that have been dormant in the American psyche .
As part of some new Rabbit features , we ’ve been investigating the use of boot files to start multiple applications without requiring us to build our own application loader .
After some initial experimentation , we built a fairly simple utility that would generate a .rel file , then request the Erlang toolchain to compile this and generate . script and .boot files .
In doing this , we learnt a great deal about the internals of OTP startup sequences .
As a result of the experimentation , we found a number of interesting properties .
Firstly , we discovered that if you go down the path of using boot files you should use Supervisors on all of your top - level applications .
Whilst this is generally considered good practice in all Erlang applications , it is even more important when these applications are listed in the boot file , since if an application listed in the boot file crashes at any point the entire Erlang VM will be halted !
This behaviour certainly piqued a number of people ’s interests – after some consideration we agreed that it is a sensible enough behaviour , since if you instructed the VM to start with a given set of applications , then any of them crashing out probably constitutes a fairly major failure .
Through some investigation and reading of the Erlang documentation , we learnt this was n’t actually a boot file specific behaviour .
Instead , it was because applications listed in the boot file are actually started as permanent ( instead of the default of temporary ) .
The effect of marking an application as permanent is that if it crashes , the Erlang kernel will shutdown as a result .
Those wishing to try this at home can simulate it with the use of
application : start ( app_name , permanent )
and some rather adventurous use of the Erlang toolbar .
After the initial implementation , a number of other issues were discovered .
Currently , Rabbit performs a number of “ VM - configuration ” tasks during the rabbit : start method .
Unfortunately , using the boot file bypassed ( or in the very least de-prioritised ) Â these operations .
So investigation began into finding a way to configure the VM running Rabbit before applications were started .
Somewhat expectedly , the - eval flag is not evaluated until after the boot sequence is completed .
Applications run via “ - s ” flags are similarly delayed until after the boot sequence has finished .
So we began to dig a little deeper .
Anyone who has experimented with .boot files will have noticed the boot file is n’t plain text .
However , the boot file is actually just a binary form of the associated . script file .
Inside the . script file , following the various path - setup commands , are a series of MFA formatted commands , looking something like :
{apply , {application , start_boot , [ kernel , permanent ]}} , {apply , {application , start_boot , [ stdlib , permanent ]}} , {apply , {application , start_boot , [ mnesia , permanent ]}} , {apply , {application , start_boot , [ sasl , permanent ]}} , {apply , {application , start_boot , [ os_mon , permanent ]}} , {apply , {application , start_boot , [ rabbit , permanent ]}}
This opened up a whole new set of options .
We tried a few different techniques to get the behaviour we were after .
Currently , we ’ve settled on inserting an apply line like {apply , rabbit , prepare , [ ]}} after the stdlib application startup .
This allows us to do custom VM initialisation before the non-kernel applications are started .
( We decided it would be wise not to do any application specific changes to the VM before the kernel or stdlib are started ) .
Until starting down this path , I certainly did n’t know there were so many possibilities for customising the Erlang boot sequence .
Hopefully others might be able to find interesting things to do too !
Epidurals reduce or eliminate the pain of contractions
The pain of childbirth may have benefits on which women who opt for painkilling epidurals miss out , a senior male midwife has said .
Dr Denis Walsh , associate professor in midwifery at Nottingham University , said pain was a " rite of passage " which often helped regulate childbirth .
He said it helped strengthen a mother 's bond with her baby , and prepared her for the responsibility of motherhood .
But an obstetrician said epidurals were an important option for some women .
Do not under - estimate the pain of having a baby - it is a very , very intense and painful experience
Dr Maggie Blott
Consultant obstetrician Dr Walsh , who wrote on the subject in a piece submitted to the journal Evidence Based Midwifery , agreed that in some cases epidurals were very useful .
But he said epidural rates had been rising over the last 20 years , despite the fact that alternative , less invasive ways to manage pain in labour were available .
He said pain in labour was known to have positive physiological effects , such as helping to establish a rhythm to childbirth .
It also triggered the release of endorphins which helped women to adjust to pain .
Dr Walsh said epidurals were known to increase the risk that hormone treatment would be needed to boost contractions , and that devices such as forceps would be needed to complete the birth successfully .
He said : " I am concerned that if we increase epidural rates we do not know the long - term impacts of that . "
But he warned that a culture had emerged where most hospitals effectively offered women epidurals on demand .
Official figures show the number of mothers receiving an epidural rose from 17 % in 1989 to 1990 to 33 % in 2007 to 2008 .
Dr Walsh said the NHS should encourage alternative ways to deal with pain such as yoga , hypnosis , massage and birthing pools .
Very useful Dr Maggie Blott , consultant obstetrician at University College London , agreed that pain could help aid the physiology of labour , and that alternative ways to manage pain were available .

She said : " There are some labours which are very prolonged , some are very complicated , and we need to have epidurals available so that women have access to them if they need them .
" Do not under - estimate the pain of having a baby - it is a very , very intense and painful experience .
" If it is happening hour after hour in a very prolonged labour it is very tiring and wears people down and I think epidurals are very useful in that situation . "
Dr Blott also stressed that the use of forceps , or other devices to aid birth was a relatively simple procedure , which many women would prefer to enduring pain over long periods .
Cathy Warwick , general secretary of the Royal College of Midwives , offered support for her colleague .
She said : " At the moment it is very easy for most women to ask for an epidural , and if they want one they definitely should get one .
" But what Denis is saying is that we want to make sure that women get other options , and that they do get really good support from midwives . "
Carrie Longton , from the parenting website Mumsnet , said her contributors had given Dr Walsh 's views short shrift .
She said : " It is very difficult to talk about this unless you have been through it .
Childbirth is such a different experience to breaking a leg , or breaking an ankle , and it is different for every woman .
" So anybody saying you must not do anything is unwelcome . "
Ms Longton said it was vital that women who asked for an epidural were not made to feel they had failed in some way , as that was very likely to damage the bonding process with their baby .

As anticipated all summer after GM Chuck Fletcher and coach Todd Richards made clear the years of monthly captaincy rotations were history , Mikko Koivu was named the first - ever permanent captain of the Wild today .
The natural born leader , who grew up in the same household as longtime former Montreal Canadiens captain Saku Koivu , has the respect of his teammates .
Koivu , 26 , performed marvelously under the weight of the `C ' last season , leading the Wild in scoring and helping the team to a 31 - 19 - 6 record during his four stints as captain .
It seemed logical that Richards ' first captain would be a core part of the future , only the coach decided to wait a month to observe the players on and off the ice .
" He has the demeanor for it , " Andrew Brunette said during training camp .
Besides talking to refs , the captain is the liaison between playerand coach .
He also is responsible for speaking up in the locker room , coordinating team functions and being accountable to the media on asemi-daily basis .
" That 's the fun part of the job , " quipped Koivu last month .
In other news , Wild defenseman Jaime Sifers cleared waivers , so the Wild can send him to the minors if it chooses .

With Mass Effect 2 promising darker themes , more brutal stories and fewer fluffy asides , Dragon
Age implying a hardened world of grisly fighting , and Alpha Protocol replacing good / bad choices with murky / murkier , this notion appears to be getting increasingly mature .
What will be interesting to see , in all forthcoming RPGs , is whether there can be a sense of scale to match .
I think scale is the hardest thing to get right in such games .
Take Knights Of The Old Republic as a useful example .
KotOR sets up the most remarkable sense of scale after its opening few hours .
You spend time on an occupied planet , an oppressed people caught between two evil forces , performing trials .
Important to those you help – sourcing medical supplies for the free clinic , for instance , has huge potential impact for good – but made meaningless in the shocking destruction of the planet that quickly follows .
It creates a sense of massiveness , or enormous consequence .
But it is , of course , a fudge .
You had no part in that – your actions were the smaller pieces on the surface , the obliteration hard - coded into the plot .
Once it ’s happened , you ’re rushing around another planet looking for lost Jedi , convincing families to resolve differences or slaughter each other , and helping a woman find her droid .
Again , important for those involved , not of huge impact to the galaxy as a whole .
That ’s not quite fair .
Looking for the lost Jedi carries quite a weight .
Find her , and you can kill her on the spot ( out of mad malice ) .
Or you can aid her , bring her into your group of friends , and spend the next 30 hours travelling the galaxy with her .
She can make a massive impact on your experience as a constant companion .
Or she can be a corpse .
That ’s a fairly hefty decision .
But I do n’t want my choices to always be life or death .
And equally , I do n’t want them to always be wrong or right .
Sometimes these are perfect themes , but not always .
I want to fathom a means to create a sense of scale behind my actions , without their being so dramatically thudding .
I want subtlety , but impact .
I think the problem is , too often , that your choice is reduced to a binary switch , and whichever way you flick it , nothing changes .
Return to the island / planet / space station , and the consequences of your actions are sat there , lifeless , whether they ’re a corpse or a reunited mother and son .
Talk to them and they might say , “ Thank you so much for your help !
Without my child would have died ! ”
Return weeks later and they might say , “ Thank you so much for your help !
Without my child would have died ! ”
The moment I was finished with them , they ceased to live .
Their moment of reuniting happiness becomes something of a grotesque parody .
Trapped in that instance , unable to move on with their lives , I might just as well have killed them both and robbed from their cupboards .
When I say “ nothing changes ” , that ’s not strictly true .
My experience changed , my memories of the events are constructed uniquely , and even though their existences are frozen in time , they ’re how I left them .
I ’m not dismissing the impact of this at all .
What I ’m wondering is : can this get bigger without breaking a game ?
I ’m not entirely sure .
RPGs must be the world ’s biggest nightmare to build .
Creating a series of choices , and yet at the same time a coherent and cogent game , with meaningful direction and strong narrative …
I would n’t like that to be my job .
Clearly the simplest solution to doing it well is to have choices make aesthetic differences , and player experience differences , but not impact the overall story in any massive way .
The difficult part is to do this incredibly well .
I think , perhaps , the greatest example of doing this incredibly well is Deus Ex .
The story has been told many times , but it bears repeating once more .
Long ago when the world was young and Kieron and I were even younger , I called him from my home in Guildford to his home in the PC Gamer offices to discuss Deus Ex .
We were chatting about various moments , sharing thoughts , and then I said , “ Was n’t it awful when your brother died ? ” Kieron replied , “ My brother did n’t die ? ”
Of course it turns out whether you save older Denton or not , you still travel next to Hong Kong .
I went there to recover a chip from his body .
Kieron went there to meet his brother .
I broke the news of his death to his girlfriend .
Kieron went to see his girlfriend for other reasons .
We both played exactly the same game , playing through exactly the same levels , but our motivations were dramatically different .
Neither of us could perceive a game in which we would go to those places for any reason other than those we had at the time , creating the sense of something unique to our decisions and experiences .
I think this is possibly the most realistic structure .
It is of course one that ’s broken with a second play through ( or a sneaky use of save games , like someone with six fingers and a thumb in their choose - your - own - adventure book ) .
It also goes some way to creating an illusion that multiple endings are n’t about pushing a particular coloured button in a scene near the end .
( Which oddly enough Deus Ex was more guilty of than most . )
So what is the quest that I want ?
Well , I want all that currently exists .
While the vaccination quest in Mass Effect that caused me to write a diatribe about morality in RPGs almost exactly a year ago was ridiculous , I want those weighty decisions put in front of me .
However , I ’d like to know the people involved , be troubled by an emotional connection , and have the opportunity to speak to experts on either side before making my feelings known , I still want those tough choices .
And I certainly want the most obvious , “ Could you deliver this parcel to the butcher ? ” quests , that turn out to be smuggling illegal magic spells for an underground cartel , and finish with fighting a terrible warlock .
I want all that stuff to be there .
But I want , when I ’ve finished them , to see progress in the lives with which I was involved .
I do n’t think this breaks the game .
If I save the husband from the Gnarth Beast on Undersea Base 6 , then I do n’t want it to end when I inform his wife and she gives me her father ’s anti-shark gun to thank me .
Many games will have it set up so should you return you might find them both stood outside their house like garden ornaments , praising you on repeat every time you speak to them .
But I want more .
More I say !
I want to return later and find they ’ve had a fight and are n’t speaking to each other .
And later still , their away on holiday .
Come back just before the end and they ’re she ’s dying .
I want their existence to continue , even though I may not be a part of it .
Clearly should I have killed her husband and fed him to the Gnarth Beast , then these things would n’t be happening .
Other things instead .
Not huge changes , but progress .
Then elaborate on this .
If I save the husband , perhaps he helps me in the final battle .
It does n’t change the ending of the game .
It does n’t enormously impact upon the fight .
But he ’s there , aiding me , a bonus .
But that pirate I thwarted , returning all his stolen gold to the orphanage , he ’s there making it more difficult .
It ’s all about embracing the more trivial parts of the game and giving them consequence .
It ’s not about being unrealistic and demanding each choice I make creating another divergent path until the game looks like a fractal , coded by ten million people over a thousand years .
It ’s about not only creating the illusion that my path through the pre-determined narrative is unique , but flavouring that narrative with the consequences of my actions .
I find little in gaming more comforting than the quest log .
For a person who never makes to - do lists , and is pitifully disorganised , having something so neat and structured is a pleasure and a security .
Watching one get crossed off as I complete it , seeing entire chapters relocated to the list of completed tasks , it ’s wonderful .
What I want next is that list of completed tasks to be reminders of places to return , or hints of what ’s yet to come .
“ We had a really hard time casting the role , and in retrospect it was obvious that the problem was not the actresses but the conception of the character , ” he said .
Focus groups that watched the original pilot were left with protective feelings for the two naïve , socially awkward scientists , and they did not like the prospect of a bitter , manipulative woman taking advantage of them .

“ What we all liked was the relationship between these two guys , one who wants his world to be bigger and the other who wants his world to be smaller , ” Mr. Prady said .
“ I think that ’s what everyone looked at and said , ‘ This is worth trying again . ’ ” The creators decided to keep the male characters and to persuade Mr. Parsons and Mr. Galecki not to take another series in the year between the two pilots .
They also called back one of the actresses who auditioned unsuccessfully for the original female role : Kaley Cuoco , a former child actor who played opposite John Ritter in the comedy “ 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter . ”
Much of the edge was taken off the character of Penny  so much that at first she looked to be little more than a jiggly blonde next door with no apparent motivation for being interested in two science geeks .
It took awhile to find the character ’s voice , but now Penny “ is one of the guys , ” Ms. Cuoco said .
“ She ’s not some untouchable creature . ”
Over the first two seasons Penny and Leonard edged toward each other and are now in a full - fledged relationship .
But theirs is not the unbelievable type of couple  a gorgeous female and a paunchy , slacker male  that has been so popular in Judd Apatow films recently .
“ Penny has been in horrible relationships and picked the wrong guy constantly , ” Ms. Cuoco said .
“ I think she has more baggage than the guys . ”
According to documents we 've seen and conversations we 've had , Apple had reached out to Intel as early as 2007 with plans for an interoperable standard which could handle massive amounts of data and " replace the multitudinous connector types with a single connector ( FireWire , USB , Display interface ) . "
From what we 've learned , the initial conversations ( and apparent disagreements ) were had directly between Steve Jobs and Paul Otellini .
If you were wondering about that Apple - blue motherboard we saw at IDF or the aforementioned Hackintosh demo , this should explain everything .
Cupertino apparently had specific demands for the standard , including the desire for a single port solution , and an insistence that optical was the only logical choice for such a connector type .
Based on the documents we had a look at , the short - term plans seem to involve a one - size - fits - all solution ( somehow allowing for multiple connections but avoiding " double dongles " ) which would enable users to connect a variety of devices into a single Light Peak port , while slightly longer - term plans will mean Light Peak obviates the need for almost every type of connector you use today .
Translation : Apple products in the near future could come equipped with only a Light Peak port ( or ports ) to handle your networking , display driving , and general connectivity .
What happens next , however , is where the story really gets interesting .
Based on what we 've learned , Apple will introduce the new standard for its systems around Fall 2010 in a line of Macs destined for back - to - school shoppers -- a follow - up to the " Spotlight turns to notebooks " event , perhaps .
Following the initial launch , there are plans to roll out a low - power variation in 2011 , which could lead to more widespread adoption in handhelds and cellphones .
The plans from October 2007 show a roadmap that includes Light Peak being introduced to the iPhone / iPod platform to serve as a gateway for multimedia and networking outputs .
While the timing does n't line up , a low - powered Light Peak sounds like the kind of technology that would be perfect for a device with a need for broad connectivity but limited real estate for ports ... like a tablet .
is
potentially just skip over forthcoming offerings like
Apparently , there are also plans for a new , low - power Atom chip due next year meant to compete with current CPUs driving mobile devices like the iPhone , netbooks , and set - top boxes .
The indication we 've been given is that that product ( coupled with the Light Peak standard ) could provide the basis for some " big " MID news in 2010 ... but not from Apple .
As we saw at the announcement , Sony is also a first - tier partner ( though not nearly in the connected way Apple is ) , and it looks likely the company could find use for that pairing ( especially with its entry into the netbook market this year ) .
We ca n't see Apple utilizing an Atom chip in anything , especially when it 's busy cranking away with P.A. Semiconductor and its rumored projects
In the end , we can't say we know or understand Apple 's complete plans for the standard , but whatnotable is that the company is pushing for an all - on - one connectivity solution , and pushing hard .
That means Cupertino is at least prepared to abandon the standards we now know for a singular solution , and USB 3.0 ( or at least downplay their use ) .
It 's not an uncommon move for Apple , but in the past those choices have had major repercussions -- and this pairing is extremely reminiscent of the USB / iMac story ( Intel also created that standard , which Apple then popularized ) .
We 're going to keep our ears to the ground on this news , but for now , it 's an interesting peek behind the curtain , and a possible glimpse into the future of connectivity .

Heavy but brief rain that moved through Sydney has brought down part of a hospital roof and forced affected patients to be moved .
The storm from the west moved through the Sydney basin on Tuesday afternoon , bringing hail to some areas and downpours before it moved off the coast .
The roof over a ward in Mt Wilga Private Hospital , a rehabilitation centre in Hornsby in Sydney 's north , collapsed around 6 pm ( AEDT ) .
A hospital spokeswoman said no one was injured but two patents had to be relocated within the hospital .
The NSW State Emergency Service ( SES ) responded to a flash flooding incident in Flemington in western Sydney .
They rescued a person from a car .

We 've all been taught that when malloc returns 0 , it means the machine ran out of memory .
This case should be detected and " handled " by our application in some graceful manner .
But what does " handled " mean here ?
How does an application recover from an out of memory ( OOM ) condition ?
And what about the increased code complexity of checking all those malloc return values and passing them around ?
In this article I want to discuss the common policies of handling OOM conditions in C code .
There is no single right approach .
Therefore , I will review the code of several popular applications and libraries , to find out how they do it in order to gain useful insights for my own programming .
Note that I focus on desktop & server applications here , not embedded applications , which deserve an article of their own .
As the old adage goes , " Be careful what you wish for -- you might get it , and wish you had n't . "
Proponents of net neutrality might want to keep that in mind now that net neutrality regulations from either the FCC , Congress or both are a virtual certainty .
As with most wishes the impulse behind this one is laudable .
As FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski puts it , the goal is " to ensure the Internet remains a free and open platform that promotes innovation , investment , competition , and users ' interests . "
Amen !
More specifically , the idea is to ensure that penniless entrepreneurs have the same ability to reach audiences as do multibillion - dollar companies , and that providers can't censor content ( whether by competitors or users expressing First Amendment - protected views ) .
Interestingly , both conditions largely prevail in the Internet today .
Yes , there are a few well - publicized cases of content censorship -- but the vast majority of the time , the Internet actually is net neutral .
Unfortunately , by imposing legislation designed to keep things that way , net neutrality proponents run a real risk of destroying the very Internet they want to protect .
Here 's why : Internet usage continues to grow dramatically -- between 50 % and 100 % year over year .
That 's not a problem in the core , which has more capacity than it needs for the foreseeable future .
But access circuits ( both wired and wireless ) are bandwidth - constrained -- and excruciatingly expensive to upgrade ( ask Verizon how much it has spent on FiOS ) .
Net neutrality prohibits carriers from recouping those costs by charging differentially based on type of content or quality of service .
That means as user demand increases , carriers have just one option for recouping their costs : Charge by the bit .
And that , in turn , will have a domino effect on peering arrangements .
Tier - one providers now peer for free with each other .
Once they have no choice but to charge for bandwidth , free peering will go away .
And one of two things will happen then -- both unpleasant .
Either user costs go up ( to cover the costs of peering ) , or more likely , carriers wo n't bother to peer in the first place ( because they can't charge users enough to recoup the costs of peering ) .
Guess what ?
When peering goes away , so does the Internet -- because you 're no longer able to connect to anywhere from anywhere .
A site on one network wo n't be visible to users on other networks , unless the site owner is rich enough to buy connections to multiple networks .
So your hypothetical penniless entrepreneur will need to decide whether to spend those precious funds to reach Verizon 's users , or those from AT&T -- because he wo n't be able to afford both .
Reaching all users , everywhere , will only be financially viable to behemoths such as Amazon or Google , which already pay for connections to all major networks ( now you see why these guys love net neutrality ) .
In fact , the best adage to keep in mind about all this probably has nothing to do with answered wishes .
It 's " Do n't fix it if it ai n't broken . "
This story , " The Downside of Net Neutrality Law " was originally published by Network World .
He said : " He pushed me to the limit .
I took no enjoyment in taking him out of the class .
I acted swiftly to remove the student who was disrupting the lesson , who was telling a racist joke , who would not settle down .
Responsibility for the Kabul attacks , which included rockets fired at the five - star Serena Hotel , was claimed by an Afghan Taliban faction led by Siraj Haqqani , who uses his base in North Waziristan , along the Afghan border , to organize an insurgency against American and NATO forces .

“ This is a very dark day for the U.N. in Afghanistan , ” said Kai Eide , the United Nations special representative to Afghanistan .
He said officials of the organization would review “ whether other appropriate measures need to be taken to protect all our staff . ”
No one claimed responsibility for the Peshawar bombing , but the authorities said it appeared to be another in a series of attacks by Pakistani Taliban militants to answer the military ’s offensive against their stronghold in South Waziristan .
Since the military moved into the region this month , the Pakistani Taliban have shifted their attacks from suicide bombings aimed at security installations and Western targets to more powerful and more indiscriminate bombings in urban centers intended to kill large numbers of Pakistani civilians .
“ The militants want to destabilize the government and intimidate the public , ” Mehmood Shah , a retired brigadier and defense analyst based in Peshawar , told the Geo news network .
As long as the military operation continues , he added , “ We can expect such attacks to carry on . ”
A senior intelligence official blamed Taliban militants based in Darra Adamkhel for the attack .
“ We had an intercept last week that spoke of a ‘ heart - rending ’ attack in Peshawar , ” the official said , requesting he not be identified .
The militants , he said , spoke of carrying out the attack to “ unnerve ” the government .
“ This explains why they are now targeting civilians , ” he said .
We are now well in the middle of October and this means it ’s our usual time of celebration at OpenOffice.org .
OpenOffice.org is now 9 years old , which is no small accomplishment for a Free Software project .
We will soon all gather to celebrate this event in Orvieto , where the OOoCon will take place between the 3 and 6th of November .
( Do n’t forget : we have an ODF plugfest at the same place on the 1st and 2nd of November ! )
Last year has been a good year .
Our mirrors saw a significant rise as we released our major release number 3 and its subversions .
Our office suite has never been better , never faster , never more versatile than the one we distribute today .
Our community has vastly expanded , and is still growing at a healthy rate .
For all this we should be thankful and we should realize we are all contributing to an extraordinary project that helps dozens of million people worldwide , contributes significantly to bridge the digital divide , and is an essential tool of Free Software on potentially any desktop .
The future will bring some changes ; the nature of these changes is something that is still unknown to us .
But regardless of what will happen in the next year ( and I believe we should expect the best for OpenOffice.org ) we should always remind ourselves the power of the Community .
The power of the Community is not a magical thing , regardless of how I might try to make it sound like it is .
The Community itself is quite intangible , but it is only through ourselves and the others with whom we contribute and share that things work , that a project is carried forward and that in some sense , magic happens .
Thank you , OpenOffice.org , for these 9 years of magic .
I expect to see more next year .
KABUL , Afghanistan — Shouting “ Down with America ! ” and “ Death to the infidels ! ” hundreds of protesters made their way from Kabul University , on the western outskirts of the capital , to the center of the city on Sunday .
They were reacting to rumors , vigorously denied by the U.S. Forces - Afghanistan , that American troops had burned several copies of the Koran in a province close to Kabul .
Police tried to contain the demonstrators by the university , but as their ranks swelled with students from the nearby Polytechnic and the Education University , the police relaxed their cordon and the crowds entered the city .
A separate group gathered near the parliament .
By noon the worst of it was over , with no casualties reported , although the police fired warning shots in the air at some locations .
But the demonstrations were just the latest in a series of protests that have swept Afghanistan since rumors of a Koran - burning incident in Wardak province began to circulate over a week ago .
At least two people have been killed and several injured in the earlier protests , and there are few signs that the rage is dying down .
This could be very bad news for the new policy introduced by commander of the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) , Lt. Gen. Stanley McChrystal .
McChrystal has insisted that the protection of the Afghan population should be paramount for the troops under his command .
Winning hearts and minds , rather than killing or capturing Taliban , would be the first priority , he has repeatedly said .
But judging by the recent waves of protests , this will be a hard sell in a country where security is deteriorating daily , and where the local population often feels caught between a brutal insurgency and an equally unpalatable occupation .
Anti-American sentiment runs deep here , and requires just a small spark to ignite .
The latest violence was prompted by rumors that U.S. soldiers had burned several copies of the Holy Koran in retaliation for an attack by insurgents .
The U.S. forces reject the accusations and hint that the Taliban themselves perpetrated the offense to use as a propaganda ploy .
The Wardak province governor ’s spokesman defends the foreign troops and points the finger at local drug addicts .
But despite efforts to defuse the situation , university students and local residents in at least five provinces so far have taken to the streets to protest against the perceived insult to their culture and their religion .
The trouble began on Oct. 15 , when U.S. forces were out on patrol in Wardak , a province just 25 miles from Kabul .
According to villagers from Khwajagan village , an American tank hit an improvised explosive device ( IED ) just outside their town .
The soldiers then began a house - to - house search , they said , and , not finding the insurgents who planted the mine , directed their wrath by seizing and burning six copies of the Koran .
“ We saw the burned Korans , ” said Khwaja Qandol , who lives in the village .
“ The Americans went to Khwaja Fazlurahman ’s house , where only women were at home , and they took six Korans from a cabinet and burned them in the middle of the room .
Four of the women witnessed this and told us about it .
We went and saw that the Korans had really been burned . ”
This version of events is completely rejected by the U.S. Forces - Afghanistan .
“ There was no incident in which ISAF forces burned Korans in Wardak , ” said Capt .
Elizabeth Mathias , of the U.S. Forces - Afghanistan public affairs office .
“ ISAF and Afghan forces conducted an investigation of the incident and determined that ‘ the enemies of Afghanistan , ’ as reported by local authorities , were responsible for the burning . ”
Shahidullah Shahid , spokesman for the governor of Wardak , confirmed that Korans were burned , but assigned blame to three local youths who , he said , were addicted to hashish .
“ We have begun a serious investigation into this incident , ” he said .
“ The U.S. forces in Wardak respect the people ’s culture and traditions .
Last week they provided dozens of copies of the Koran as well as prayer - cloths to the local council in Jalrez district . ”
But another government official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said that the Americans were indeed behind the incident .
“ The government of Wardak is hiding this incident in order to avoid problems , ” he said .
The provincial government did appear eager to protect the Americans , something confirmed by the U.S. forces spokesperson .
“ A mullah from the local Afghan National Army unit addressed people in Wardak earlier this week , ” said Mathias .
“ In his comments , the mullah … described how the Taliban has used this tactic of burning the Holy Koran then blaming international forces to inflame the public in several provinces , and that these actions disrespect Islam and Afghanistan . ”
Whatever the truth of the matter , Afghans seemed only too eager to believe the worst .
Within days the news had spread throughout the country .
Protests began in the capital of Wardak , Maidan Shahr .
On Oct. 17 , hundreds of students and residents marched in what they said was a peaceful protest against the insult to the Koran .
They blocked the main road , which links Kandahar to Kabul , for more than three hours .
“ We informed the police one day in advance that we were going to have a demonstration , ” said one student from the local vocational school of agriculture , who was afraid to give his name because the local security forces had warned residents not to talk to the media .
“ But the police acted illegally .
They shot at us , and firefighters directed water canons at us .
One person was wounded and five others were arrested . ”
The governor ’s spokesman denied the student ’s statement .
“ There was no advance notice , ” said Shahid .
“ The demonstrations started spontaneously .
The police began shooting in the air and dousing the protesters with water in order to avoid chaos .
No one has been arrested and no one has been wounded . ”
Wardak , like many other provinces in Afghanistan , has seen a recent spike in insurgent activity .
Kabul residents with roots in Wardak say they can no longer visit family in their home villages , because the Taliban controls the roads and are notoriously suspicious of visitors from the capital .
U.S. troops have moved into the area , but have not as yet conducted large - scale military offensives .
Instead , complain local residents , their presence provokes the kinds of attacks that sparked the Koran - burning incident .
Following the protests in Wardak , groups demonstrated in Nangahar , Kandahar , Khost , Logar , and , on Friday , on the outskirts of Kabul .
Two people were killed , reportedly when Afghan National Police forces fired in the air .
In Afghanistan , with a high degree of illiteracy and an underdeveloped media sector , rumors often gain the status of truth .
This makes it relatively easy for those in control of informal communications networks to spread whatever version of events they like .
Rumors can serve as a spur to action , sometimes disastrously so .
Unconfirmed reports that U.S. soldiers had desecrated the Koran in the Guantanamo Bay detention center three years ago caused riots that left at least four people dead and scores injured .
“ In Afghanistan , rumors often become reality , ” said Kim Barker , Edward R. Murrow media fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations .
The U.S. forces recognize the problem , even as they try to put their own spin on the recent events .
“ I ’m concerned because a rumor has gained such traction , ” said Mathias .
“ Though insurgents often force people to demonstrate and propagate rumor to disrupt security . ”
Habiburrahman Ibrahimi contributed to this report from Wardak .

Preface to the revised edition ( 2011 )
June 6 , 2011 – Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal --
There are a number of changes in this edition compared to the first edition ( Resistance Books 2010 ) .
Most of these changes merely expand on points made in the original , supplying more detail in the text and / or the footnotes .
Others take account of new developments in the year since the first edition was published .
The biggest change is in the discussion of the Great Leap Forward , which has been significantly expanded and rewritten .
I felt this was necessary for two reasons .
First , I wanted to acknowledge that natural disasters as well as mistaken policies played a role in the reappearance of famine in 1959 - 61 .
Second , I wanted to explain in more detail what the policy errors were , and why I consider that Mao was largely responsible for them .

THE two largest tobacco companies in the United States voluntarily stopped advertising cigarettes in magazines , with Philip Morris , whose brands include Marlboro , ceasing in 2005 and R. J. Reynolds , whose brands include Camel , at the beginning of 2008 .
Now the Camel logo is back prominently in major glossies , including Rolling Stone , Sports Illustrated and Maxim  but not to advertise cigarettes .
R. J. Reynolds is advertising Camel Snus , a tobacco packet that wedges in the upper lip and , unlike chewing tobacco , is promoted as “ spitless ” because low salt content spares users the unpleasantness of public expectoration .
Although snus is popular in Sweden , this is the first time it has been marketed in the United States by a major American tobacco company .
The campaign , by Quaker City Mercantile in Philadelphia , pitches Camel Snus ( pronounced snoose ) as a way around smoking bans .
The ads cater to specific magazine audiences , with a recent issue of Rolling Stone promoting snus as “ sweaty outdoor festival friendly ” and one in Sports Illustrated declaring it “ extra inning friendly . ”
Others call snus “ your flight just got canceled friendly , ” “ ridiculously long conference call friendly ” and “ fancy hotel friendly . ”
David Howard , an R. J. Reynolds spokesman , said that the company had not reversed its magazine policy , but that this was a Camel of another color .

Sandro Donati has worked from within the Italian system on putting an end to doping in sports .
Photo : Niels Nyholm
The head of research at the Italian Olympic Committee ( CONI ) , Sandro Donati ( photo ) , recounts his personal story about twenty years of fighting against doping in Italian and international sport .
An unbelievable story which nevertheless is true .
In addition to the story below , you can see much of Donati 's documentation in a PowerPoint file .

1. Introduction to the doping cave : 1981 , I meet prof .
Conconi
Just a few days after becoming National Coach for 800 m and 1500 m male runners , I met Prof.
Conconi at a scientific congress where I was a speaker .
He was informal , as if we had known each other for a long time , and asked to speak to me .
He congratulated me on my new appointment and told me the Italian Athletics Federation had asked him to advise me of their project .
He had elaborated a new system , improving upon the one used in Finland , for the transfusion of selected red blood cells , which were stored Iat - 90 , enriched with particular substances and then transfused two or three days before an important event .
He said : " it means an improvement of 3 to 5 seconds for 1500 m races , 15 to 20 seconds for 5000 m races and 30 to 40 seconds for 10,000 m races . "
I was astounded as I suddenly understood that doping really did exist and that the rumours concerning the Italian medals at the Moscow Olympics were true !
But I did not let on ; I immediately decided I would not let him understand what my position was so that I would be able to gather as much information as I could .
He went on to say : " in the next few weeks we shall carry out a number of field tests and then draw the blood - a total of 1000 c.c. on two separate occasions - of the athletes you consider more promising in view of the oncoming Athens European Championships " .
I made no comment and just said I would be available for the field tests .
I was very upset when I got home as I realised that in the new environment I had just entered , high level performances were to be obtained through any means .
But was there anyone I could take into my confidence ?
2. 1981 - 1984 blood transfusions
I decided the best thing would be to tell everything to the athletes themselves .
I called a meeting and illustrated the proposal , adding that for my part , I would never accept this type of procedure , even though it had not been expressly forbidden by the IOC , because it had all the characteristics of doping .
I told them they were absolutely free to chose , but that if they were to accept I would resign and go back to my desk at CONI .
All seven of them said it would never occur to them to accept .
A few days later , Prof .
Conconi sent his assistants to perform the field tests and I carefully took note of all the data they recorded for each athlete .
I then processed these data and found that the test elaborated by Conconi and extensively publicized on international scientific publications was by no means as significant as he claimed .
I therefore decided on a counterattack ; I refuted the test thus putting off the moment in which I would have to give the more important reply , the one about the blood transfusions ; a practice that probably killed the young middle distance runner , Fulvio Costa .
Prof. Conconi waited for a few weeks and then wrote to Primo Nebiolo who was President of Italian Athletics Federation as well of the International Athletics Federation to report my lack of co-operation .
I was summoned by the Head Coach , Enzo Rossi , who very urbanely tried to persuade me ; I firmly refused saying that if he wanted to perform blood transfusions on the athletes in my charge , he would first have to find another coach to substitute for me .
I knew I had the full support of the athletes and of their respective club coach .
He did not insist but said he hoped I would change my mind .
Just before the Los Angeles Olympics , Italian Athletics Federation officials became more determined ; the Head Coach summoned my best athletes and asked them whether they wanted to improve their performance in view of the Olympic Games through blood transfusion .
I was present in this occasion but had been asked not to express an opinion .
All the seven athletes refused !
The Head Coach left the room in a rage .
After a few days , behind my back , Prof.
Conconi invited two of these athletes to visit the University of Ferrara and , once again , tried to persuade them to try blood transfusion without letting me know about it .
Both of them refused and came to talk to me that same evening as soon as they returned to the Tirrenia Training Centre .
I protested heatedly but was told I would be relieved from office immediately after the Olympic Games .
All the other National Coaches , so had the athletes ( 5000 m , 10,000 m , marathon and walk races , Men and Women ) had accepted blood transfusion .
It was then that I understood how , when it comes to doping , the key figure is the coach ; it is not really a question of honest or dishonest athletes but of honest or dishonest coaches .
During that same period , apart from the blood transfusions organized by Prof.
Conconi , Italian Athletics Federation was also implementing another project with Prof.
Conconi and with the complicity of one of the major Italian research institutes ; the administration of testosterone and of anabolic steroids to athletes specializing in different Athletics events .
These procedures were of course kept secret ; I heard of them only because I was still working with the National Team .
None of my colleagues opposed them , in fact they were very pleased that the Federation provided them with " methods " that would allow them to achieve better results and so improve their reputation .
I did not know how to organize a movement of opposition as I had to be careful not to lose my job with CONI .
A dear friend of mine , Renato Marino , suggested I speak to his uncle who was a Member of Parliament .
I was very agitated on my way to this appointment but I managed to explain clearly just how dangerous the situation had become with CONI supporting the doping methods carried out by Italian Athletics Federation .
He introduced me to a younger Member of Parliament , Adriana Ceci , who was haematologist and immediately took this issue to heart .
Together we prepared a question in Parliament to the Minister of Health .
The Ministers reply came after a few weeks - blood transfusions aimed at improving sports performances were outlawed and defined blood doping .
The reaction of the entire sports system was particularly violent and led to heated debates on the major newspapers and on television .
Italian sports officials denied that blood transfusions had been performed on Italian athletes in view of the Los Angeles Olympics , but they had to acknowledge the letter sent by the Ministry of Health and agree to ensure that blood transfusions would not be performed in the future .
Also the IOC promptly declared that blood transfusions were forbidden , and this method was officialy denominated blood doping .
One little move of a seemingly powerless individual had delivered a sensational blow to the propagators of doping - it was unbelievable !
3. 1986 , the discovery of doping diaries
A physician and former decathlete by name of Daniele Faraggiana had been instructed by the Athletics Federation and by the Weightlifting Federation to " treat " the athletes of their respective National Teams - mostly with anabolic steroids and with testosterone .
People talked about it but there was no proof .
Proof could come only from phototats of the documents he always carried with him .
Far from easy , but at long last it was done !
The documents listed everything : the names of all the athletes involved ( between them the shot put Olympic Champion in Los Angeles , Alessandro Andrei ) , the drugs that had been administered , the respective dosage , the negative effects on their health , the targets that had been set , even the " philosophy " behind the whole process .
It also emerged that the Anti-Doping Laboratory in Rome , duly accredited by IOC , was used for a totally different purpose : to establish after how long traces of these drugs would disappear from the urine samples of the individual athletes .
The documents also proved that Dr. Faraggiana was regularly paid by the two Federations to administer these drugs and that he provided forbidden substances also to Prof.
Conconi
4. 1987 , an interview to L'Espresso
The excellent results obtained at the European Championships , Mei and the 400 - metre runners , induced the Federation to increase the number of disciplines in my charge ; I became National Coach for the 100m , 200 m , 400 m , both relay races and the 800m .
In March , two of my sprinters , Pier Francesco Pavoni and Antonio Ullo , placed second and third in the 60 m dash at the European Indoor Championships .
We then began to prepare for the World Championships that were to be held in Rome during the month of August .
Taking advantage of the fact that these achievements had given me credit , I released a number of controversial interviews on the issue of doping .
Also Pavoni strongly attacked Athletics Federation .
5. 1987 , the faked jump
The day before the beginning of the World Championships , the secretary of the Field Judges told me that the Long Jump event was going to be arranged so as to favour the Italian athlete Giovanni Evangelisti .
She said to me " a jump of 8 m 38 cm will be arranged for him so that he will be third after Carl Lewis and Emmian " .
I was at the Stadio Olimpico and watched the competition very carefully .
Evangelistis first trial was a no jump , the following ones were quite modest but the distance given was every time over 8 metres .
Finally , the fifth jump ; a very poor performance , the spectators were disappointed and so was Evangelisti himself .
As he was getting dressed , one of the Judges went to him and obviously told him to turn around and look at the electronic scoreboard ; after a few seconds it showed 8 metres and 37 centimetres ; the exact result that had been established beforehand .
I went home in rage ; I could not understand how they had managed it and it drove me mad that they would probably get away with it once again .
I did not sleep all night and in the morning I went to the police station and reported everything .
When the newspapers took up my accusation , CONI started a separate enquiry .
Neither of these investigations seemed to be getting anywhere ; on the contrary all the witnesses denied everything .
My situation was becoming extremely difficult as CONI was ready to sack me .
Everything around me appeared to be crumbling .
First Athletics Federation withdrew my appointment as National Coach , then the Civil Court of Rome decided my accusations had no foundation and dismissed the case ; the Committee established for the CONI investigation was about to do the same .
With the few friends still ready to help me , I stubbornly continued to look for proof of the fraud until I found a young Field Judge , who trembled even as he spoke , but told me he had overhead the other judges when they agreed to arrange the fifth jump .
He said : " I think they recorded the distance , by electronic instruments , before Evangelisti jumped " .
I now had a clue and I started looking for the television recordings of the event .
A journalist friend of mine agreed to let me watch hours of film recorded with various cameras .
After a long day in front of the video I finally found what I was looking for .
The film showed clearly how the Field Judge went to the pit , placed the marker , focused the Seiko apparatus , returned to the pit , retrieved the marker and then waited for Evangelisti to jump .
Ironically , that jump was particularly poor , about 7 metres and 85 centimetres , quite 50 centimetres below the distance which was officially measured .
6. 1989 , a book : Campioni senza valore
I decided to set down the details of this nine - year struggle in a book , Campioni senza valore ( Worthless Champions ) , to illustrate how the struggle had constantly risen in level and how I had encountered unimaginable levels of corruption .
The book was presented to the press in one of the major bookshops in Rome .
Quite a number of journalists and other authors attended , and during the first week the sales were very successful .
Then , all of a sudden , the publisher stopped providing the bookshops and I was submerged by telephone calls and letters from all over Italy : nobody could not find my book .
The publisher told me they had problems with the distribution but that everything would be solved shortly .
Nothing happened ; my book disappeared for ever .
7. 1992 , the appointment to scientific anti-doping committee
After four years of exile , which turned out to be useful to purge my mind of all the poison and tiredness I had accumulated , the President of CONI summoned me and told me he thought I deserved to be rewarded for all I had done for sports .
He therefore offered me to become Head of CONIs Research Department ( Settore Ricerca e Sperimentazione ) .
Shortly afterwards , as doping was becoming a major issue , CONI created a Scientific Anti-doping Committee , which was quite ambiguous since some of the members , such as Prof.
Conconi , and the Heads of Romes Anti-doping Laboratory , were heavily involved in doping activities .
The President of CONI invited me to sit on this Committee .
It was obvious that my name would be used to give credit to the Committee .
I thought it over and , in the end , decided to accept as the time had come to oppose doping from an official position and from within the system .
8. 1992-1994 , science , conscience , logig and information
To begin with , I introduced anti-doping tests to be performed without prior notice on Italian athletes of all sports disciplines .
I then suggested to install a telephone line on which anyone could call , toll - free , to ask for information on medical or pharmacological aspects , or to provide any type of information on events related to doping .
The telephone number was widely publicised on the media .
I also suggested to reduce the length of the suspension for athletes who had proved positive at anti-doping tests but were willing to co-operate by giving complete information on who had introduced them to doping and provided the forbidden drugs .
At the same time , I obtained the IOC official statistics on the number of positive tests detected in each one of the 21 accredited Anti-doping Laboratories throughout the world .
The data clearly showed that the Rome Laboratory was way behind all the others with a ridiculously low number of positive tests .
I pondered over the possible meaning of these statistics and then asked to meet both the President and the General Secretary of CONI to advise them of this situation .
When the meetings of the Scientific Committee began , it became immediately apparent that it was not an assembly of saints and virgins .
As Secretary of the Committee , I was careful to instruct my collaborators to take very detailed minutes of each meeting so as to record the exact details of all discussions .
I mentioned earlier that Prof. Conconi sat on this Committee .
Conconi was always particularly nice to me , nearly sickening .
A number of incidents occurred to change the atmosphere and re-establish the distance between the various members of the Committee .
Right from the beginning I questioned the work done by the Rome Laboratory on the basis of the IOC statistics ; the responsibles were not able to find a reasonable explanation for the ridiculously low number of positive tests .
A few months later , I asked Prof.
Conconi to perform anti-doping tests on urine and blood samples of a professional cyclist , Francesco Moser , who was " assisted " by Conconi , and was preparing to go to Mexico City to try for a new one - hour track record .
Prof. Conconi refused and the other members of the Committee voted against these tests ...
Then , Prof. Conconi submitted to the Committee a request of 150,000 US $ to finance a research project aimed at the detection of erythropoietin .
His request was supported by the President of CONI , Dr. Pescante .
I showed Conconis project to chemistry experts who concluded it could not possibly be successful since the technical bases were wrong .
The request was therefore refused much to the President 's annoyance .
After the refusal of Prof. Conconis request the President of CONI lost interest in the Committee and did not even answer my proposal to organize an International Contest for a method to detect erythropoietin .
I realized that the time had come to let this Committee die out as it was ambiguous and I was being used as a screen .
9. 1994 , the EPO dossier
Before the Committee was closed down , however , I decided to investigate closely , and very secretly , on the incidence of doping among professional cyclists .
I identified twelve key - figures of the cycling milieu , athletes , physicians , officials , and spoke to them assuring that the information would remain strictly anonymous , as my interest lay in collecting information that I would then report to the President and to the General Secretary of CONI in order to establish adequate measures .
After four months of investigation , I arrived at extraordinary conclusions :
anti-doping tests on cyclists were very rarely positive because they used new substances , peptidic hormones , which cannot be traced with urine tests ;
in particular , the erythropoietin hormone also known as Epo , was being used ever more frequently ;
the idea of using Epo for athletes involved in endurance sports , and therefore also for cyclists , had clearly come from Prof.
Conconi , who had been nominated member of the IOC Medical Committee some years before ;
Prof. Conconi and his assistants had signed very important contracts with professional cyclist clubs to administer Epo to the cyclists ;
at that time the production of Epo was quite limited and the substance was provided only to the hospitals who treated nephrology and the cyclists therefore obtained it through illegal channels ;
the cost of Epo on the black market was very high ( about 150 US $ per dose ) ; there were also other very expensive hormones , such as Gh , or Igf1 ; in other words the doping market was becoming as lucrative as the narcotics market ;
I wrote out a 14 - page report and sent it , complete with a protocol letter , to the President and to the General Secretary of CONI .
The President did not even answer it .
The General Secretary sent for me and said he was very worried .
Time passed but nothing more was said about my report .
10 . 1994-1996 , reflux
The only outcome of my report on Epo was that the President of CONI stopped talking to me , while the General Secretary talked of other matters ; he also mentioned that I should make better use of my capacities , instead of concentrating only on doping .
In the meantime the media had forgotten all about doping and were busy magnifying the performance of this or that champion athlete .
Page - long interviews with Prof. Conconi filled all the newspapers .
The President of the IOC Medical Committee , Prince de Merode , accorded Prof .
Conconi the financial support that had been refused by CONIs Scientific Committee !
Prof.
Conconi therefore posed as the great champion of the struggle against doping while he actually administered the forbidden substances in his laboratory !
11 . 1996 , the EPO dossier reappears
October 1996 marked the beginning of a period the President of CONI and other high sports officials are not likely to forget .
One of the major Italian sports daily newspapers , La Gazzetta dello Sport , began a series of articles , rather sterile and unenthusiastic , on doping ; I just looked on and smiled as this happened after a whole two years of complete silence .
After the sixth or seventh instalment , the Journalists of the Gazzetta asked me to help them .
I jokingly pointed out that they had not needed my help for the past two years , nor for the other instalments .
I gave them the name of a physician in Florence , who for many years had been in charge of the national women road cyclists team , and who had contributed significantly to my report on the incidence of Epo doping among professional cyclists .
The two journalists went to Florence where Dr. Flavio Alessandri gave them a number of details ; he also underlined that he had already given these same details to me , nearly two and a half years before , when I was preparing a report for the President of CONI .
The two journalists knew something and came to me asking about the report .
I said " ask the President of CONI , I delivered it to him more than two years ago " .
The President first tried to deny the existence of such a report , and then admitted to having received it , but could not explain why he had kept it secret without doing anything about it .
All hell broke loose .
I was in Russia for a scientific congress but my collaborators informed me of the scandal that had followed the publication of these facts first on the Gazzetta and then on other newspapers .
CONI was being asked to answer for :
a ) having ignored the heavy accusations contained in the dossier ;
b ) not having reported these accusations to the Court of Law ;
c ) not having interrupted , or even discussed CONIs collaboration with Prof. Conconis Centres .
Many italian and international newspapers contacted me ; I was ready for the press campaign that followed and after so many years of struggle , I knew how to manage it .
The dossier was taken up by the press and by television in Italy and abroad ; in particular LEquipe , the major French sports daily dedicated the front page to this issue .
12 . 1996 , the international setting and extra-sports context
During the various conversations I had with journalists from all over the world , I was careful to keep in mind the following concepts :
a ) doping is not a strictly Italian problem but an international one ;
b ) my reason for talking to them was not only to denounce what was happening in Italy , but mainly to raise the issue at an international level ;
c ) the root of the problem is international ; the pharmaceutical companies which produce these substances are multinational companies ; the illegal import and export of these substances is managed by an international racket ( one example is via Internet ) ;
d ) doping is no longer restricted to high level athletes ; for a long time now industrialised production of these drugs and the widespread distribution through a network of peddlers , has turned doping into a social issue ;
e ) the IOC has lost its struggle against doping , through lack of a clear analysis of the situation and of the capacity to intervene on a practical level .
The anti-doping testing techniques have practically not progressed from 1980 onwards , as against the enormous development of doping methods .
f ) consequently , extra -sports institutions should be made aware of the problem and take the necessary measures to face it .
13 . 1996 , CONI , the Italian parliament and the magistrate
As I said , the discovery of the dossier and of the fact that it had been kept secret for over two years created a great sensation .
The attacks of the media were so pressing that even CONI had to take action .
I was summoned by the Committee of Enquiry and my hearing lasted over five hours .
The Italian Parliament took an interest in these events and formed a Commission of Enquiry who summoned both the President of Coni , Dr. Pescante , and Dr. Santilli President of the Sports Physicians Federation .
They were questioned as to the relationship between CONI and Prof. Conconi of the University of Ferrara .
Dr. Pescante lied to them saying that the relationship with Prof.
Conconi had been ended a few years before , when Prof.
Conconis activities had begun to create suspicion .
There was also criminal investigation ; in the month of November 1996 , three investigators from the Criminal Investigation Department came to my office in CONI , asking to speak to me .
This interview lasted a whole thirteen hours .
Also Following the echo of this affair even the International Cyclist Union ( UCI ) had to take adequate measures , and started preparing tests on blood samples .
An haematocrit limit was set for the value : 50 % for men , 48 % for women .
14 . 1997 , the Di Terlizzi case
After a few weeks of intense excitement , the media lost interest in doping once again ; nearly no articles in the press , no debates on television .
My telephone stopped ringing .
Also the CONI officials around me were silent .
Then they organized the terrible coup de grace .
Anna Maria Di Terlizzi , a young 100 m hurdler I had been training for a few years , was tested positive for caffeine on February 7th 1997 , after an indoor competition .
The caffeine level found in the urine sample was very high , nearly double the value established by IOC .
When the girl told me what had happened , I asked if she had taken any medicament .
She answered she was on the pill , but had not taken nothing except a cappuccino at breakfast and a cup of coffee after lunch , but the competition had taken place hours later , in the evening .
The caffeine value found in the urine sample corresponded to about thirty cups of coffee taken at the same time .
After a week , the second sample of urine was tested in the presence of an expert of our choice .
Right at the beginning , the Head of the Rome Anti-doping Laboratory asked our expert if he chose the normal testing procedure , which would last several hours , or the shortened procedure .
The expert was very surprised and answered , that it was , of course , necessary to repeat exactly the procedure used for the first test , the one that had proved positive .
Before the end of the qualitative analysis , the Head of the Laboratory asked our expert if he wanted to go out for a cup of coffee .
He refused and noticed that the Head of the Laboratory and his collaborators were becoming increasingly nervous .
When the qualitative analysis was over , the result was astounding : no caffeine peak at all !
The expert called me on his cellular phone ; I had been waiting for that call all morning and the news left me breathless ; but I still couldnt believe it .
I asked how long it would take to have the results of the quantitative analysis ; about an hour , he said .
That hour seemed never to end .
At last he called me with the results ; Anna Maria 's urine sample contained the traces of one cappuccino and one cup of coffee .
At last , it dawned on me ; they had prepared an ambush , the worst possible one : they had tried to destroy my reputation , my credibility .
I realised then that I had been dealing with really malicious people .
The following day , and for a few days after that , the Italian media gave quite relevant coverage to this incident and accused the higher sports officials of having organized a fraud to get rid of me .
Unfortunately , the international media did not understand the significance of what had been planned ; they did not connect the trap prepared for me to my untiring struggle against doping .
15 . 1997-1998 , everybody has forgotten
There was also a question in Parliament asking the Minister of Sports to assure that those who had organized this fraud would be called to answer for it .
The President of CONI tried to clear himself of suspicion and the only result was the substitution of the Head of Romes Anti-doping Laboratory .
As usual , the media lost interest after a few days and the President of CONI , furious because he had failed to get rid of me , took his revenge by cutting off my Departments funds , so that all our work came to a standstill , and by isolating me completely .
16 . 1998 , the scandal of the Rome Anti-doping laboratory
In the month of August 1998 , Zdenek Zeman , coach of a first division soccer team , A.S. Roma , declared in an interview that doping was widespread among soccer players .
A great scandal ensued as the foreign press took up the news .
The usual scenario : a sudden and totally superficial interest , no real understanding of the facts nor of their significance , followed by an equally sudden loss of interest , boredom , perhaps , or calculation .
The Public Attorney of Turin , Raffaele Guariniello , started an investigation ; he summoned Zeman first , and then me , on the following day .
He asked me to tell him all I knew about doping among soccer players .
I answered that the question should be worded differently ; it should be : " how are anti-doping tests performed on soccer players ? "
In the following days the press reported that during my hearing I had accused the Rome Laboratory of using irregular testing procedures .
The President of CONI and the President of the Sports Physicians Federation , reacted violently ; my declarations were false , they said , and I would lose my job at CONI unless I could prove the facts .
And proof was found !
The premises of the Rome Laboratory were searched , by order of the Public Attorney , and , as I had said , it was established that the anti-doping tests performed on soccer players did not include tests for the detection of anabolic steroids or of the other hormones !
The scandal became international and grew to unprecedented proportions ; a number of the events that followed will prove decisive in the struggle against doping , namely :
1 ) the Italian Government appointed a Committee of Enquiry , headed by the Vice President of the Consiglio Superiore della Magistratura , the highest judicial authority in Italy ;
2 ) at long last , the Public Attorney of Turin forced the IOC to take notice of what was happening ; the Rome Anti-doping Laboratory accredited by IOC was closed down .
17 . 1998 , the president of CONI resigns from office
The President of CONI , Mario Pescante , who had denied charges right to the end and accused me of lying , was found guilty by the Committee of Enquiry appointed by the Government and had to resign from office !
18 . 1998 , criminal investigations begin
As I mentioned earlier , investigations on doping were opened in a number of Italian cities .
It would be impossible here to list them all , I shall therefore mention only the more important ones :
1 ) the Public Attorney of Torino investigated the Rome Anti-doping Laboratory , the first division soccer team Juventus and Marco Pantani .
2 ) the Public Attorney of Bologna investigated one of the cities chemists which was charged with import , production and illicit sale of forbidden drugs ; the names of important customers were revealed ;
3 ) the Public Attorney of Ferrara investigated Prof. Conconi , in particular his twenty - year relationship with CONI and with various Italian Sports Federations ;
4 ) the Public Attorney of Venezia investigated the incidence of doping among the younger athletes and came to shocking conclusions ;
5 ) the Public Attorney of Trento investigated the Pantani case in Giro dItalia ;
6 ) the Public Attorney of Brescia investigated the higher officials of the Italian National Cyclist Team and charged them with the acquisition of forbidden drugs in Switzerland .
19 . 1998 -1999 , work on a new anti-doping law begins
The bill on doping was drawn up by the Senate , the higher branch of the Italian Parliament .
It combined the better points of six different drafts on the issue ; this proved to be a time - consuming process and the bills procedure in Parliament was accelerated only as a result of the very serious doping offences discovered in August 1998 .
I participated in the various steps of the preparation of this bill which in September 1999 was passed to the Chamber of Deputies where it will be examined by the Health Committee .
I was appointed consultant to the Committee by the President of the Committee itself as work on the final draft of the bill will begin within the next few weeks .
20 . 1998-1999 , from the scandals to the Lausane fiasco
When IOC decided to oppose the diffusion of doping , it set up a Medical Committee , and appointed , none other than Prince Alexandre De Merode as it President ; not a physiologist or a chemist , no , just a member of the aristocracy .
This occurred 28 years ago , and the President had plenty of time to prove his inadequacy : in the implementation of anti-doping methods , in the organization of the Anti-doping Laboratories , in the selection of his collaborators .
Halfway through his seemingly unending mandate , De Merode fell under the spell of an Italian biochemist , Prof. Conconi , who was strongly supported by the powerful Italian IOC members .
To please them , he appointed Prof. Conconi member of the Medical Committee and readily confirmed , in public , his absolute faith in Prof.
Conconi even though this man was accused of doping by the public attorney of Ferrara .
To show his gratitude , Prof. Conconi arranged for the University of Ferrara to confer an honorary degree , in medicine , of course , to Prince Alexandre De Merode .
While the CONI Scientific Anti-doping Committee refused Prof .
Conconis request for funds to study a method for the detection of Epo in urine samples in 1994 , the highly competent President of the IOC Medical Committee readily accorded these funds .
A series of public declarations began : De Merode and Conconi jointly declared that the test would be ready " at the beginning of 1996 ... in June ... it is ready , it is a question only of final details ... will be ready for use at the end of 1996 ... in June 1997 ... "
Finally , De Merode had to admit , in great confusion during a press conference that the project had been a total failure .
In January 1999 , with the Lausanne Conference dedicated to the struggle against doping , the IOC made a desperate attempt to recover it credibility which had been significantly undermined both by the scandals on the venues of the Olympic Games , and by the fact that doping was increasingly widespread among athletes .
The Conference was attended by many Ministers of Sports , but it backfired as various Ministers openly attacked the IOC for not having implemented an adequate strategy to oppose the diffusion of doping .
21 . 1998-2000 , doping from the producer to the consumer
During these same years , doping evolved considerably ; at first , more than twenty years ago , it was limited to high level athletes and many Sports Federations in various countries tolerated doping , in some cases even protected and encouraged this plague .
There was a great demand among athletes for Gh ; it was first extracted from cadavers , and later , after 1990 , synthesized .
The multinational pharmaceutical companies were made aware of the enormous potential of this market .
The same happened with Epo after 1993 .
High level athletes acted as testimonials for the effectiveness of these substances which were then sold to an increasing number of amateur athletes and then even youngsters as the network of complaisant physicians and peddlers developed .
The entity of the turnover ( no less than fourty thousand million US dollars a year only for the illicit drugs and ten times as much for the so - called dietary supplements ) could not but attract criminal organizations .
For my part , I frequently pointed that this danger .
The two following examples confirm that the fears were not unfounded :
1 ) in September of 1999 , a large operation of the Italian police led to the seizure of relevant quantities of doping substances and to various arrests ; evidence clearly pointed to an international racket in the hands of the Mafia ;
2 ) in May of 1999 a commissioned burglary occurred in Nicosia ( Cyprus ) ; four million and five hundred thousand doses of Epo were taken ; according to the investigators these were to be sold on the black market to athletes specializing in endurance disciplines ;
3 ) in January 1999 in Milan , the Police received an anonymous telephone call and seized various bags containing 35 kilograms of testosterone (...! ) ; enough to dope 700,000 athletes for one day , or if we prefer , 70,000 athletes for 10 days .
The telephone call was probably a reckoning between racketeers .
22 . 1999 , Nandrolone and EPO champions
This last year is dotted with resounding doping cases ; a real massacre of key figures who were far from innocent .
Most of these worthless champions tested positive to nandrolone , an anabolic steroid : the British sprinter , Linford Christie , the Jamaican sprinter Marlene Ottey , the Barcelona Olympic 5000 m champion , Dieter Baumann , French and Russian professional soccer players , weightlifting record holders and various women athletes from Sri Lanka , Columbia , the Dominican Republic and Morocco !
What a coincidence !
The same drug , nandrolone , was found in the urine samples of athletes from different continents , who specialized in different sports disciplines and has invaded female sports , even in the countries where " integriste " religions are predominant .
It would appear that a grapevine spread the information world - wide , overcoming ethical , religious and sexual barriers .
A grapevine dictated by commercial interests which have transformed the world of sports into a stupid market , populated by vapid athletes who parade muscles and worthless medals .
The other resounding case concerned a professional cyclist , Marco Pantani , who dominated the major stage races in these last few years .
This year , the UCI found his haematocrit value well above the establish limit 50 % .
This happened just before the second last stage of the Giro d'Italia , which he was dominating once more .
The UCI started an investigation and it came out that he was being " assisted " by Prof.
Conconi and his team .
In 1995 , Pantani came very close to death on account of a sudden decrease of the haematocrit value from 60 % (...! ) to below 16 % .
Many former champions of endurance disciplines have now the side - effects of Epo , but they remain silent , and even deny everything when they are questioned on this subject .
It does not occur to them to warn the thousands of young athletes who are following in their steps , all they care about is their own reputation .
Death figures hover behind the stage of sports events as doping becomes increasingly widespread among young and not so young athletes .
Hypocrisy is the word for athletes , trainers and sports officials .
The media look on a pretend to believe in it all .
In the meantime , the producers of these forbidden substances , the complacent phycisians and the peddlers take advantage of such foolishness and falsehood as their profit increases .
23 . Analysis of international situation
I believe that the battle to combat doping in the international arena has reached the following situation :
1 ) the IOC has little power over International Federations , which almost always take decisions regardless of the IOC 's rules , with regard to the lists of substances and doping methods and to the size and actual application of sanctions .
This is true for both anti-doping testing during competitions and especially random testing during training ;
2 ) there is moreover no temporal or substantial correlation between the aims of the IOC and those of International Federations , or between the activity schedules of the IOC and those of International Federations .
The objectives and consequent activity of the IOC are indeed focused almost entirely on a four - yearly event , the Olympic Games , while those of International Federations focus more closely on day - to - day events ;
3 ) the IOC has gradually become an Organisation that is part corrupt and part inadequate , occupying the demanding and bulky role of the world 's foremost sporting institution , but in this capacity it has been unable to dialogue with the world 's leading non-sporting institutions - Governments , the World Health Organization , international pharmaceutical companies or international Scientific Organisations - to seek joint solutions to problems ;
4 ) at the same time , International Federations have been busy " defending themselves " in the anti-doping battle without defending their sports from doping .
Their actions have accordingly been slow and very inadequate .
24 . The media system : Basic considerations
Of all journalists , those in the most difficult position are probably those employed by specialist sporting papers , because they are called upon to write about the feats of sportsmen and women who are the readers ' idols .
A sports champion is , in the collective imagination , a people 's champion , loved by one and all .
He is an example to be copied , full of personal qualities .
He is naturally good , even though he may not be , intelligent and educated , even though he may actually be stupid and very ignorant .
And what is even worse , he sells papers and conquers an audience for the radio and TV , but only if they take care of him .
Journalists have the following problem : talking about doping or corruption makes you unpopular .
It is just the opposite of what is said about journalists making up stories about doping to sell more copies or gain a wider audience : the more you praise the champion the more you sell .
When you talk about doping , people do not at first believe you ; then , when the proof comes out , readers finally realise and begin to lose interest in sport .
This state of affairs is of course very dangerous for sports papers .
Any journalist that intends to delve into the doping problem will come up against strong resistance , first of all from his editor .
He will have to write with the proof in his hands and with great care if he does not want to be sued for libel , especially if the sportsman in question is very popular .
Suing against doping accusations has become all the rage : even those who are guilty resort to the law in a bid to intimidate both the journalist and the paper in question .
At this point , the journalist will ask himself whether it is worth all the trouble .
Only if the answer is yes will he have the strength to carry on .
If he realises that his profession obliges him to be honest and to keep the public correctly informed , then he will have the courage to go on .
A separate chapter should also be written about those sports newspapers that also act as organisers of major sporting events .
Like Italy 's daily " La Gazzetta dello Sport " , which organises cycling 's Giro d'Italia , or the French sporting daily '' L' Equipe ' ' , which organises the Tour de France .
How can they combine the need for correct information with that of promoting the race they are organising ?
How can they talk about doping without covering their creations with mud ?
As for more general newspapers that also deal with sport , the situation is different .
These journalists can be a little freer , as sport is not the only attraction for readers .
In conclusion , a sports journalist will only be able to do his job well if he realises that doping is a real , dramatic social problem , and that youngsters are in danger of taking " artificial " champions as role models .
It is a difficult choice to make , which is why only a few have had the necessary courage .
25 . Rediscovery of ethics or crisis
But the IOC is no other than a manifestation of what sport has become .
Proof of this assertion is the crisis of International Federations or , returning to the subject of this seminar , the proven unstoppable spread of doping in all parts of the world .
Doping tests have been positive at the Asian Games , African Games , PanAmerican Games and the European Championships in various sports , even at the PanArabian Games , however inadequate or backward these analysis methods may be .
A clear example of the Global Village !
26 . The sporting education of children and youngsters
I believe that the crucial question for the future is the following :
Which needs must the supply of sports to children and youngsters meet most urgently ?
The need to find youngsters of great sporting talent through a planned selection programme ?
The need to submit youngsters to intense training to verify their real potential ?
The need to identify " winners " from a psychological point of view , thanks to their resistance to stress , their control of anxiety and very strong motivation ?
This is the " culture " which , disdaining the rights of individuals , has exploited youngsters in a search for CHAMPIONS .
A culture that arose in the authoritarian regimes , but that was copied by democratic nations !
The social consequences of this process are extremely serious , leading , among other things , to the emergence of the most cynical and unprincipled persons in the sporting sphere .
At the same time , this process puts off honest persons who respect children 's rights to :
have fun by playing sports ;
limit their sporting activity so as to fit it in with studies and a normal social life ;
claim victory every time they improve themselves ;
Since broad segments of the sporting world have shown themselves to be incapable of adequately performing this educational task , schools in particular must deal with the problem , teaching youngsters to free themselves from conditioning , to view sport as an asset and victory over oneself as more important than victory over others .
It is always possible indeed to improve oneself , no matter what level one is at , while victory over others seldom occurs , requiring genetic advantages and a certain " diversity " , which should be accepted as a value and not simply reduced to " one winner , all the others losers " .
27 . The solutions : Creation of the World Anti-Doping Agency
The success of the Agency will depend on the quality of contributions from national Governments , which will have to :
a ) carry out a preliminary analysis of the IOC 's activity in scientific , legal , technical - sporting and ethical - educational terms , to gain an idea of its merits but also of its responsibilities , potential , inability , sincerity of intents and ambiguity ;
b ) study the spread of doping in a rational manner , both the existing situation and possible developments in the near future ;
c ) appoint their own representatives to the Agency on the basis of competence , honesty and independence from the IOC and from leading international sports institutions ;
d ) act to ensure that the strategies drawn up are quickly implemented .
28 . The solutions :
The search to improve anti-doping analysis methods
One of the tasks to be performed by the new Agency will be that of commencing Studies and Research on new anti-doping analysis methods that can detect in athletes ' urine the new pharmacological agents used and , more generally , that can extend analysis methods beyond urine to other biological indicators .
This is a task in which the IOC Medical Commission has failed , and we do not see how it can now help to tackle the problem .
This task will thus be shouldered mainly by Governments .
A detailed research programme must thus be drawn up and rolled out :
a ) in conjunction with Universities and Research Institutes ;
b ) in conjunction with IOC Anti-doping Laboratories , which must organise specific sectors really dedicated to Research in their own area of competence ;
c ) in conjunction with pharmaceutical companies , which can provide necessary information on the pharmaco - kinetic action of new products and on their chemical properties .
At this point in time , the most effective actions to be taken appear to be the following :
1 ) the intensification of random anti-doping tests ;
2 ) the development of analytical methods capable of identifying molecules that are modified so as to render them unrecognisable in anti-doping tests ;
3 ) the use of biological indicators other than urine ( e.g. blood , saliva and hair ) to uncover drug - taking methods :
4 ) the perfecting of new techniques , e.g. IRMS ( isotopic ratio mass spectrometry ) to determine whether a given substance ( e.g. testosterone or nandrolone ) is of endogenous or exogenous origin ;
5 ) the development of indirect methods based on a longitudinal examination of biochemical and clinical parameters .
29 .
The solutions : Campaigns to safeguard sportmen's health
The purpose of anti-doping tests is to demonstrate the presence in urine of a forbidden substance or of a relative metabolite as proof of the taking of doping drugs .
Many substances are not however detectable at the present time , so the use of doping substances has increased dramatically in all parts of the world .
These substances , as already mentioned , include : the erythropoietic hormone ( Epo ) , the growth hormone ( Gh ) , the insulin growth factor ( Igf ) .
Starting from the assumption that these substances , administered to healthy persons in the absence of a pathology , are harmful to one 's health and cause evident physiological alterations , it is possible and indeed dutiful to safeguard the health of sportsmen and women through the monitoring of haematic - chemical parameters measured in the blood or urine .
The International Cycling Union ( UCI ) , the International Skiing Federation ( FIS ) , the International Biathlon Union ( IBU ) , Italy 's National Olympic Committee ( CONI ) and the French Sports Ministry have already begun blood test campaigns to detect indirect signs of the taking of erythropoietin .
These programmes have proved to be very effective , making it possible to reduce the use of Epo in endurance specialities .
CONI has even established that Italian sportsmen wishing to take part in the Sidney Olympics must undergo blood tests , otherwise they will be excluded from the list of potential participants at the Olympic Games .
In Italy , studies are now being conducted for special blood test campaigns against the use of Gh and other hormones , in collaboration with study groups from other countries .
30 .
The solutions : Agreements with international pharmaceutical companies
The IOC has been unable ( or perhaps unwilling ) to dialogue with Pharmaceutical Companies and seek forms of collaboration to find solutions to the doping problem , especially for those drugs that cannot be detected during tests .
The new Agency will have to work in this direction , and it will have the authority to do so .
Pharmaceutical companies must be asked to :
a ) produce drugs in relation to the actual needs of the ill ;
b ) report to competent authorities ( WHO and the Governments of different countries ) any anomalies and suspicions regarding the increase in demand and consumption ;
c ) forgo with a great sense of responsibility a portion of their revenues , receiving as a reward the knowledge that they are helping to safeguard the health of a large number of youngsters .
The World Anti-doping Agency should steer the actions of single countries in identifying legislative or regulatory instruments that might allow a definition of the nature of substances similar to those included in the IOC lists of doping substances during the registration phase for new drugs .
31 . The solutions : Approval of specific criminal laws
The Agency could pursue another primary objective : that of examining the legislative situation in different countries to assess the possibility of :
a ) making additions to existing laws on narcotics or on drugs in general ;
b ) proposing specific texts on drugs and doping procedures for those cases in which this is deemed necessary .
For the comparative analysis of different legislative situations , suitable instruments should be prepared , where they are not already present in single systems , to foster the prevention of specific crimes relating to the international trafficking of doping substances .
32 . The solutions : International cooperation among magistrates
The present report has repeatedly referred to the international dimension of the doping phenomenon .
The seizure of doping drugs and several investigations in France , Italy and Belgium show without a shadow of a doubt that the trafficking of these substances transcends national borders .
We have also mentioned the continuing spread of sales via the Internet , giving rise to orders and deliveries that escape all controls .
It should be added that the life of sportsmen and women is one of constant travelling , especially for those in the top flight .
Sportsmen are often accompanied on their trips by coaches , masseurs or physiotherapists , physicians and federal officials .
In this nomadic existence , doping " runners " are hired from the circles of organised crime .
An Italian professional cyclist , was for example recently arrested in France for the trafficking of huge amounts of Igfl from Mexico to Europe .
And a Moroccan top athlete was recently arrested in Italy after becoming involved in the international trafficking of enormous quantities of doping substances .
We could go on for a long time with other examples .
Students at a school in central New South Wales were allegedly forced to engage in group sex and were hypnotised to have intercourse with teachers , a court has heard .
The allegations were made during a bail application for a former chaplain at St Stanislaus College in Bathurst .
Brian Spillane , 66 , is one of several men charged after allegations of assaults dating back to the 1960s .
Earlier this year he was granted bail on 117 charges of indecently assaulting former students .
He has since been charged with another 29 offences .
In asking for bail to be revoked , the prosecutor said the brief of evidence " paints a picture of rampant paedophilia " .
Spillane was granted bail and is now accused of a total of 146 charges of indecency and sexual abuse against 27 victims .

H1N1 Swine Flu Vaccine clinical trials has said that he became seriously ill as a consequence of the H1N1 Swine Flu Vaccine , according to reports in the German mainstream media .
Berlin : Last week Australian H1N1 Swine Flu Vaccine Panvax Manufacturer “ Listed Guillian - Barre Syndrome as vaccine side effect ” .
And now a German man who participated inclinical trials has said that he became seriously ill as a consequence of the , according to reports in the German mainstream media .
Axel Sch. , a 40 year old man with a degree in business , enrolled for the “ swine flu ” clinical trials at Munich ’s Ludwig - Maximilians - University led by Dr Frank von Sonnenburg .
After receiving an injection on August 10th he became seriously ill .
“ The injection made me sick – the test is irresponsible , ” he said .
He felt the impact just a few hours after the injection , he said .
“ I felt totally shattered .
On the third day , I felt pain in my kidneys and head and I got a fever .
Then I had a coughing fit – and my washbasin was suddenly red .
It was blood . ”
Sonnenburg has denied the patient ’s claims , but good clinical practice requires a doctor to include all the side effects , no matter how serious to avoid falsifying data .
The failure of Sonnenburg to acknowledge the report of Axel Sch. raises serious questions about just how independent and valid the clinical study results on this new and untested vaccine material with adjuvant can be considered .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
It appears that the vaccine material being tested on Axel Sch. was from GSK which has produced a swine flu vaccine using the oil - based adjuvant containing squalene .
GSK issued a press release on Monday 14th September maintaining that a one dose “ swine flu ” vaccine with adjuvants had proved successful in its first clinical trials in Germany .

Health Secretary Klaus Theo Schroeder said after a meeting of health ministers of the seven leading industrialized nations ( G - 7 ) and Mexico in Brussels , the government could hold on to Impfstart mid-October .

Comment on this article
This is an important development :
Shor ’s algorithm was first demonstrated in a computing system based on nuclear magnetic resonance — manipulating molecules in a solution with strong magnetic fields .
It was later demonstrated with quantum optical methods but with the use of bulk components like mirrors and beam splitters that take up an unwieldy area of several square meters .
Last year , the Bristol researchers showed they could miniaturize this optical setup , building a quantum photonic circuit on a silicon chip mere millimeters square .
They replaced mirrors and beam splitters with waveguides that weave their way around the chip and interact to split , reflect , and transmit light through the circuit .
They then injected photons into the waveguides to act as their qubits .
Now they ’ve put their circuit to work :
Using four photons that pass through a sequence of quantum logic gates , the optical circuit helped find the prime factors of the number 15 .
While the researchers showed that it was possible to solve for the factors , the chip itself did n’t just spit out 5 and 3 .
Instead , it came up with an answer to the “ order - finding routine , ” the “ computationally hard ” part of Shor ’s algorithm that requires a quantum calculation to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time , according to Jeremy O’Brien , a professor of physics and electrical engineering at the University of Bristol .
The researchers then finished the computation using an ordinary computer to finally come up with the correct factors .
WASHINGTON , D.C. -
For those hoping the international community might finally be getting more serious about possible sanctions against Iran for its continued defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions , the headlines this week were downright discouraging .
" In Face of Sanctions Push , China Warms Up to Iran , " The New York Times declared on Friday .
" China Lauds Ties with Iran , " according to Thursday 's Wall Street Journal .
And , as Charles Krauthammer noted in his column in Friday 's Washington Post , his own paper said on Wednesday : " Russian Not Budging on Iran Sanctions ; Clinton Unable to Sway Counterpart . "
None of this , of course , should be a major surprise in light of the Oct. 1 meeting in Geneva of the so - called P5+1 with Iran .
At that meeting , Iranian representatives agreed to a process by which Iran might let in international inspectors and might send lightly enriched uranium to Russia for further enrichment .
Russia and China have been hoping for that process , which removes the need for even any talk of sanctions , let alone the sanctions themselves .
Russian and Chinese resistance to sanctions is certainly not new .
Several U.N. resolutions against Iran passed during the Bush Administration were severely watered down at the insistence of Moscow and Beijing .
Now , those capitals do n't even want to talk about the possibility of taking U.N. action against Tehran .
It would be " premature , " in the words of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov after meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
Added Prime Minister Vladimir Putin several thousand miles away in Beijing : " There is no need to frighten the Iranians " with talk of sanctions .
" If now , before making any steps we start announcing some sanctions , " Putin said , " then we wo n't be creating favorable conditions for talks to end positively .
This is why it is premature to talk about this now . "
Despite this crystal clear rejection from Russia , Clinton voiced optimism in an interview on ABC's " Good Morning America " that if sanctions become necessary , " we will have support from Russia . "
Her optimism apparently is based on what U.S. officials claim she was told by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Tuesday .
These same officials got carried away when Medvedev , in New York for the U.N. General Assembly session last month , criticized sanctions but said they might be inevitable anyway .
Alas , for those of us no longer working in the government , we can rely only on Lavrov 's and Putin 's public comments to divine Russia 's position .
And based on those comments - and the fact that it is Putin , much more so than Medvedev , who is calling the shots in Russia on issues of this importance - Clinton 's optimism seems sadly misplaced .
While in Moscow with Lavrov standing next to her , Clinton also had this to say : " We did not ask for anything today .
We reviewed the situation and where it stood , which I think was the appropriate timing for what this process entails . "
How could she not have asked for Russian support for sanctions ?
She schlepped 5,000 miles to Moscow and did n't seek Russian support for sanctions ?
Could this be true ?
Whether Clinton asked or not , Lavrov and Putin seemed to have provided a clear answer - no .
The situation with China is n't much better .
As part of a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , Chinese officials hosted Iranian Vice President Reza Rahimi this week , and the two governments " had frequent exchanges , and cooperation in trade and energy has widened and deepened , " according to press reports .
That certainly does n't sound promising for seeking Chinese support on sanctions either .
It may explain why neither Russia nor China was invited to a meeting organized last week by the U.S. with 10 allies to discuss the prospects for possible sanctions .
Having Russia and China at the meeting likely would have led to disagreements on the way forward , but excluding them from it virtually guarantees that they will not support sanctions .
Perhaps the Obama Administration is planning to follow a path outside of the U.N. process , where Russia and China have veto power .
Perhaps it has already discounted the likelihood of having Russia and China on board .
Why , then , the continued spin from Clinton and others ?
The problem with both Moscow and Beijing is that they have too much at stake in their respective relationships with Iran .
They do n't want to sacrifice that by siding with the U.S. and other members of the P5+1 .
They 'd much rather have the West play the role of the bad guy in applying pressure on Iran .
Moreover , they simply do n't share the same sense of threat , notwithstanding the recent disclosure of the nuclear facility in Qum .
The Russians reportedly were surprised by this revelation - and then very annoyed that they had not been briefed on it well beforehand .
The clock is ticking , and Iran continues to work away on its nuclear program .
One can only hope that the Obama Administration knows what it is doing and is working quietly , behind - the - scenes , in winning support for possible sanctions .
The public evidence suggests otherwise .
The concentration camp in Ohrdruf was the first to be liberated by U.S. forces during World War II , and just a week later , General Dwight D. Eisenhower paid a visit in order to survey the scene .
The following letter , in which Eisenhower describes said experience , was written by the future President three days later and sent to General George C. Marshall in Washington .
Although the entire letter is interesting and worth reading , the now famous description by Eisenhower can be seen in the image below and found in the transcript ’s 6th paragraph .
All three pages of the letter can be seen here ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) as JPGs or in PDF format here .

SECRET
DDE/nmr
15 April 1945
Dear General :
Today I forwarded to the Combined Chiefs of Staff the essentials of my future plans .
In a word , what I am going to do now that the western enemy is split into two parts , is to take up a defensive line in the center ( along a geographical feature that will tend to separate our forces physically from the advancing Russians ) and clean up the important jobs on our flanks .
A mere glance at the map shows that one of these is to get Lubeck and then clear up all the areas west and north of there .
The other job is the so - called “ redoubt . ”
I deem both of these to be vastly more important than the capture of Berlin — anyway , to plan for making an immediate effort against Berlin would be foolish in view of the relative situation of the Russians and ourselves at this moment .
We ’d get all coiled up for something that in all probability would never come off .
While true that we have seized a small bridgehead over the Elbe , it must be remembered that only our spearheads are up to that river ; our center of gravity is well back of there .
Montgomery anticipates that he will need no help from the Americans other than that involved in an extension of Simpson ’s left .
However , I rather think that he will want possibly an American Airborne Division and maybe an Armored Division .
I have enough in reserve to give him this much if he needs it .
But assuming that he needs no American help , that job will be performed by the 17 divisions of the 21st Army Group .
In the center , extending all the way from Newhouse on the Elbe down to the vicinity of Selb on the border of Czechoslovakia , will be the Ninth and First Armies , probably with about 23 to 24 divisions , including their own reserves .
This will be enough to push on to Berlin if resistance is light , and the Russians do not advance in that sector .
Bradley ’s main offensive effort will be the thrust along the line Wurzburg - Nuremberg - Linz , carried out by the Third Army with about 12 divisions .
Devers , with another 12 U.S. divisions and 6 French divisions , will capture Munich and all of the German territory lying within his zone of advance .
About 8 divisions at that time will be on strictly occupational duties , largely under Fifteenth Army .
This will leave about 5 divisions , including Airborne , in my Reserve .
The intervention of the British Chiefs of Staff in my military dealings with the Soviet has thrown quite a monkey - wrench into our speed of communication .
If you will note from Antonov ’s reply to the telegram that we finally sent ( as revised on recommendations of the BCOS ) the point he immediately raised is whether our message implies an attempt , under the guise of military operations , to change the occupational boundaries already agreed upon by our three governments .
Frankly , if I should have forces in the Russian occupational zone and be faced with an order or “ request ” to retire so that they may advance to the points they choose , I see no recourse except to comply .
To do otherwise would probably provoke an incident , with the logic of the situation all on the side of the Soviets .
I cannot see exactly what the British have in mind for me to do , under such circumstances .
It is a bridge that I will have to cross when I come to it but I must say that I feel a bit lost in trying to give sensible instructions to my various commanders in the field .
On a recent tour of the forward areas in First and Third Armies , I stopped momentarily at the salt mines to take a look at the German treasure .
There is a lot of it .
But the most interesting – although horrible – sight that I encountered during the trip was a visit to a German internment camp near Gotha .
The things I saw beggar description .
While I was touring the camp I encountered three men who had been inmates and by one ruse or another had made their escape .
I interviewed them through an interpreter .
The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation , cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick .
In one room , where they were piled up twenty or thirty naked men , killed by starvation , George Patton would not even enter .
He said he would get sick if he did so .
I made the visit deliberately , in order to be in position to give first - hand evidence of these things if ever , in the future , there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to “ propaganda . ”
If you could see your way clear to do it , I think you should make a visit here at the earliest possible moment , while we are still conducting a general offensive .
You would be proud of the Army you have produced .
In the first place , U.S. ground and air forces are a unit ; they both participate in the same battle all the way down the line from me to the lowest private .
I can find no evidence whatsoever olf any mutual jealousy , suspicion or lack of understanding .
In fact , I know of one or two Major Generals in the Air Force that one of my Army Commanders would accept as Division Commanders today .
Next , you would be struck by the “ veteran ” quality of the whole organization .
Commanders , staffs , and troops , both air and ground , go about their business in a perfectly calm and sure manner that gets results .
I am quite certain that no organization has ever existed that can re-shuffle and re-group on a large scale and continue offensives without a single pause , better than can Bradley and his staff .
Another thing that would strike you is the high average of ability in our higher command team .
In recent telegrams to you I explained something of the quality of our Corps Commanders .
Inadvertently I left out the name of Ridgway , one of the finest soldiers this war ever produced .
If ever we get to the point that I can recommend to you additional Corps Commanders for promotion , he will certainly have to be one .
In Army command , there is no weakness except for the one feature of Patton ’s unpredictability so far as his judgment ( usually in small things ) is concerned .
These Army Commanders , with Bradley , make up a team that could scarcely be improved on .
Bradley , of course , remains the one whose tactical and strategical judgment I consider almost unimpeachable .
Only once have we had a real difference of opinion on a major question .
He is big , sound , and has the complete confidence of those above and below him .
Patton ’s latest crackpot actions may possibly get some publicity .
One involved the arbitrary relief of a censor ( over whom he had no authority whatsoever ) for what Patton considered to be an error in judgment .
All the censor did was to allow the printing of a story saying we had captured some of the German monetary reserves .
Three or four newspapers have written very bitter articles about Patton , on this incident , and to my disgust they call it another example of “ Army Blundering ” .
I took Patton ’s hide off , but there is nothing else to do about it .
Then again , he sent off a little expedition on a wild goose chase in an effort to liberate some American prisoners .
The upshot was that he got 25 prisoners back and lost a full company of medium tanks and a platoon of light tanks .
Foolishly , he then imposed censorship on the movement , meaning to lift it later , which he forgot to do .
The story has now been released and I hope the newspapers do not make too much of it .
One bad , though Patton says accidental , feature of the affair was that his own son - in - law was one of the 25 released .
Patton is a problem child , but he is a great fighting leader in pursuit and exploitation .
This developed into quite a long story , all to convince you that in a short visit here you could see , in visible form , the fruits of much of your work over the past five years .
In a matter of three or four days I am sure you would see things that would be of great satisfaction to you from now on .
This sounds like I am completely and wholly satisfied with everything that I see .
This is far from the case , but the point is that higher commanders have learned to handle the important things and we have gradually developed an organization that keeps the nagging details in the hands of people that can give their whole attention to them .
With best wishes ,

In August , the Kansas Supreme Court issued a ruling against a mortgage tracking service which may prove very costly to banks in foreclosure , leading to massive writedowns .
It could be a life saver for many trapped in the foreclosure process .
The case goes to the core of the functioning of massive markets in securitization and derivatives and has wide - ranging importance .
The service , MERS ( Mortgage Electronic Registration System ) , is a privately - owned registry set up in 1997 by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and several large banks including JPMorgan Chase , Citigroup and Bank of America .
In foreclosure , MERS is often the party which files on behalf of the lenders behind the mortgage against homeowners .
The Kansas ruling effectively blocks MERS from bringing legal action on the lenders ’ behalf in certain foreclosure situations , potentially putting the kibosh on MERS ’ legal authority on the more than 60 million mortgages it holds and subjecting the lenders to huge losses .
This is a complicated but important case I want to break down for you below .
Securitization at fault
The crux of the case has to do with mortgage - backed securities and the process of securitization .
In a bygone era , almost all mortgages were held as loans on the books of the originating banks .
In this case , if a mortgage went past due , it was a matter to be worked out between an individual homeowner and an individual mortgage holder .
However , when the mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) market took off , mortgages were sliced and diced into tranches and packaged into securities and sold on to investors .
These same securities were then sliced and diced and packaged with other securities into collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) .
CDOs were often then sliced and diced further still into CDOs - squared – that is CDOs of CDOs .
Often times , the underlying mortgages in these instruments were high - risk , sub - prime mortgages .
But the ratings agencies could still give them AAA ratings , which made them eligible for investment by risk - averse investors like teachers ’ pension funds or municipalities .
So , these securities were then sold on to investors around the world into remote places like small towns in Norway and banks in Germany .
However , when the housing market fell , the value of these securities plummeted ; and they fell much more than the house prices as the securities are derivatives and leveraged against the value of the underlying asset .
The result was a financial crisis of epic proportions .
Making matters more complicated for the homeowner , the originating lender is often not the servicing agent of a mortgage .
Payment from the homeowner and to investors who are the ultimate owners of the security is handled by a mortgage servicer who collects a fee for its work .
What this has meant is that there is considerable distance between a homeowner and a mortgage holder , such that in the event of foreclosure , it is not a matter of picking up the telephone and calling Mr. Smith at the local Bank .
Often times , there is a byzantine web of originating bank , mortgage holder ( if loan is sold ) , mortgage servicer , MBS pooling / securitizing agent , and investors .
Needless to say , the average person does n’t have a clue as to who to call in order to get relief to avoid foreclosure .
The obvious port of call is the mortgage servicer , who is the one party with whom a homeowner has ongoing contact .
Mortgage Servicer
Below is a research report written by the National Consumer Law Center just this past month on why consumers in jeopardy of suffering foreclosure cannot get loans modified .
It starts :
The country is in the midst of a foreclosure crisis of unprecedented proportions .
Millions of families have lost their homes and millions more are expected to lose their homes in the next few years .
With home values plummeting and layoffs common , homeowners are crumbling under the weight of mortgages that were often only marginally affordable when made .
One commonsense solution to the foreclosure crisis is to modify the loan terms .
Lenders routinely lament their losses in foreclosure .
Foreclosures cost everyone — the homeowner , the lender , the community — money .
Yet foreclosures continue to outstrip loan modifications .
Why ?
Once a mortgage loan is made , in most cases the original lender does not have further ongoing contact with the homeowner .
Instead , the original lender , or the investment trust to which the loan is sold , hires a servicer to collect monthly payments .
It is the servicer that either answers the borrower ’s plea for a modification or launches a foreclosure .
Servicers spend millions of dollars advertising their concern for the plight of homeowners and their willingness to make deals .
Yet the experience of many homeowners and their advocates is that servicers — not the mortgage owners — are often the barrier to making a loan modification .
See the problem ?
This is exactly why loan modifications are not happening in large enough numbers .
This goes to incentives – mortgage servicers are not incentivized to make modifications .
In fact the incentives go the other way – foreclosure .
Servicers have four main sources of income , listed in descending order of importance :
The monthly servicing fee , a fixed percentage of the unpaid principal balance of the loans in the pool ;
Fees charged borrowers in default , including late fees and “ process management fees ” ;
Float income , or interest income from the time between when the servicer collects the payment from the borrower and when it turns the payment over to the mortgage owner ; and
Income from investment interests in the pool of mortgage loans that the servicer is servicing .
Overall , these sources of income give servicers little incentive to offer sustainable loan modifications , and some incentive to push loans into foreclosure .
The monthly fee that the servicer receives based on a percentage of the outstanding principal of the loans in the pool provides some incentive to servicers to keep loans in the pool rather than foreclosing on them , but also provides a significant disincentive to offer principal reductions or other loan modifications that are sustainable on the long term .
In fact , this fee gives servicers an incentive to increase the loan principal by adding delinquent amounts and junk fees .
Then the servicer receives a higher monthly fee for a while , until the loan finally fails .
Fees that servicers charge borrowers in default reward servicers for getting and keeping a borrower in default .
As they grow , these fees make a modification less and less feasible .
The servicer may have to waive them to make a loan modification feasible but is almost always assured of collecting them if a foreclosure goes through .
The other two sources of servicer income are less significant .
If servicers ’ income gives no incentive to modify and some incentive to foreclose , through increased fees , what about servicers ’ expenditures ?
Servicers ’ largest expenses are the costs of financing the advances they are required to make to investors of the principal and interest payments on nonperforming loans .
Once a loan is modified or the home foreclosed on and sold , the requirement to make advances stops .
Servicers will only want to modify if doing so stops the clock on advances sooner than a foreclosure would .
Worse , under the rules promulgated by the credit rating agencies and bond insurers , servicers are delayed in recovering the advances when they do a modification , but not when they foreclose .
Servicers lose no money from foreclosures because they recover all of their expenses when a loan is foreclosed , before any of the investors get paid .
The rules for recovery of expenses in a modification are much less clear and somewhat less generous .
In addition , performing large numbers of loan modifications would cost servicers upfront money in fixed overhead costs , including staffing and physical infrastructure , plus out - of - pocket expenses such as property valuation and credit reports as well as financing costs .
On the other hand , servicers lose no money from foreclosures .
This is a very important document for anyone looking to do a loan modification .
I strongly suggest you read it , download it and act upon it .
By the way , the largest servicers are :
Bank of America : $ 2.1 trillion , up from $ 530 billion a year earlier ( via its acquisition of Countrywide – this is WHY bank of America bought Countrywide )
Wells Fargo : $ 1.8 trillion , up from $ 1.5 trillion a year earlier
JPMorgan Chase : $ 1.5 trillion , up from $ 795 billion a year ago ( thanks in large part to its acquisition of Washington Mutual )
CitiMortgage ( a division of Citigroup ) : $ 792 billion , down from $ 799 billion a year earlier .
Citi is hurting i everywhere )
ResCap : $ 391 billion , down from $ 449 billion in the first quarter of 2008 .
As you can see , consolidation has meant the big are getting bigger .
Despite a recession , servicing fees are increasing , not decreasing .
You should DEFINITELY read my post “ How refinancing helps the likes of Bank of America and Wells Fargo ” because this demonstrates why these banks are going to rack up monster fees in mortgage servicing .
Landmark National Bank v. Boyd A. Kessler , Kan 2009 , No. 98,489
That brings us to the Kansas case .
According to the Kansas City Business Journal , the case can be summarized as follows :
A Ford County man went into bankruptcy in 2006 .
He had taken out two mortgages on the same property , one to Landmark National Bank and one to Millennia Mortgage Corp .
Landmark foreclosed on its mortgage .
Millennia had sold its mortgage , which eventually landed at Sovereign Bank , though that transaction never was recorded in Ford County .
Neither MERS nor Sovereign received notice when Landmark filed its foreclosure .
That ’s because the notice went to Millennia , still registered in Ford County , which is like telling someone that a stranger ’s car is about to be towed .
Landmark won a default judgment , essentially wiping out Sovereign ’s mortgage .
MERS and Sovereign sued to set aside the judgment , arguing that MERS should have received notice .
They lost at trial and on appeal .
Supreme Court justices had a difficult time accepting what MERS was and why it would be entitled to receive notice of a foreclosure when it was not a lender and had no stake in the property behind the mortgage .
In addition , the court found , the original mortgage required notice only to the lender , not MERS .
This case was decided on 28 August 2009 in favor of the homeowner Boyd Kessler ( Document and link below ) .
The issue was predatory lending .
But there was more wrong here .
MERS does facilitate liquidity in the MBS market , but it does a lot of other things that could harm consumers
MERS also acts as a “ corporate shield , ” protecting lenders from legal action in cases of predatory lending .
. MERS can foreclose even though it is not the financial party with interest
Because MERS is a distant intermediary , foreclosure can proceed without even producing an original mortgage note
With MERS in control , consumers cannot access publicly available information to adequately determine who the holders of their note are .
If MERS is blocked from filing suit in many cases , there will be large losses accumulating at the holders of these notes .
Expect to hear more about this very important case .

What a Classless Ass He is at the VMAs

It 's been nearly three years since our last post .
The Republican party has n't been showing us much love .
Sure , they 've been threatening to do away with the Violence Against Women Act .
And of course , they 've been hard at work requiring rapes for abortion seekers .
What have they have been doing for us , the die - hard rape enthusiasts ?
Todd Akin knows what I 'm talking about .
He 's a rape connoisseur , just like us .
Barack Obama has a palate so unrefined that he thinks " rape is rape . "
Todd knows better than that .
See , Todd knows that some rape is legitimate , and some rape is n't .
If you try to have sex with a woman , and she says no , and you do it anyway , now that 's a legitimate rape .
If you try to have sex with a woman , she says no , you continue your attempt , and she says yes before penetration occurs , then the rape is basically ruined .
Not a legitimate rape !
If you and a woman arrange for a little consensual rape play , I gotta tell you , that ain't rape .
That 's poser rape , completely illegitimate .
Todd knows that some rape is forcible , and some is n't .
Forcible rape often has bloody finish , as well as a nose that is frequently broken .
If you 're worried that the strong taste of forcible rape might overpower everything else you have planned , you may want to pair your evening with another rape variety .
Statutory rape is light - bodied , though it can be very hard to find a decent vintage .
Consult a rape sommelier if you 're have trouble making a selection .
I want to thank you , Congressman Akin .
If not for you , I might have stayed home in November .
Now I 'm legitimately excited about the Republican Party again !
P.S. Akin may be one of us , but he 's not keen on biology .
Remember to protect yourself from unwanted rape babies , everyone !
CHICAGO — September 24 , 2009 — 37signals is now a $ 100 billion dollar company , according to a group of investors who have agreed to purchase 0.000000001 % of the company in exchange for $ 1 .
Founder Jason
Fried informed his employees about the new deal at a recent company - wide meeting .
The financing round was led by Yardstick Capital and Institutionalized Venture Partners .
In order to increase the value of the company , 37signals has decided to stop generating revenues .
“ When it comes to valuation , making money is a real obstacle .
Our profitability has been a real drag on our valuation , ” said Mr. Fried .
“ Once you have profits , it ’s impossible to just make stuff up .
That ’s why we ’re switching to a ‘ freeconomics ’ model .
We ’ll give away everything for free and let the market speculate about how much money we could make if we wanted to make money .
That way , the sky ’s the limit ! ”
Proof that 37signals is now a $ 100 billion dollar company .
A $ 100 billion value for 37signals is “ not outlandish , ” says Aanandamayee Bhatnagar , a finance professor and valuation guru at Grenada State ’s Schnook School of Business .
Bhatnagar points to a leaked , confidential corporate strategy plan that projects 37 signals will attract twelve billion users by the end of 2013 .
How will the company overcome the fact that there are only 6.8 billion people alive today ?
“ Why limit users to people ? ” said Bhatnagar .
In order to determine the valuation of companies , Bhatnagar typically applies the following formula : [ ( Twitter followers x Facebook fans ) + ( # of employees x 1000 ) ] x ( RSS subscribers + daily page views ) + ( monthly burn rate x Google ’s stock price ) 2 and then doubles if it they use Ruby on Rails or if the CEO has run a business into the ground before .
Bhatnagar admits the math is mostly a guess but points out that “ the press eats it up . ”
To help handle the burdens of an increased valuation , 37signals hired former YouTube exec Craig Mirage as Chief Operating Officer earlier this month .
Mirage hopes to replicate YouTube ’s valuation success at 37signals .
“ Of course , the investment comes with great expectations .
But you should see the spreadsheet models we ’re making up .
Really breakthrough stuff , ” said Mirage .
“ 37signals will lead the new global movement filled with imaginary assumptions on growth and monetization potential , ” he continued .
“ We ’re excited to roll out a list of unconfirmed revenue possibilities that involve crowdsourcing , a robust set of widget creation tools , 3G , augmented reality , social stuff , and an app store .
Also , everything we make will include a compass . ”
Welcome to Volume 1 of our Hot Water Music video retrospective .
Each installment will feature exclusive liner notes , blurbs and of course a shit ton of original video footage .
This edition highlights the first two European tours in 1998 and 1999 .
Especially the 1998 endeavor was overshadowed by plenty of drama , leading to a temporary mid tour break up .
Luckily Chuck , Jason , George and Chris could be convinced to finish the tour .
Amongst the last performances of 1998 were some of the most memorable and emotionally charged shows I have seen this band play , as the videos below hopefully convey .

In Leatherface ’s anthem ‘ Do the right thing ’ Frankie Stubbs blurts out : “ Do n’t underestimate the underdogs / they can beat the world and come back for more / they can dance and romance / and drink the night into coma . ”
That much for the abridged version .
Operating at levels of intoxication only seen by few , the Floridian band conquered every single punk dive this world has to offer and yes , they usually came back for more .
It was not like ‘ another city left wrecked behind ’ , Instead , their audiences were deeply moved by the sincerity and compassion that was offered .
Hot Water Music glued us all together again , creating friendships , hangovers , and the feeling that it all still made sense .
Honesty that no fucking MTV clown could ever offer .
In a sometimes painfully and self - revealing manner the ( ( ( unartig ) ) ) crew documented – under rigid conditions or until the camera broke – what comes down as the most creative years of the only punk band of their era touring the Black Flag way : 200 + p.a. and no overdubs .

Pistachio industry bets on ' sex sells ' mentality with ads
There 's one sure - fire way to get folks to forget about last spring 's nationwide pistachio recall :
Make 'em think about sex , instead .
Make that kinky sex .
Like , say , an honest - to - goodness dominatrix — who formerly worked her trade in Los Angeles — cracking open a pistachio with her whip .
A voice - over explains : " A dominatrix does it on command . "
Or Levi Johnston , the media - hungry father of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin 's out - of - wedlock grandchild , starring in his first TV spot .
In it , he 's standing next to a bodyguard as a voice - over notes : " Now , Levi does it with protection . "
Er , that 's how he cracks open pistachios , that is — wink , wink .
Never mind that this is the first time the pistachio industry has broadcast ads nationally , or that it 's pumping $ 15 million into the campaign .
At the heart of all this is an often sexually risqué marketing campaign that 's made to go viral online .
In a new world of marketing , social - networking buzz reigns , particularly for struggling companies or industries with small ad budgets .
The $ 800 million domestic pistachio industry still has n't recovered from the recall of 2 million pounds of pistachios after last April 's salmonella contamination scare .
Sales are off upwards of 20 % for the year .
The new campaign aims to fix that .
" We want to get some sizzle out there , " says Dominic Engels , vice president of global marketing for Paramount Farms , the largest grower , processor and marketer of pistachios in the world .
" By providing chatter on the Internet , this starts to multiply your base .
That 's when you get exponential impact . "
Of course , no company can guarantee its campaign will go viral .
That only happens to about one in 100 advertisements , says Al Silverstein , senior vice president of innovation and strategy at Active International , which specializes in digital consulting .
But the powerful elements of offbeat humor , provocative celebrities and sexual imagery can help , he says .
" The most important thing is to resonate with the consumer , " Silverstein says .
" If it looks too contrived , it wo n't be effective . "
But Engels insists nothing is contrived in this campaign .
And there 's even a separate YouTube video contest for consumers to create their own pistachio commercials — one of which will earn $ 25,000 and a national airing .
Because national ads have never been broadcast for pistachios , " We have a blank canvas , " he says .
" People do n't think of buying pistachios .
We have to earn a right to be on the shopping list . "

Here in Los Angeles , local news channels have been locked on a chase and subsequent standoff between police and a mentally ill man accused of making threats on the White House .
The LAPD have him cornered at the Federal Building .
I was just in the area ( for other reasons ) — traffic 's a mess , streets are blocked off , law enforcement all over the place .
The LAPD bomb squad is using a remote - controlled robot to coax the suspect out of his Volkswagen beetle .
This device is operated by a human , and is not autonomous — sort of a humanoid drone , a machine proxy for a human negotiator .
You can see it in the photo above , from the Daily Breeze .
I wonder if anyone knows more about the particular robot / ROV / whatever they 're using ?
At least four police cruisers blocked the red Volkswagen Beetle in the driveway of a parking lot on Veteran Avenue just south of Wilshire Boulevard .
Officers stood nearby with their guns pointed at the vehicle , and a police robot wheeled its way next to the driver 's side door as the standoff continued .
A military - style armored vehicle was also brought to the scene and was parked near the vehicle .
Update : Anonymous says ,
That particular piece of equipment is a Remotec ( a subsidiary of Northrop - Grumman ) model F - 6A by the looks of it .
It has 3 cameras , a microphone and a speaker .
It can be operated remotely by a fiber optic tether or by radio waves .
It is used by Law enforcement and the Military typically in bomb disposal operations .
The use in hostage situations is not unprecedented however .
Above , a photo of the Northrop - Grumman / Remotec ANDROS F6A with Window Breaker and Dual PAN Disrupter mount .
On the product page , the manufacturer refers to it as a " robot , " so all of you arguing in the comments that this is an improper term can simmer down now , please .
More photos of an ANDROS equipped with a gun and window - basher , and live video stream of today 's human / robot standoff , after the jump .
here 's the Daily Breeze , here 's KTLA , LA Times .

Eight years after invasion
Washington faces deepening debacle in Afghanistan
7 October 2009
Today marks eight years since the launching of the US war against Afghanistan .
The aerial bombardment of Kabul , Kandahar and Jalalabad was followed by the deployment of CIA and military special forces units which directed US warplanes in the annihilation of Taliban fighters .
The militias of the Northern Alliance — a collection of warlords tied to the opium trade and implicated in war crimes over the previous decade — served as Washington ’s proxy army .
Within two months , all of Afghanistan ’s provinces had fallen to the US intervention , with large numbers of the Taliban resistance taken prisoner and massacred and others driven into the Tora Bora mountains or across the border into Pakistan .
In those two months , a total of 12 US soldiers were killed .
Now , eight years later , the Obama White House and the Pentagon are engaged in a heated debate over whether to send another 40,000 troops — on top of the 68,000 US and 38,000 NATO troops already deployed — in an attempt to salvage an intervention that has succeeded only in intensifying the resistance to the US - led occupation and spreading it throughout the country .
The number of US and NATO troops killed in Afghanistan so far this year has risen to 400 — nearly six times as many as died in the first year of the US intervention .
The war has gone on twice as long as US forces were engaged in World War II .
The Bush administration launched the war in the name of smashing Al Qaeda and capturing or killing Osama bin Laden .
It was justified as retribution for the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , tragic events whose real origins have not been seriously investigated to this day .
The Obama administration employs this same essential pretext , describing Afghanistan as a “ war of necessity ” — in contrast to the “ war of choice ” in still - occupied Iraq .
Like his predecessor , Obama insists that the war is aimed at preventing another terrorist attack , maintaining this pretense even as his national security adviser , retired General James Jones , admitted this week that there are no more than 100 members of Al Qaeda in all of Afghanistan , with no means of attacking the US .
The World Socialist Web Site rejected this rationale as a lie from the outset .
In an editorial board statement posted on October 9 , 2001 , two days after the war was launched , the WSWS explained :
“ … while the events of September 11 have served as the catalyst for the assault on Afghanistan , the cause is far deeper .
The nature of this or any war , its progressive or reactionary character , is determined not by the immediate events that preceded it , but rather by the class structures , economic foundations and international roles of the states that are involved .
From this decisive standpoint , the present action by the United States is an imperialist war .
“ The US government initiated the war in pursuit of far - reaching international interests of the American ruling elite .
What is the main purpose of the war ?
The collapse of the Soviet Union a decade ago created a political vacuum in Central Asia , which is home to the second largest deposit of proven reserves of petroleum and natural gas in the world . ”
The statement continued , “ By attacking Afghanistan , setting up a client regime and moving vast military forces into the region , the US aims to establish a new political framework within which it will exert hegemonic control . ”
There is no need to revise a single word in this analysis .
Since October 2001 , ample evidence has emerged that the decision to invade Afghanistan — like the one to conquer Iraq — was made well before the 9/11 attacks .
These served as the pretext , not the cause , of two wars of military aggression .
The debacle confronting US imperialism in Afghanistan is one of its own making .
Al Qaeda and the Taliban are both the products of previous US interventions in Afghanistan .
Beginning in 1979 , Washington funneled billions of dollars in arms and aid to Islamist guerrillas seeking to topple the country ’s Soviet - backed government .
It deliberately instigated a Soviet invasion and war that claimed over a million lives , turned another five million into refugees and wrecked the entire society .
At that point , bin Laden was part of the CIA - Saudi-Pakistani pipeline .
Much of the US aid went to the forces of mujahedeen leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , who is now blamed for last weekend ’s attack that killed eight US soldiers in the remote province of Nuristan .
The US - led occupation begun eight years ago has proven another unmitigated catastrophe for the Afghan people .
Thousands have been killed in aerial bombardments and repressive raids across the country , with the civilian casualty rate steadily rising .
Already desperate conditions of life have only worsened .
The United Nations recently ranked Afghanistan at 181 out of 182 countries in the world in terms of human development indices .
Only Niger ranked lower .
Life expectancy has fallen to 43 since the US invasion .
At least 40 percent of the population is unemployed and 42 percent live on less than $ 1 a day .
One in five children die before his or her fifth birthday , while one in 50 births ends in the death of the mother , one of the highest rates in the world .
Two - thirds of the country ’s adult population can neither read nor write .
Conditions have steadily worsened even as some $ 36 billion in foreign aid has been delivered to the country since October 2001 , the bulk of it flowing into the pockets of the kleptocracy headed by the US - installed puppet president , Hamid Karzai .
Hated by the majority of the population and having blatantly stolen the August 20 presidential election , Karzai remains in power solely thanks to the support of Washington , which has concluded that it has nothing with which to replace him .
These conditions of violence , destitution and corruption have created broad popular support for those resisting the occupation .
The ongoing debate in Washington is how best to suppress this resistance .
Two main options are reportedly under discussion : the deployment of another 40,000 troops in a redoubled counterinsurgency campaign , as demanded by Gen. Stanley McChrystal and the Pentagon , or an intensified use of drone attacks , aerial bombardment and special forces incursions into Pakistan , as proposed by Vice President Joseph Biden and others in the administration .
Both spell increased bloodshed and a far wider war .
While there are no doubt bitter divisions over how the war should be conducted , all sides begin from achieving the aims upon which the war was launched : establishing a stranglehold over the energy resources of Central Asia in order to seize a decisive advantage for US imperialism over its economic rivals in Asia and Europe .
The onset of the global financial crisis has only intensified the underlying contradictions that are the driving force of American militarism , above all the conflict between a globally integrated economy and a world system divided by rival capitalist nation states .
This finds its most explosive expression in the decline in the economic dominance of US imperialism .
The majority of the American people oppose both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars , and millions voted for Obama on the basis of this opposition .
Yet both wars continue , and Obama is preparing to escalate the carnage in Afghanistan and Pakistan , while threatening military aggression in Iran .
No less than Bush and the Republicans , the Obama administration represents — in both its foreign and domestic policy — the interests of the corporate and financial oligarchy that rules America .
Wars abroad go hand in hand with mounting social inequality and an assault on the living standards and social and democratic rights of working people in the US itself .
The discussion now going on in the White House — and behind the backs of the American people — about how best to advance US imperialism ’s interests in Central Asia poses immense dangers .
An escalation of the war , either with more ground troops or intensified air attacks , threatens to destabilize nuclear - armed Pakistan and all of South and Central Asia .
China , a rising power , and Russia , with longstanding interests in the region , will not remain on the sidelines indefinitely while Washington attempts to exert its dominance by armed force .
The war begun eight years ago and the threat of its escalation into a far bloodier conflagration can be ended only by the intervention of the working class in the US and internationally , fighting against the capitalist profit system which is the source of militarism .
In this struggle , the demands must be raised for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops from Iraq and Afghanistan , a halt to the US attacks on Pakistan , and the dismantling of the US military and intelligence apparatus so as to provide billions of dollars for reparations to the victims of US aggression and to secure jobs and improve living standards for working people in the US and internationally .

Our ultimate betrayal would come from Atiqullah himself , whose nom de guerre means “ gift from God . ”
What follows is the story of our captivity .
I took no notes while I was a prisoner .
All descriptions stem from my memory and , where possible , records kept by my family and colleagues .
Direct quotations from our captors are based on Tahir ’s translations .
Undoubtedly , my recollections are incomplete and the passage of time may have affected them .
For safety reasons , certain details and names have been withheld .
Our time as prisoners was bewildering .
Two phone calls and one letter from my wife sustained me .
I kept telling myself  and Tahir and Asad  to be patient and wait .
By June , our seventh month in captivity , it had become clear to us that our captors were not seriously negotiating our release .
Their arrogance and hypocrisy had become unending , their dishonesty constant .
We saw an escape attempt as a last - ditch , foolhardy act that had little chance of success .
Yet we still wanted to try .
To our eternal surprise , it worked .
ON Oct. 26 , 2008 , I arrived in Afghanistan on a three - week reporting trip for a book I was writing about the squandered opportunities to bring stability to the region .
I had been covering Afghanistan and Pakistan since 2001 and was inspired by the bravery and pride of the people in those two countries and , it seemed , their popular desire for moderate , modern societies .
The first part of my visit proved depressing .
I spent two weeks in Helmand Province , in southern Afghanistan , and was struck by the rising public support for the Taliban .
Seven years of halting economic development , a foreign troop presence and military mistakes that killed civilians had bred a deep resentment of American and NATO forces .
For the book to be as rigorous and fair as possible , I decided that I needed to get the Taliban ’s side of the story .
I knew that would mean taking a calculated risk , a decision journalists sometimes make to report accurately in the field .
I was familiar with the potential consequences .
In 1995 , I was imprisoned for 10 days while covering the war in Bosnia .
Serbian authorities arrested me after I discovered mass graves of more than 7,000 Muslim men who had been executed in Srebrenica .
My detention was excruciating for my family .
Promising I would never put them through such an ordeal again , I was cautious through 13 subsequent years of reporting .
The White House wants to make something perfectly clear :
The public option is still on the health care negotiating table .
" The goal is choice and competition " among health insurance plans , spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters this morning .
" The preference is the public option . "
Gibbs denounced reports that the administration may drop its support for a publicly funded insurance option because of intense opposition .
He attributed the reports to a media " overreaction " after the comment by Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that a public option is not " essential " to a health care plan .
Obama himself stoked commentary with his statement Saturday that " the public option , whether we have it or we do n't have it , is not the entirety of health care reform . "
Whether the White House was sending signals or not , liberal Democrats made their own position very clear :
The public option is essential to any health care plan designed to cover all Americans .
Yet Sen. Kent Conrad , D - N.D. , says there are n't the votes for it in the Senate .
Republicans and some conservative Democrats describe the public option as a gateway to a government - run , single - payer plan .
Bottom line :
It 's tough to negotiate a complex piece of legislation in public .
The administration obviously does n't want to deal through the media or drop a key provision before Congress returns from August recess .
To be continued .

Having the right level of cover is essential when you ’re tasked with the responsibility of taking care of a fleet of vehicles .
You ’ll want peace of mind that these expensive assets are protected should the unexpected happen .
If you want a comprehensive policy which gives you sufficient cover , you wo n’t want to pay the highest premium .
Business managers and owners should know that prices have risen over the past number of years , but you can still get a good deal .
To find the best deal , you should use an online comparison site such as Utility Saving Expert to obtain a fleet insurance quote .
Simply enter a few details about your business and requirements , and you ’ll be presented with a number of options to choose from .
You can filter quotes from leading insurers based on price and features .
It should n’t take you longer than 10 to 15 minutes to compare prices to find the best value for your fleet of vehicles .
Although this may be the best way to save money , there are a number of other tips you can use to reduce your premium .
Install fleet vehicle trackers
Installing a vehicle tracker can help you find the location of a vehicle that has been stolen , it can also help you understand how well your employees are driving , encouraging road safety .
Instead of a standard fleet insurance policy , consider a telematics policy , sometimes referred to as ‘ black box cover ’ .
If your employees are able to demonstrate that they are safe drivers , your total premium will be reduced .
Tracking devices can also help you significantly increase the chances of recovering a vehicle that has been stolen .
Install an alarm and immobiliser
In addition to tracking the vehicle , having an appropriate alarm or immobiliser can also cut the costs of your fleet insurance quote .
The contents that each vehicle carries will be determined by the type of business you are in , although it is likely that you will be carrying some expensive goods .
These need to be protected at all times , and an alarm can help you deter thieves .
These security measures will be useful regardless of having your vehicles parked in a locked overnight location or on a driveway .
Thieves will be deterred from driving away with your expensive asset and the contents contained inside .
Assessing the level of risk
If you have a large fleet of vehicles , insurers will want to offer you a competitive deal .
To calculate your premium , they will carry out a risk assessment to provide a suitable solution .
Have an in - depth conversation with your provider and talk about your previous claims history , areas in which you can improve upon , and what a driver should do if they are involved in an unfortunate accident or incident .
Combine multiple policies
If you ’re taking out multiple types of cover , find out if your insurance company is able to combine these policies into one and offer you a discount for doing so .
You may be able to combine your fleet insurance with other business cover such as public liability and employers ’ liability .
Not only will you save money , it ’s far easier dealing with one provider when pursuing a claim or if you need assistance with anything .
Do n’t purchase unnecessary extras
When searching for the right fleet policy , many insurers will offer you a whole range of optional extras as an addition .
While some of these can be useful , often times , you may not actually make use of them .
You may even have some of these add - ons covered elsewhere .
Common examples include breakdown cover , windscreen cover and legal expenses .
Purchasing things like breakdown cover separately may actually cost you less , so remember to compare the two quotes before proceeding .
Some vehicles cost less to insure
If you ’re planning on purchasing a brand new fleet , or are leasing some vehicles , this can be very costly and will increase your business expenditure significantly .
However , you could save money by choosing the right type of vehicle .
First and foremost , you will need vehicles that help you complete the job .
Newer vehicles will have modern security features , making them less prone to theft .
The latest safety features could also protect you against personal injury claims .
Aside from safety and security , you will also benefit from better fuel efficiency , saving you money on fuel and reducing your CO2 emissions at the same time .
Depending on the type of warranty you have , breakdowns and repairs may also be included as standard .
There may not be much room for manoeuvre as the type of vehicle you will require will be determined by the nature of your business .
Where possible , reduce the risk to save money on your insurance price .
In conclusion , fleet insurance does n’t have to be costly if you take advantage of the practical tips listed above .
Ultimately , you ’ll need a policy that provides suitable cover to protect your valuable assets .
Remember to read the terms and conditions of a policy before buying and make yourself aware of any exclusions or limitations .
I 've been meaning to send you an email after reflecting upon the outcome of my bankruptcy case but it's bee difficult to find the right words .
Please accept my heartfelt thanks for assisting me with this effort .
I realize that you were just doing your job , however , to me , it was so much more .
I appreciated how well you strategically shielded me from creditor harassment while keeping me informed of the progress on the case .
I appreciate your diligent review of my finances and the facts and presenting those to the trustee .
I appreciate your professionalism and empathy .
It 's not often that you find an attorney of character and you are clearly one of a few .
Should you ever need a recommendation or reference please allow me to provide that for you .

OPINION : The original pint was a very different drink from the modern version .
Today ’s Guinness only dates from 1959 , writes CORMAC Ó GRÁDA
YESTERDAY MARKED
“ Arthur ’s Day ” , the putative 250th anniversary of the founding of the St James ’s Gate brewery , and who can blame Diageo , the current owners of Guinness , for milking the occasion for all it ’s worth .
The owners of the Guinness brand have long been masters at appropriating tradition and “ Irishness ” .
Their marketing campaigns have been usually brilliant , sometimes awesome , and occasionally outrageous .
Most over - the - top , surely , is the current Proposition 3 - 17 campaign waged by Guinness / Diageo in the United States to make St Patrick ’s Day an official holiday there .
Inevitably , the true history is more complex than what the ad men tell us .
When that “ truly remarkable man ” of the current commercials began brewing it – not in 1759 , but a few decades later – he was brewing a drink that was then relatively new to Ireland .
The black stuff was invented , not on the banks of the Liffey , but in London , and Arthur Guinness started off as a brewer , not of extra stout , but of ale of unremarkable quality .
Indeed , it was competition from the London brew that forced Arthur into shifting to his own version of the new product .
A further irony , since “ Arthur ’s Day ” merges marketing and history , is that for a long time after Arthur ’s death , Guinness was far from being our “ national ” drink .
Only after the Great Famine did it begin to make inroads into rural Ireland .
Its conquest of the remoter west and southwest came quite late , a century or more after the foundation of the brewery .
A survey prompted by Guinness ’s bicentennial , carried out by the then Irish Folklore Commission in 1956 ( and now housed in the National Folklore Collection in UCD ) , highlighted the novelty of the pint of plain in many places as recently as the late 19th century .
According to a Longford informant , “ all the old men I ’ve talked to agree on this , that porter and stout are comparatively new drinks . . .
In their young days there was no such thing as porter , and .
. . their fathers before them drank nothing but whiskey ” .
From Fair Head in north Antrim came a report that McCaffreys , a Belfast brewery , had been the first to produce a black beer in the North , and that Guinness did not appear on the scene until early in the 1900s .
Thomas Duggan of Claregalway , aged 79 , said that “ there was not much porter to be got a hundred years ago ” .
But he said that when the porter arrived on the scene , the traditional ales were given up .
Guinness was stronger than ale , and it “ would go farther than whiskey , and it was cheaper ” .
And one of the Folklore Commission ’s greatest collectors , Michael Corduff ( 75 ) of Rossport in Co Mayo , reported : “ It is only within the last half - century that porter made its appearance in this area .
I remember being at a wedding feast about 50 years ago at which there was a jar of porter , by way of a novelty from the potheen , which was in abundant supply .
Guests merely tasted the porter for the first time , but would not drink it .
They said it was like a soot and water mixture , nauseous in the last degree and revolting as a drink , but the mountain dew was the elixir of life or ‘ uisce beatha ’ with all and sundry . ”
The relative novelty of Guinness in the remote west was confirmed by Kerryman Seán Ó Dubhda : “ People hereabouts had little , if any , practice at drinking porter or stout 70 or even 60 years ago .
The old people had no meas on it .
I saw some of them who could not taste it at all , if they did n’t spit it out again . ”
“ Arthur ’s Day ” , then , offers another reminder of the gap between history and tradition .
It may feel as though the pint of porter or stout is as distinctively Irish as hurling and as ancient as Cúchulainn , but in the “ real Ireland ” of the west and southwest it is a relatively recent import .
At the same time , another message of those informants from the 1950s bears noting .
All agreed that the new drink wiped the floor with the competition in its quality and consistency .
But there is a final twist to the tale .
The brew described and praised in those accounts was a very different drink from what some of us will be enjoying this week .
Today ’s Guinness dates only from 1959 – another anniversary year .
So how might the smooth , ice - cold Guinness so familiar across the globe today compare to Myles na Gopaleen ’s frothy and comfortingly tepid “ pint of plain ” , not to mention James Joyce ’s “ foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats ” ?

We have become a suburban society .
The comic - book values of the ' burbs are engraved on the tablets of the law .
Fear , timidity , nosiness , suspicion .
The idea that safety is the highest good , and that the main purpose of living is to exclude the possibility of anything unexpected .
A loathing of the country : mud , yokels , snobs , hunting , vile horses , horrid dogs with blood on their chops , shooting , rain , inadequate signage and street lighting , inexplicable shrieks in the night , drunken big - bellied peasants with Type 2 diabetes driving home , lurching from one muddied bank to the other , pigs ( flu ) , chickens ( flu ) , eggs ( salmonella ) , cheese ( listeria ) , turkeys ( Bernard Matthews ) , woodsheds containing something nasty .
The country is tolerable when corralled as a theme park for the kiddies ( water features , rides , an " Experience " , brochures ) but otherwise : no .
A loathing of the city , too .
Swaggering young men , individuals of interest to the police , those whose citizenship cannot be proven , groups likely to conspire , parking , congestion , people drinking on the pavement , people drinking in shebeens , dirty bookshops , insider trading , unhygienic street markets , litter , smoking , unregulated vehicles plying for hire , loud music , fighting , people taking photographs of policemen , inflammatory mosques , talking to the driver while the vehicle is in motion , standing too close to the platform edge , evasion of fines , failure to show ID .

Very suspicious as I think you will agree . )
We know who you are .
We know where you 've been .
The innocent have nothing to fear and we decide what 's innocent .
When in doubt , do n't .
Simple .
And always be doubtful .
Is n't that suburban ethic ?
You never know .
Better safe than sorry .
Keep your head down .
Keep your hands to yourself .
Keep yourself to yourself .
We do n't go in for that sort of thing here .
Just like the Galilean , the suburbs have triumphed and the world has grown grey with their breath .
Both the Tories and Labour , each in theory utterly opposed to it , have all the same embraced the suburban ethos and placed it at the heart of Brit2000 .
Maybe it's not surprising given that the core of that ethos is the commandment " Thou shalt do what thou art told " , a maxim more precious than rubies to the withered souls of politicians , but , all the same : we have become what we most despise .
We still despise the suburbs .
But perhaps that 's because the suburbs are the only thing left that we can despise .
Every other target of the fine rich English heritage of indiscriminate contempt has been fenced off under penalty of law .
But still we can hurl abuse at the suburbs , at their architecture , their inhabitants , their habits , beliefs , speech , pretensions , delusions , possessions , jobs , hobbies and manners .
While adopting their principles wholesale and effectively unopposed , we are still allowed to curse at the idea , perhaps as a consolation for having to conform to the reality .
Yet we remain fascinated .
Even for those who 've never lived there , or who have managed to escape , the contemplation of the suburbs arouses in the English soul a deep and inexplicable yearning for nostos , the Homeric notion of a perfect return to Laburnum Drive where God – or Barratt Homes ,
His representative on earth – will wipe away all tears , the cat will be purring , the dog safe , the kiddies clean and happy and all shall be well , and all manner of thing shall be well .
The test of a foreigner , however fluent , was to ask them to say " squirrel " .
They could n't .
Germans say " Skvivel " .
Americans say " Skwerl " .
Japanese say " Skrirriro ... skri ... sklirr ... skli ... " and then get tongue - cramp and stare at their shoes .
It would be as good a test to wire them up to an MRI scanner and show them a picture of a Metropolitan line rounding the long curve between Watford and Moor Park , whether in high summer ( the leaves brushing the carriage roof , birch and cow - parsley lining the banks ) or winter ( snow on the sleepers , low sun glinting on the lines , the pylons blurred with mist ) .
In any other brain , the regions handling low - level perplexity and uncomprehending boredom would light up , everything else remaining dormant .
In the English brain , though , everything would turn a soothing shade of comfy .
The summer scene would summon scents of privet and hollyhock , the drift of pampas grass and the lawnmower smells of two - stroke motors and freshly - cut grass , diamond glitter of car - wash hoses , the summer garage perfume of 3 - In - One , petrol and warm mildew .
In winter the mental scene would move indoors : the Ercol chair is warm and yielding , the remote control is to hand , the air calm with the incense of Pledge , supper is in the microwave and the boiler has just – whirrrrrr - whomp – kicked in ; soon , Dad will run the kids down to The Parade to get the bus in ; it 's a full moon and the air smells of frost , as it always does at full moon whether there 's frost or not : it is , for the kids , the smell of promise ; for Dad , the pleasing counterpoint to the warmth of home .
And all summed up in that daily moment when the Metropolitan line train trundles out of the tunnel on to the overground tracks .
A daily resurrection after the small Calvary of the morning trip in the other direction .
There , maybe , is the defining feature of the suburban dream , and you can see it summed up in a pair of images on display at a new exhibition , Suburbia , at the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden .
The posters were commission by London Transport from Paul Nash in 1936 : " Come Out to Live " , exhorts one ; " Come In to Play " invites the other .

In the first , a greyscale image of the City – its aerial perspective suggesting not only smog but the sheer unmanageability of London – explodes out into a Modernist pastoral fantasy of suburban life : the En - tout - cas patent all - weather tennis court , the wide , tree - lined streets , a sunset with fair - weather cumulus clouds ( the LT roundel where the sun might be , in a more astronomically accurate picture ) and , oddly , a development of white geometric Modernist houses – odd , because the classic suburban style of the between - the - wars suburban development was a faintly joyless , neverland mock - Tudor style , denoted by phony half - timbered eaves , and , in the upper price ranges , diamond - leaded windows .
Why this became the dominant style of suburban domestic architecture is a mystery .
Was it because it was in direct opposition to the Modernist style , which people simply did n't like ?
Was it a sort of false nostalgia , like the Portuguese saudade , a yearning to recapture something you never had in the first place ?
Or was it perhaps to distinguish London 's suburbs from the City , Tudor being the one architectural style which London hardly had , since it had all burnt down in the Great Fire of 1666 ?
Whatever the reason , says David Bownes , senior curator at the London Transport Museum , Modernist architecture was fine for stations – think of Arnos Grove or Bounds Green – but not for home .
" The Tudor homes – though they were sold with ad copy like ' Buy a piece of Old England ' – were ' modern ' .
They just were n't Modernist . "
Nash 's other poster – " Come in to Play " – reverses the iconography .
Rain gouts down ; the nets have been removed and standing water obscures the court ; the bare trees bend in a fierce wind ; clouds scud across a gibbous waning moon ; the concrete houses are grey and desolate .
But , in Town , Eros stands backlit by street - lamps and a bright jeweller 's window ( " Diamonds & Rings " ) while an expensive car pulls up at the kerb and the corner of a neon sign advertises " Guinness for Strength " – a reminder , perhaps , that the new suburban developments may have had their little parades of shops ( butcher , newsagent , greengrocer , radio and bicycle shop , sub - post office ) but very seldom a pub .
Nash 's posters were commissioned , like so much other great design on London 's transport , by Frank Pick , who displayed a simultaneously Fabian and commercially persuasive concern for good and consistent taste .
Pick commissioned the magnificent " Underground " typeface from Edward Johnston in 1916 , still in use today ; he 's commemorated by a blue plaque outside his Golders Green house as " Pioneer of good design for London Transport " , but really he might be considered the creator of the first great piece of large - scale branding .
Indeed , you might call him the man who branded London – along with the suburbs , whose salient features are encapsulated in the artwork he commissioned .
The advertisements extolled the freedom from renting , an escape ( ironically , we might feel ) from faceless grey boxes ; when to travel to avoid the rush .
Many ads are aimed at women ( whose travel , then , unlike men's , was discretionary ) : here 's a man and woman choosing wallpaper , here they are going to the cinema , here are the winter sales , here she is going " In to Town " for shopping .
Nothing is done in suburbia .
That 's where home is .
Everything else needs a trip .
Suburbia itself was , and remains , a sort of a nowhere , betwixt and between : neither the countryside , with its isolation , its inaccessibility , its odd and , to the outsider , inexplicable social demarcations and customs and its strange hooting noises in the middle of the night , nor the city : impersonal , vast , dirty , expensive , unnavigable .
The rise of suburbia , particularly between the wars , repositioned the very idea of a city , and particularly of London .
In his Dictionary of the English Language ( 1755 ) Samuel Johnson defines a city as " a large collection of houses and inhabitants " and told Boswell ( who was wondering if London was better to visit than to live in ) that " when a man is tired of London , he is tired of life ; for there is in London all that life can afford " .
A little under 200 years later , men were tired of London , and life unaffordable .
A city – the city – was no longer a large collection of houses and inhabitants but a relentless machine , Moloch , Willam Blake 's " Great Wen " .
The city was filthy , impersonal , choked with smog and humanity ; even in Dickens 's time , a man might walk for two hours to get to his work and two hours back again to a small , rented flat in a poor building under the thumb of an unregulated landlord .
London had become a city for the working - class down and the upper - middle class up ; the " middling sort " were stranded .
And , of course , it was no place for children .
What happened , most startlingly in the 1920s and 1930s with the new railway suburbs , was a wholescale and unprecedented uncoupling of work from home .
Previously – whether urban or rural – work and home leaked together , if only for geographical reasons ; now , they were clearly demarcated , signalled at each end of the working day by a physical journey : a rite of passage in the liminal space of the train .
You boarded in one role , alighted in the other .
At one end , the umbrella ; at the other , the spade .
Horticulture was crucial to the suburban ethos , beginning with the station gardens themselves , a source of pride and bitter competition .
In the suburbs , you had that atavistic Grail of humanity 's immemorial inner peasant : the bit of land to call your own .
To the intelligentsia , the suburbanites might be victims , slaves to the city ; but to themselves , it was the other way round : the city was a resource , something to be exploited to finance the landlord - free , traffic - and pollution - free dream : that an Englishman 's home was his mock - Tudor semi at the end of the District line .
The great suburban migration was a different class of animal to the slow expansion which had led Pooter to his clerk 's villa in Holloway – the sort of house which , now , a junior city lawyer might be glad of a two - bedroom flat in .
This was not so much an expansion as a centrifugal force , and it was only made possible by the railways .
Not that they were guided by ulterior motives .
In particular , the Metropolitan Railway , until its incorporation into London Transport in 1933 , acted both as carrier and developer .
A poster of 1926 showed its branch lines stretching out way beyond London proper , to Amersham , Stoke Mandeville , Great Missenden , Hillingdon and Uxbridge : it built the lines and the houses and would even arrange mortgages .
( There has been a suggestion that perhaps the world 's most famous and iconic map – the 1933 Harry Beck schematic diagram and its descendants – was chosen to disguise the true distance of outlying stations . )
We may rail against the Underground now but it was a thoroughly virtuous circle , particularly in the development of the suburbs .
It could have been better ; for example , the suburban rail services could have been wrapped up into London Transport , had it not been for pressure from the internecine " Big Four " railways – the London , Midland and Scottish , London and Northeastern , Great Western and Southern Railways , in 1933 .
Better still had LT been allowed to go on developing the very suburbs to and from which it carried people , and reinvesting the profits in better services .
But that , of course , depends on acknowledging the good in the suburbs .
How we sneer !
The main reason , says Hoyle , was ( and is ) pure snobbery .
The suburbs were the middle classes getting above themselves .
" The upper class did n't like it .
The architects did n't like it .
The intellectuals did n't like it .
They despised the lower middle classes .
They hated the clerks . "
So , too , did the landowners , despite their handsome profits .
Who were these upstarts making a hybrid of the countryside , buying into the fantasy of safety , green space for the kids , the combination of the best of town and countryside ?
Who did they think they were ?
The answer might be : they were n't sure .
The history of the suburbs seems to be the history of an odd , introspective deracination .
Some writers , like John Betjeman , found this enchanting .
Others – Keith Waterhouse , Leslie Thomas – looked at the suburbs as they looked at everything else : with affection , as a stage for human idiosyncracy .
Tom Sharpe in The Throwback also saw suburbia as a stage on which was enacted terrible bloody mayhem , as served it right .
And others – George Orwell in particular – saw something darker still , a sort of massive con trick , a living death .
Frank Reynolds ' cartoon of 1923 , The Bitter Cry of the Suburbs , shows a clerk on a suburban station beside a 10 - year - old railway poster announcing " Come to the country .
CHEAP FARES " , and another , recent , one reading : " SEASON TICKET HOLDERS : INCREASED RATES " .
His brow is furrowed , his pipe clenched .
" They tempted me to come and live out here , " he complains , " and now they make my life unbearable ! "
For Evelyn
Waugh , living in Golders Green was unbearable anyway , because of snobbery ; he'd walk across the hill to to post his letters so that they would be franked " Hampstead " instead .
The rootlessness of the suburbs was no mere fiction ; David Bownes says that , behind the neat privet hedges ( a giant one greets visitors to the exhibition ) there was , to begin with at least , little sense of belonging .
" People were n't much involved in local society , either the pre-existing community or their own .
But of course there often were n't any pubs or centres where people could come together . "
The very social uniformity , too , could militate against an active community .
" They were all middle - class , " says Hoyle , " which might account for the idea of keeping up with the Joneses . "
Worth remembering that the Italian for suburb is " borghetto " – little borough – from which we get the word " ghetto " .
But maybe it's that very ghetto uniformity and rootlessness which gave the suburbs their odd , comforting allure .
Suburban life – certainly for the literati , who are of course the ones who write about it – is like Turkish delight : terribly tempting , but we know we should n't really .
Yet suburban values are n't that bad : safety , security , comfort , fitting in , living within your means , having a bit in reserve : these , until they tip , as they can , into a bitter sort of Daily Mail paranoia , are perhaps the most commonplace aspirations of humanity , and none the worse for that .
If we impute terrible vices to suburbia – wife - swapping , Abigail 's Party pretension , emotional frigidity , meanness , xenophobia , caravanning – that may say as much about us as it does about them .
And if the safety - suspicion - and - surveillance ethic we blame on the suburbs has infected the state as a whole ... then perhaps we should at least give an ear to the call of the spade , the laburnum and the season - ticket .

Kate Moss
The model grew up in the London suburb of Croydon .
She has said of her youth : " I knew I wanted to travel , because my dad worked in the travel business and I knew I wanted to leave Croydon ...
I 'm not retiring in the near future and when I do , it definitely will not be to Croydon . "
Ian Curtis
The late lead singer of cult band Joy Division lived in suburban Macclesfield .
He once said of his time there : " In sixth form , we all had this idea , ' Well we 'll go down to London and get some kind of job ' .
When I left , I got a great feeling : ' I 'm free , I 'm free ! ' "
David Bowie
The musician and actor grew up in Bromley , Kent , from the age of six .
He once said of the area : " It 's the greyness of it all ...
It was a man-made Orwellian society ready - cast in stone .
I think all my generation just wanted to escape . "
Alan Davies
The actor and comedian , on discovering his grandfather made his fortune by constructing suburban properties in north - east England , said : " The suburban life I grew up in filled me with horror and dread ... it gives me the willies ...
I 'm slightly dispirited he wanted to be MFI .
He built suburbia .
What a thing to do .
I do n't blame him , though .
He just built the houses . "
Hanif Kureishi
The playwright and novelist used his childhood in Bromley as inspiration for his novel ' The Buddha of Surburbia ' and once said : " ... in the suburbs , where concealment is often the only art , but where there is so much aspiration , dreaming and disappointment ... there is a lot for a writer "
JG Ballard
The late writer lived in Shepperton , Middlesex , for more than 50 years .
He has said :
“ Living out in Shepperton gives me a close - up view of the real England – the M25 , the world of business parks , industrial estates and executive housing , sports clubs and marinas , cineplexes , CCTV , car -rental forecourts …
That ’s where boredom comes in – a paralysing conformity and boredom that can only be relieved by some sort of violent act ; by taking your mail - order Kalashnikov into the nearest supermarket and letting rip . ”
Sir John Betjeman
The poet and broadcaster , who died in 1984 , grew up in the London suburb of Highgate and often wrote affectionately about suburban life :
“ Gaily into Ruislip Gardens
Runs the red electric train ...
Out into the outskirt ’s edges
Where a few surviving hedges
Keep alive our lost Elysium – rural Middlesex
again ”

Representatives of the Obama White House and Fox News met Wednesday and agreed to a truce in the war of words the administration and the news network have engaged in in recent weeks , says a report at media Web site Fishbowl DC .
Blogger Matt Dornic reports :
A very reliable source tells FishbowlDC that Fox News SVP Michael Clemente met with White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs this morning and reached what some are calling a “ truce . ”
Clemente then met with the FNC Washington bureau and encouraged staff to remain “ fair and balanced . ”

Writing at the TVNewser blog , blogger Kevin Allocca reported he had confirmed the report that the meeting took place .
“ No word whether the White House will backpedal on its pledge to keep Barack Obama from appearing on the News Corp. network until 2010 , ” reports The Wrap .
The White House and Fox News have been engaged in a political war of words since last month , when the Fox broadcasting network failed to air President Obama ’s address to a joint session of Congress about health care .
In recent weeks , White House staffers have publicly accused Fox of being dishonest in its reporting .
White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said that Fox is “ not really a news station , ” and communications director Anita Dunn called the network “ an arm of the Republican Party . ”
That drew strong criticism from conservative circles , with some observers accusing the administration of drawing up a Nixon - style “ enemies list . ”

This is reportedly not the first time that White House officials and Fox staffers have met during the course of the verbal war .
Earlier this month , it was reported that Fox News President Roger Ailes met with senior White House adviser David Axelrod .
As the New York Times noted , no details about that meeting have been made public .

It details how the opposing trenches were sometimes so close that the two sides would call a temporary truce to exchange friendly insults across No Man 's Land .
In one ' rather curious ' incident , a British soldier stood above the parapet to shout : ' Come on over , Fritz ' in a comedy German accent .
One of the enemy then called back - in a perfect English accent - ' No blooming fear ' .
Both sides then put their heads above the trench for half an hour to ' laugh and shout ' at each other before ' heads went down and the war went on the same as usual ' .
The three volumes were discovered among the possessions of Mr French 's sister Emily following her recent death at the age of 99 .
Immaculate :
An entry in one of John French 's pencil - written war diaries
' Lost ' journals : John 's daily log of experiences on the front line between 1915 and 1917 have been discovered after the death of his sister
Post war : John French 's family photo from 1918 .

Front row : George and Ernie
They describe the horror of the trenches , such as removing ' piles of men ' killed in action and ' shifting and ducking ' bullets which scream ' like ten thousand devils on the loose ' .
But Mr French , a tin miner from Redruth in Cornwall , also writes about the enticing smell of frying bacon , the relief of a good ' sing song ' , and discovering watercress growing in a stream which ' went all right with bread and cheese ' .
The sapper , who was awarded the Military Medal and the Military Cross for conspicuous bravery , even says the war is ' rather exciting ' because ' you never know what 's coming next ' .
' Immensely proud ' : John 's niece Wendy Dawe found three volumes of the journals after the death of his sister
Mr French was eventually promoted to second lieutenant .
Although he was wounded in action , he survived the war , but developed TB and died in 1929 aged 37 .
He married a young pianist named Eve during a spell in the U.S. , but they are believed not to have had any children .
The diaries are now on display at the Redruth Old Cornwall Society Museum .
In the running : John pictured winning a half - marathon before the war
Mr French , one of 11 children , was born in 1892 .
He was a keen runner and before joining the Army was pictured winning a half - marathon - for which he was awarded a trophy worth five guineas .
He was sent to France in 1915 as a member of the 254th Tunnelling Company of the Royal Engineers .
His diaries describe some of the bloodiest battles of the Great War .
He spends his days and nights ' up to my knees in water ' digging trenches just 75 yards away from Germans who throw a hail of bombs and grenades which ' go hizzing ' around his head .
Vivid memories : John describes mortars which look like ' big sausages '
The men are forced to work in whispers as their tunnels weave between those of the Germans and they flee when chemical weapons descend like ' thick yellow fog ' .
Award : John French , here pictured in his uniform , was awarded the Military Cross for Conspicuous Bravery
Enemy snipers , including one particular ' smart and hot ' shooter , regularly kill his comrades .
Mr French describes the ' awful mess ' of limbs sticking out of the ground and times when he is called to dig out men who have been trapped in mud and collapsed trenches .
Three days after the ' come on over , Fritz ' incident , he writes : ' Up in orders today that any German looking over the parapet is to be shot and any man found talking to them is to be placed under arrest .
' This is the result of the affair a few mornings ago . '
Mr French served at Ypres in 1917 - where one battle saw half a million men die - and he talks of the regular ' big pushes ' and how ' there wo n't be many of us left at this rate ' .
His entry for August 16 , 1917 , reads : ' Had a rather narrow escape .
Shell hit me full in the left side , ripped through my tunic but was stopped by my thick leather belt .
Escaped with nothing worse than a bruise . '
Yesterday his niece Wendy Dawe , of Illogan , near Redruth , said his journals make her ' immensely proud ' .

The Maoist movement first coalesced after a violent 1967 uprising by local Communists over a land dispute in a West Bengal village known as Naxalbari , hence the name Naxalites .
Some Communists would enter the political system ; today , the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) is an influential political force that holds power in West Bengal .
But others went underground , and by the 1980s , many found sanctuary in Chattisgarh , especially in the region across from the Indravati River known as Abhujmad .
From here , the Maoists recruited and trained disgruntled tribal villagers and slowly spread out .
For years , the central government regarded them as mostly a nuisance .
But in 2004 , the movement radicalized , authorities say , when its two dominant wings merged with the more violent Communist Party of India ( Maoist ) .
Authorities in Chattisgarh then deputized and armed civilian posses , which have been accused by human rights groups of terrorizing innocent villagers and committing atrocities of their own in the name of hunting Maoists .
Now , violence is frequent , if unpredictable , like the ambush near the village of Laheri , in Maharashtra State , carried out by the Maoists on Oct.
8 .
That morning , following a tip , a police patrol chased two Maoist fighters and stumbled into a trap .
Two hundred Maoists with rifles and machine guns lay waiting and opened fire when the officers came into an exposed area of rice paddies .
Seventeen officers died , fighting for hours until they ran out of ammunition .
In a recent Slashdot poll , users were asked which what breakthrough was the most likely from the following list :
Time Travel
Human - Level AI
Immortality
World Peace
Sharks with Lasers
Most people said that World Peace did n’t stand a chance prompting this comment :
It is deeply depressing that from amongst a list of alternatives whose achievements are up there in the realms of magic / fantasy , the one thing that humans are capable of right now is seen in the poll results as by far the least possible .
I thought this was thought provoking , but what what really caught my eye was the first response :
Sharks with Lasers are achievable right now .
Let us never forget that no matter what great advances are on the future horizon , we could put lasers on sharks today .
The following correction was printed in the Observer 's For the record column , Sunday October 11 2009
In the article below an editing error led to our claiming that 400,000 people pass annually through Hammersmith bus station and the Tower Bridge museum , where new Hydrachill water fountains are to be trialled .
That should be 4 million and 400,000 respectively .
London may soon follow in the footsteps of Bundanoon , the Australian town that last week banned bottled water and set up drinking fountains for thirsty locals .
The capital 's first water stations will be set up this month in a move that could have serious repercussions for the £ 1.5 bn - a - year bottled water industry , with companies finding it increasingly difficult to justify their carbon footprint as the quality of tap water improves .
Thames Water , Britain 's largest privatised water company , with 13.6 million customers , has had talks with the Greater London Authority and Transport for London to install water machines in the capital .
In the first trial , Hydrachills will be installed at Hammersmith bus station and at the Tower Bridge museum .
The machines can fill bottles of up to 500 ml with chilled water for a 20 p charge .
All proceeds will be donated to Waste Watch , a charity working to change the way people use natural resources .
Should London 's water stations prove a hit with the 400,000 visitors who annually pass through the two sites , the scheme will be extended to underground , bus and railway stations across London and the south - east before the 2012 Olympics .
The move follows the installation last week of Hyde Park 's first drinking fountain in 30 years .
The mayor of London , Boris Johnson , was criticised for reneging on promises to install water fountains in the capital 's parks , with Hyde Park his solitary success .
In his draft water strategy for London , Johnson says British tap water is " among the best in the world " , but that misconceptions over its perceived healthiness encouraged people to buy bottled water .
Tap water is a thousand times cheaper than bottled , which is more expensive per litre than petrol , he says .
But Thames
Water has been left to take up the mayor 's pledge of more drinking stations , in a move that has upset bottled - water firms , which are fast losing the PR battle .
Activists say bottling water causes unnecessary use of plastics and fuel for transport and requires 2,000 times the energy required to produce tap water .
Hildon , regarded by many as the most exclusive bottled water , last week launched its second aggressive advertising campaign .
In magazine adverts , fitness instructor Jonathan Goodair claimed tap water was only good enough to shower in and for " washing my kit " .
He claimed it left an " unpleasant taste " .
In the summer , the company took out a 20 - page trade magazine advertisement attacking tap water .
Under the headline " Is it safe ? " it said : " Cancer drugs found in tap water " , adding : " Is there anything else they are not telling us ? "
Water companies ignored the attacks , preferring to concentrate on promoting their own benefits .
The Drinking Water Inspectorate 's latest water quality report said Thames Water 's tap water was 99.99 % compliant with national and European standards – its best - ever performance .
Average compliance across the industry remained at 99.96 % .
Consumption of bottled water doubled in the 10 years to 2006 , but since then sales have fallen .
At the end of March , sales were down 12 % on the year , according to researchers .
Of 13 billion plastic bottles of all types sold in the UK last year , only a third were recycled .
Peter Antolik , of Thames Water , said : " Where once people may have felt obliged to order mineral water when out for a meal or a drink , they are now at ease asking for tap water .
We 're building on this achievement by trialling Hydrachill water stations , which we hope will soon be commonplace for carbon - conscious Londoners wanting to stay refreshed as well as cut down on cost and waste . "
Drug related
We see this all the time …
80 % of Puerto Rico Murders Called Drug - Related SAN JUAN – About 80 percent of the murders committed in Puerto Rico are directly linked to drug trafficking , authorities and academics say .
So despite the headline , it ’s not really drug - related .
It ’s more accurately drug - war - related , or drug - trafficking - related , but it ’s easier for headline writers to say “ drug- related . ”
But it does make me wonder why , when there are various violent religious conflicts around the world , headline writers do n’t refer to those deaths as “ God-related . ”
What 's worse than making a 9/11 - themed ad ?
Making a 9/11 - themed video !
While we all now know that WWF does n't endorse the ad made in its name , let 's all take a moment to wonder why , oh why , Brazil - based agency DDB BRASIL thought such a thing was a good idea ....
Okay , now that the moment has passed ...
WTF ?
Really ?
Who in their right mind would think that using a terrorist attack would drive an earth - friendly message home ?
Also , we do n't want to be sticklers , but the 9/11 attacks killed more than the number put forth by this commercial .
DDB Brasil insists the commercial was nothing but a rough draft , but STILL ...
Seriously ?!

SANDY --
A former pizza delivery man is set to appear before a judge next month on a charge he tried to bribe his way out of a speeding ticket using a pepperoni pizza .
Paul G. Booth , 54 , was pulled over in June on 9400 South in Sandy while on a double delivery .
" As [ the officer ] was walking away I said , ‘ Hey , if you go easy on me , I can get you a pizza , ' " Booth said .
" I should have said , ‘ Hey if you go easy on me , I 'd sure appreciate it . ' "
Booth said that 's when the officer stopped in his tracks and told him that would be a bribe .
Booth said he realized he'd put his foot in his mouth .
Booth said he later told the officer , " You were really up front telling me that was some kind of a bribe on my part , I 'm going to be up front with you .
I 've got my seat belt on , I 'm not drinking .
You can see I 'm trying to work here .
Now everything I make tonight is going to go to Sandy City .
I hope you feel really good about that . "
In the case notes , however , the officer said Booth told him , " You were really quick to call me on my bribe . "
Police said that comment was caught on dash - cam video , as was the first part of the stop .
However police said when they tried to recover the entire segment , that part was lost due to a server error .
Booth claimed the lost part of the tape would have caught the true nature of his comments and led others to realize the offer was not serious .
He said he questioned the server error and claimed the officer was possibly being vindictive because Booth had scolded him .
Sgt. Justin Chapman with the Sandy Police Department said the computer error did happen .
In fact , the problem erased video from numerous dash cams that night , including one on a case he was involved in .
" Certainly we do n't train our officers to act in a vindictive nature , " he said .
The officer noted Booth 's pizza comment on the ticket and cited him for speeding .
In August , Booth appeared in court in Sandy City to appeal the ticket .
The city said at that time it offered to let the bribery charges go if Booth would pay his speeding fine .
Sandy City spokeswoman Trina Duerkson said Booth wanted to press the issue and take his case to trial .
At that point , Duerkson said the city had no choice but to send all the information , including the information on the alleged bribe , to the district attorney 's office .
Booth said he did not recall any such offer and would have taken it rather than face a felony .
He said the only thing that was said in the hearing was that the city planned to dismiss the speeding ticket without prejudice and forward the case to the district attorney for possible felony bribery charges .
Booth claimed that in the hearing , the representative from the city prosecutor 's office was very terse and overreacted when Booth turned and looked at the police officer after learning he may face a possible felony charge .
" They 're twisting this around like I was the aggressor .
They were the aggressors , " he said .
The charges were screened with the district attorney , but office spokeswoman Alicia Cook said they were eventually amended to a misdemeanor charge of bribery to avoid criminal prosecution .
Cook said the facts of the case better fit that charge .
" What we charge is a reflection of what evidence we have , " said Cook .
Booth will be back in court on Nov. 9 .

A new version of Officemalscanner / RTFScan has been released .
This update includes a generic decryption loop detection , enhanced shellcode patterns and bugfixes .
Enjoy !
OfficeMalScanner.zip
12.09.2012
The new version of the OfficeMalScanner suite introduces RTFScan .
As you might know , there are several samples in the wild , using the RTF format as OLE and PE - File container .
So here is a very first version of RTFScan .
It currently is able to scan for malicious traces like shellcode , dumps embedded OLE and PE files and other data containers .
Buffer decryption in RTFScan is not supported in this release , as OMS and RTFScan will be enhanced to a cryptanalysis feature to break keys up to 1024 bytes in seconds .
The old brute force feature in OMS will be kicked then .

Today i read an article on the New York Times website called A sneaky security problem , ignored by the bad guys
I had a conversion by phone and mail with its author Robert McMillan from IDG
News before and i've answered him some questions about my Rustock .
C research as he planned to write the above story .
There are some quotes by Al Huger from Symantec in this article i would like to comment , as i disagree to most of his statements regarding rootkits .
Quote 1 :
" It 's extremely difficult to write code for your kernel that does n't crash your computer , " said Alfred Huger , vice president of Symantec 's Security Response team .
" Your software can step on somebody else 's pretty easily . "
I think this statement comes from the mentioned crashes that Rustock .
C produced while analyzing it .
But in fact it just crashed if the decryption failed because the rootkit gets analyzed on another box , than the original infected one ( check my slides for details ) .
The Rustock familiy has proven to have stable code , as well as other creatures from its author like MEBROOT .
If it crashed victims boxes all the time , they had reinstalled their OSes very quickly , but in fact i know people who had this beast on their boxes for 1 year without any crash and without even knowing about its existance .
Quote 2 :
" Huger agrees that while rootkits are still a problem for Unix users , they 're not widespread on Windows PCs . "
Yep , sure .
How old is the last well known rootkit on Unix please ?
3 or 4 years ?
And what about rootkits on Windows ?
Rustock , Srizbi , Ascesso , Mebroot ( Here is a bigger list : Antirootkit.com Stealth Malware List
Quote 3 :
" Rootkits make up far less than 1 percent of all the attempted infections that Symantec tracks these days . "
If i just count all those useless malwares created with lame kits or code written by some kiddies , then rootkits might be only 1 percent , but if i take a look at the real effective SpamBots , Banking Trojans and so forth , nearly all of them use rootkit techniques to hide its tracks .
Ok , that 's all for now .
Sorry for being so rude on Al 's statements , but i had to clarify this .

The binaries are usually created with a tool called ZEUS Builder and there exist lots of different versions in the wild .
I found samples with and without rootkit functionality , as well as ontop packed binaries , meaning they are additionally protected / packed with tools like Aspack , ACProtect , Polycrypt and so forth .
We will discuss all 3 types and how to deal with them in 3 different ways .
- 1 . Manual unpacking + import fixing - 2 . Manual unpacking +
Auto import fixing - 3 . Auto unpacking / import fixing - Stage 2 introduces a nice tool called " Universal Import Fixer " and Stage 3 shows how to automate unpacking / import fixing with OllyDbgScript .

This small IDAPython script scans an idb file for class and interfaces UUIDs and creates the matching structure and its name .
Unfortunately IDA does n't do this automatically , thus this little helper .
It personally helped me alot , while reversing several malwares using the COM interface , e.g. for browser or outlook manipulation , BITS file transfer or dumping the protected storage .
The script was tested with IDAPython v0.9.0 and Python 2.4 .

I put a new paper online .
It is an analysis of the Rustock .
B rootkit .
The rootkit used several proprietary obfuscation / packing methods to hide the native driver code from prying eyes .
I have divided the paper into two main parts .
The first part , which is divided in three stages , describes how to extract the native rootkit driver code without the use of kernel debuggers or other ring0 tools .
The second part basically does the same , but much faster and with lesser efforts using the SoftICE kernel debugger .
Each part shows various possibilities for solving the different problems facing the researcher when analyzing Rustock .

The ministers have been receiving training at a military base
The government of the Maldives is to hold a cabinet meeting underwater to highlight the threat of global warming .
President Mohamed Nasheed and his cabinet will sign a document during the 17 October dive , calling for global cuts in carbon emissions .
An adviser to the president told the BBC the dive was " a bit of fun " but the cabinet intended to send a serious message about rising sea levels .
The low - lying island nation says it faces being wiped out if oceans rise .
The adviser , who asked not to be named , said ministers would communicate during the meeting using hand signals and waterproof boards and pens .
The cabinet will be joined by instructors and military escorts " Obviously the hand signals that divers can use are limited , so the amount of work the cabinet are going to get done will be limited , " he said .
" But they will call on all nations - rich and poor , developed and developing - to take climate change seriously . "
All cabinet members bar one - who has a medical condition that rules out diving - have been in training at a military base on one of the country 's many islands .
Mr Nasheed , who is already a qualified diver , will also hold a press conference in the water .
While underwater , the government will sign a document ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December , calling on all nations to cut down their carbon emissions .
World leaders at the summit are aiming to create a new agreement to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , which expires in 2012 .
' Friendly ' sharks
The dive is being held to mark the 350 International Day of Climate Change Action on 24 October .
The Maldives is the world 's lowest - lying country
The day 's organisers say they want to highlight the risks of rising carbon in the atmosphere and encourage world leaders to commit to reducing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere to 350 parts per million .
That is the amount some scientists say is the safe upper limit to avoid irreparable damage to the environment .
Some 80 % of the Maldives archipelago is less than a metre above sea level and is extremely vulnerable to any rise in sea levels as a result of global warming melting the polar ice caps .
Officials say that by the time the Maldives feels the full effect of climate change , it will be too late to save other countries .
Mr Nasheed has warned that the entire nation may have to find a new home if the oceans rise as predicted by the UN .
The president 's adviser told the BBC that although the country 's government was almost all going to be underwater at the same time , there was no real danger .
Each minister will be accompanied by a diving instructor and a military minder and the local sharks were " friendly " , he said .

Any effort to describe the photography of Lu Guang by reference to the work of other artists would almost certainly invoke the name of W. Eugene Smith .
( It is , for instance , just about impossible to look at Slide 4 without thinking of “ Tomoko Uemura in Her Bath . ” )
So it seems especially fitting that Mr. Lu , a Chinese freelancer , is the recipient of this year ’s $ 30,000 W. Eugene Smith Grant in Humanistic Photography for his project , “ Pollution in China . ”
The announcement was made Wednesday evening in New York by the W. Eugene Smith Memorial Fund on the occasion of its 30th anniversary .
It is not just Mr. Smith ’s work that comes to mind when looking at Mr. Lu’s depiction of the dark social and environmental consequences of China ’s modern industrial revolution .
There is a bit of Charles Sheeler and Edward Burtynsky .
And Hieronymus Bosch .
“ Because China ’s economy is moving so fast , the pollution is incredibly severe , ” he told us Wednesday through a translation by Orville Schell at the Asia Society .
“ As I became aware of the pollution as China opened up the western area , I felt that people needed to know about this . ”
Mr. Lu was born in 1961 in Zhejiang Province and was taking pictures before his 20th birthday , when he worked in a factory .
He studied at the fine arts academy at Tsinghua University in Beijing from 1993 to 1995 and has concentrated on social and economic issues in his work since then .
In 2003 , his pictures of peasants in Henan Province who had been infected with HIV after selling their blood won the first prize for a story about contemporary issues from World Press Photo .
In the words of the Smith fund , its annual grants are intended to reward photographers “ who have demonstrated a deep commitment to documenting the human condition in the formidable tradition of compassionate dedication that W. Eugene Smith exhibited . ”
The jurors were Helen Marcus , president emerita of the fund ; Devika Daulet - Singh , founder and director of the Photo - Ink gallery in New Delhi ; and Jeff L. Rosenheim , curator of the department of photographs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art .
They also awarded a $ 5,000 fellowship to Krisanne Johnson of Brooklyn and announced three other finalists from among 216 proposals : Matt Eich , of Norfolk , Va. ; Johan Spanner , from Copenhagen ; and Joseph Sywenkyj of Campton , N.H .
“ The impact on me is very significant , ” Mr. Lu said .
“ It confirms this work .
The money will also allow me to do even better .
Certainly , I ’m not finished .
There are many other places I have to shoot . ”
HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) -- Hong
Kong is pulling all its physical gold holdings from depositories in London , transferring them to a high - security depository newly built at the city 's airport , in a move that won praise from local traders Thursday .
The facility , industry professionals said , would support Hong Kong 's emergence as a Swiss - style trading hub for bullion and would lessen London 's status as a key settlement - and - storage center .
" Having a central government - sponsored vault would create a situation where you could conceivably look at Hong Kong as being a hub , where metal could be traded for the region , " said Sunil Kashyap , managing director at Scotia Capital in Hong Kong , adding that the facility was the first with official government backing in the region .
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority , which functions as the territory 's unofficial central bank , will transfer its gold reserves stored in other vaults to the depository later this year , the Hong Kong government said in an earlier statement .
The monetary authority reported $ 63 million in physical gold reserves as of July 31 , according to its International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity statement .
The authority would n't disclose where the reserves are held , but local media reports cited gold traders as saying that London 's the most likely location .
Traders said the new depository facility could also foster new financial products , such as exchange - traded funds based on precious metals .
The 3,660 - square - foot depository , located at the city 's main Chek Lap Kok Airport , will serve as a " storage facility for local and overseas government institutions , " according to the government statement .
Martin Hennecke , a financial advisor with the Hong Kong - based Tyche Group Ltd. , said that could be appealing to regional central banks unnerved after watching the global financial system teeter on verge of implosion last year .
" Central banks are increasingly aware of the importance of having gold reserves at time of financial crisis and having it easily available at their own disposal , " he said .
Meanwhile , local newspaper reports said the Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange had signed an agreement to use the depository for its physical settlement and storage needs .
Marketing efforts will be launched to convince Asian central banks to transfer their gold reserves to the Hong Kong facility , according to reports citing Raymond Lai , finance director with the Hong Kong Airport Authority .
Efforts will also be made to reach out to commodity exchanges , banks , precious - metals refiners and ETF providers , the reports said .
Management firm Value Partners planned to launch an ETF gold fund that will use Hong Kong instead of London as a repository for the gold backing the fund , local reports said Thursday .

TARP Recipients Paid Out $ 114 Million for Politicking Last Year
Open Secret .
Org February 4 , 2009 9:52 AM
http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/02/tarp-recipients-paid-out-114-m.html
I recall that September day like it was yesterday — the explosion so stunning , so memorable .
It was n’t 9/11/01 , it was 9/29/08 — a moment when a rare blast of populist democracy briefly singed the economic terrorists who hold the Capitol hostage .
It had been a dark and stormy month of financial collapse , culminating in an attempted power grab .
Pushed by his fellow Wall Street Ponzi schemers , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson — a former Goldman Sachs CEO — was threatening Armageddon unless Congress ratified his pamphlet - sized decree for a no - strings - attached bank bailout .
The straightforward proposal , backed by President George W. Bush and President - to - be Barack Obama , would have turned Paulson into King Henry — a despot allowed to autonomously dole out $ 700 billion to any of his business cronies .
This was too outrageous even for a rubber - stamp Congress that had long been ceding power to both the executive branch and the corporate boardroom .
And so rank - and - file House Democrats and Republicans , backed by an angry public , overrode their leaders and voted down the measure .
Admittedly , the conflagration was brief .
After a few days of industry lobbying , the House ultimately passed the Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) bailout — but one with at least some mild restrictions .
For a time , 9/29 ’s fleeting blast of defiance appeared to establish a maximum limit to robbery and presidential authoritarianism .
For a time .
Today , the episode — if considered at all in Washington — seems merely to have set minimum standards for chicanery .
As evidenced by two little - noticed sections of the Obama administration ’s Wall Street “ reform ” bill , presidents and their bank benefactors are back to thinking they can pilfer whatever they want — only now they have learned to camouflage their demands by burying them in the esoterica of lengthier bills .
Finding this latest giveaway means digging all the way down to sections 1109 and 1604 of the White House ’s mammoth proposal .
These passages look like typical legislative asterisks — perfunctory “ oh , by the ways ” inserted by some overeager law school intern in the Treasury Department ’s basement as a matter of meaningless parliamentary etiquette .
They are anything but .
At a recent hearing , Rep. Brad Sherman , D - Calif. , called the language “ TARP on steroids , ” noting the provisions would deliberately let the executive branch enact even bigger , more unregulated bailouts than ever — and by unilateral fiat .
Whereas the original TARP included some oversight language and power to limit Wall Street bonuses , TARP on Steroids includes no specific oversight or executive pay constraints .
Whereas TARP permitted the government to underwrite both small and large banks , TARP on Steroids allows taxpayer cash to go only to the behemoths ( which , not coincidentally , tend to make the biggest campaign contributions ) .
And whereas TARP limited the Treasury secretary ’s check - writing authority to two years and $ 700 billion , TARP on Steroids would let him spend as much as he wants for as long as he wants .
This last point is what poker players call “ the tell ” — the inadvertent tip exposing a scam .
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner ’s tell came when he publicly said the Obama administration would oppose amendments limiting the new bailout power — even if the limit was a $ 1 trillion cap .
The former financial executives inside the Obama administration have labeled their bill the “ Financial Stability Improvement Act , ” and some might say that ’s like Bush officials oxymoronically calling their own anti-environment initiatives a “ Clear Skies ” agenda .
But that ’s not a totally fair comparison because there ’s an underlying consistency here :
While these new “ financial stability ” powers may destabilize the nation ’s finances , they would more than stabilize Wall Street ’s larcenous profits .
That thievery , of course , has been the big problem all along — and now , only another 9/29 can prevent it from getting worse .

The Environmental Protection Agency said on Thursday that it would overhaul enforcement of the Clean Water Act , as lawmakers sharply criticized the agency ’s decade - long lapses in punishing polluters .
At a daylong hearing before the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure , the E.P.A. administrator , Lisa P. Jackson , said that agency officials “ are falling short of this administration ’s expectations for the effectiveness of our clean water enforcement programs . ”
“ The time is long overdue for E.P.A. to re-examine its approach to Clean Water Act enforcement , ” said Ms. Jackson , who was confirmed to her position in January .
She added that the agency would set strict benchmarks for state regulators , eventually compel companies to submit electronic pollution records so violations could be detected and punished more easily , and “ develop more innovative approaches to target enforcement to the most serious violations and the most significant sources . ”
One approach will probably include a series of enforcement actions against companies and municipalities that have violated the Clean Water Act , according to people with knowledge of the E.P.A. ’s plans who were not authorized to speak publicly .
( CNN ) --
Five juveniles were in custody Tuesday after a 15 - year - old was intentionally set on fire at a Deerfield Beach , Florida , apartment complex , police said .
Police say Michael Brewer , 15 , is expected to be hospitalized for five months .
Michael Brewer suffered second - degree burns over 80 percent of his body .
" He 's in for a long , long recovery , " Broward County Sheriff Al Lamberti told reporters .
Three juveniles were arrested Monday night , hours after the incident , and two others were arrested Tuesday , sheriff 's Sgt. Steve Feeley said .
" A couple of them last night were laughing about it , " he said .
" One of them arrested today seems genuinely sorry about it . "
The youths all attend school together , police said , and Brewer apparently owed one of the suspects $ 40 for a video game and had not paid it .
So the suspect allegedly stole the victim 's father 's bicycle , Feeley said .
Brewer reported the bicycle stolen Sunday , and the suspect was arrested that day , taken to a detention center and released to his parents early Monday , police said .
Watch Lamberti describe the alleged motive »
Neither Brewer nor the suspect went to school Monday , and the victim was waiting at the apartment complex for his friends when the suspect and two other people approached him , Feeley said .
From what the suspects and witnesses have told police , the suspect yelled , " He 's a snitch , he 's a snitch " and " pour it on him . "
Another juvenile threw what police believe was rubbing alcohol on Brewer from a plastic jug and used a lighter to set him on fire , he said .
Witness Provindencia Maldenero told CNN affiliate WPLG , " I saw a kid throwing something at the other kid , and next thing you know , the kid was on fire .
He was up in fire . "
A resident used a fire extinguisher to put out the flames , and Brewer jumped into the complex 's swimming pool , WPLG reported .
Malissa Durkee , the teen 's sister , told WPLG on Monday night that her brother was in critical condition .
Lamberti said Brewer is expected to be hospitalized for five months .
" In my 31 years -- I always say , ' it 's the most heinous crime I 've ever seen , ' " Lamberti told reporters Tuesday .
" This one fits in that category .
The fact that a person would intentionally ignite another child on fire -- it 's indescribable . "
Brewer " reported somebody for stealing his dad 's bike , " the sheriff said .
" That 's what this comes down to .
It 's retaliation .
They deliberately sought him out , poured alcohol on him and set him on fire .
I can tell you there 's no way to explain it , no way to rationalize it . "
Police believe the three arrested Monday night took an " active role " in the incident , while the other two helped surround Brewer and prevented him from leaving , Feeley said .
He said authorities are hoping to interview Brewer on Wednesday or Thursday .

Update : Evan Rapoport from HedgeCo tells us that his client list is only a " sample " and thus , LogiEnergy was n't included on said list .
Reuters today reported that troubled business lender CIT Group was offered $ 1 billion by unknown hedge fund LogiEnergy .
According to the report , LogiEnergy was looking to pick up a " sliver " of CIT 's oil and gas debt in an effort to boost its Peak Oil fund .
But the entire deal is shrouded in deep mystery .
Who is LogiEnergy ?
We went searching for answers and found that its main corporate website , which is buried within Google , is n't even operational .
Their Peak Oil website at www.logipeakoil.com allows you to access no information without signing up .
Furthermore , the designers of the Peak Oil website , HedgeCo Websites , have apparently dropped LogiEnergy from their client list and no record of the hedge fund exists on its website :
Asked about the source of the financing , logi's chief investment officer , Lorenzo Ortega , declined to comment .
But Ortega told Reuters , " We have an institutional - class investor that is interested in supporting it . "
The financing is contingent on CIT accepting the offer .
A spokesman for CIT declined to comment on the proposal .
Analysts and energy investors said they had not previously heard of logi .
Ortega said he did not believe the debt offer was a game - changing deal for CIT .
" This is simply a hip pocket opportunity for them , " he said .
" Those poor guys have a much bigger problems ... CIT has a big chunk of oil and gas debt .
We only want a sliver . "
Who is this " institutional - class investor " that Ortega offers up to the press ?
Surely it would come out and announce its plans to purchase $ 1 billion of CIT asssets if it were serious .
For now , LogiEnergy is nothing more than an apparition .

NEW DELHI , India —
In December 2007 , Californian Amy Scher got on a plane to India , wheeled herself into the Nu Tech Mediworld hospital in New Delhi , and started the first phase of an experimental embryonic stem - cell treatment .
Her American doctor had warned her against this untested procedure .
But 27 - year - old Scher was making no progress with conventional medicine , and she was fed up with the constant visits to hospital emergency rooms .
Scher suffered from chronic
Lyme disease , which had gone undiagnosed initially , causing serious damage her nervous system .
After researching her options for months , talking to several people who had benefitted from these treatments in India , and reading up about therapies available stateside , Scher decided the American medical system could n't help her .
She chose to travel to India .
For eight weeks , she was injected with stem cells and underwent extensive physical therapy .
The treatments cost an average of $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 for a first round of injections .
They were not covered by insurance .
Today , Scher 's U.S. physician , Dr. Steven Harris considers her " asymptomatic . "
He is uncertain whether the disease has been eradicated , or if it ’s just dormant , but he says the treatments appear to have helped .
From India ,
Scher brought back a SPECT scan , which measures blood flow in the brain .
Before India , Harris says , the blood flow in her brain was impaired .
" At the end of her stay , a repeat scan showed normalization of her blood flow — in effect , an improvement in brain function . "
Scher no longer takes nerve stabilizers or cardiac medication .
The chronic pain , a constant companion since 2001 , is gone .
Unknown risks
But some scientists and stem cell researchers in the West believe that patients like Scher are putting themselves at a huge risk by coming to India to get these experimental treatments .
The problem , they say , is the lack of legislation governing the use of stem cells in the developing world .
The Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) allows the use of embryonic stem cells if the condition or disorder is considered incurable .
But Dr. Satish Totey , Chief Scientific Officer at Stempeutics , a private stem cell company , and the Secretary of the Stem Cell Research Forum of India ( SCRFI ) believes there needs to be tighter regulation .
" There is nothing in those ICMR guidelines that can actually be called a guideline , " he says .
Unlike in the West , there has never been a controversy about the manipulation or destruction of human embryos in India , giving the country ’s doctors a head start in the field .
The growth of private hospitals providing stem cell therapies , however , is breeding a rift of a different kind .
Given that most of these treatments have not been proven safe or effective , medical professionals dispute whether these clinics should be allowed to exist at all .
A controversial doc
At the heart of the controversy is Dr. Geeta Shroff , the doctor who treated Scher .
Being both fiercely independent and intelligent has earned Dr. Shroff the criticism and scorn of many .
A pioneer in many ways , she developed a technology through which , by the use of a single donated embryo , she has been able to treat 600 patients for conditions such as Alzheimer 's , multiple sclerosis , renal failure , cerebral palsy , and diabetes .
What 's also unique about Dr. Shroff 's technique is that 's she 's been able to grow embryonic stem cells without the use of any animal products .
Dr. Shroff converts the stem cells into a clear substance that can be injected into her patients .
The treatments include four to eight weeks of injections with intense physical therapy .
In a progressive disorder , such as multiple sclerosis , the aim is to first stabilize the patient , in order to stop further deterioration , and then eventually , to start rebuilding through the use of stem cells .
The greater the damage to the body , the longer it takes for the stem cells to start regeneration .
In a static injury , such as a stroke or a spinal cord injury , the stem cells have to bypass the thick scar tissue and form connections around it .
Patients who come seeking a " miracle cure , " are often disappointed , she says .
The stem cells need time to regenerate the body , and often take months or years depending on the injury .
Dr. Shroff started out as an infertility specialist .
That , and her practice as a gynecologist , helped fund her early work , which was carried out in her garage .
It also gave her insight into embryonic stem cells .
In the nine years that she 's been treating patients using this technology , she says that not one has reported any side effects .
For GlobalPost Passport , several of her patients were happy to lay out their medical reports , wiggle their toes where they once had no feeling , and share details of their stay in the hospital — including complaints about the food .
The scientific community , however , remains unconvinced .
In what is probably her most controversial move , instead of publishing her findings , Dr. Shroff decided to patent her technology .
( Her patent application is available online . )
Totey says Shroff is taking advantage of her patients ’ desperation .
" Under the pretext of patents , she says that nothing can be shown , " he says .
" Why does she not publish a paper ? "
He believes that by not doing so , she is putting her patients at a risk of getting a teratoma — a type of tumor “ that may contain several different types of tissue and sometimes mature elements such as hair , muscle , and bone , ” as defined by medterms .
net .
( Teratomas are a common challenge for embryonic stem cell researchers . )
Initially , Dr. Shroff explains that she did think about publishing her results .
" You do try and get out there and at the end of the day , I am a doctor , " she says .
She tried to present at some conferences , but was rejected and told that there were already too many people presenting on embryonic stem cells .
That 's when she decided to patent her work instead .
" With the patent , I could protect the technology .
I could make sure that somebody who does n't understand the business can't stop it . "
Once the patent is granted , Dr. Shroff will be able to move forward with the next step .
The dream , she says , is to make stem cell injections available in pharmacies across the world , so that the process of stabilization and treatment can be started right at the onset of disease .
She likens it to the discovery of penicillin .
" That was the beginning of the antibiotic era , and it changed the entire face of infection around the world .
This is similar to that . "
Favorable outcomes
Of her 600 patients , 30 percent are either doctors or have physicians in the family , she says .
Despite her critics ' claims , Dr. Shroff says she has always put the well being of her patients first .
An ethics committee at her hospital evaluates every case that comes in .
The first two years , she says , were spent exclusively in the lab , testing repeatedly to make sure the treatments were safe .
In time , she 's sure the controversy will die out , as laws will come into effect .
" It 's important to have certain guidelines or laws , but they should n't curb research , " she says .
" The law has to be such that the work does not stop . "
But Dr. Totey rejects proceeding with treatments before the science has been published and vetted .
He points out that no one knows what she is putting into those injections .
" If it is intravenous , I can use river water and inject that , " he says .
Until she shows the scientific community what she is putting in there , he says he 'll remain unconvinced .
Some doctors argue that the U.S. puts up too many barriers , and that India 's regulations are appropriate in allowing stem cell treatments for incurable and terminally ill patients .
One such physician is Dr. Laurance Johnston , who in 2007 was the first American scientist to visit the Nu Tech Mediworld clinic .
Dr. Johnston ’s credentials make him well - placed to judge : he is the director of the Spinal Cord Research and Education Foundations , Paralyzed Veterans of America ( PVA ) ; and he was formerly director at the Division of Scientific Review at the U.S. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , a division of the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) .
He told GlobalPost Passport that he 's convinced she 's sincere and conscientious in her endeavors .
" As you probably expect , there are a lot of politics , agendas , and economic interests when it comes to various emerging stem - cell programs , " he says .
" In general scientists think they are being good scientists if they point out what is wrong with a program rather than its potential . "
Dr. Harris , Scher 's physician , is also impressed .
After advising his patient not to go , and being pleasantly surprised on her return , he decided to travel to India himself to see Dr. Shroff 's work .
" She has been able to accomplished two feats quite advanced in the field of stem cells , " he says .
" The ability to freeze and thaw her cells to allow storage and transport and the creation of an immortal cell line without animal feeder cells . "
Harris was most impressed with Shroff ’s success treating patients with spinal cord injuries , and children with cerebral palsy .
According to a report by the SCRFI , India ’s stem cell industry — including mainly research , but also stem cell therapies deployed by Shroff , and other stem cell therapies — is expected to grow at a rate of 15 percent , to $ 540 million by 2010 .
" I think India is at the forefront of emerging stem - cell treatments in many ways , " says Dr. Johnston .
" Convinced of their superiority , American scientists hate the notion that the hottest breakthroughs may be happening in other parts of the world and vociferously denigrate them . "
Dr. Totey agrees that it would be a mistake to base India 's stem cell guidelines on those of the U.S.
" The way we work is different , " he says .
" We should look at our own system and make our own guidelines .
There is no point in looking at the U.S. and thinking that they 're the best . "
Scher , who spent years going in and out of U.S. hospitals , shares this sentiment .
" I had really tried , " she says .
" I had tried all the traditional things , but I had also tried alternative therapies .
And then , when you do n't have any of that left , you have to be open - minded .
It 's ignorance to not look anywhere else .
You can't think that the U.S. has the only good treatments in the world .

Earlier this year we covered a study on REM sleep behaviour disorder ( RBD ) where normal sleep paralysis breaks down and sleepers act out their dreams .
The Journal of Forensic Science has just published a study on the dark side of the disorder , where affected sleepers experience nightmares and can unknowingly damage themselves or their partners in fits of dream world violence .
The researchers examined all the published cases on violence in REM sleep behaviour disorder with potential for a lethal outcome and found they fall into three groups : choking or headlock attacks , throwing someone or throwing yourself through a window , and diving from the bed .
Some of the descriptions are pretty intense :
A 63 - year - old man with RBD and delayed - onset Shy - Drager Syndrome reported “ a progressive 10 - year history of abnormal behavior during sleep .
He would at various times choke , kick , punch , and spit on his wife while he was asleep .
In addition , complex behaviors such as getting out of bed and running into walls while asleep were reported by family members .
This behavior occurred while the patient was dreaming , usually of being attacked .
A 67 - year - old man had a 3 - year history of progressive stiffness and slowing of his left side .
Five years before the onset of these symptoms , he began having vivid dreams together with violent movements during sleep .
Once he dreamed of being trapped in a house on fire , and he almost jumped out of the window , if not for his wife awakening and restraining him .
A 25 - year - old woman with multiple sclerosis “ presented with a 6 - month history of sudden awakenings from fearful , often vivid ‚Ä¶dreams and with terrified screams or violent behavior such as kicking , running to the door or to the window , crying and falling out of bed .
If awakened , she always recalled a fighting dream .
Once she repetitively banged her head against the floor , inducing a large facial hematoma .
On that occasion , she was dreaming that a man was knocking her against the wall .
The idea that someone could be violent during sleep without any awareness was initially treated with suspicion but it has since been confirmed in sleep labs where patient are video - taped and wired up to an EEG to confirm they are in REM sleep .
There have now been numerous legal cases where ‘ sleepwalking violence ’ has been used as a defence for murders or attempted murders , and at least one case where it led to a successful acquittal .

UNICEF 's direct mail campaign has put a teary smile on my face .
They 're sending out baggies of what appear to be lil ' plastic toy soldiers , but are actually playing children , reminders of young 'ns forced into battle in Africa .

This direct mail campaign is incredibly effective in how it brings forth childhood memories for many while emphasizing the reality of those who may never have one : Child soldiers in places such as Africa .
The campaign may be aiming to find corporate sponsorships , but they 've earned a check from me , too .

On This Date in History :
Orville and Wilbur Wright made their first public demonstration of their airplane on this date in 1908 .
Actually , it was n’t the same Wright Flyer that made the historic flight in December 1903 .
They had made a number of improvements over nearly 5 years , but no one really noticed .
The day that they made their initial flight , they had invited the press but no one came .
Instead , they had been focused on the ill - fated attempt at heavier than air flight by the more celebrated Samuel Pierpont Langley .
Following the Wright ’s flight at Kitty Hawk , NC the New York Daily Tribune printed a small story with the headline “ Dayton Boys Fly Airship . ”
The newspaper obviously had no clue as to what they had accomplished .
After that , the Wrights worked on improving their “ airship ” but even the farmers were n’t interested .
A farmer once watched the Wrights fly a plane near Dayton , Ohio 24 miles in 38 minutes , but he did n’t even stop plowing his field .
Well , the brothers on this date in 1908 began a series of demonstrations for the Army at Fort Myer , Virginia and the public was invited .
The demonstrations went on for several days and it took but two short weeks for the Wrights to achieve a somewhat infamous aviation record when on September 17 , Orville took Lt. Thomas E Selfridge on a ride to demonstrate the potential military value of the airplane .
A guy wire broke and got tangled in a propeller and the plane “ came down like a bird shot dead in full flight . ”
Orville shattered his hip and left leg but Selfridge was killed , going in the record book as the first aviation crash and first aviation fatality .
So Orville got to make the first flight , was the first to crash , the first to be in a fatal air crash .
Meanwhile , poor old Wilbur was the first Wright born on my birthday , the first to get typhoid fever around the time that the Titanic sunk in April 1912 and was the first Wright to die when he succumbed a month later .
Talk about bad breaks …
On this date in 1944 , a young Lieutenant pilot was recovering on a US submarine after his plane crash .
He went to to at least earn the same fame as Orville Wright .
Lt. George Bush was but 20 years old when his plane was shot down over the Pacific Ocean by enemy anti-aircraft fire .
His two crewmen were killed .
One of them was killed in the aircraft while the other bailed out with Bush .
But , only Bush ’s parachute opened .
After paddling around in a life raft for 4 hours , Lt. Bush was picked up by the USS Finback .
But the sub had other things to do and Bush spent the next month on board while the Finback continued its mission .
Bush spent his time assisting in picking up other downed pilots .
For his heroism and actions during numerous sorties ( 58 missions in 1944 alone ) Bush received the Navy ’s Distinguished Flying Cross , three Air Medals and a Unit Citation shared with the rest of the crew of the USS Jacinto .
He went on to be a Congressman , Ambassador to the UN , CIA Director , Vice - President , President of the United States and only the second former President to have a son also hold the nation ’s highest elective office .
Imagine all that the nation would have missed had the Finback not been in the area .
You never know what one good turn can lead to .
Weather Bottom Line :
High pressure that brought us such cool weather is drifting eastward .
Consequently , our humidity levels will be on the rise , though temperatures will be rising only modestly .
An upper disturbance to our southwest may be close enough to increase our rain chances some this afternoon and that type of scattered stuff will be around through the labor day weekend , though Saturday we ’ll probably be in between the shortwaves so probabilities will be lowest then .
As it is , none of the shortwaves at this time seem to be too strong nor do they track right over us so its a fair bet that you wo n’t see any rain at all through Monday … that ’s either a good thing or bad thing , depending on how you look at it .
My Sunflowers like rain .
( Adds comments from Goldman client note , background )
NEW YORK , Oct 28 ( Reuters ) - Goldman Sachs GS.N on Wednesday cut its forecast for third - quarter U.S. gross domestic product growth to 2.7 percent from 3.0 percent .
In a short client note released after the durable goods report , Goldman Sachs economists Jan Hatzius , Ed McKelvey and Andrew Tilton noted that shipments were somewhat weaker .
“ The shipments of capital goods and total durable goods inventories are the last major piece of information feeding into tomorrow ’s preliminary report on GDP growth , ” they wrote .
“ Based on this information as well as other data released in the past couple of weeks -- including complete book value inventory data for August -- we now estimate that real GDP rose at a 2.7 percent annual rate , somewhat less than the 3 percent annual rate that we had previously thought , ” they said .
Data on GDP -- a gauge of economic growth , which the government will report on Thursday , is expected to show a rise of 3.3 percent , according to 77 analysts polled by Reuters .
The day before the September jobs report , Goldman economists increased their forecast of job losses to 250,000 from 200,000 , a call that turned out to be much closer to the actual number of 263,000 .

bash $ perl - E 'use CPAN :: Config ; say $ INC {" CPAN /Config.pm " } '
/ System / Library / Perl/5.10.0/CPAN/Config.pm
' urllist ' => [ q[ file:///cpan/] , q[http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/] ] ,
CPAN is often described as Perl 's Killer App ; Modern Perl relies on it , with the perl distribution being almost considered in parts to be nothing more than a bootstrap for the rest of the language that 's out there in the cloud .
Which makes it all the more annoying when you 're stuck somewhere without an internet connection missing the vital bit of the language you need .
I just had first hand experience of being offline for a two week holiday , but I did n't have this problem when hacking on personal projects : I took CPAN with me .
So , want CPAN at your fingertips even when you 're offline ?
Yep , you 've guessed it :
There 's a CPAN module for that !
It 's called CPAN :: Mini , and it lets you create a mini-mirror of CPAN .
A mini-mirror ?
What 's that ?
It 's a mirror of just the latest non-development versions of the modules from the CPAN - or in other words , it 's a mirror of anything you can install by just typing " install " and just the module name into the cpan shell .
As I type this now this mirror weighs in at about 1.1GB , which is a fair bit smaller than the full archive .
So how do we create a mini-mirror ?
Well , first ( when you 're actually online ) you need to install the module .
Once you 've done that thecommand will be installed on your computer .
While you can pass arguments on the command line to tell it how to run , it 's easier to create afile in your home directory so you do n't have to remember what commands to type each time you want to sync your mirror .
This is what mine looks like : local : / cpan / remote : http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/
So I 've got minicpan set up to download from mirrorserver.org ( my nearest CPAN mirror on the internet when I'm in the UK ) and create files inon my hard drive .
So all that 's left is to run the cpan mirror command and watch it download .
This prints out each file as it downloads .
The first time you run this might take a while ( depending on the speed of your internet connection ) so you might want to trigger it while you 're laptop is going to be in the same place for a while with a fast internet connection ( i.e. just before you go to bed or just after you get into the office for the day . )
The second time you run this command it'll update the existing mirror .
This means that it wo n't have to download the whole 1.1GB again , just the index files and the new modules that have been released .
The module will also delete any old versions of modules that are no longer in the index ;
In the above example you can see Adam released a new version of Test : : POE : : Stopping , so CPAN :: Mini downloaded the new distribution and deleted the old distribution ( as no modules contained in the index still relied on that distribution ) .
This keeps the size of the local mirror as small as possible on disk .
There 's several ways you can configure the CPAN module to use this new local mirror , including typing commands in the CPAN shell .
However , my preferred way is to directly edit the CPAN :: Config module on the system directly .
First work out where the module containing your config is installed :
Then edit it changing the urllist parameter to contain your CPAN mirror in addition to your normal remote mirror :
This means your CPAN shell will try and install files from disk first , and if for any reason that fails ( for example , you tell it to install a development release ) it 'll go to the second mirror .
Which way round you order the mirrors depends really on how often you update your cpan mirror and personal preference .
If you , as I do , put your local mirror first this has the disadvantage that CPAN will seem " frozen " at the last time you ran minicpan , with any new changes being hidden from you until you next update .
It however means that installs are very quick compared to normal internet installs ( be you offline or not ) and it avoids having to wait for the internet connection timeout every time CPAN tries to fetch a file and fallback to the local mirror when you 're offline .
With all this done , I can now install modules in the usual way with the CPAN shell no matter if I have an internet connection or not .
Of course , I have n't yet explained how I work out what modules I should be using when I 'm offline and have n't got access to search.cpan.org .
I 'll get to that in a future blog post ...
The scheme demonstrates the worldwide revolution that mobile phones have brought to low - level finance .
In parts of Africa where infrastructure is poor , users can not only use their phones to transmit money to relatives , like conventional wire services , but are also allowed by service operators to use them as banks to store credit .
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation knows how to get things done .
On October 5 , the Foundation met with FCC broadband coordinator Blair Levin .
The purpose of that meeting was to provide a cost estimate for one of the Foundation 's ideas : running fiber optic cables to every " anchor institution " in the US — libraries , hospitals , community colleges , public schools .
By October 8 , the FCC was asking for public comment ( PDF ) on the plan and the viability of its cost estimates , which say the entire project could be completed for $ 5 - $ 10 billion .
The Gates Foundation has identified 123,000 " anchor institutions " in local communities that could make good use of fiber Internet connections .
In addition to serving the community that comes to each institution , the idea is also to run fiber into the center of every community in the country , with the goal of making it easier to then expand Internet access to homes and businesses in the community .
A rural hospital , for instance , could stick a white spaces broadband antenna on its roof , link the antenna to its fiber connection , and suddenly bring at least basic wireless connectivity to the surrounding area at minimal cost .
The Foundation admits that the cost estimate is not a complete one ; it does n't include costs for network management and upkeep , and additional backhaul costs might be needed in some areas to feed these fiber links .
In addition , the group estimates that 13 percent of libraries and 20 percent of other anchor institutions already have fiber connections .
Wiring up the rest would cost between $ 4.9 billion and $ 10.1 billion , with much the variability linked to the amount of trenching that might be involved in running the fiber .
In putting together its national broadband plan , due in February 2010 , the FCC is considering numerous ideas like this — but the quick public request for comment indicates that it is specially intrigued by the Gates Foundation proposal .
The agency wants to know by October 28 whether the cost estimates are reasonable , whether other sorts of buildings should count as " anchor institutions , " and to what extent " will providing fiber to these institutions directly assist last - mile build - out economics in currently un - or under - served areas .

( CNN ) --
The amount of money lobbyists are spending on health care reform could break records , and now that the five bills before Congress have cleared committee , that spending is expected to go into overdrive .
Lobbyists are hitting the Capitol to schmooze lawmakers .
" It is sort of a Super Bowl of lobbying for health care reform .
The lobbyists are winning so far .
But the game 's not over yet , " said Rep. Jim Cooper , D - Tennessee .
As lawmakers work to come up with a plan that can make it to President Obama 's desk , industries and interests close to the issue are digging deeper into their pockets to sway public opinion and those in office .
The insurance industry launched its first air attack with an ad aimed at seniors .
" Most people agree we need to reform health care , but is it right to ask 10 million seniors on Medicare Advantage for more than their fair share ?
Congress is proposing more than $ 100 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage , " the ad says , referring to the private insurance plan Medicare offers to some recipients .
The industry 's trade group America 's Health Insurance Plans put out the ad .
Watch more on the big bucks spent on health care lobbying »
In addition to the battle with the insurance industry , liberal reform supporters and armies of special interest groups are entering the fray .
And there 's also a ground offensive : Lobbyists hitting the Capitol to schmooze lawmakers .
Members of Congress feel they 're getting slimed .
" I rise just days before Halloween to unmask the insurance industry , " said Rep. Donna Edwards , D - Maryland .
" Now , we see the industry and their lobbyists for what they are , a little shop of horrors . "
Do n't Miss Pushback grows against insurance industry report
The health care sector has spent $ 263 million this year lobbying Congress for changes to reform plans , a government watchdog group estimates .
" This is one of the biggest lobbying pushes that we 've seen on a single issue in U.S. history , " said Dave Levinthal , communications director for the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics .
There are more than 3,000 people registered to lobby about health care , almost six lobbyists for every member of Congress .
Many of the lobbyists are former members of Congress and staffers from both sides of the aisle .
" It 's like a sports team .
If you want to put together a good team , then you 're going to have to hire some pretty big - dollar players , " Levinthal said .
Cooper , who opposed President Clinton 's health care plan in the 1990s , says President Obama put himself in a tough position when he invited the health care sector to help craft reform .
" There are a number of groups that are threatening to revolt on the White House deals and Congressional deals , " Cooper said .
Earlier this week , AHIP released a controversial study it commissioned claiming the Senate Finance Committee bill would result in premium increases of up to $ 4,000 for a family .
However , the study conducted by the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers did not take into account some of the proposed subsidies that would be offered to low - income families to help them pay for insurance , and the firm has said such provisions would offset some of the impact it estimated .
Republican leaders in Congress are quoting the study , predicting higher premiums for consumers .
But Congressional Democrats and the White House say the analysis is flawed .
Finance Committee spokesman Scott Mulhauser called the analysis " a health insurance company hatchet job -- plain and simple . "
Some top Democrats including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid are swinging back at the insurance industry .
Reid testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee , asking them to repeal an antitrust law that has given certain protections to the insurance industry and lets them reap in huge profits .
Reid 's office says the law allows insurance companies to huddle in a room and come up with rates .
They say that other than Major League Baseball , no other industry has this exemption .
If lawmakers were to repeal this law , the McCarran - Ferguson Act , it could cut into the health insurance industry 's profits .
Reid 's office says the timing of the attempts to appeal the law -- shortly after the health care industry 's report -- is just a coincidence .
The industry , however , says the McCarran Ferguson law has nothing to do with competition in the market .
" The focus on this issue is a political ploy designed to distract attention away from the real issue of rising health care costs , " the industry said in a statement .
CNN 's Kevin Bohn and Jessica Yellin contributed to this report .

TORONTO ( Reuters ) - Startup wireless carrier Globalive does not comply with Canada 's foreign ownership regulations because it is effectively under the control of its Egyptian - based financial backer , Orascom Telecom ORTE .CA , Canada 's telecom regulator said on Thursday .
The ruling deals a major blow to Globalive , which said it will now delay the launch its mobile phone service .
It had planned the service to compete against the country 's established Big Three wireless providers , BCE BCE.TO , Telus Corp T.TO and Rogers Communications RCIb .
TO .
The Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission said in a ruling that “ Orascom has the ongoing ability to determine Globalive ’s strategic decision - making activities . ”
The regulator said that Orascom owns 65.1 percent of Globalive ’s equity , has entered into a strategic technical arrangement with Globalive , and controls and holds the Wind brand under which Globalive had been set to operate .
It also holds the overwhelming majority of Globalive ’s outstanding debt .
“ The commission finds that Globalive is controlled in fact by Orascom , a non-Canadian , ” the CRTC said , and is therefore not currently eligible to operate as a telecoms carrier .
Under federal regulations , telecom companies must be majority - owned and controlled by Canadians .
Globalive spent more than C$ 442 million ( $ 413.1 million ) on buying wireless spectrum in a government auction held last year .
Orascom provided Globalive with financial backing that is estimated to total more than $ 500 million .
“ We are ready to bring competition to the market , ” Ken Campbell , chief executive of Globalive ’s Wind Mobile , said in a statement late on Thursday .
“ We will be evaluating our options on how to proceed . ”
Rogers , BCE and Telus had argued that Globalive ’s structure and Orascom ’s investment mean the company is effectively controlled by foreigners .
“ I do n’t think the CRTC had any choice , ” said Ken Engelhart , vice - president of regulatory affairs at Rogers .
“ This set of facts is so clearly indicating foreign ownership that I do n’t think the CRTC could have done anything different . ”
Telus Corp had a similar response and added it thinks the decision does not hamper competition on Canada ’s wireless landscape .
“ It is important to note that this decision does not prevent Globalive or any other new wireless company from competing in Canada or accessing capital , ” said Michael Hennessy , Telus ’s senior vice - president of regulatory and government affairs .
“ It merely means they must abide by Canada ’s laws . ”
To try to appease regulatory concerns about the influence that Orascom could wield over Globalive , the carrier altered its shareholder agreement with Orascom and made other changes to its structure .
Globalive also said that the federal Industry Ministry had found its shareholder arrangements to be in compliance with Canadian ownership rules .

As demonstrations go , it was more of a lighthearted affair than a threat to the nation .
About 600 climate change campaigners had gathered outside the Drax power station in North Yorkshire .
They had chosen to demonstrate there because the huge plant is the UK 's biggest emitter of carbon .
The protesters were mainly families with young children , accompanied by clowns , cyclists , baton twirlers and , according to some reports , a giant ostrich puppet .
It was not completely without incident .
Two protesters climbed a lighting pylon at the edge of the site and four others broke through the fence .
About 30 others were arrested for public order offences .
Under the heading of " not much a fight , more like a festival " , the Guardian reported that the predicted battle between the police and activists wanting to close the plant down had not materialised .
It was the type of demonstration which has been going on for decades in Britain .
But the police appear to have had another , completely different view of the 2006 protest .
After the demonstration , the first in what has become an annual gathering known as Climate Camp , North Yorkshire police conducted a review along with government officials .
Internal papers obtained by the Guardian show they called it " the first time domestic extremism took place against national infrastructure in the county " .
The term " domestic extremism " is now common currency within the police .
It is a phrase which shapes how forces seek to control demonstrations .
It has led to the personal details and photographs of a substantial number of protesters being stored on secret police databases around the country .
There is no official or legal definition of the term .
Instead , the police have made a vague stab at what they think it means .
Senior officers describe domestic extremists as individuals or groups " that carry out criminal acts of direct action in furtherance of a campaign .
These people and activities usually seek to prevent something from happening or to change legislation or domestic policy , but attempt to do so outside of the normal democratic process . "
They say they are mostly associated with single issues and suggest the majority of protesters are never considered extremists .
Police insist they are just monitoring the minority who could damage property or commit aggravated trespass , causing significant disruption to lawful businesses .
Activists respond by claiming this is an excuse that gives police the licence to carry out widespread surveillance of whole organisations that are a legitimate part of the democratic process .
They also warn that the categorisation carries echoes of the cold war , when the security services monitored constitutional campaigns such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Anti-Apartheid Movement because alleged subversives or communists were said to be active within them , although they said the organisations themselves were not subversive .
The domestic extremist term was coined by police involved in tackling criminals involved in animal rights groups sometime between 2001 and 2004 .
Many of these activists were prepared to resort to violence to promote their aims , most notoriously digging up a grandmother 's grave .
The police were successful in jailing many of the animal rights campaigners who were committing crimes .
However , there are fears the police 's domestic extremism apparatus , which evolved to counter sometimes violent criminals , is now looking for new targets to justify both its budgets and its existence .
There are three little - known organisations at the heart of this apparatus .
They work in tandem under the direction of Anton Setchell , who is national co-ordinator for domestic extremism for the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) .
The main branch is the National Public Order Intelligence Unit ( NPOIU ) , essentially a giant database of protest groups and protesters in the country .
Housed at a secret location in London , its purpose is " to gather , assess , analyse and disseminate intelligence and information relating to criminal activities in the United Kingdom where there is a threat of crime or to public order which arises from domestic extremism or protest activity " .
Police in England and Wales collect intelligence on individuals and then feed it to the NPOIU which , Setchell said , " can read across " all the forces ' intelligence and deliver back to them " coherent " assessments .
Setchell said the " fair proportion " of the intelligence comes from Special Branch officers and police who monitor and photograph demonstrations .
Sensitive information from informants in protest groups and covert intercepts are handled by a section of the NPOIU called the Confidential Intelligence Unit .
The NPOIU database consists of entries indexed by descriptions of people , nicknames or pseudonyms .
Originally it was confined to animal rights groups , but was expanded in 1999 to " include all forms of domestic extremism , criminality and public disorder associated with cause - led groups " .
It contains some information supplied by companies that hire private investigators to spy on protesters , sometimes by infiltration .
Setchell argued that there were robust safeguards to protect the human rights of individuals on the database .
He said it was possible that protesters with no criminal record were on the databases , but police would have to give a justified reason .
" Just because you have no criminal record does not mean that you are not of interest to the police , " he said .
" Everyone who has got a criminal record did not have one once . "
The second part of Acpo's triumvirate , the National Extremism Tactical Co-ordination Unit ( Netcu ) , helps police forces , companies , universities and other bodies that are on the receiving end of protest campaigns .
Netcu 's job is to give " security advice , risk assessments and information that can minimise disruption and keep their employees safe " .
Its head , Superintendent Steve Pearl , says his 16 - strong unit works with police forces across the country , keeps detailed files on protest groups , rather than individuals , and liaises with thousands of companies in aviation , energy , research , farming and retail .
Netcu was set up in Huntingdon , Cambridgeshire in 2004 by the Home Office which , Pearl said , was " getting really pressurised by big business – pharmaceuticals in particular , and the banks – that they were not able to go about their lawful business because of the extreme criminal behaviour of some people within the animal rights movement . "
Pearl denied the unit was engaged in mission creep but admitted that environmental protesters had now been brought " more on their radar " as they had been " shutting down airports , and shutting down coal - fired power stations , more recently stopping coal trains , hijacking coal trains and ships in the river Medway . "
The third leg of the trio , the National Domestic Extremism Team , was set up in 2005 and consists of detectives who help police forces around the UK .
Initially , the team focused on animal rights activists , but has fanned out to look at any crimes " linked to single issue - type causes and campaigns " , Setchell said .
The team draws on intelligence from the NPOIU database and , the Guardian has learned , is located on the seventh floor of 10 Victoria Street in central London , a building previously occupied by the Department of Trade and Industry .

The FSF is launching a new advocacy campaign , and we'd love to have you involved .
One of the most important tasks for us at the FSF is to help foster the understanding that free software is crucial to a free society , and that citizens should switch to free software at home and in their own work , for freedom 's sake .
But in many ways , most of this work has always been done by the millions of free software users around the world , telling others why they care about free software and what they use it for .
So , why not make all that energy , specificity , and persuasion part of our message to the world on FSF.org ?
And what better way to do it than with videos from free software supporters , published using free formats and an exciting new free standard for online video ?
At the Women in Free Software Summit and the Boston celebration of Software Freedom Day 2009 , FSF volunteer Dana Moser roved the event asking participants the following questions , and making videos of the responses ( video links below ) :
The responses came out great , but that 's just the beginning .
We 'd like you to submit your own video , and invite friends to do the same !
It only takes five minutes .
You can do it with your phone , your digital camera , or your webcam .
If you 'd like to record a second video in a language other than English , that 's great too !
Thanks to everyone who participated in the " beta " videos :
Harley Amundsen , Jasimin Huang , Tal Schechter , Sven Vilomp , Joe Cornelli , Joe Fineman , Sara Adelaida McIntire , Leslie Hawthorn , Donald Robertson , Clara Raubertas , Christine Peters , Hannah Wallach , Fumiki Yuguchi , Nate Aune , Christine Spang , Steve Revilak
On a related note :
We 've been collecting written testimonials for a while .

Just to refresh your memory about the full extent of Jamie Leigh Jones ' nightmare , thanks to ohcanada in the comments for posting this description from todays '
Guardian :
In legal papers Jones , who was 20 at the time , says she was fed a knockout drug while drinking with KBR firefighters .
" When she awoke the next morning still affected by the drug , she found her body naked and severely bruised , with lacerations to her vagina and anus , blood running down her leg , her breast implants ruptured and her pectoral muscles torn‚ which would later require reconstructive surgery .
Upon walking to the rest room , she passed out again , " the papers say .
Jones was treated by a US army doctor who gave forensic evidence to company officials .
She says the firm placed her under guard in a shipping container and she was released only after her father asked the US embassy to intervene .
When the forensic evidence was handed to investigators two years later , crucial photographs and notes were missing .
Jones says she identified one of the men who attacked her after he confessed , but that Halliburton / KBR prevented her from taking legal action against him or the company by pointing to a clause in her contract requiring disputes to go to arbitration .
...
KBR has sought to discredit Jones 's account by saying she was seen drinking and flirting with a firefighter before leaving the gathering with him , and that the man claims to have had consensual sex with her .
The firm denies that Jones was held prisoner , but not that her injuries indicated serious sexual assault .
I was originally intending on simply reposting the diary as is , with the hope of a second shot at the Rec List ( update : and thank you for that ! ) , but another development caught my eye tonight , and seems to provide a perfect contrast to Sen.
Franken .
I 'm referring to this :
Sensitivity Training : GOP Senator Batters Witness Over Domestic Violence Report After the Huffington
Post reported that eight states still allow insurance companies to treat domestic violence as a precondition , leaders from three of those declared that they would put an end to the practice .
North Carolina Republican Senator Richard Burr took a different approach and instead challenged the head of the organization , the National Women 's Law Center , that issued the original report at a Senate hearing Thursday .
Burr 's reaction was the polar opposite of Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney , who told the Jackson Free Press after the story broke that he was ashamed that his state was on the list .
Read the whole thing for the backstory , but then make sure to come back here so you can watch the two Senators ' performances side by side .
Note :
The first clip , of Sen .
Franken grilling a KBR lawyer , is 10 minutes long , but trust me -- watch the whole thing for the full impact .
Chilling stuff .
So .
In one case , you have a U.S. Senator tearing apart a guy for trying to defend the gang rape , battery and imprisonment of a young woman .
In the other case , you have a U.S. Senator tearing apart a woman for trying to help domestic violence victims get medical attention .
( It probably goes without saying that the second Senator , Richard Burr ( R- NC ) , was one of the 30 GOP Rape Defenders who voted against the Franken amendment . )
If you ever needed a crystal clear example of the difference between the Democratic and Republican parties , I 'd say these two videos are it .
PS
If you 're looking for a darkly satirical , but disturbingly accurate overview of today 's GOP , I recommend checking out the new parody (? ) site Republicans for Rape .
Update : I should also have included a link to the Jamie Leigh Foundation
Update x2 : To expand on the diary somewhat , while it may be blatantly obvious to most of us here , there are those who have been trying to defend the " No " votes against the Franken amendment .
In case anyone asks about what possible justification there might have been for voting against this amendment , there are only two :
If the amendment was attached to some totally unrelated larger bill which you were against , and the only way to vote against the bill as a whole was to vote against this amendment ( which happens in many cases ) .
if the wording of the bill was too vague or open to massive abuse ( the " unintended consequences " issue ) .
HOWEVER , in this case , you could vote for the amendment and still vote against the main bill ( which is actually a DoD spending bill anyway , not the sort of thing Republicans are going to be against as a rule ) , and the actual , full text of the amendment is VERY specific and narrow ( bottom right of page S10069 ) :
Sec. 8104 . ( a ) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act may be used for any existing or new Federal contract if the contractor or a subcontractor at any tier requires that an employee or independent contractor , as a condition of employment , sign a contract that mandates that the employee or independent contractor performing work under the contract or subcontract resolve through arbitration any claim under title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 or any tort related to or arising out of sexual assault or harassment , including assault and battery , intentional infliction of emotional distress , false imprisonment , or negligent hiring , supervision , or retention .
In other words , it specifically covers :
-- Violations of core civil rights
-- Rape
-- Assault
-- Torture
-- Kidnapping
-- Knowingly ( or being criminally negligent about ) hiring sick , sadistic , twisted rapist / murderer types
These are all criminal actions which have absolutely NO business being dealt with via arbitration , which is intended for disputes over intellectual property , compensation , nondisclosure of corporate secrets , that sort of thing .
In addition , this amendment does n't force the companies abandon contracts with these provisions -- it simply says that the Federal Government of the United States refuses to do businesses with those businesses that continue to do so .
Halliburton is still free to do business with other corporations if they wish ; they just lost their single biggest client , that 's all .
In this particular case , there are exactly zero legitimate reasons to vote against it .
Christ , they could have at least abstained or something ( for the record , 2 Democrats did n't vote at all due to illness or scheduling conflicts ) .
Update x3 : Here 's Jon Stewart 's take on it :
Update x4 : If you think you can stand to read more on the issue of sexual assault , PLEASE read Clytemnestra 's diary , When all is made hostile ; a story of sexual assault .
Update x5 : For those without video , special thanks to Britkid for adding in a full transcript of the Franken clip .
The diary is too long for me to paste it in directly , but you can read it in the comments below .
I have it set to load in a separate window so you wo n't lose the rest of the diary .
Update x6 : I just wanted to formally apologize for the first poll choice .
As several people have pointed out in the comments , women staying with partners who abuse them is a complicated matter , with more than one reason , and it 's inappropriate to try and compare the two situations , even out of bitter snark .
Unfortunately there does n't appear to be any way of deleting a poll that 's been voted on without deleting the entire diary .
I 've apologized for the poll several times in the comments .
This is the last time I 'll do so .
Update x7 : I just wanted to say an obligatory thank you to everyone -- I know I was pushing hard for this to hit the Rec list , but I 'm still overwhelmed by the response once it finally did .
In addition , I should note that the story made it to the FRONT PAGE OF DIGG earlier this evening ... although , oddly enough , it was yesterday 's original posting ( which did n't include the Richard Burr footage ) which made it big on DIGG .
Strange , but that 's fine as long as the Franken clip goes viral .
Anyway , thanks again .
God Bless Al Franken and Jamie Leigh Jones , and may God not have mercy on the souls of the rapists , the KBR supervisors , the KBR executives , the 30 GOP Senators who voted NO on the amendment , and the douchebag attorney who were responsible for these atrocities in the first place .
SAN FRANCISCO --
A majority of Californians in recent polls say the state should legalize marijuana .
What pot proponents can't agree on is how soon voters will really be ready to approve legalization .
A schism has emerged among California 's pot-legalization advocates .
On one side are those pushing to get a proposition to voters quickly , including activists such as Richard Lee , who last month began collecting signatures to put a pot-legalization measure on the state 's November 2010 ballot .

A motorist filmed deliberately driving through a puddle and splashing children at a bus stop in Devon faces prosecution for inconsiderate driving .
Police received complaints after the 30 - second clip , which includes an excited commentary from the passenger , was posted on YouTube .
The clip was shot inside a car being driven down Weston Mill Hill , Plymouth .
It has since been removed from YouTube .
Police said the driver had voluntarily contacted them and may be prosecuted .
The Road Traffic
Act contains an offence of " careless , and inconsiderate , driving " and , according to Crown Prosecution Service policy , that could include driving through a puddle to splash bystanders .
' Real danger '
Courts may impose fines of up to £ 2,500 for such an offence .
A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said : " Deliberately splashing people by driving through a big puddle could mean that the motorist was driving without reasonable consideration for other road users .
" There is also the real danger that by driving through deep water this could cause the driver of the vehicle to lose control and could result in a road traffic collision .
" People involved in this practice could find themselves prosecuted and points put on their licence . "
In 2005 a Somerset motorist who soaked a workman by driving through a puddle admitted a charge of driving without due consideration and was fined £ 150 and given three penalty points by magistrates in Yeovil .
After years of suffering through dull lab safety videos , a group of Berkeley students have made a film that could spare a younger generation from watching humorless people with 80's hair explain the dangers of wearing open - toed shoes while working with chemicals .
Their music video evokes the Muppets while conveying several important messages that can keep kids from getting hurt .
" Lab safety has been a real issue recently , " said Patrick Bennett , who directed and edited the short film .
" And a few high chemistry school teachers we knew were interested in showing stuff like the nano song in their classes . "
Late last year , a UCLA lab technician was fatally wounded when a plastic syringe filled with tert - butyl lithium , which ignites upon exposure to air , broke and sprayed the flammable liquid all over her .
That incident sparked a great deal of interest among chemists in updating their safety training materials .
After Bennett 's group of musicians , songwriters , and puppeteers won several awards for making an educational video about nanotechnology , they turned their attention to preventing tragic accidents .
Producing their next clip took more than four months .
" The music writing took quite a while , I heard the first cut back in July , " Bennett said .
" The video itself we filmed in mid September and did n't finish till last week . "

“ It ’s so unfair ” is one of the first morally - based complaints that children make , and as adults , unfairness can get our hackles up .
Even some animals seem to have a sense of fairness .
Some versions of liberal theory treat fairness as the most fundamental political value .
But fairness is a highly contested concept , fraught with ambiguity and should not be the basis of liberal political theory .
Is it fair that Alex Rodriquez makes millions of dollars but people equally talented and far more useful to society earn a fraction of his salary ?
According to one meaning of “ fairness ” there is nothing unfair about Rodriquez ’s salary .
If by “ fair ” we mean that rules are applied equally to everyone , then assuming A - Rod and the Yankees freely entered into their contract , both parties are playing by the rules of contractual agreement — every other player and team has the same opportunity to negotiate .
Fairness understood as “ equally subject to rules ” is an important value but it is limited because the rules themselves may be unfair .
One might argue that a compensation scheme that permits the marginally more talented Rodriquez to earn an astronomically higher salary than other players is itself unfair ; or that a compensation scheme that pays a talented entertainer or athlete more than a doctor or teacher is unfair .
The intuition behind this kind of judgment is that fairness is tied to what one deserves .
If we base what someone deserves on their contribution to society then Rodriquez probably does n’t deserve his salary .
But what is the proper basis for what philosophers call desert claims ?
One dominant strand of liberalism has a general answer to this question .
We deserve a distribution of goods based on our efforts and choices .
But since none of us choose our families or genetic heritage , and how we do in life is dependent on such factors that are outside our control , it is not obvious that we deserve anything .
Rodriquez was just lucky to have the genetic endowment and developmental opportunities he had .
But his birthright is not deserved ; and neither is that of someone disadvantaged by birth .
This entails that a society based on fairness , on what people deserve , should compensate people for their bad luck , since they do n’t deserve their fate , and such a society should refuse to excessively compensate the fortunate because they do n’t deserve their advantages .
But this is a problem for liberalism because : ( 1 ) it is counter - intuitive from the standpoint of common sense , and thus citizens will resist it .
Most people are morally bothered only by intentional unfairness .
We seem to accept unfairness when it is a matter of luck but do n’t like it when someone is stacking the deck against us , and ( 2 ) such a compensation scheme will crowd out other things we value .
Sometimes getting good outcomes requires that we tolerate unfairness .
It may be unfair that talented , diligent workers are laid off in times of economic contraction but it may be necessary to save the firm .
It may be unfair to put federal money into saving Wall St. bankers while more deserving people lost out in the financial collapse .
But doing so may have saved the financial system .
Enhancing the capabilities and resources of the already talented and successful will sometimes produce goods that benefit everyone even though that seems unfair to the less gifted who may be denied those resources .
Achievement is likely only under conditions where people who are already fortunate are allowed to continue to flourish .
Regardless of how many resources we devote to it , we can never prevent bad luck from influencing outcomes without disabling the fortunate which is itself a morally monstrous thing to do .
Life is n’t fair .
But there is not much we can do about that .
How then should liberals think about treatment of the disadvantaged ?
What is morally disturbing is not that one person might have been lucky in life ’s lottery and another less fortunate — rather it is morally disturbing that some person has too few resources and capabilities to lead a decent life .
It is more important to arrange social institutions to enable the less fortunate to flourish than it is to ensure fairness or equality .
We should aim at improving the condition of the worst off , not because their condition is unfair , but because we are concerned about their welfare .
Compassion not fairness is the foundation of liberalism .
We cannot disentangle questions of fairness from questions of what one deserves .
But determining what one deserves requires separating out good or bad fortune from what one is genuinely responsible for — and this is an impossible task .
None of us really know where our capabilities , personality or character traits come from .
What is clear is that , for the most part , we did n’t choose them .
Thus , aiming at the fair outcome involves us in lots of contentious , unanswerable questions .
It lacks moral clarity and allows conservatives to co-opt the moral high ground by injecting questions about deservingness into any discussion about the distribution of resources .
The current dustup about illegal immigrants receiving health care is an example of how excessive focus on fairness harms liberalism .
It would be far better for all of us if illegal immigrants received health insurance , since they would be less susceptible to disease , more productive , and less a burden on emergency services .
Conservatives rail that they do n’t deserve it — and conservatives are right .
They probably do n’t .
But that should be irrelevant ; compassion and a concern for our collective health should be the over - riding response .
But one reason why what one deserves continues to be relevant is because liberals keep insisting on the foundational importance of fairness .

Elected by her neighbors ( the Constitution breaks from British tradition by requiring that members of Congress be drawn from specific constituencies with which they are familiar and in which they reside ) , Olympia Snowe has an obligation to consider the perspectives of those she represents .
Further , because ours is a representative , rather than direct , democracy , she has an obligation to evaluate as carefully as possible the options before her and to do , in the end , what she thinks is right ( she need not follow her constituents ' wishes if she concludes that they are not in the best interests of the nation she has vowed to serve ; her obligation is to hear them out and take their views into account ) .
So long as the decision she reaches is constitutionally permitted , she will then have done her duty .
In this hyperpartisan world , however , some seem to believe her duty is neither to conscience nor constituent but rather to party .
And thus there is some grumbling among her Republican colleagues and suggestions that she should be denied a committee leadership position she would otherwise be entitled to claim on the basis of her Senate seniority .
The party that drove Arlen Specter from its ranks because he believed he owed the nation his best considered judgment rather than fealty to a political club now weighs whether to turn its betrayal - obsessed wrath on yet another in its circle .
Here 's the thing .
One campaigns as a member of a party ( Madison 's warnings against parties -- permanent factions -- having been long since disregarded ) but on election steps across an invisible line and becomes not a representative of a political faction but a part of the government sworn to serve the nation 's interests rather than the cause of partisan advantage .
That may lead one to vote for or against a proposition , but for reasons other than , and far more important than , the desire to be true to one 's team .
Olympia
Snowe is guilty of no more than having taken her oath of office seriously .
It 's something more of her colleagues should try .

Epigraph
This morning I was born in a yurt at the edge of a horse - plain in a land of a planet which no longer exists .
Tomorrow I will be born someone else in another place .
I have not yet chosen .
This morning , though - ahhh .
this life !
When my eyes had learned to focus , I looked out at sunshine on trampled grass and I saw vigorous people going about the sweet activities of their lives .
Where ... oh where has all of that vigor gone ?

The US space agency ( Nasa ) has launched a prototype rocket designed to replace the ageing space shuttle .
The Ares I - X blasted off from Florida on a flight that will test technology for the development of a future manned launch vehicle .
The 100 m - tall , syringe - like rocket roared into the sky at 1530 GMT from Nasa 's Kennedy Space Center .
The stick - thin launcher is the first Nasa has built in more than three decades , but its future is uncertain .
The $ 450 m ( 300 m euros ; £ 275 m )
Ares I - X is what Nasa describes as a " Pathfinder " vehicle .
It was designed to climb about 40 km ( 25 miles ) into the sky during the powered phase of its two - minute flight .
The I - X carried more than 700 sensors to measure vehicle aerodynamics , controls and performance of the rocket 's first stage .
" This is a huge step forward for Nasa 's exploration goals , " said Doug Cooke , an associate administrator at the space agency 's headquarters in Washington DC .
" Ares I - X provides Nasa with an enormous amount of data that will be used to improve the design and safety of the next generation of American spaceflight vehicles - vehicles that could again take humans beyond low Earth orbit . "
The top half of the rocket is a dummy .
What would be an upper stage , with a crew capsule and its emergency escape mechanism , is actually a simulator made to the correct shape and weight .
After the two portions separated , parachutes were expected to open up , dropping the booster into the Atlantic , where recovery ships were waiting to retrieve it .
The upper , dummy portion of the rocket fell uncontrolled into the ocean and was destroyed on impact .
These parts were not intended to be recovered .
Lightning strikes
The rocket was scheduled to launch on Tuesday , but the attempt had to be scrubbed due in part to bad weather .
Forecasters gave only a 40 % chance of acceptable weather for Wednesday 's launch attempt .
Controllers had to wait for interfering clouds to clear , finally launching the I - X three - and - a - half hours into its lift - off window .
Cameras caught the moment of separation
The rocket systems had to be re-tested after more than 150 lightning strikes were reported around the launch pad overnight .
A recent report has cast doubt on the future of the Ares programme .
The Augustine panel , which had been asked to review the US human spaceflight programme , published its report on 22 October .
Although the panel supported the Ares I - X test flight , it questioned the need to develop the launch vehicle .
In particular , the panel queried the cost and design of the craft as well as its development time .
The decision on the future of the Ares I and the rest of the Constellation programme now rests with President Barack Obama who is expected to give a response in coming weeks .

You floss regularly , yield to oncoming traffic and use your credit cards judiciously , dutifully paying off your balance every month .
You may believe that your exemplary behavior shields you from unexpected credit card fees .
Sadly , that is no longer the case .
Starting next year , Bank of America will charge a small number of customers an annual fee , ranging from $ 29 to $ 99 .
The bank has characterized the fee as experimental .
But card holders who have never carried a balance or paid late fees could be among those affected .
NEW RULE PROPOSED : Fed wants banks to get customer OK to pay debit card , ATM overdrafts
Citigroup , meanwhile , has started charging annual fees to card holders who do n't put more than a specific amount on their cards , typically $ 2,400 a year .
Other banks are charging inactivity fees if customers do n't use their credit cards during a specific period of time .
You heard that right :
You could be spanked for staying out of debt .
These fees are the credit card industry 's response to credit card legislation that will , among other things , restrict credit card issuers ' ability to raise interest rates on existing balances .
Credit card issuers are looking for ways to raise income before the new rules take effect in February .
During the first quarter , 27 % of credit card offers included annual fees , up from 18 % a year earlier , according to Synovate Mail Monitor , a credit card direct - mail tracking service .
Curtis Arnold , founder of CardRatings.com , says he expected credit card issuers to raise annual fees after the legislation was enacted .
What he did n't expect , he says , " was that good customers were going to be hit . "
Fortunately , if you 've paid off your balance on time every month , you probably have a good credit score .
And when you have good credit , you have more choices .
What to do if your card issuer starts charging an annual fee — or increases the fee you 're already paying :
• Call and complain .
Check your credit score first to make sure you 're on solid ground , says Adam Levin , founder of Credit.com , a consumer website .
If you have a good score and you 've been a good customer , the lender may be willing to waive the fee to keep your business .
• Weigh the benefits of rewards against the annual fee .
The days when you could get a rewards card with no annual fee are numbered , Arnold says .
If your rewards card charges a fee , you 'll need to figure out whether the value of the rewards exceeds the fee .
That 's not always easy to do , particularly with cards that give you airline miles , says Chris Fichera , associate editor for Consumer Reports .
Rewards miles often come with restrictions and expiration dates , making it difficult to figure out how much they 're worth , he says .
" A lot of airline cards are not the best deal unless you can combine them with a frequent - flier plan , " Fichera adds .
If you 're not a frequent flier , Fichera says , you 're probably better off using a card that gives you cash back .
As long as you can estimate how much you spend , it 's easy to figure out whether you 'll get enough cash back to justify the annual fee .
• Leave .
If your card issuer wo n't waive the fee , you 'll have a choice :
Pay the annoying fee or close your account .
Unfortunately , this decision is n't as clear - cut as it sounds , because closing an account could hurt your credit score .
One of the factors used to calculate your credit score is what 's known as the " credit utilization ratio , " which is based on the amount of credit you have outstanding as a percentage of your total available credit .
When you close a credit card account , the amount of your total available credit shrinks , which could lead to a higher utilization rate .
This ratio accounts for 30 % of your credit score .
In addition , closing an account you 've owned a long time could affect your credit history , another factor used to calculate your score , Fichera says .
Still , if you are n't carrying balances on your other accounts and the card is relatively new , closing your account is worth considering .
Even now , there are good deals out there , particularly for card holders with good credit , Arnold says .
For example , the Fidelity Rewards American Express card pays 2 % of cash back to a Fidelity account , with no limits on cash rewards and no annual fee .
If you do n't care about rewards and just want a credit card that does n't charge an annual fee , consider applying for a card through a credit union .
Many credit union cards charge no annual fee and offer below - average interest rates .
Associations , such as the USAA , which provides products and services for military personnel and their families , also offer good deals on credit cards , according to Consumer Reports .

Let me start with a rounded version of the Rudebusch version of the Taylor rule :
Fed funds target = 2 + 1.5 x inflation – 2 x excess unemployment
where inflation is measured by the change in the core PCE deflator over the past four quarters ( currently 1.6 ) , and excess unemployment is the different between the CBO estimate of the NAIRU ( currently 4.8 ) and the actual unemployment rate ( currently 9.8 ) .
Right now , this rule says that the Fed funds rate should be - 5.6 % .
So we ’re hard up against the zero bound .
Suppose that core inflation stays at 1.6 % ( although in fact it ’s almost sure to go lower . )
Then we can back out the unemployment rate at which the target would cross zero , suggesting that tightening should begin : it ’s an excess unemployment rate of 2.2 , implying an actual rate of 7 percent .
That ’s a long way from here .
If inflation drops to , say , 1 percent , the Fed should n’t tighten until unemployment drops to 6.25 % .
What would it take to get to that range of unemployment ?
Okun ’s
Law suggests that it takes 2 points of GDP growth in excess of potential to reduce unemployment by 1 point .
Potential growth is probably around 2.5 .
So say we have 5 percent growth for the next 2 years — which would be hailed as a stunning boom .
Even so , unemployment should fall only 2.5 points , to 7.3 .
In other words , even with a really strong recovery ( which almost nobody expects ) , the Fed should keep rates on hold for at least two years .
Bear in mind that I ’m using entirely standard , conventional analysis here .
It ’s the people saying that the Fed should start tightening in the near future who are inventing some kind of new , unspecified framework to justify their views .
Israel M. Gelfand , one of the giants of 20th - century mathematics , whose work cleared paths for other thinkers in fields as diverse as physics and medical imaging , died on Monday in New Brunswick , N.J. He was 96 .
The death , at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital , was confirmed by his wife , Tatiana .
Dr. Gelfand did not achieve fame from attacking and solving famous , intractable problems .
Instead , he was a pioneer in untrodden mathematical fields , laying the foundation and creating tools for others to use .
“ People always compare him with great mathematicians like Euler or Hilbert or Poincaré , ” said Vladimir Retakh , a professor of mathematics at Rutgers , where Dr. Gelfand spent most of his time as a visiting professor after leaving the Soviet Union in 1989 .
Dr. Retakh said Vladimir Arnold , a prominent Russian mathematician , had contrasted the approaches of the Soviet Union ’s two most famous mathematicians 
Dr. Gelfand and Andrei Kolmogorov , who was Dr. Gelfand ’s thesis adviser  with a travel analogy .

A common claim I ’ve come across is that , all - in - all , the major religions , and the major non-religious bodies of thought , preach the same ethical message .
That if you push beyond the superficialities , and focus on ethics rather than on metaphysics , we get a very similar message coming from all of them ( and , it is suggested , that message is quite a good one that ‘ we ’ the modern sceptical observers should accept ) .
In certain senses this is true ( i.e. , if you select the right sources to make them agree ) but in certain senses I often think it ’s the opposite of the truth .
I want to supply one of the supporting documents for this latter case .
Most people are familiar with ‘ the Seven Deadly Sins ’ , a list of character traits that would lead to damnation , which circulated in various forms for much of Christian history .
A notable feature of this meme is the relative importance it accords to the sins .
In almost every version Pride is considered the original and most serious of the seven deadly sins , and indeed the ultimate source from which the others arise ( this parallels the association of pride with Lucifer , from whose actions other sins came ) .
This is n’t a particular unfortunate action that can be hand - waved away .
This is a cultural item that was developed and preserved over centuries and remains widely recognised .
It can probably claim more widespread assent than most other non-obvious Christian ethical claims .
That seems to be partly a psychological claim ( that when people act wrongly , it usually stems ultimately from an over - high opinion of themselves ) , and partly an ethical claim ( that this is what is most objectionable in a human being ) .
Note , this is not just the ( perfectly reasonable , and obviously correct ) awareness that sometimes , and in certain senses , pride is a major failing , a vice , and a source for other vices .
It is explicitly an over - all claim : that , all - in - all , esteeming oneself too highly is the single biggest cause of vice , and the single most serious vice .
Is the psychological claim true ?
I do n’t think so ; I happen to think it ’s the opposite of the truth .
Of course there are more than one meanings that one can give to ‘ thinking highly of oneself ’ , but all - in - all I think that wrong acts and personal failings more often stem from a lack of self - esteem , a sense of emptiness , inferiority , weakness and worthlessness .
All - in - all I think that people who feel better about themselves are more likely to act rightly , to have strength of will , to make sacrifices for others .
I also think that this is the belief of many of the most influential figures in the history of psychology .
Perhaps I ’m wrong .
But there is at least a substantial difference here .
What about the directly ethical claim : that pride is more objectionable than other vices ?
Again , I do n’t believe that , and I doubt I ’m alone in that .
I see nothing obviously worse about pride than , say , habitual violent anger , cruelty , apathy , wilful ignorance , or other vices .
Of course , that might be a result of me having a particularly high opinion of myself ( to quote Blackadder , ‘ I try not to fly in the face of popular opinion ’ ) , which might blind me to recognising its seriousness – indeed , the opinion might even be cited as evidence of my vice .
But this runs both ways .
If a tolerant attitude towards pride might be a result of vice , so too might be a severe attitude .
Someone might hate pride because they are so invested in degrading themselves before something , so emotionally bound up with self - hatred that they are unhappy seeing others not bowing down .
We might find ourselves wondering which way to go .
Maybe our understanding of this Christian meme will be improved by looking at its expression in popular culture .
Hence I submit for consideration : Cenodoxus .
In this extremely popular 17th - century play , we are introduced to a polymathic doctor who , to all appearances , is the sort of person that everyone should aspire to be : kind , learned , restrained , wise , generous , who has devoted his life to helping others , and is respected and loved by all who know him .
This man dies , and during the saying of the last rites his corpse is heard to cry out .
Each of the three times the priest says ‘ Cenodoxus was a good man ’ , the body exclaims : first that he has been accused , then that he has been found guilty , then that he has been damned , and is to be tortured .
Why ?
For the sin of pride .
For how long ?
For a billion years , and then billions more after that .
I wo n’t say much about this , except to say that it sounds like it should be satire , and that it clearly illustrates that to a certain religious mindset , there seems to be quite literally nothing that can be imagined so appalling and barbaric that God might not do it and be praised for doing it .
Should we give the benefit of the doubt to this sort of Christian civilisation ?
Should we presume that when it says what appear to be false and loathsome things , and what will clearly be interpreted as such by a naive listener , it actually has an unobjectionable and intelligent meaning in mind ?
Should we , that is , resolve that no matter what the words we read are , we shall presume good faith and virtue on the part of the person or culture that wrote them ?
We could if we want , but would n’t it be more efficient to just not read the words in the first place ?
If we take it that over centuries , the Christian church had a chance to express what it actually meant , and that when it says that the worst failing is to respect yourself too much , and doing so may earn you trillions of trillions of years of dismemberment , however much you help others and improve yourself , they meant that – then there ’s a distinctive ethical position here which is diametrically opposed to an alternative ethical position which , thankfully , many people subscribe to .
Of course , that position is n’t “ The Christian Position ’ .
There are many ways to extract a message from Christianity , and many standards to judge which is most reasonable .
But the fact that what is arguably the historically most significant of the Christian cultures has so reliably promoted this view of pride as the worst sin , does at least make it impossible for any contrasting view to be presented as ‘ the Christian message ’ or Christian ethics ’ in any simple way .

A court ruling today affirmed science writer Simon Singh ’s right to free expression .
It grants him leave to appeal Mr Justice Eady ’s ruling against him in a libel action brought by the British Chiropractic Association , reports Padraig Reidy
Popular science writer Simon Singh has been granted leave to appeal in the libel action brought against him by the British Chiropractic Association .
In a scathing rebuttal of Mr Justice Eady ’s previous judgement in the case , Lord Justice Laws said Eady had risked swinging the balance of rights too far in favour of the right to reputation and against the right to free expression .
Lord Justice Laws described Eady ’s judgement , centred on Singh ’s use of the word “ bogus ” in an article published by the Guardian newspaper , as “ legally erroneous ” .
Laws also pointed out that Eady ’s judgement had conflated two issues — the meaning of the phrases complained of , and the issue of whether the article was presented as fact or fair comment .
Laws said there was “ no question ” of the “ good faith ” of Singh in writing the article , as the matter was “ clearly in the public interest ” .
Speaking after the judgement , Singh told Index on Censorship this was the “ best possible result ” .
“ But I try not to get my hopes up , ” he continued .
“ We have only won leave to appeal .
Now we must convince the court of appeal on the issue of meaning .
There is a long battle ahead .
Reform of English libel laws , particularly the right to a public interest defence and a fairer costs structure , are vital . ”
The BCA was not represented at this morning ’s hearing .

German chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday waded into the row over Google 's plans to build a massive digital library .
The move was a remarkable intervention from a leading world politician in a growing dispute about the threat posed by the internet , and Google in particular , to publishing companies , authors and also newspapers .
In her weekly video podcast , before the opening of the Frankfurt Book Fair this week , Merkel appealed for more international co-operation on copyright protection and said her government opposed Google 's drive to create online libraries full of scanned books .
" The German government has a clear position : copyrights have to be protected on the internet , " Merkel said , adding that there were " considerable dangers " for copyright protection online .
Merkel , who will officially open the world 's largest book fair in Germany 's financial capital on Tuesday , said there was a need to discuss the issue in greater detail .
She was reacting to Google 's astonishing project to eventually make virtually all the books in the world available to be searched online .
Though it sounds almost like science fiction , Google workers have been scouring the world 's libraries and scanning the books therein .
They then upload the images onto the internet and make them searchable using Google .
To date it is believed that Google has scanned more than 10 million titles from libraries in America and Europe – including half a million volumes held by Oxford 's Bodleian library .
The exact method it uses is unclear ; the company does not allow outsiders to observe the process .
However , despite the secrecy surrounding the project , Google says its aims are entirely altruistic .
Its founders , Sergey Brin and Larry Page , have frequently said that their company 's ultimate mission is to make available all the world 's information online .
However , despite such seemingly poetic aims , the project has many critics , including those who say it could put publishers out of business , as it risks putting books for free onto the internet .
Authors and other holders of copyright on titles also worry that it will infringe their rights and harm their ability to profit from their work .
The issue is already before the courts in America .
In New York , a judge said last week that changes to a settlement that would allow Google to put millions more books online should be presented in court by 9 November .
The move is an effort to resolve a 2005 lawsuit brought by the Authors Guild and others against Google 's effort to scan libraries full of books .
Under the terms of the original settlement , Google would pay $ 125 m ( £ 78 m ) to create a book rights registry .
Authors and publishers could register works and be paid for books and other publications that the search giant would put online .
But German book publishers have criticised European regulators for failing to oppose the settlement .
Meanwhile , last month French publishing house La Martinière , the French Publishers ' Association and authors ' group SGDL asked a Paris court to fine Google € 15 m ( £ 14 m ) and € 100,000 for each day it continued " to violate copyright " by digitising their books .
Brin , however , says the plan would make millions of out - of - print books available online and thus would not cannibalise existing sales , as those books were not readily available to buyers .
Google argues that it is increasing access to works that would otherwise never see the light of the day .
Nor is the books issue the only area where Google 's quest to make all information readily accessible on the internet is causing a stir .
The newspaper industry argues that Google , and other websites , are profiting from its hard work by acting as aggregators of news stories while not actually producing any content themselves .
The argument has turned increasingly bitter in recent months as the crisis in the global newspaper industry has deepened amid widespread lay - offs of journalists and the closure of some titles .
Last week Rupert Murdoch , head of News Corporation , made an especially fiery speech hitting out at companies such as Google and effectively calling them thieves who profited from stolen content .
" The aggregators and plagiarists will soon have to pay a price for the co-opting of our content , " he told the World Media Summit in Beijing .

A year after Washington rescued the big names of American finance , it ’s still hard to get a loan .
But the problem is n’t just tight - fisted banks .
The continued disarray in debt - securitization markets , which in recent years were the source of roughly 60 percent of all credit in the United States , is making loans scarce and threatening to slow the economic recovery .
Many of these markets are operating only because the government is propping them up .
But now the Federal Reserve has put these markets on notice that it plans to withdraw its support for them .
Policy makers hope private investors will return to the markets , which imploded during the financial crisis .
The exit will require a delicate balancing act , government officials said .
“ You do it incrementally , where and when you think you can , and not sooner , ” said Lee Sachs , a counselor to the Treasury secretary , Timothy F. Geithner .
CARACAS — Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has said he seized the landmark Hilton hotel on Margarita Island because its owners dared to impose conditions on its use by his government to host a summit there last month .
“ To hold the conference we had to ask for permission … and the owners tried to impose conditions on the revolutionary government .
No way , ” said Chavez .

“ So I said , ‘ Let ’s expropriate it . ’
And now it ’s been expropriated . ”
The Venezuelan government was already a majority shareholder in the Hilton on the Caribbean resort island when Chavez took it over on Tuesday .
“ The acquisition by force of the real estate , furnishings , and related assets … of the Margarita Hilton & Suites Hotel Complex , along with the Marina owned by Inversiones Pueblamar y Desarrollos MBK , have been ordered , ” read a presidential decree in the official register .
The sprawling complex , including 280 rooms , 210 suites , a casino , stores , restaurants , offices and meeting areas , as well as the adjoining marina , will be held by the state tourism corporation Venetur , which reports to the Tourism Ministry .
The hotel , in northeastern Nueva Esparta state , was targeted for nationalization less than a month after it was used to host the South America - Africa Summit on September 26 and 27 .

The seizure was billed as part of an “ urgent ” effort to boost “ the social development side of the tourism and hotel industries in Nueva Esparta state . ”
On Wednesday , the US - based Hilton chain said it was “ evaluating ” Venezuela ’s seizure of one of its hotels .
A Hilton spokeswoman told AFP that , in the meantime , the facility “ remains a member of the Hilton system of hotels . ”
Venezuela ’s Minister of Tourism , Pedro Morejon , on Wednesday said the Hilton and its facilities were in an “ advanced state of disrepair ” and that the government would refurbish them .

“ We ’re going to socialize the hotel , ” the minister told VTV television , adding that its future facilities would include a “ training center for tourism . ”
He also said that all current Hilton Hotel employees would not be out of a job .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We ’re going to change its name , ” said Chavez .
“ We ’ll give it a local sounding name because the Hilton brand is so international . ”
It is not the first time the Chavez government has checked into a Hilton and stayed for good .
Caracas has already seized the Hilton in Caracas , re-christening it the Hotel Alba , a reference to the Venezuelan - led leftist regional alliance Alianza Bolivariana para las Americas ( ALBA ) .

In the past four years , Venezuela has implemented the nationalization of what is sees as strategic industries , including electric utilities , cement , steel , oil services and banking .
Nigeria 's government said it believed the amnesty had been a success
The authorities in Nigeria say as many as 15,000 oil militants active in the Niger Delta surrendered under the two - month amnesty which expired on Sunday .
The official in charge of the scheme said 5,000 weapons and 18 gunboats had also been handed in by the militants .
President Umaru Yar 'Adua is to meet some of the militant commanders who have surrendered in Abuja on Friday .
However , one militant faction says it will resume fighting and that most of those who had disarmed were " rented " .
Attacks on oil installations and their employees have cut Nigeria 's output by a third in the past three years and helped raise oil prices .
Mr Yar 'Adua has made bringing peace to the delta a priority .
' Empty ' threat Speaking at a news conference in the capital on Thursday , chief amnesty co-ordinator Air Vice Marshal Lucky Ararile said 8,299 militants had officially been disarmed since August , but that he expected the figure to rise considerably because there had been a last - minute rush before the programme ended .
We will fight for our land with the last drop of our blood regardless of how many people the government of Nigeria and the oil companies are successful in bribing
Statement by Mend faction " Eventually , we will be looking at about 14,000 to 15,000 by the time the men are fully documented , " he said .
AVM Ararile said the government had so far built only three centres to educate and house the thousands of former militants in the Niger Delta , and would have to build more if it did not want them to have to wait too long .
" We will have a total capacity for 2,400 people at a time , but we are talking about 15,000 ex-militants , " he said .
" The constraint here is the amount of bed space that is available .
Re-orientation training will take a month , so we will take in 2,400 per month , " he added .
Some ex-militants in the delta have also reportedly taken to the streets in protest at the government 's failure to pay them the promised monthly living allowance of 65,000 naira ( $ 435 ) , and threatened to take up arms again .
Earlier , one faction of the Movement for the Emancipation of Niger Delta ( Mend ) led by Henry Okah said most of those who had surrendered " were rented by the government in the hope that real militants would be persuaded to emerge " .
Will amnesty bring peace ?
Nigeria 's peace hopes rest on Okah
The group said its commanders had been replaced and that it would resume attacks on oil pipelines and installations from next Thursday .
" We will fight for our land with the last drop of our blood regardless of how many people the government of Nigeria and the oil companies are successful in bribing , " said an e-mail sent by Mend spokesman Jomo Gbomo .
Mend declared a 60 - day ceasefire on 15 July to allow for peace talks shortly after Mr Okah was freed from prison .
It extended the ceasefire by a month in mid-September despite not having held any formal discussions with the government .
The BBC's Abdullahi Kaura Abubakar in the Niger Delta says some former leaders of the group have dismissed the threat to resume hostilities as empty , and it is not clear how many fighters belong to Mr Okah 's faction .
AVM Ararile told the BBC : " In any organisation you have renegades .
If they want to continue with their activities , that 's their choice . "
Mend says it is fighting so that Niger Delta residents benefit more from their region 's oil wealth .
But much of the violence is carried out by criminal gangs .

Renault boss Flavio Briatore has insisted that his team has done nothing wrong amid the Singapore Grand Prix race - fix controversy - after boldly predicting the truth of the matter will come out in public soon .
The flamboyant Italian broke his silence about the accusations made against him at Monza on Friday , as he told a select group of media that his decision to take criminal action against the Piquets was proof about how sure he was his team is innocent of the claims made by Nelson Piquet .
" The fact that we put a plan for blackmail [ action ] against the two Piquets , means I think we are very confident that the truth will come out , " said Briatore .
Renault is to face the FIA 's World Motor Sport Council in Paris on September 21 to answer charges that it deliberately caused a crash in last year 's Singapore Grand Prix to help Fernando Alonso win .
Speaking about the looming WMSC action , Briatore said : " You know what ?
Whatever happens , if someone goes against the rules , they go against the rules .
If I tell you to go rob a bank - afterwards , you decide whether to rob the bank or not .
" I do n't feel I have any responsibility , and we do n't feel we have done absolutely anything [ wrong ] .
In the case of Piquet we go to the World Council .
But the fact already that we have put a criminal plan to Piquet is because we have enough confidence to be successful - the team and myself . "
The matter appears to revolve around an alleged pre-race meeting that took place in Briatore 's office hours before that race - where Piquet claims that he was asked to crash early in the race to bring out a safety car .
Briatore declined to comment on the specifics of the events that took place that day , but said he had never known of any occasion where a driver had been asked to crash on purpose to help a team .
" No . Never .
Fernando only won the race because Massa had a problem , Kubica had a problem , " he said .
" There were six or seven problems .
" I think Barrichello stopped in the same place as Piquet .
What is possible on lap 14 , with 40 laps to go , to determine somebody winning the race ?
There was another pitstop , another safety car .
On lap 14 , how is it possible to know what is going to happen ? "
Briatore also hit out at the way that details of the evidence against Renault had been leaked to the media - something which he thinks has been damaging for his team and the sport .
The FIA has already begun an investigation into identifying who distributed the confidential information .
" The bad press I think was completely unfair - some leaks in the press to accuse somebody before they had the possibility to defend themselves , " he said .
" I think this is really not honest , this is really damaging and this really takes the sport in dispute [ sic ] .
We probably do n't know where it 's coming from , but this takes the sport in dispute [ sic ] because at the moment it is the accusation about Renault with no possibility for us to defend ourselves , because we respect our word to the FIA .
" We do n't want to do any comment and all the comment is around you guys , seeing what is leaked in the press .
I do n't want to put any comment .
I just put , this is making damage for Renault and puts the image of Formula 1 and the sport in dispute .
" All these things , if there is an allegation then you go to the World Council and you discuss in the World Council .
You do n't need to discuss in front of the public opinion and put 500 people working for the team in this kind of danger . "
Briatore also offered some words on how he felt about Piquet , as he said that all he had wanted was for the Brazilian to deliver performance when he raced for the team .
" I feel Nelsinho is a very spoiled guy , " he said .
" Every time he is racing it is because he owns the team as well .
He is very fragile .
We tried everything .
What you want is only performance . "
In the contest , which is held each year to coincide with the start of the pig hunt , children see how far they can throw a dead rabbit .
A superhero .
No , scratch that .
Superhero ’s have way too much responsibility .
Spiderman taught me that .
If I could choose any job in the world , it would have to be one with little to no responsibility .
At least that is the way I feel today .
Tomorrow things could change .
Tomorrow I may be willing to take on the responsibilities of a superhero .
But today , if I could choose any job in the world , it would be a marathon runner .
Not just someone who runs marathons , but someone who consistently places high enough to get endorsed and paid .
I could see myself running 26.2 miles multiples times a year .
During the off season , I would run fartleks on the beach mixed with long distance runs , all on my toes since I am a toe striker .
I ’d eat well .
I ’d sleep well .
I ’d be tanned .
I ’d have strong lungs , strong heart .
And I ’d truly understand the meaning of the mantra :
Pain is inevitable , suffering is optional .

PHILADELPHIA 
As a teenager , Keith Garrett was desperate to be accepted by the guys on the corner .
His first arrest for shoplifting was a point of pride with the gang , he recalled , and using heroin , cocaine and alcohol was natural .
Like many others in his group , he ended up addicted and scrounging to survive in abandoned houses .
Mr. Garrett , now 54 , was first sent to drug treatment in 1975 , for six months .
When he got out , he joined a 12 - step program , but soon enough , he lighted a joint with an old friend and was drawn back to the streets .
The halfhearted efforts at rehabilitation followed by relapse were repeated over the years .
“ I did n’t get much support in building a new life , ” he said of earlier treatments .
Finally , a year ago , Mr. Garrett said , he realized that “ nobody cared if I lived or died . ”
He entered into a new world of addiction recovery services developing in Philadelphia , where public and private agencies have teamed up to give struggling addicts far more social and practical support than before .
The city relies on a network of treatment centers , recovery houses and a community center that provide counseling and practical aid .
They are mainly staffed by peers in recovery who are trained to help others navigate a shaky new world of sobriety .
The edge of the solar system is tied up with a ribbon , astronomers have discovered .
The first global map of the solar system reveals that its edge is nothing like what had been predicted .
Neutral atoms , which are the only way to image the fringes of the solar system , are densely packed into a narrow ribbon rather than evenly distributed .
“ Our maps show structure and energy spectra that are completely different from what any model has predicted , ” says study co-author Herbert Funsten of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico .
NASA ’s Interstellar Boundary Explorer satellite , or IBEX , discovered the narrow ribbon , which completes nearly a full circle across the sky .
The density of neutral atoms in the band is two to three times that in adjacent regions .
These and related findings , reported in six papers posted online Oct. 15 in Science , will not only send theorists back to the drawing board , researchers say , but may ultimately provide new insight on the interaction between the heliosphere — the vast bubble in which the solar system resides — and surrounding space .
The bubble is inflated by solar wind , the high - speed stream of charged particles blowing out from the sun to the solar system ’s very edge .
For 48 years , researchers have assumed that the solar wind sculpted the structure at the heliosphere ’s boundary with interstellar space , says Tom Krimigis of Johns Hopkins University ’s Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel , Maryland .
But the newly found ribbon ’s orientation suggests that the galaxy ’s magnetic field , just outside the heliosphere , seems to be the chief organizer of structure in this region , says theorist Nathan Schwadron of Boston University , a lead author of one of the studies .
It ’s not known whether the ribbon lasts for just a few years or is a permanent feature .
Equally puzzling are observations of the same boundary region with an instrument on the Cassini spacecraft , which recorded the density of atoms at higher energies , above 6,000 electron volts .
From its vantage point at Saturn , Cassini sees a belt rather than a ribbonlike structure , a team led by Krimigis also reports in Science .
The belt is substantially broader than the ribbon seen by IBEX but is in the same general area .
The heliosphere shields the solar system from 90 percent of energetic cosmic rays — high - speed charged particles that would otherwise bombard the planets and harm life .
Understanding more about the heliosphere and its ability to filter out galactic cosmic rays could be critical for assessing the safety of human space travel , Schwadron notes .
The new findings may also help predict how the heliosphere varies in shape and size as it moves through the galaxy and encounters regions of space having different densities and magnetic field strengths .
The ribbon found by IBEX , recorded at energies between 200 and 6,000 electron volts , is brightest at about 1,000 electron volts and lies between about 100 and 125 astronomical units from the sun , notes David McComas of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio .
One astronomical unit is the distance between the Earth and the sun .
The atoms recorded by IBEX , which orbits Earth , took a year or two , depending on their energies , to reach the craft from the outer edge of the heliosphere .
The IBEX ribbon runs perpendicular to the direction of the galaxy ’s magnetic field at the interstellar boundary , an indication that the field has a much stronger than expected influence on the sun ’s environs , report Schwadron and his colleagues .
One possibility is that pressure from this external magnetic field has forced particles just inside the heliosphere to bunch together into a ribbon .
“ First and foremost , this is a big surprise because we thought we know a lot about this region , the edge of the heliosphere , ” McComas says .
The Voyager 1 craft in 2004 ( Science News : 1/3/04 , p. 7 ) and the Voyager 2 craft in 2007 ( Science News : 8/2/08 , p. 7 ) journeyed to opposite sides of this fringe region of the solar system and crossed the termination shock — where the solar wind encounters a shock that precedes the influx of particles drifting into the solar system from interstellar space .
Both craft recorded the density of particles and the strength of the magnetic fields .
Both Voyager 1 and 2 missed seeing the newly found ribbon because it spans a region between their flight paths , says McComas .
No existing model can explain the ribbon , he adds , which was found independently by two instruments on IBEX .
Researchers had assumed that the pressure from the solar wind would compress in the heliosphere in the direction that the solar system was moving through space and create a cometlike tail in the opposite direction , notes Krimigis .
“ Now we know that ’s wrong , ” he says .
IBEX has also generated the first maps of neutral hydrogen and oxygen atoms entering the solar system from interstellar space .
Previous observations had traced only incoming helium atoms .
The sensitivity of the IBEX instruments allowed researchers to record the relatively small number of oxygen atoms that travel from beyond the termination shock , about 16 billion kilometers from Earth , to the spacecraft , notes study co-author Stephen Fuselier of the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center in Palo Alto , California .
Hydrogen atoms are more abundant than either helium or oxygen but their low mass means they are easily swept aside by the high - speed solar wind and ca n’t readily be detected .
The sun ’s unusually low activity during the current minimum in the solar cycle allowed more of the hydrogen atoms from the outer heliosphere to travel unimpeded to the inner solar system , enabling IBEX to record those atoms , Fuselier says .

The fighter jet camera that can read the time on Big Ben from the Isle of Wight
A new fighter jet camera which can read the time on Big Ben from the Isle of Wight has been hailed as a breakthrough for fighter pilots in Afghanistan .
The RAF Tornado GR4 technology - known as a Raptor - is used to zoom in on Taliban hideouts and snipers .
It is one of the most advanced reconnaissance sensors in the world today .
The pod , which is just under two metres long , is fixed underneath the jets , enabling pilots overhead to see precise detail from miles in the air .
It contains a dual - band sensor using both visible light and infrared , so can be used both day and night .
The Raptor pod can be seen attached to the underbelly of the Tornado GR4
Test flights showed the raptor can spot tiny details 75 miles away
Speaking at Kandahar Air Field , Wing Commander James Linter , officer commander 12 ( Bomber ) Squadron , said : ' It brings great flexibility to us and is particularly useful in Afghanistan .
' We have had them since July 1 - since then we have been able to deliver high quality imagery from amazing distances .
' One of the early testers flew over the Isle of Wight to test it .
They were able to take a shot of the face of Big Ben . '
First used during the 2003 invasion of Iraq in Operation Telic , the RAF now has eight Raptor pods and two ground stations .
Raptor , standing for Reconnaissance Airborne Pod for Tornado , is built by BF Goodrich Aerospace .
The infrared sensor offers superior haze - penetration in poor weather conditions , while the night time imagery can reveal details such as the fuel levels in storage tanks on the ground .
The camera has both visible light and infrared sensors so can be used during day and night missions
A Tornado GR4 is fitted with Raptor in Afghanistan
The pictures received by the pod can be transmitted via a live data - link system to image analysts at a ground station , or can be displayed in the cockpit during flight .
It can also record for post - flight analysis .
The pod is capable of imaging over 200 separate points on any one flight .
Squadron Leader Jon Nixon said : ' The thing about Raptor and its strategic capability is that it can take a huge amount of imagery in a short space of time . '
In the past many reconnaissance pods have been designed to operate with the aircraft either overflying or passing very close to the target , but the Raptor works differently .
' The stand - off range of the sensors also allows the aircraft to remain outside heavily defended areas , thus minimising the aircraft ’s exposure to enemy air - defence systems , ' an RAF spokesman said .
The Raptor transmits data from the camera to a ground station ( pictured ) for advanced analysis
Introduction
Rudel is a collaborative editing environment for GNU Emacs .
Its purpose is to share buffers with other users in order to edit the contents of those buffers collaboratively .
It supports multiple backends to enable communication with other collaborative editors using different protocols ( most notably Gobby ) .
For details about supported protocols and compatibility with other implementations , have a look at the compatibility page .
A list of complete , partial and planned backends is on the backends page .
There is also a page in the EmacsWiki .
Since Rudel is not an application , but an extension to Emacs , it is not started and used like most applications ( not even Emacs applications like Gnus ) .
Rudel mostly works in the background to change the behavior of the set of Emacs buffers for which it has been activated .
These do not even have to have a certain minor mode enabled .
The user interface of Rudel consists of a set of key bindings , a menu entry and some visual status indicators , which are added to the text and mode line of buffers for which Rudel has been activated .
This user interface is realized as a global minor mode .
A list of Rudel modes can be found on the modes page .

Before President Obama even landed at Andrews Air Force Base , returning from his mission to Copenhagen to win the 2016 Olympic Games , Chicago had been voted off the island .
Many shared the lamentation of Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels , “ What has become of America , when Chicago ca n’t steal an election ? ”
A second and more serious battle of Copenhagen is shaping up , in mid-December , when a world conference gathers to impose limits on greenhouse gases to stop “ global warming . ”
Primary purpose : Rope in the Americans who refused to submit to the Kyoto Protocols that Al Gore brought home in the Clinton era .
The long campaign to bring the United States under another global regime — the newest piece in the architecture of world government — has been flagging since 2008 .
Then , it seemed a lock with the election of Obama and a veto - proof Democratic Senate .
Green Hell : How Enviro ...
Milloy , Steven Best Price : $ 1.25 Buy New $ 8.10 ( as of 05:10 EST - Details )
Why has the campaign stalled ?
Because global warming has stalled .
The hottest year of modern times , 1998 , came and went a decade ago .
As BBC climate correspondent Paul Hudson writes : “ For the last 11 years , we have not observed any increase in global temperatures .
And our climate models did not forecast it , even though manmade carbon dioxide , the gas thought to be responsible for warming our planet , has continued to rise . ”
What this powerfully suggests is that what man does and does not do is far less responsible for climate change , if it is responsible at all , than other factors over which he has no control .
Consider .
Though the emissions of carbon dioxide rose constantly throughout the 20th century — with the industrialization of the West , Japan , Southeast Asia and , finally , China and India — global temperatures have not risen steadily at all .
They have fluctuated .
John Sununu , writing in the St. Croix Review , says the Earth underwent “ cooling in the 1920s , heating in the 1930s and 1940s , cooling in the 1950s and 1960s and 1970s , warming in the 1980s and 1990s , and cooling in the past decade . ”
But if there is no crisis , why are we even going to Copenhagen ?
And if there is no causal connection between carbon dioxide and global warming , what is the true cause of climate change ?
Some scientists say that 98 percent of the Earth ’s temperature can be explained by the sun .
When the sun ’s energy increases , a matter over which man has zero control , the Earth ’s temperature rises .
When the sun ’s energy diminishes , the Earth ’s temperature falls .
One solar scientist , Piers Corbyn , claims to have found a link between solar charged particles hitting the Earth and global warming and cooling .
Others , like professor Don Easterbrook of Western Washington University , contend that the oceans explain climate change .
As they heat and cool cyclically , the Earth heats and cools .
And where the oceans were cooling for 40 years before the 1990s , they have lately been heating up .
Easterbrook says these cycles tend to last for 30 years .
As Hudson notes , there are scientists who claim they have taken all these factors into consideration and insist that the Earth , over the long haul , is warming .
But Hudson cites Mojib Latif of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , who says we are in the fist stage of a long - term cooling trend that will last another 10 to 20 years .
The anecdotal evidence almost daily contradicts Al Gore and the end - of - times environmentalists .
Lately , there have been record - breaking cold spells in the Midwest and West .
Snow came to Colorado this October , postponing a baseball playoff game .
The hurricane season turned out to be among the mildest on record .
Contrary to predictions , the polar bear population seems to be doing fine .
While the ice cap at the North Pole is receding , the Antarctic ice cap , which contains 90 percent of the world ’s ice , is expanding .
Moreover , receding ice in the Arctic is opening up a northwest passage from Europe to Asia .
The Russians believe the immense mineral resources of the Arctic may soon be accessible .
While we wring our hands , they are rushing to get them .
The mounting evidence that global warming has halted and man is not responsible for climate change has thrown the Kyoto II lobby into something of a panic .
Barbara Boxer and John Kerry are re-branding the Senate cap - and - trade bill as a national security measure .
If , however , cap - and - trade , which the Congressional Budget Office says will be another blow to economic growth , can be stopped before the Copenhagen summit in December , the republic may have dodged another bullet .
And the goal of the globalists — an end to the independence and sovereignty of the United States , and the creation of a world government — will have sustained yet another welcome postponement .
The Best of Patrick J. Buchanan
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is threatening to kill hundreds of bills unless the Legislature delivers one bill on water .
Is that heavy - handed ?
No question .
Is it bullying ?
Sure .
Hostage - taking ?
Political terrorism ?
Of course .
Misuse of power ?
Definitely not .
Advertisement
It is a proper use of power .
It ’s ugly .
But it ’s an available political tool that the governor would be derelict not to use when an issue as critical as water is at stake .
This is n’t about some narrow scheme important only to a narrow interest .
Nor is it merely about a governor ’s pet project -- other than his legacy - building , which should be encouraged as long as it helps the state .
It ’s about finally resolving an acute , decades - old problem that is worsening and affects practically all Californians .
The state water system is clogged and rusting .
It ’s a matter of time before the California aqueduct , which funnels Sierra snow runoff from the Sacramento Valley into the San Joaquin Valley and Southern California , is shut off .
The principal water tank , the Sacramento - San Joaquin River Delta , is threatened with potential levee collapses , earthquakes , floods and global warming .
And the ecology already is crumbling .
Advertisement
The estuary ’s fishery is fast disappearing .
The endangered delta smelt is a red herring -- a pet target of San Joaquin farmers and the governor who resent federal judges holding back water to save the tiny critter .
The real economic tragedy is the decline of the once - abundant king salmon .
Their plight has caused a two - year cancellation of commercial fishing for the popular fish , idling boats and shuttering processing plants all along the North Coast .
Nobody argues that the waterworks do n’t need major repairs and remodeling .
But there is a delicate balance that Capitol negotiators have yet to find .
It ’s the balance between investing in a reliable , environmentally friendly water supply and trying to achieve what really must be the state ’s No. 1 priority : living within its means .
Senate Republicans have proposed a $ 12.4 - billion bond issue that would be paid off by all taxpayers .
It would include $ 4 billion for two or three dams .
Additionally , users of the newly developed water would kick in at least that much dam - building money .
The rest of the bond funds would be available for local projects , the delta , conservation , groundwater protection and removing some small , salmon - blocking dams on the Klamath River .
Advertisement
The bond would not include money for a so - called peripheral canal around the delta .
This controversial facility would be financed entirely by water users , including customers of the Metropolitan Water District .
That ’s too steep a bond for many legislators , who worry about repayments carving a deep hole in the deficit - plagued general fund .
Sen. Dave Cogdill of Modesto , the Senate Republicans ’ go - to guy on water , replies that the bonds could be parceled out over several years .
The important thing is to line up the funding authorization for construction projects , he says .
But Assembly Republican Leader Sam Blakeslee of San Luis Obispo disagrees .
He would prefer a bond closer to $ 8 billion .
“ We ’re in the biggest recession of our generation , ” he says .
“ We need to spend only what is necessary to solve the problem as quickly as possible . . . without some of the Christmas ornaments and largesse -- a scaled - down package that is n’t the ultimate solution for every water problem anyone can imagine , funding every possible stakeholder who has a dog in this hunt . ”
Advertisement
Democratic leaders basically agree .
But they would cut back on dam funding before they would eliminate some of the things Blakeslee would , such as groundwater monitoring and treatment plants .
“ Much of this bill is a wish list of the far left , ” the GOP leader asserts .
“ Frankly , I do n’t think this is the time for a wish list . ”
But it also may be the necessary makings of a compromise , trade - offs necessary for environmentalist groups to buy the farm lobby ’s desired dams .
There ’s also a battle over who pays -- all taxpayers , or mostly the water users .
And who pays for the delta environmental restoration ?
The public exclusively ?
Or also the water users who drained the estuary ?
These and other arguments -- such as details of a new governing system for the delta -- have raged for years .
Schwarzenegger apparently does n’t much care what the Legislature decides .
He just wants it to compromise and send him a bill .
Advertisement
The governor demands a deal by Friday night .
Or he ’ll grab the veto pen , he strongly hints and his advisors tell reporters .
Sunday night is the deadline for signing or vetoing more than 700 bills .
Is that threat risky ?
Somewhat .
He ’s swinging a sledgehammer and could wind up dropping it on his foot .
Assembly Democrats “ are very angry ” at the governor , says Speaker Karen Bass ( D - Los Angeles ) .
“ I ’m trying to hold off their anger .
I ’m worried about a backlash . ”
Senate leader Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) calls the governor ’s extortion “ silly . ”
Advertisement
Even Republican Blakeslee mildly criticizes Schwarzenegger .
The bills on his desk should be judged “ on their own merit , ” he says .
“ Using other criteria is not constructive . ”
But Blakeslee and Bass doubt Schwarzenegger will carry out the threat .
The leaders believe that if the governor and legislators are within striking distance of an agreement -- and they already seem to be -- he ’ll put away the sledgehammer .
“ This is a classic contest of wills between the executive and legislative branches , ” Blakeslee says .
“ I do n’t get too overwrought with some of the positioning and posturing . ”
But the governor is n’t backing down .
“ It makes sense to use the executive leverage , ” says Matt David , his chief spokesman .
“ He ’s going to use everything at his disposal . ”
Advertisement
That ’s what it ’s for .
For years , many people -- myself included -- have carped at Schwarzenegger for not using all the powers of his office .
We should n’t complain now that he ’s using the most potent power .

There have been some recent stories in the news about various " anonymous " bloggers and commenters being unmasked by court order .
A business promises not to give up your identity unless forced to do so via court order .
This is anonymity by policy .
If a business does n't have your identity , then there is nothing to divulge .
This is anonymity by design .
Advocates for anonymous comments understand the value of being able to speak freely .
However , if you 're simply connecting from your home or office , parts of your identity are leaked to the site on which you commented .
As shown above , you can be unmasked fairly easily .
Some sites simply respond to a subpoena , others legal threats , and still others simply do n't care ; giving away your identity with any request .
There are plenty of valid reasons to want to protect your identity in a blog , comment , or feedback form .
I 've participated in " anonymous reviews " being conducted in a company where employees get to give their opinion on anything in the company : strategy , management , branding , etc. Human Resources rolls out the " anonymous survey " with great fanfare as a chance for the line employees to get their voice heard .
At the same time , upper management asks IT to ascertain which IP address maps to which employee , whether connecting internally or not .
Employees quickly figure out what 's going on and feel undervalued and coerced into toeing the company line .
And management lacks the feedback they probably should hear .
In this case , anonymity by policy does n't help anyone actually improve the company .
Another example is the Iraqi Rewards Program run by the CIA .
It 's designed such that concerned Iraqi 's can report illegal activities and get a reward for verified intelligence .
Essentially , an anonymous tip line .
The issue is an Iraqi citizen will go into an Internet cafe and have an encrypted conversation with cia.gov .
This is bad for the people who want to report something .
An observer on the network only sees someone talking to cia.gov with encryption .
A truly anonymous tip line should protect the identity of the tipster , and provide the tipster with the ability to divulge as much of their identity as comfortable .
The examples and news stories above show you the difference between anonymity by policy and anonymity by design .
We encourage the courts to keep raising the requirements before forcing a provider to divulge your identity .
We encourage companies to learn how privacy can enhance their relationship with their customers .
We designed Tor such that relying on court tests and company policies is n't your only protection .
Tor users and relay operators do n't have the data to divulge .
This is anonymity and privacy by design .
Beijing , China ( CNN ) -- China ranks second only to the United States in the number of billionaires , according to an annual report of the 1,000 richest people in the country .
The Hurun Rich List counted 130 billionaires in China this year , up from 101 a year ago and none in 2003 .
An additional 825,000 people had personal wealth of more than $ 1.5 million , said Rupert Hoogewerf , an accountant who has compiled the list since 1998 .
" You can double the real number of billionaires in China to 260 , " said Hoogewerf in a statement .
" There are still a large number of billionaires off the radar screens . "
Often , wealthy people in China try to avoid the scrutiny of tax authorities by keeping their finances private .
The man who topped the list last year , for example , is under arrest for alleged financial irregularities .
The most prominent dropout from the list is injured Houston Rockets basketball player Yao Ming , whose fortune was valued at $ 100 million last year .
The list indicates that China 's wealthy have been buffered from the global financial meltdown , which has tycoons in other countries reeling .
A separate list , released in June by Capgemeni SA and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management , found that China 's economy grew by 9 percent last year , even as the United States and Europe slipped into recession .
That list found that the combined riches of China 's millionaires surpassed that of the United Kingdom's .
Most business owners who made the Hurun list -- both as billionaires and millionaires -- made their fortune in real estate and related industries as China has undergone dizzying urbanization .
The construction ministry estimates that the country 's urban population will increase by 300 million people by 2025 .
Few of those making the list relied on exports to Western economies .
But the richest man in China this year , Wang Chuanfu , jumped 102 places to the top after billionaire U.S. investor Warren Buffett agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in his company .
Buffett 's announcement sent shares in Wang 's company , BYD , surging 387 percent this year .
The company initially made its name with rechargeable cell phone batteries , but this year launched mass production of a plug - in hybrid electric car .
Other highlights from the list :
• Less than 1 percent on the list inherited their wealth , compared with 25 percent in the United Kingdom and 35 percent in the United States .
• The typical rich list member is a 50 - year - old self - made man who started out 16 years ago and has made his money from property development .
• 102 women were among China 's 1,000 richest .
Chinese women make up more than half the world 's richest self - made women .
• The top three hobbies of wealthy Chinese are travel , swimming and golf .
The United States , Australia and France are their preferred destinations .
Though the list mentions China as second to the United States in the number of billionaires , it did not specify how many the latter produced .
A Forbes magazine tally of the world 's richest people , released in March , counted 359 billionaires in America .
Trekkers of all stripes lined up as early as 5 a.m. in Atlanta , Georgia , for the once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to see two titans of " Star Trek " together .
William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy 's appearance today at the annual Dragon - Con was a raucous treat .
Taking on a roast - like atmosphere from the very beginning , the appearance was like eavesdropping on a conversation between two old friends who enjoyed ripping into each other mercilessly .
It was an event that Dragon - Con " Star Trek " programming director Eric L. Watts said he never imagined would take place .
At the start , Nimoy brought up the recent smash hit reboot of " Trek " on the big screen by asking Shatner , " Seen any good movies lately ? "
The newest incarnation of " Trek " has been a sore point for Shatner of late , and the remark set him off .
No matter how many times Nimoy tried to change the subject , Shatner kept asking , " Why was n't I in the movie ? " Finally Nimoy , who had a major role in it , gave his best guess , which was that Captain Kirk was killed in the movie " Star Trek Generations . "
Shatner admitted that he has yet to see the movie , though he said its director , J.J. Abrams , had offered to screen it for him .
Adding that he also had n't watched " Star Trek : The Next Generation , " he blamed his busy schedule and the fact that he would inevitably be asked " Why were n't you in the movie ? " by others seeing it with him at a theater .
Nimoy said that he did n't think he would be in any future movies , and that the character of Spock was in good hands with Zachary Quinto .
The audience of nearly 2,000 ate up the pair 's relentless needling .
When one question was addressed to Nimoy , Shatner turned around in his chair .
At another point , Nimoy reached for Shatner 's hair .
At yet another , Shatner jokingly accused Nimoy of calling him something unprintable .
At the end of the session , Shatner shared the speech he would give if he won the Emmy this year for " Boston Legal : " " This will make a great plaque on the body of a dead show . "

PUA Summit Answer To Promo Questions – Part 1
Question 1 : What Opener Has Worked Best For You And Why ?
As you all know , I am 100 % different than anyone else out there .
I do n’t believe in canned routines or pre-planned openers , because women are all about serendipitous moments .
Everyone can create an unbelievably powerful opener based on what ’s going on around them .
The key to attracting a woman is to be aware of what she ’s doing in that moment .
So every time I see a woman , I run the scenario happening around me through my head to be successful in opening her ( because the key to successfully opening a woman is to make it casual , fun and non-threatening ) .
A good opener is based on her not feeling like she ’s being opened .
It needs to feel like a twist of fate to her :
You ’re in a coffee shop , she ’s there and you meet .
It ’s how women are wired .
So how do you open a woman anyplace and anytime ?
First , observe what she ’s doing or feeling .
This is really simple .
Ask yourself this question :
What does her facial expression convey right now ?
Is she happy ?
Sad ? Frustrated ?
Also , observe what she physically is doing at that moment .
Is she ordering a sandwich ?
Is she sampling coffee ?
Smelling blueberries ?
Once you process this information , what is the first thing that comes to your mind ?
You ’ll need to train yourself to do this .
The best way to do that is to take a week and write down everything you feel when you watch people , so that you are able to quickly react to any situation .
The other thing to do is to be sure to have a powerful voice tone when you talk to a woman .
Once you know what you ’re going to say , walk over like you ’ve said what you ’re about to say 1000 times before .
The more casual you are in your approach , the better her response will be to you because what you say will be coming from what ’s already in her head .
It gets you off to an easy start into a conversation .
This is how I craft openers all the time . . . and they work every time .
Casa Batllo , Barcelona in HDR : : Photo Credit : MorBCN
Restored and remodeled by the Spanish modernist architect Antoni Gaudi in the years 1905 – 1907 , Casa Batllo is now one the most overlooked buildings by the tourists who visit Barcelona .
Although Casa Batllo is a museum now , Gaudi designed it for for a wealthy Barcelona Aristocrat .
The local name for the building is Casa dels ossos ( House of Bones ) , and indeed it does have a visceral , skeletal organic quality .

It seems that the goal of the designer was to avoid straight lines completely .
Much of the facade is decorated with a mosaic made of broken ceramic tiles that starts in shades of golden orange moving into greenish blues .

From the balconies resembling the bones of animals to the scale like surface of the front facade , the building is a tour de force of an artist reaching the peak of his powers .
At night the floodlit facade has an iridescence like the scales of a fish .
This polychromic finish is known as trencadís .

The single most useful tip I 've ever received as a programmer is a bash alias from Damian Conway .
I already had a handful of bash aliases squirreled away in my . bashrc , but he showed off an alias called realias :
alias realias= '$ EDITOR ~/.aliases ; source ~/.aliases '
By moving my aliases into a file called .aliases and adding source ~/.aliases to my . bashrc , I could use the new realias alias to write an alias in the same shell process .
Instead of logging in and out of the shell ( manually suspending and resuming any work in progress ) or remembering to source the same file I was editing , I could add and use an alias immediately .
I now use plenty of shell aliases .
Only after the tiny pain of setting and using a new alias went away did I realize that the change was an optimization .
Put another way , Damian 's trick removed a tiny pessimization .
Now I use these aliases all the time .
I do n't have to remember all of the command - line flags to invoke Callgrind or Valgrind in the proper way to profile Parrot or Rakudo .
I use the cg and vg aliases .
I do n't have to remember how to build or publish a book in progress ; I use a book - specific alias to build and upload the new version .
When I find myself repeating a complex command line and it's suitable for an alias instead of a script , I make an alias then and there .
Imagine what would happen if we could identify and remove other tiny pessimizations .
Modern : : Perl is one attempt to do so .
Whenever I use that module , I know what to expect .
Whenever I see code which uses that module , I know what to expect as well .
I can use say wherever I want without having to remember to use feature ' say ' ; .
I do n't have to remember that the feature description of given / when is switch .
Yes , these are tiny little pieces of community knowledge that are easy to learn and reasonably easy to remember and they only trip me up for a second or two when I forget them , but sometimes removing a fraction - of - a - second pessimism is enough to keep my brain focused on what I really want to accomplish , not forehead - slapping minutiae related only to the expression of my desires .
Mark Fowler called it the simplest change that 'll make the most difference .
Adam Kennedy says productivity sometimes means saving ten seconds here and ten seconds there .
Does this apply elsewhere ?
Of course .
I have more to write about operator - oriented programming languages , but consider that even C has polymorphic behavior when adding integers and floats and Java 's println method supports implicit stringification , if you look at it from one direction .
Imagine if you had to be explicit about only being able to print ( or concatenate ) strings or if you needed a special operator to add numeric values with and without decimal components .
Now ask yourself this .
What if , in Perl 5 , hashes did n't have a single , global iterator ?
What if , in the Python shell , typing exit actually exited ( at least if there were no symbol called exit bound in the current scope ) ?
What if , in JavaScript , you did n't have to create a new function to get a new lexical scope ?
What if ...
I 'm sure you have your own list .
I 'm not saying that these changes are easy , nor that they 're simple to implement , nor that there are n't valid compatibility reasons to proceed with caution .
The world 's not that simple .
Even still , if we 're to replace badvocacy with real , working solutions , we should also consider sanding off the tiny , rough corners of our software that individually are small , ignorable distractions .
It 's surprising how much easier software is to use when even one tiny pessimization suddenly disappears .
A relational database , as we all know from the previous article , stores relations between integers , strings and other simple types in a very plain way : it just enumerates all values related .
This model is extremely flexible , since other relations can be easily derived from existing ones using mathematical formulae , and the relational database takes care of that .
However , database should reflect the real world in some way to be really of use .
Since the relational databases store relations between mathematical abstractions and not real world things , we should make some kind of a mapping of ones to the others .
This is what entity - relationship model is for .
An entity - relationship model , as one can easily guess from its name , models relationships between entities .
But since we know that databases do essentially the same , how does it differ from the database model ?
An entity - relationship model states which data and relations between them should be stored
data and relations between them should be stored A database model states how these relations are stored
In other words , ER model is design and database model is one of the ways to implement it .
ER model is said to be above the database model in the waterfall developement .
Note that in both cases I use the word stored above .
The model says nothing of data and relations between them that may or should exist , only of those that should be stored .
Every human being participates in thousands if not millions relationships , but an ER model should state which of them are to be stored , and a relational model should decide how to store them .
Of course it would be nice to store them all ( and police and insurance would be just happy ) , but the technology does not allow it yet .
Do n't know whether it is good or bad .
A typical entity - relationship diagram in Peter Chen 's notation looks like this :
What does it mean ?
Entities
Square boxes mean entites .
What do we describe in our database ?
In our case , the model requires that we store information about clients , orders and
items ordered .
Square boxes are useless without additional information .
Store some information ?
OK , we do .
We just make a file to which a new line is added each time a new customer registers :
A customer has registered A customer has registered A customer has registered …
, another file to which a new line is added when an order is made :
An order is made An order is made An order is made …
and a third file to keep the list of items ordered .
An item is ordered An item is ordered …
Quite useless , right ?
However , there still is some information , as per request .
We know that each row in the files describe a customer , an order or an item , and we can get the total number of customers , orders and items we 've had so far .
This is better than nothing but still far from being usable .
Note that the diagram tells us nothing of how they should be stored .
We could write them into a file , or on a paper or carve it on a stone .
Relationships
Diamonds mean relationships .
How the entities are related to each other ?
We see that we should store the relationships between orders and clients as well as those between items and orders .
More than that : tiny arrows between the diamonds and the boxes ( that is , between the entities and relationships ) show us which relationships should we store .
In our cases , we have a 1 : ( 0 - N ) relationship between clients and orders and a 1 : ( 0 - N ) relationship between orders and clients .
1 :( 0 - N ) is spelled as one to zero , one or many
That means that our database should make sure that any order is related to exactly one client .
Want to store an order ?
Be prepared to link it to the piece of information about the client who made it and make sure this information describes exactly one client .
This is the database developer 's task .
However , a client can have an arbitrary number of orders : no orders at all , one order or many orders .
The database should provide an ability to store the clients and orders this way .
Again , the entity - relationship model does not prescribe how should we store that data , as long as the storage method satisfies the conditions above .
We could store it in two files and relate them using the row numbers :
A customer has registered A customer has registered A customer has registered …
An order is made by the customer described on line 1
An order is made by the customer described on line 2
An order is made by the customer described on line 2
, or we can just keep the information in a single text file :
A client has registered Made an order A client has registered Made an order Made an order …
, or keep it in an XML file :
< root > < client > < order /> </ client > < client > < order /> < order /> </ client > </root >
, or even bend down a finger each time a client makes an order .
The latter one limits us to only 2 clients and 5 orders , but , you know , every system has its limitations .
Attributes
Ovals are attributes .
What information is stored in the database ?
Mere enumerating the clients is nice but serves no purpose .
Much better if you know the names of the clients ; the orders need to be assigned with unique numbers that help to identify them ; and it would be great to record which good did which item contain ( so not only the number of packages could be checked but their contents too ) .
This is in fact what the database is for : storing information .
Not only the links between the entities but the descriptions of the entities too .
Something like this :
< root > < client name = " John " > < order number= " 1 " > < item name = " apple " /> </order > </ client > < client name = " Jim " > < order number= " 2 " > < item name = " apple " /> < item name= " banana " /> </order > </ client > </root >
That 's what makes database a database , not a computer - assisted finger - counting .
Entity - relationship and relational model
Everything above should be squeezed into relational model , which as we all know stores relations .
Since the time relational database appeared , they were mostly used to implement ER models .
Multiple database manuals and guides describe the relational databases solely from that point of view .
Various tools exist to automatically generate relational structure given a model .
However , ER model and a relational database are not the same .
There is even no mapping to either side : same ER model can be implemented in different ways in relational database and vise versa , a relational structure can serve multiple ER models .
Due to the way the data are stored in a relational model , there is no reliable way to tell between attributes , entities and relationships by looking only at the relational model .
These terms belong to the ER model .
In a relational model , one thing can be implemented as an entity , relationship or an attribute .
In this article , I will give several examples .
Attribute or relationship ?
Imagine a simple model as pictured in the diagram on the right .
The model requires that the database store fictional characters ( as the entities ) .
For each fictional character it should store their name , address , town and state ( as the attributes ) .
There are no relations here : we store only one type of entities and their attributes .
As I already said earlier , the ER model specifies what should be stored and the database design ( relational model in this case ) decides how .
One ot the benefits of the relational model is that is can construct the data representation on the fly , using SQL statements .
That 's why there is more than one way to design a storage model , and as long as it's possible to retrieve the data in expected form , every storage model is just as good .
One of the possible ways to implement this ER model in a relational database is to store the entities and their attributes in one table , like this :
FictionalCharacter ID First Name Last Name Address Town State 1 Marty McFly 9303 Lyon Estates Hill Valley CA 2 Arnold 4040 Vineland Hillwood WA 3 Hank Hill 123 Rainey Street Arlen TX
This table serves two purposes : it both defines an entity and stores its attributes .
The entities are defined by being listed in a table with their id ( a value being used in the relations ) defined as a PRIMARY KEY .
Not all fictional characters , though , have last names .
Arnold of Hey , Arnold ! does not .
There is one more way to implement this model : store the entities and attributes in two ( or even more ) separate relational tables .
If an attribute is rarely set or rarely used , it can be offloaded into another table :
FictionalCharacter ID First Name Address Town State 1 Marty 9303 Lyon Estates Hill Valley CA 2 Arnold 4040 Vineland Hillwood WA 3 Hank 123 Rainey Street Arlen TX
FictionalCharacterLastName ID Last Name 1 McFly 3 Hill
The model remains the same : the last name is an attribute of an entity , possibly undefined ; but the relational implementations differ .
Nevertheless , we can easily transform one representation to another by issuing SQL queries .
This second one can be transformed to the first one using this query :
SELECT c.* , ln.LastName FROM FictionalCharacter c LEFT JOIN FictionalCharacterLastName ln ON ln.id = c.id
and vice versa :
SELECT c.id , c.FirstName , ln.LastName , c.Address , c.Town , c.State FROM FictionalCharacter c LEFT JOIN FictionalCharacterLastName ln ON ln.id = c.id
SELECT c.id , c.LastName FROM FictionalCharacter c WHERE c.LastName IS NOT NULL
The first model ( storing all attributes in one table ) seems more simple .
Why should one ever use the second solution which is more complex ?
The reason is that the relational database , itself being an abstraction , should nevertheless be stored on a real world disk drive and served by a real world software .
And when it comes to the real world , as we all know , several trade - offs should be made .
In the world of relational databases there is a convention to use a special value , NULL , to mark the data whose value is undefined , that is not known , not stored or not cared for .
This value is not equal ( and not even unequal ) to any value ( including itself ) , the results of most operators and functions over this value are also undefined .
However , it still should be stored in the database somehow .
Most databases optimize it to occupy as few space as possible .
Oracle , for instance , stored data in rows of dynamic size , the row itself and each column being prepended with their sizes .
If the column count in a given row is less than it should be ( i. e. there are fewer columns stored in a row than it is stated in the table definition ) , all other columns are considered to have the value of NULL .
This makes storing NULLS in trailing columns to be free in terms of the disk drive space .
But sometimes NULL still occupies some space .
Some systems store the data in rows of fixed length ; some use no strict datatypes and therefore should store the database along with each value ( rather than relying on the table definition ) ; some ( like Oracle ) should store the NULL if the column is not trailing , i. e. there are some non- NULL values after it .
This makes the table bigger in size .
And the queries that do not return this attribute are slower than they would be were it not for that column , since the data occupies more space and the engine needs to read more datapages .
On the other hand , the queries returning all columns , including that which is rarely used , are faster than they would be were this column stored in a separate table .
Extra disk reads and CPU time are required to join these columns into one resulting relation and present it to the querying code .
The relations we get as a result of the queries are exactly same , since the relational databases separate logical presentation from the physical storage .
But they do it does not mean they do it the best way .
They do not know beforehand which query shall we do more often : the one that returns all attributes or the one that omits some of them .
The two queries , one returning the missing attribute and one lacking it , cannot be optimized together .
Making one faster usually makes the other one slower .
If the attribute is stored only for some , not for all entities , or the attribute is not queried for much often , it may be useful to store it in a separate table on the disk , so that the most used query is faster .
Both these storage methods implement one ER model .
It 's only the way the attribute is stored is changed , not the way it is presented logically .
We can even create a view or a stored procedure that would hide this storage method from the calling application completely .
In a relational database , the ER model defines the number and the possible values of the attributes but not the way they are stored .
The entity should be defined by a relation corresponding the PRIMARY KEY of the entity with all of its attributes .
The database can store this relation in a relational table as is or generate it from the several tables on demand .
As long as the database is able to do that , the model implementation is considered valid .
Storing something in another table and joining the tables to get the results usually means a relationship ( in this case a one - to - one relationship ) .
But in this model it is not a relationship that the separate table defines .
It is just a more efficient way to store an attribute .
Attribute or entity ?
Back to the model that describes fictional characters :
and its implementation :
FictionalCharacter ID First Name Last Name Address Town State 1 Marty McFly 9303 Lyon Estates Hill Valley CA 2 Arnold 4040 Vineland Hillwood WA 3 Hank Hill 123 Rainey Street Arlen TX
Here we see an attribute , State , which contains a two - letter state code .
Now , what if we want to select all characters who live in states with population less than 10,000,000 ?
We do n't keep information about the population of the U.S. states in our model .
We will need to add it to the model somehow .
We could possibly add an additional attribute , StatePopulation , that would show the population of the state the character lives in .
However , this is not the best design : whenever we need to reflect a change in state population in our model , we should update the records for all character who live in these states .
In addition , we should make sure that all these records are consistent : all characters who live in same state should have same StatePopulation .
It would be wrong if two Hills lived in same Texas with different populations .
StatePopulation is a property of a state , not that of a person who lives in that state .
But the entity - relationship model does not allow adding attributes to attributes .
Instead , we should make State an entity , define a many - to - one relationship between the persons and the states and keep the Population as an attribute of a State .
Here 's how the new model would look :
This process is usually called normalization .
However , normalization is relational concept , not the ER concept .
Here is the definition of the third normal form ( which was what we made here ) from Wikipedia :
The third normal form ( 3NF ) is a normal form used in database normalization .
3NF was originally defined by E.F. Codd in 1971 .
Codd 's definition states that a table is in 3NF if and only if both of the following conditions hold :
The relation R ( table ) is in second normal form ( 2NF )
( table ) is in second normal form ( )
Every non-prime attribute of R is non-transitively dependent ( i.e. directly dependent ) on every key of R .
As we can see , there are a lot of things in this definition that the ER model knows nothing about : relations , keys , tables .
But the ER model has a similar concept : attributes cannot have the child attributes , entites can .
If you want to define an attribute for an attribute , promote the latter to an entity and define the relationship .
Transitive dependence is just another name for an attribute of an attribute .
Here is how this new ER model could be implemented in a relational database :
FictionalCharacter ID First Name Last Name Address Town State 1 Marty McFly 9303 Lyon Estates Hill Valley CA 2 Arnold 4040 Vineland Hillwood WA 3 Hank Hill 123 Rainey Street Arlen TX
State State Population CA 36,756,666 TX 24,326,974 WA 6,549,224
To select all characters who live in states with population less than 10,000,000 , we just issue the following query :
SELECT FictionalCharacter .*
FROM FictionalCharacter JOIN State ON State .
State = FictionalCharacter .
State WHERE State .
Population < 10000000 [ / sourcecode ]
Now lets see what have we changed here .
In the ER model : < ul > < li >< code > State </ code > became an entity < / li > < li>
One attribute , < code > State </ code > was removed from < code>FictionalCharacter</code></li> < li>
An additional relationship appeared : < code>FictionalCharacter </ code > < em>lives in </em > < code > State</code ></li > < li>
An additional attribute , < code > Population </ code > , was added to < code >
State</ code ></li> </ul >
In the relational model : < ul > < li>
One additional table , < code > State </ code > , appeared .</li > < li>
One constraint , a < code > FOREIGN KEY </ code > referencing < code > State </ code > , was added to the < code>FictionalCharacter</code></li> </ul >
Nothing had changed in the original table except for the < code > FOREIGN KEY </ code > constraint added to ensure the data integrity .
We see that promoting the < code > State < / code > to an entity did n't affect the original table .
The field < code > State < / code > remained .
The only thing that changed for this attribute that it now refers a record in the new table , < code > State < / code > , that both defines the list of states and holds the state populations .
This is because relational model ( unlike ER model ) does not really distinguish between the attributes and entities .
Relational model stores relations between the simple types ( like integers and strings ) .
A real world relational database stores relations between the integers and strings that describe some real world data .
A U.S. state does not become less of an entity , be it listed as an entity or as an attribute in the ER model .
If it 's enough for us to know only the state code ( which is used in the relational model to represent the state in the relations stored in the database ) , we can store it in an unconstrained field ; if it is not , we should create a separate table for it and constrain the value of the field using a < code > FOREIGN KEY </ code > .
In this very case it 's easy to tell that there is a relation by looking into the table structure .
There is a < code > FOREIGN KEY </ code > that gives us a hint that the < code > State < / code > is actually a field defining a one - to - many relationship , not a mere attribute .
But 's let 's consider another model : < img src= " https://explainextended.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/GoodsBonuses.png " alt = " Goods and Bonuses " title= " Goods and Bonuses " width = " 600 " height = " 300 " class=" aligncenter size - full wp- image - 3511 noborder " />
This model described goods and price - based bonuses .
The price ranges should be contiguous and the last range should have no upper bound .
Here 's how it would look in a relational database : < table class = " excel " > < caption > Goods </ caption > < tr>< th > ID</th>< th> Name</th>< th>
Price</th></tr>
< tr>< td>1</td>< td> Wormy apple </td >< td class = " double "
>0.09</td></tr> < tr >< td>2</td>< td> Bangkok durian </ td >< td class = " double " >
9.99</td></tr> < tr >< td>3</td>< td> Densuke watermelon</td>< td class = " double " >999.99</td></tr > < tr >< td>4</td>< td> White truffle < / td >< td class = " double " >99999.99</td></tr> </ table > < table class= " excel " > < caption > PriceRange</ caption > < tr>< th> Price</th>< th> Bonus</th></tr> < tr>< td class = " double " > 0.01 </td > < td class = " double " >
1%</td></tr>
< tr>< td class = " double " > 1.00 </td > < td class = " double " >
3%</td></tr>
< tr>< td class = " double " > 100.00 </td > < td class = " double "
>
10%</td></tr> < tr >< td class = " double " >10000.00 </td > < td class = " double "
>30%</td></tr> </table >
Does the < code > PriceRange </ code > table really define the price range entities ?
Sure it does .
It contains all required information : the < code > StartPrice < / code > ( as a field ) , the < code > EndPrice < / code > ( as the same field in the < em > next < / em > record in < code > PriceOrder</code >) and the < code > Bonus </ code > ( as a field in the record that defines the < code > StartPrice < / code > ) .
It is possible to write a query that would return a classical relation with all three attributes in one record : SELECT Price AS StartPrice , ( SELECT MIN ( Price ) FROM PriceRange NextRange WHERE NextRange .
Price > CurrentRange .
Price ) AS EndPrice , Bonus FROM PriceRange CurrentRange
Due to the way the entity is defined , it is impossible to put a FOREIGN KEY constraint to a price range .
The entity price range is not even being defined by a relation stored in a database : instead , a more simple relation is stored , which corresponds the value of the attribute ( Bonus ) with a lower bound of the price range .
To build the relation which would correspond each good with its price range and the bonus , we should issue the following query :
SELECT *
FROM Goods
JOIN PriceRange
ON PriceRange .
Price =
(
SELECT MAX ( Price )
FROM PriceRange
WHERE PriceRange .
Price <= Goods .
Price ) [ / sourcecode ]
We could probably use a more formalistic approach to the problem : store PriceRange in a table with a surrogate PRIMARY KEY , the lower and upper bounds as the attributes ; and store a FOREIGN KEY reference to it in Goods .
This design would be more familiar but it could easily lead to data inconsistency .
What if the Price of a good is not within the PriceRange the good references ?
What is the price ranges are not contiguous ?
What if the price ranges values are updated and the referencing columns are not ?
The root of this problem it that the mechanisms to ensure referential integrity work on declared relationships , i. e. those just listed in a table , while what we deal with here is an inferred relationship .
The relationship between a good and a price range is not defined by a mere declaration of the fact that the relationship exists , i. e. it is not taken from the outside world .
Instead , whether the relationship exists or not is defined by the values of the attributes of a good and a price range .
It is generated from the other information stored in the database .
And the relational databases , as I already said above , can transform the relations they store in the tables to other relations , using the relational algebra , mathematical operators and other means .
This relational design implements the ER model more consistently and efficiently , and this implementation is less prone to errors .
However , using this design , we cannot use automated tools to map the relational model back to the ER model anymore .
We do n't define the PriceRange and both of its attributes using a single stored relation referenceable with a FOREIGN KEY .
From the relational model 's point of view , the Price is just an attribute of a Good which has no reference to the PriceRange .
Nevertheless , the PriceRange is an entity with its attributes ( which can only be represented by self - joining the table ) , and Price is used to reference it .
The fact that this design is more consistent , however , does not mean that the original design should never be used .
Database normalization helps to cope with the possible inconsistencies in the model by inferring relations rather than storing them , but this can require additional resources ( memory , CPU etc ) and therefore be less efficient .
There are numerous situations which require to store relations in a way that allows possible logical inconsistencies but is faster to query .
Keeping the model consistent now becomes a developer 's task but it is the price one has to pay for speed .
This process is called denormalization .
I will not discuss benefits and drawbacks of normalization and denormalization in this article .
What I wanted to say is that usually there are many ways to implement an ER model in a relational database and not all these methods can be easily mapped back to the ER model which clearly distinguishes between entities , attributes and relationships .
A relational model uses same datatypes to represent entities and to define attributes .
Therefore , it is best thought of as a way to store relations between the entities of the real world ( represented by the numbers and strings ) , some of which are not of interest enough to be the entities of the model .
Whether the values the table relates represent entities or attributes is not a concern of a relational model .
It can store and return both with equal efficiency .
Relationship or entity ?
Consider this model :
It describes fictional persons who are married to each other .
This can be implemented in a relational database as this :
FictionalPerson ID Gender First Name Last Name 1 M Desmond Jones 2 F Mary Jones
Marriage ID Husband Wife 1 1 2
Here we see that Desmond Jones is married to Mary Jones .
Marriage of course is relationship ( and is called so even outside the database world ) .
That 's fine .
Now we want to add Scarlett O'Hara into the model .
She was married first to Ashley Wilkes , then to Rhett Butler .
The model as it is now does not let us do it , since a marriage is a one - to - one relation ( at least in the Christian tradition ) .
We should change this relation to a many - to - many ( which changes its wording from is married to to has ever been married to ) .
Here 's how the new model would look like :
FictionalPerson ID Gender First Name Last Name 1 M Desmond Jones 2 F Mary Jones 3 M Ashley Wilkes 4 M Rhett Butler 5 F Scarlett O'Hara
Marriage ID Husband Wife 1 1 2 2 3 5 3 4 5
The ER model changed the relationship from one - to - one to many - to - many .
To reflect this , the relational model dropped the separate UNIQUE constraints on Husband and Wife and added a composite UNIQUE constraint on ( Husband , Wife ) .
Now , let 's the add two more persons to our model : Ransie and Ariela Bilbro from O. Henry 's The Whirligig of Life .
They married each other twice .
This time even changing the relationship type in the ER model wo n't help .
There is no such thing as a double relationship .
To reflect the double marriages , the relationship should be promoted to a first - class entity with one - to - one relation to either part ( which now means been in this marriage ) .
The model would look like this now :
We see that the ER model changed significantly .
How did the relational model change ?
Since the husband and wife do not uniquely define the marriage anymore , the UNIQUE constraint should be dropped from the Marriage , but otherwise the tables remains the same :
FictionalPerson ID Gender First Name Last Name 1 M Desmond Jones 2 F Mary Jones 3 M Ashley Wilkes 4 M Rhett Butler 5 F Scarlett O'Hara 6 M Ransie Bilbro 7 F Ariela Bilbro
Marriage ID Husband Wife 1 1 2 2 3 5 3 4 5 4 6 7 5 6 7
This happened because the marriage in fact is an entity , with its own attributes like date and place of the wedding , the number of guests invited , awful toasts made , tea sets presented etc .
But the ER model was not initially interested in all this and the marriage was declared as a relationship , not an entity .
In ER model , a relationship between two entities can either exist or not exist , one or the other .
There can not be such thing as a double relationship or expired relationship .
To trace such things one should need to promote a relationship to an entity and assign the attributes to it .
However , the relation model can handle this easily .
The way the relationship is build in our implementation , there is no clear disctinction between a marriage as a relationship and a marriage as an entity .
By putting and removing UNIQUE constraints , Marriage can be easily changed to represent a one - to - one relationship , a many - to - many relationship or even an entity and two one - to - one relationships at once , the relational struсture still remaining the same .
Summary
The entity - relationship model defines what should be stored in a database : about what , which information , how related .
This should be described in terms of entities , relationships and attributes .
A relational model describes how to implement the requirements of the ER model : which information should be stored in which relational tables .
The relational model is very flexible and can construct relations on the fly .
The relations can be stored in one way and represented in another way .
This helps in handling more complex models that require the relationships to be inferred rather than stored .
The database can thus be made more maintainable and less prone to logical inconsistencies .
Since the relational model just defines relations between simple types like integers and strings , things like entities , attributes and relationships are not a concern of a relational model .
It only implements the requirements established by the entity - relationship model .
Usually it does it using simple and formal mechanisms : a PRIMARY KEY - preserved table to define entities and attributes , and a separate table with FOREIGN KEY references to define the relationships .
However , it can change the storage methods : move the attributes and relationship between the tables , define the entities so that the attributes should be calculated , etc .
This can be done both to improve efficiency and to get rid of inconsistencies .
Since relational model separates storage from presentation by using a built - in relation transformation language , SQL , any storage method is valid as long as it is able to construct the entities , attributes and relationships in their canonical form .
That 's why it makes no sense to speak of the entities , relationships and attributes in respect to the relational model .
These things are defined by the entity - relationship model .
The agricultural giant Monsanto may well still be the world 's most hated company .
The company that brought the world Agent Orange , the defoliant of choice in the Vietnam War , followed up a decade ago with a strident push to flood the world with genetically modified crops .
It alienated millions – and even its friends and rivals among GM supporters blamed Monsanto 's belligerence for putting back the cause by many years .
But I 'm going to ignore GMs and talk about water .
And belligerence .
In part , no doubt , to help salvage its GM - tarnished reputation , Monsanto now makes great play of its efforts to help engineer a second green revolution built around " sustainability " .
Sustainability is a much - abused term and it infiltrates almost every corner of the company 's website .
But to be fair they do try and define what the word means for its business .
The company promises that its " sustainable yield initiative " will " reduce by one - third per unit produced the aggregate amount of key resources such as land , water and energy , required to grow crops by 2030 . "
Many analysts now see water , rather than land , as the key limitation on growing food to feed a future world population of nine billion in the coming decades .
So a third more crop for the same amount of water is a valuable goal .
The company trumpets especially its work to engineer more water - efficient maize .
Of course , despite the company 's public pledge to " share knowledge and technology " the company 's corporate aim is to make sure that farmers buy Monsanto - patented water - efficient seeds by the trillion .
But you would expect Monsanto to be especially sensitive about how it manages water in its own farming operations , and particularly to show concern for how neighbouring farmers are facing up to water shortages .
Would n't you ?
The scene shifts to the Hawaiian island of Molokai .
This is an old stomping ground of Monsanto's .
It is the largest employer and the island is sometimes known as " the birthplace of biotechnology " and " the Silicon valley of the seed corn industry " .
This is where Monsanto does a lot of its research into GM crops such as maize , and where it grows many of the seeds it sells to farmers round the world .
Nature on Molokai has suffered badly from the invasion of Monsanto and other big - farm companies .
In recompense , Monsanto puts money into a Nature Conservancy programme on the island to " preserve biodiversity and protect water sources " .
The company has nonetheless gained a bad reputation there as a water bully .
As a local journalist wrote there last year in the Molokai Dispatch , " Monsanto 's thirst for more water " threatens its future on the island .
" Like most large corporations , Monsanto 's number one priority is to maximise profits .
In this case it means planting as many acres as possible , and using a lot of water , " wrote Todd Yamashita .
Recently , during a drought that emptied reservoirs and forced the local irrigation company to demand 20 % water cutbacks from all " non-homestead " users – that is , companies and some individuals ( local farmers and householders were excluded from the cuts ) – Monsanto was reported locally to have pressed the authorities for increased pumping from the Waikolo Valley , for which it proposed to pay the cost .
In law , two - thirds of the water from the Molokai irrigation system should go to homestead farmers .
In practice big landowners , especially Monsanto , take 84 % of the irrigation system 's water consumption .
Monsanto alone , according to Yamashita , takes almost twice as much water as all 200 homesteaders .
So I think I have this right .
In the cause of developing crops that will allow the world 's farmers to use less water , Monsanto is so overusing the water in its own backyard that local farmers are have resorted to legal action to get their water back .
As the Molokai Dispatch 's headline has it : " Monsanto could be its own worst enemy . "
Monsanto may have had a PR makeover , with its website featuring wind mills and lots of happy farmers tending healthy and well - watered crops .
But the reality down on the farm does n't seem to have changed so much .
• This article was amended 21 September 2009 .
The original said that Monsanto had lobbied for a new aquifer to be tapped .
In fact , there is one aquifer supplying water from the Waikolo Valley .
It was from that existing system that Monsanto sought additional pumping and offered to pay extra pumping costs .
The original article also said that drought led to the local irrigation company demanding 20 % water cutbacks from local farmers ; the water company 's cuts excluded householders and local farmers .
This has been corrected .
• Responding to this Greenwash article , Monsanto states that its activities have been portrayed in a one - sided way .
The comment thread has been reopened so that the company 's response can appear .

Harvard study finds nearly 45,000 excess deaths annually linked to lack of health coverage
Lack of health insurance now more lethal

A study published online today estimates nearly 45,000 annual deaths are associated with lack of health insurance .
That figure is about two and a half times higher than an estimate from the Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) in 2002 .
The new study , “ Health Insurance and Mortality in U.S. Adults , ” appears in today ’s online edition of the American Journal of Public Health .
The Harvard - based researchers found that uninsured , working - age Americans have a 40 percent higher risk of death than their privately insured counterparts , up from a 25 percent excess death rate found in 1993 .
Lead author Dr. Andrew Wilper , who worked at Harvard Medical School when the study was done and who now teaches at the University of Washington Medical School , said , “ The uninsured have a higher risk of death when compared to the privately insured , even after taking into account socioeconomics , health behaviors and baseline health .
We doctors have many new ways to prevent deaths from hypertension , diabetes and heart disease — but only if patients can get into our offices and afford their medications . ”
The study , which analyzed data from national surveys carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , assessed death rates after taking education , income and many other factors including smoking , drinking and obesity into account .
It estimated that lack of health insurance causes 44,789 excess deaths annually .
Previous estimates from the IOM and others had put that figure near 18,000 .
The methods used in the current study were similar to those employed by the IOM in 2002 , which in turn were based on a pioneering 1993 study of health insurance and mortality .
Deaths associated with lack of health insurance now exceed those caused by many common killers such as kidney disease .
An increase in the number of uninsured and an eroding medical safety net for the disadvantaged likely explain the substantial increase in the number of deaths associated with lack of insurance .
The uninsured are more likely to go without needed care .
Another factor contributing to the widening gap in the risk of death between those who have insurance and those who do n’t is the improved quality of care for those who can get it .
The research , carried out at the Cambridge Health Alliance and Harvard Medical School , analyzed U.S. adults under age 65 who participated in the annual National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys ( NHANES ) between 1986 and 1994 .
Respondents first answered detailed questions about their socioeconomic status and health and were then examined by physicians .
The CDC tracked study participants to see who died by 2000 .
The study found a 40 percent increased risk of death among the uninsured .
As expected , death rates were also higher for males ( 37 percent increase ) , current or former smokers ( 102 percent and 42 percent increases ) , people who said that their health was fair or poor ( 126 percent increase ) , and those that examining physicians said were in fair or poor health ( 222 percent increase ) .
Dr. Steffie Woolhandler , study co-author , professor of medicine at Harvard and a primary care physician in Cambridge , Mass . , noted : “ Historically , every other developed nation has achieved universal health care through some form of nonprofit national health insurance .
Our failure to do so means that all Americans pay higher health care costs , and 45,000 pay with their lives . ”
She added : “ Even the most liberal version of the House bill would have left 17 million uninsured , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
The whittled down Senate bill will be worse — leaving tens of millions uninsured , and tens of thousands dying because of lack of care .
Without the administrative savings only attainable through a Medicare - for - all , single - payer reform — real universal coverage will remain unaffordable .
Politicians are protecting insurance industry profits by sacrificing American lives . ”
Dr. David Himmelstein , study co-author and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard , remarked , “ The Institute of Medicine , using older studies , estimated that one American dies every 30 minutes from lack of health insurance .
Even this grim figure is an underestimate — now one dies every 12 minutes . ”

Thimerosal as a Preservative
Thimerosal is a mercury - containing organic compound ( an organomercurial ) .
Since the 1930s , it has been widely used as a preservative in a number of biological and drug products , including many vaccines , to help prevent potentially life threatening contamination with harmful microbes .
The documented antimicrobial properties of thimerosal contribute to the safe use of vaccines in multi- dose vials , and the ability to package certain vaccines , such as those for seasonal and pandemic influenza , in multi- dose vials helps facilitate immunization campaigns in the United States and globally that save lives .
However , the use of thimerosal as a preservative in U.S. FDA - licensed vaccines has significantly declined due to reformulation and development of new vaccines presented in single - dose containers .
Thimerosal , which is approximately 50 % mercury by weight , has been one of the most widely used preservatives in vaccines .
It is metabolized or degraded to ethylmercury and thiosalicylate .
Ethylmercury is an organomercurial that should be distinguished from methylmercury , a related substance that has been the focus of considerable study .
Methylmercury is the type of mercury found in certain kinds of fish .
At high exposure levels methylmercury can be toxic to people .
In the United States , federal guidelines keep as much methylmercury as possible out of the environment and food , but over a lifetime , everyone is exposed to some methylmercury .
At concentrations found in vaccines , thimerosal meets the requirements for a preservative as set forth by the United States Pharmacopeia ; that is , it kills the specified challenge organisms and is able to prevent the growth of the challenge fungi ( U.S. Pharmacopeia 2004 ) .
Thimerosal in concentrations of 0.001 % ( 1 part in 100,000 ) to 0.01 % ( 1 part in 10,000 ) has been shown to be effective in clearing a broad spectrum of pathogens .
A vaccine containing 0.01 % thimerosal as a preservative contains 50 micrograms of thimerosal per 0.5 mL dose or approximately 25 micrograms of mercury per 0.5 mL dose .
For comparison , this is roughly the same amount of elemental mercury contained in a 3 ounce can of tuna fish .
Prior to introduction of thimerosal in the 1930's , data were available in several animal species and humans providing evidence for its safety and effectiveness as a preservative ( Powell and Jamieson 1931 ) .
Since then , thimerosal has been the subject of numerous studies ( see Bibliography - Notable Studies and Assessments Supporting the Safe Use of Thimerosal in Vaccines ) and has a long record of safe and effective use preventing bacterial and fungal contamination of vaccines , with no ill effects established other than minor local reactions at the site of injection .
While the use of mercury - containing preservatives has declined in recent years due to the development of new products formulated into single - dose presentations that do not require preservatives , thimerosal has been used in some immune globulin preparations , anti-venins , skin test antigens , and ophthalmic and nasal products , in addition to some vaccines .
Under the FDA Modernization
Act of 1997 , the FDA compiled a list of regulated products containing mercury , including those with thimerosal ( Federal Register 1999 ) .
It is important to note that this list was compiled in 1999 ; some products listed are no longer manufactured and many products have been reformulated without thimerosal .

Other Preservatives
Phenol is used in a variety of consumer products including mouthwashes , throat lozenges , and throat sprays .
It is also currently used as a preservative in three FDA - approved available vaccines , Pneumovax 23 ( for prevention of pneumococcal disease caused by the 23 serotypes contained in the vaccine ) and Typhim Vi ( for prevention of typhoid fever ) and ACAM2000 ( for prevention of smallpox ) ; each of these vaccines contains 0.25 % phenol .
These vaccines are not recommended for routine use by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s ( CDC ) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) .
2 - Phenoxyethanol is an organic chemical compound that is sometimes used in cosmetics and antiseptics .
It is also currently used as a preservative in one FDA - approved available vaccine , Ipol , for the prevention of polio , at a concentration of 0.5 % .
Benzethonium chloride is a chemical that has antimicrobial properties .
It is used in over - the - counter hand and body washes .
This preservative is currently used in only one FDA - approved vaccine , BioThrax , for the prevention of disease caused by Bacillus anthracis .
BioThrax is not recommended for routine use by CDC’s ACIP .

Rationale for Preservatives in Vaccines
Preservatives may be defined as compounds that kill or prevent the growth of microorganisms , particularly bacteria and fungi .
They are used in vaccines to prevent microbial growth in the event that the vaccine is accidentally contaminated , as might occur with repeated puncture of multi- dose vials with a needle .
In some cases , preservatives are added during the manufacturing process to prevent microbial growth .
However , improvements in manufacturing technology have markedly decreased the need to add preservatives during the manufacturing process .
The United States Code of Federal Regulations ( the CFR ) requires , in general , the addition of a preservative to multi- dose vials of vaccines ; and , worldwide , preservatives are routinely added to multi- dose vials of vaccine .
Tragic consequences have followed the use of multi- dose vials that did not contain a preservative and have served as the impetus for this requirement .
One particularly telling incident from Australia is described by Sir Graham S. Wilson in his classic book , The Hazards of Immunization .
In January 1928 , in the early stages of an immunization campaign against diphtheria , Dr. Ewing George Thomson , Medical Officer of Health of Bundaberg , began the injection of children with toxin - antitoxin mixture .
The material was taken from an India - rubber - capped bottle containing 10 mL of TAM .
On the 17th , 20th , 21 , and 24th January , Dr. Thomson injected subcutaneously a total of 21 children without ill effect .
On the 27th an additional 21 children were injected .
Of these children : eleven died on the 28th and one on the 29th .
( Wilson 1967 )
This incident was investigated by a Royal Commission and the final sentence in the summary of their findings reads as follows :
The consideration of all possible evidence concerning the deaths at Bundeberg points to the injection of living staphylococci as the cause of the fatalities .
From this experience , the Royal Commission recommended that biological products in which the growth of a pathogenic organism is possible should not be issued in containers for repeated use unless there is a sufficient concentration of antiseptic ( preservative ) to inhibit bacterial growth .
The U.S. requirement for preservatives in multi-dose vaccines was incorporated into the CFR in January 1968 , although many biological products had contained preservatives , including thimerosal , prior to this date .
The risk of contamination of vaccines cannot be completely eliminated even with the use of preservatives .
The literature contains several reports of bacterial contamination of vaccines despite the presence of a preservative , emphasizing the need for meticulous attention to technique in withdrawing vaccines from multi- dose vials .
( Bernier et al 1981 ; Simon et al. 1993 ) .
The need for preservatives in multi- dose vials of vaccines is nonetheless clear .
It is important to note that the FDA does not license a particular preservative ; rather , the FDA evaluates safety and effectiveness data for the vaccine containing the preservative and makes a determination whether to issue a license for the vaccine .

FDA Actions Pertaining to Thimerosal in Vaccines
FDA has actively addressed the issue of thimerosal as a preservative in vaccines .
The use of thimerosal as a preservative in U.S. FDA - licensed vaccines has significantly declined due to reformulation and development of new vaccines presented in single - dose containers .
Under the FDA Modernization Act ( FDAMA ) of 1997 , the FDA conducted a comprehensive review of the use of thimerosal in childhood vaccines .
Conducted in 1999 , this review found no evidence of harm from the use of thimerosal as a vaccine preservative , other than local hypersensitivity reactions ( Ball et al. 2001 ) .
As part of the FDAMA review , the FDA evaluated the amount of mercury an infant might receive in the form of ethylmercury from vaccines under the U.S. recommended childhood immunization schedule and compared these levels with existing guidelines for exposure to methylmercury , as there are no existing guidelines for ethylmercury , the metabolite of thimerosal .
At the time of this review in 1999 , the maximum cumulative exposure to mercury from vaccines in the recommended childhood immunization schedule was within acceptable limits for the methylmercury exposure guidelines set by FDA , the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry , and the World Health Organization .
However , depending on the vaccine formulations used and the weight of the infant , some infants could have been exposed to cumulative levels of mercury during the first six months of life that exceeded Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) recommended guidelines for safe intake of methylmercury .
Other than allergic responses in some individuals , there was no known health risk from thimerosal - preservative at the concentration used in vaccines , but in 1999 , the Public Health Service ( including the FDA , National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , CDC , and Health Resources and Services Administration ( HRSA ) ) , along with the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) and the American Academy of Family Physicians ( AAFP ) concluded that because of scientific uncertainty at the time , as a precautionary measure , that it was prudent to reduce childhood exposure to mercury from all sources , including vaccines , as feasible .
On July 1 , 1999 , the FDA sent a letter to all licensed manufacturers of vaccines requesting their plans to remove thimerosal from U.S. licensed vaccines .
This step was taken because the elimination or reduction of mercury in vaccines was a feasible means of reducing an infant ’s total exposure to mercury in a world where other environmental sources of mercury are challenging to eliminate .
Much progress has been made in removing or reducing thimerosal in vaccines .
All vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and younger in the U.S. are available in formulations that do not contain thimerosal .
In addition , vaccines that do not contain thimerosal as a preservative are available for adolescents and adults .

No Link between Thimerosal in Vaccines and Autism
Although all vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and younger in the U.S. are available in formulations that do not contain thimerosal , thimerosal has a long record of safe and effective use in preventing bacterial and fungal contamination of vaccines , with no ill effects established other than hypersensitivity and minor local reactions at the site of injection .
There is a robust body of peer - reviewed , scientific studies conducted in the United States and countries around the world that support the safety of thimerosal - containing vaccines .
The scientific evidence collected over the past 15 years does not show any evidence of harm , including serious neurodevelopmental disorders , from use of thimerosal in vaccines .
Specifically , the Institute of Medicine ( now known as the National Academy of Medicine ) , and others have concluded that the evidence favors rejection of a link between thimerosal and autism .
Scientific studies of the risk of other serious neurodevelopmental disorders have failed to support a causal link with thimerosal .

Current Status of Thimerosal in Vaccines
The use of thimerosal as a preservative in U.S. FDA - licensed vaccines has significantly declined due to reformulation and development of new vaccines presented in single - dose containers .
All vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and younger in the U.S. are available in formulations that do not contain thimerosal .
As with pediatric vaccines , vaccines for adolescents and adults are available in formulations that do not contain thimerosal .
( Note - one vaccine , Tetanus and Diphtheria Toxoids Adsorbed , single - dose presentation , manufactured by Mass Biologics utilizes thimerosal as part of its manufacturing process , not as a preservative , and a trace remains in the final presentation ) .
FDA - approved seasonal influenza vaccines are available in single - dose presentations that do not contain thimerosal as a preservative for use in infants , children , adults , the elderly and pregnant women .
( Note - one vaccine , Fluvirin ’s single - dose presentation utilizes thimerosal as part of its manufacturing process , not as a preservative , and a trace remains in the final presentation ) .
Vaccines with trace amounts of thimerosal contain 1 microgram or less of mercury per dose .
The CDC ’s ACIP does not preferentially recommend vaccines that do not contain thimerosal for any populations .

No more FireWire or IR port
No external battery indicator
No Mini-DVI port , replaced by a Mini DisplayPort
i Fixit has highlighted several interesting aspects of the new design :
The new battery is only 5 more watt - hours than the previous version 's yet it adds two hours of run time , meaning the machine is markedly more efficient
The battery is actually lighter than the older model
Unlike the earlier model , AirPort and Bluetooth share the same board , and all three antenna cables route into the display , meaning a possible improvement in Bluetooth range
The MacBook has exactly the same GPU and CPU as the baseline 13 " MacBook Pro
Of course the Republicans are whining , but in all honesty this is nothing compared to what the Republicans have had to say about health care in general .

The big news this week on the financial front was the Independent ’s claim that Gulf Arabs and France , Japan , Russia and Japan were planning to move from buying oil in dollars to buying it in a basket of currencies , including gold and a new universal currency shared by the Gulf nations .
Buying oil in dollars is one of the foundations of the dollar ’s role as the world ’s primary reserve currency .
Because the the dollar is the world ’s primary reserve currency Americans have been able to borrow money for significantly less than other countries are able to .
This has both made America more prosperous , and through the perverse incentives of cheap money , helped lead to the high indebtedness of American citizens and the financial crisis .
In addition , buying oil in dollars is one of the things which allowed strong dollar policies to drive the price of oil down .
Making dollars extremely scarce in the 80’s and nineties was one key factor leading to a price per barrel under $ 20 .
Oil prices started their rise upwards after Greenspan ’s Federal Reserve let loose the money spigot in the Asian crisis and the Long Term Capital fiasco .
Greenspan essentially never took his foot off the pedal from that point onwards , and oil prices soared , until last year at one point they were over $ 150 / barrel .
So one consequence of going off the dollar is that a major benefit of the strong dollar play is taken off the table , and the US loses its ability to control the price of oil .
Since at this time , contrary to what the Feds are saying , a strong dollar play is n’t in the cards ( the US needs to borrow way too much money ) that ’s not a big deal in the short run — in the long run it is .
But buying oil in dollars is n’t the only thing that underpins the dollar as the world ’s reserve currency and to understand what buying oil in something other than dollars would mean we need to understand what else makes , or perhaps more accurately , made , the dollar so important .
Technological Revolutions : Remember the internet boom of the nineties ?
Remember the way that money flooded in from the rest of the world to buy up internet stocks ?
Sure , most of them turned out to be worthless , but some did n’t .
When the US was the nation most likely to create the next technological revolution you needed dollars so that when it occurred you could buy in on the ground floor .
Whether microcomputers in the 80’s or the internet in the 90’s , odds were that America was going to create the next big tech .
So foreigners needed to be in the dollar .
At this point the US is the undisputed leader in almost nothing except military tech .
As expected , US dominance of the arms sales market continues to increase , but the US ca n’t live on weapon sales alone .
In most other fields , including telecom , the internet , large chunks of biotech , renewable energy , ground transportation and so on the US now lags other modern economies .
The structure of the US economy , with a few large oligopolistic firms dominating the market in key fields need n’t necessarily mean no technological advances , after all Japan and Korea certainly have high concentrations of large firms , but US firms such as the telecom giants essentially do n’t engage in research , do n’t believe in upgrading infrastructure more than they have to and are rent seeking corporations — they provide an inferior product to a captive audience ( as with insurance companies ) knowing that Americans have no other options .
If they fail , they expect the US government to bail them out with huge subsidies .
This structure means that the US , is unlikely to be the home of the next great technological revolution .
The next tech reveolution could happen in the US , with the right policies , but the Obama administration has not engaged in those policies , instead spending trillions on propping up failed business models .
Consumers of Last and Main Resort :
For decades now Americans have bought a ton of consumer goods , from cars to electronics to clothes .
As time went by , more and more of these goods were bought from foreign countries , and more and more of it was bought on credit .
America and Americans have been the engine of development for Japan , the Asian Tigers , and most recently , China .
China , Japan and Korea , in particular , used mercantalist policies — that is to say they generally used trade barriers to protect their internal economy and subsidies to help their exports .
China ’s main trade barrier and subsidy is its massive interventions to keep the Yuan cheap against the dollar , an intervention which has amounted to as much as 10 % of China ’s GDP .
That intervention has left China with a huge number of dollars denominated assets .
In effect the Chinese loaned America the money to consume Chinese goods , which simultaneously made American manufactured goods uncompetitive which meant that manufacturing employment in American dropped like a rock while new factories opened in China rather than the US .
In exchange for the money they loaned America , China industrialized .
Even if they do n’t get most of the money back ( and they wo n’t ) it was a good deal for them .
As for Americans , well , Americans were able to live above their means — those who did n’t lose their jobs , anyway .
Many countries export a lot to the US .
While US consumers have pulled back significantly , they still consume a lot .
There is , as yet , no replacement for the US consumer .
China and other countries may wish there was , but there is n’t .
The American Security Product :
One of the main reasons other countries were willing to , in effect subsidize the US , for decades , is that it provided the common security product — against the Soviets , then against real rogue nations , and always against pirates .
In particular , America ’s navy is as large as the next 13 navies combined .
The US was responsible for keeping the world ’s shipping lines open , and it was the core of the NATO hammer when a problem needed to be dealt with ( for example , Serbia in the late nineties . )
But lately the US has n’t been delivering the product in a way that the rest of the world appreciates .
Most of “ old ” Europe ( ie. the countries with money and power ) opposed it .
So did most of Asia .
So did America ’s allies in the Middle East .
Once in Iraq , the US could n’t be defunded for fear of Iraq splintering , but now that it ’s clear the US is leaving anyway , the possibility exists .
And then there ’s the Somali pirates .
Because most of the US navy was occupied with the wars in Afghanistan , Pakistan and Iraq , the Somali pirates got completely out of hand and the US Navy did n’t do anything about it for a long long time .
When the issue was finally dealt with , the US navy was only one of a number of navies doing so .
The US let it get out of control , and then was n’t key to fighting it .
Now that the US no longer protects very well against the Soviets , rogue nations or pirates , and now that joint naval operations are how the Somali pirates are being dealt with , the rest of the world is wondering whether it ’s worth paying for a US military which does n’t do what they want it to do .
Only the Afghan war , which has elite support in Europe ( though not popular ) makes some think that perhaps the US is worth keeping on as the world ’s policeman .
Buying Key Technologies Required Dollars :
Yet another reason folks wanted to have lots of dollars and access to dollars was that you needed dollars to buy certain goods .
For decades the only good commercial jet liners were Americans .
Key computer technologies needed to be bought in dollars .
Intellectual property needed to be bought in dollars .
The best military technology had to be ( and still has to be ) bought in dollars .
And so on .
The US was n’t just home to the next technological revolution , it was home to all the good things you wanted to buy and which you could n’t buy in your currency .
This is , with a few exceptions , no longer true .
The Europeans and Japanese can sell you most high end capital goods .
There is no real difference between Airbus and Boeing products ( though both are essentially 30 year old technology ) .
The Chinese can and will sell you middle and low end goods for less than America .
You do n’t need dollars to buy most of what you need and want , and if something comes up really worth buying ( say General Motors ) well , if you ’re someone who really wants it , like the Chinese , you just wo n’t be allowed to buy it anyway .
( The Chinese would have loved to buy GM . )
A Safe Haven For Money and For You :
For decades , if you wanted a safe place to put your money and put it to work , the US was probably the best .
It was the most stable , it was impossible it could be conquered even if there was a World War III , it was the largest and could absorb the most money .
Likewise , if things went really bad in your country , it was a great place to flee to .
The financial crisis put the wisdom of placing your money in the US in question .
Bush era immigration and travel policies , not rescinded by the Obama administration , put the utility of the US as a safe haven in question as well .
And yet , to an extent , the US retains at least the first role , because there is simply no other country available .
Europe did not avoid the financial crisis , China does n’t allow that much investment in the country and is an unsafe place to put money , and so on .
So the US retains some safe haven appeal .
At the same time , however , foreign elites have become far more uneasy about the idea and want a different option .
And for themselves , they ’d rather vacation , have their second homes and educate their children in Europe .
And at last , back to oil :
Of course , the final and in some ways most important reason for the dollar ’s reserve currency status is that oil was sold in dollars .
This is a result of a decades long understanding between the key Gulf States , Saudi Arabia and America that the US both underwrote their security and could knock them over any time it wanted .
In exchange for America ’s security umbrella and help in maintaining their regimes , oil was priced in dollars .
When they became rich in the 70s , their money flooded primarily through US banks .
Indeed , in prior years , every time an OPEC nation talked about going off the dollar as the currency for buying oil , rumor has it that the Saudis were the ones to spike the move .
Oil is the most important commodity in the world .
Ultimately all economies are underpinned by oil .
Oil is also the most important military resource .
With oil your army can move and fight .
Without it , it can ’t .
In many ways WWII was fought for oil and with oil , and the powers with the oil defeated those which did n’t have it .
Which brings us back to the US military product .
As long as oil is priced in dollars , the US military can always function at full capacity , because if push comes to shove , the US can always just print more dollars .
If oil is not priced in dollars , then certain US access to oil is removed — both for the military and for the civilian population .
Sure , the US can still print more dollars , but if oil is n’t priced in dollars , well , print too much and you may get inflation , even hyperinflation .
And if the oilarchies do n’t approve of a particular military action , well , they can make it much more expensive .
Are the Dollar ’s Days as Reserve Currency Over ?
No .
They are n’t .
But they are numbered .
They are n’t over because other nations still need the US consumer .
Until the Chinese manage to create a domestic consumer society , both they and other countries ca n’t cut themselves lose from the US consumer .
What they will do , and what they are doing , is trying to manage how much the US borrows and to take away the US ability control the world ’s money supply .
They will still have to keep the US propped up for the time being , because in so doing they are propping up themselves .
And remember always that Chinese citizens are n’t like Americans .
Take their jobs or their land or their hope and they get violent — very violent .
They have , do and will fight both the police and the military .
China ’s elites know that if they do n’t keep economic growth coming , their heads could literally wind up rolling .
In addition , while no one is happy with the US security product , the fact is that no one can really replace it .
The European military is not strong enough , and their navy does not have the projection ability .
Likewise with the Chinese military , who in any are n’t trusted half as much as the Europeans , though their moral flexibility is appreciated by many regimes , who still understand you do n’t invite China to station large number of troops in your country if you have half a brain .
Likewise , there is simply no replacement for the US as a haven of last resort .
China ’s currency and investment controls make it unsuitable .
Europe managed its financial affairs no better than the US over the last decade , although they seem to have learned the regulatory lessons marginally better than the US .
If you need a place to store your money , and put it to work , the US may not look good , but neither does anyone else who is large enough to absorb large amounts of money .
The key break point , the end of the dollar hegemony , will come when the Chinese are able to move to a consumer economy .
At that point , the Chinese will no longer need America as consumers , and they will let the Yuan float .
The devastation this will wreck on the US economy is hard to overstate .
Standards of living will crash .
In the long run , being forced to live within its means , and no longer having to compete against massively subsidized foreign goods may turn out to be good for the US , but that wo n’t make you feel better as your effective income collapses or you lose your job .
This is probably two economic cycles out .
We ’re talking 12 to 16 years .
So there ’s time yet .
Probably .
So what does oil not being priced in dollars mean to me now ?
Less money for everything .
The US will not be able to afford as large a stimulus as it should have .
It will mean borrowing costs higher than they would otherwise have been and more restricted credit ( sure , theoretical interest rates may be low , but can you get a loan at those rates ? )
Oil prices , and gas prices will be more volatile for the US than they were before , which is saying something .
And other countries will get more oil , relatively speaking .
Which means they will get more growth .
They will receive more investment from the oilarchies , and the US will receive less .
Relatively speaking the US economy will not be as good as it was .
This is a marginal effect , but marginal effects add up .
This is , in short , not good news .
You wo n’t be able to say “ I lost my job because oil is n’t priced in dollars ” but it will be true for some people .
Lower wages , more restricted credit , and more restricted government policy will be the price paid for the massive incompetence which lead to this moment .
And yet this does have a silver lining .
Both for other countries who deserve to be able to pay in their own currencies and for America and Americans , who need to learn to live within their means , to emphasize production again rather than consumption and who need to wean off of oil as much as possible in any case .
But it will hurt .
Irish PM ' delighted and relieved ' at release of Sharon Commins and Ugandan colleague Hilda Kawuki from captivity in Darfur
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
An Irish aid worker and her Ugandan colleague have been released from captivity four months after being kidnapped in Sudan .
Sharon Commins and Hilda Kawuki were freed following negotiations with local tribal chiefs in war - torn Darfur .
Ireland 's ambassador to Sudan , Gerry Corr , is today on his way to Darfur to meet both women .
The Irish foreign minister , Michael Martin , said he was delighted to hear that Commins , from Dublin , and her colleague had been released .
Martin praised the two women 's courage and resilience and paid tribute to the family of Sharon Commins , saying they had behaved with dignity and fortitude .
The two workers with the Irish aid agency Goal spent the longest time in captivity that any foreign aid staff had endured in Darfur since the civil war erupted in 2003 .
Sharon Commins 's mother , Agatha , said she had spoken to her daughter and that she was exhausted .
" Oh my God , can you imagine , we just leapt out of bed when we heard the phone , " she said .
" We were just absolutely overjoyed . "
The family was informed of the release by Sudan 's humanitarian affairs minister , Abdel Baqi Gilani .
The Irish prime minister , Brian Cowen , said he was " absolutely delighted and relieved " to receive news of the release .
The taoiseach passed on his " warm congratulations to everyone involved in bringing about Sharon and Hilda 's freedom " .
Goal 's director , John O'Shea , said : " A sense of overwhelming relief and joy has descended upon all of us .
We are especially happy and pleased for the families of both Hilda and Sharon who have suffered so much .
" I spoke with Sharon earlier this morning and she sounded wonderful .
Hilda and herself have suffered a traumatic ordeal ‑ but happily both have had the strength and courage to come through it . "
From Drew DeSilver at the Seattle Times : Reckless strategies doomed WaMu
This is the first of two parts .
Here is a section on loose lending :
" The big saying was ' A skinny file is a good file , ' " said Nancy Erken , a WaMu loan consultant in Seattle .
She recalled helping credit - challenged borrowers collect canceled checks , explanatory letters and other documentation that they could afford their loans .
" I 'd take the files over to the processing center in Bellevue and they 'd tell me ' Nancy , why do you have all this stuff in here ?
We 're just going to take this stuff and throw it out , ' " she said .
In time , WaMu even began allowing low - or no-documentation option ARMs , piling risk on risk .
The loose standards spread through the company like a flu virus .
In an internal newsletter dated Oct. 31 , 2005 , and obtained by The Seattle Times , risk managers were told they needed to " shift ( their ) ways of thinking " away from acting as a " regulatory burden " on the company 's lending operations and toward being a " customer service " that supported WaMu 's five - year growth plan .
Risk managers were to rely less on examining borrowers ' documentation individually and more on automated processes , Melissa Martinez , WaMu 's chief compliance and risk oversight officer , wrote in the memo .
...
" The whole tone it set was that ' Maybe the next file I review I should pull back , hold off on downgrading ( a loan ) , not take a sharp pencil to what production was doing , ' " [ Dale George , a former senior credit - risk officer in Irvine , Calif . ] said .
" They were n't going to have risk management get in the way of what they wanted to do , which was basically lend the customers more money . "
And on risk management :
Ouch .
There is much more in the article - on Option ARMs , switching to originate - to - sell and more ...
WaMu was definitely " doomed " .
This , just in from The Times , could perhaps be described as ' less than flattering ' ; http://entertainment.timesonline.co...ainment/music/live_reviews/article6894036.ece
When Morrissey collapsed onstage during a gig in Swindon last weekend , his public momentarily dealt with the possible death of England ’s poet laureate of eternal teenagers .
And perhaps there was something highly appropriate about the fact that he was helped off the stage midway through a version of This Charming Man .
The song was the Smiths ’ second single , and many will recall the band ’s iconic performance of it on Top of the Pops .
Morrissey stood , shirt open , displaying a bounty of vintage necklaces in the pink studio lights singing lines such as “ Will nature make a man of me yet ? ”
Swinging his signature gladioli as he went , he was filled with a dandyish joie de vivre .
Here at the Albert Hall he resumed the song that he failed to finish in Swindon ( owing to “ breathing difficulties ” ) , but in doing so he showed the lifetime that had passed since those early halcyon days .
The guitarist Boz Boorer ’s booming , heavy - handed electric guitar had replaced Johnny Marr ’s breezy , lightly strummed acoustic .
It was the sort of mindless riffing that you would get in a Camden dive bar of a Friday night .
Times Archive , 1984 : The Smiths live at the LyceumMorrissey is an extraordinary performer on his day - dishevelled , articulate and wryly sardonicBut the treatment of the song was n’t the only thing that was bloated .
Morrissey was dressed like a headmaster at the weekend : suit jacket , jeans and loafers .
More alarmingly , he spent the evening looking unhealthy and uncomfortable .
“ Fasten your seatbelts , it ’s going to be a bumpy night , ” he told the crowd .
He was right , but not for the right reasons .
The sea-change was confirmed by a retooling of another Smiths classic , the ode to loneliness How Soon is Now .
Stark lyrical changes to the song included the line : “ There ’s a club if you ’d like to go , you could meet somebody who can actually stand you /
So you go and you stand on your own and leave on your own .
What a big surprise .
” At the song ’s close he re-enacted the Swindon incident , curving up into the foetal position under the spotlight as a gong crashed behind him .
“ Thank you Swindon , ” he said when he finally stood up .
It was more eerie pantomime than postmodern brilliance .
Apparently the permanently adolescent victim had finally become the misanthropic old cynic , and it was n’t pretty .
The moments where the songs transcended their special circumstances were rare .
A chestbeater such as English Blood Irish Heart was rousing , while the indefatigable I ’m Throwing My Arms Around Paris was saved by a lovely chorus .
The rest of his set was filled with too many plodding , obscure solo songs that swiftly altered the mood from Lazarus - style resurrection to elongated wake .
You were left pondering the brilliance of Morrissey ’s earlier career .
“ Three years ago , he was a strong proponent for universal health care , and I accused him of , after 20 years , dithering on that topic , ” said Ned Lamont , the liberal Connecticut businessman who beat Lieberman in the 2006 Democratic primary but lost the general election .
“ As far as I can tell , a filibuster is one more dither , to quote the former vice president ” ( Dick Cheney ) .
Democratic insiders were less disappointed , saying Lieberman has been clear about his objections for weeks .
Reid “ was not surprised by these comments , ” said a Democratic leadership aide .
“ This has been [ Lieberman ’s ] private view for months . ”
Lieberman and Reid both acknowledged that he was n’t the only Democrat with serious reservations about the public option , but the other members are fence sitters , not firm “ no ” votes like Lieberman .
Sens. Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Evan Bayh of Indiana are among several Democrats who have left open the possibility of voting against Reid on procedural questions .
Reid , for his part , shrugged off Lieberman ’s remarks , saying he had always factored in the senator ’s concerns .
“ I do n’t have anyone that I have worked harder with , have more respect for in the Senate , than Joe Lieberman , ” he said Tuesday afternoon .
“ As you know , he ’s my friend .
There are a lot of senators , Democrats and Republicans , who do n’t like part of what ’s in this bill that we sent over to [ the Congressional Budget Office ] .
We ’re going to see what the final product is .
We ’re not there yet .
Sen .
Lieberman will let us get on [ to begin debating ] the bill , and he ’ll be involved in the amendment process . ”
Senate Republicans — whose nearly unanimous opposition to all Democratic plans has put them on the sidelines — sought to portray procedural votes as up - or - down votes , invoking John Kerry ’s much - ridiculed “ flip - flop ” on Iraq .
“ I think it ’s appropriate to make the point at the outset that a vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to this bill will be treated as a vote on the merits of the bill , ” Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) told reporters at the Capitol on Tuesday .
“ We all recall Sen .
Kerry ’s strained way in the 2004 campaign of explaining why he voted for it before he voted against , and I think it is perfectly clear that most Americans will treat the vote to get on [ with ] the bill as a vote on the substance of the bill , ” added McConnell .

In a guest post at Boycott Boycott Novell I ’ve written about my frustration with so - called “ Free Software Fundamentalists ” .
My main problem with them is that they keep insisting in not using proprietaryware , at all , rather than improving Free Software till it actually becomes the norm .
Now , one thing that might be difficult to understand is that , no matter how hard you try , it ’s near impossible to not use any kind of proprietary software nowadays .
And while I ’m one who fights with all his force to make sure that we have Free Software alternatives in such a state that it can be used in as many things as possible , I do n’t try to fight the presence of the other kind of software .
I might argue which one between their and my methods is the one that can reach the goal better , but that ’s not what I wanted to write about right now .
For now I just wanted to note how impossible it is to not rely at least in part in proprietary , closed - source software ( this also ties with an older post of mine about updates ) :
do you have a cellphone ?
unless you ’re running stuff like OpenMoko , I doubt you have it pure free software , since even Nokia ’s N900 has quite a few proprietary components ;
okay so cellphones are evil , but do you have a standard phone ?
remember : if it has an address book it has a firmware on it ( and even if it does n’t it might have a firmware to manage some functions ) ;
do you have a VCR ?
a DVD player ?
a DivX player ?
Is any of that running on a free software firmware ?
cable or satellite TV ?
Sky ( UK and Italy ) definitely have firmware in their decoders ( there is also some documentation about GPL violations in satellite decoders ) ;
not even that , a simple TV ?
You know , not only they have firmware now , but they also come with an upgradable firmware ( at least , my Sony Bravia does ) ; some TVs also have free software on them ( Sharp I happen to remember ) , although I highly doubt they have no proprietary bits in them ; heck , remote controls have firmware as well , at least the programmable ones ;
any game console ?
none that I know run on pure free software ;
computers usually have proprietary BIOS , but coreboot is working to replace that ; and at the same time we know of many projects working on replacing firmware for wifi cards ( although I still ca n’t understand ; why replacing a wifi card ’s firmware , but not the SATA controller firmware ? ) ; laptops , on the other hand have a lot of components with firmware on them ; for instance I remember Lenovo laptops having firmware to control the fans and similar subsystems ; and I ’m pretty sure “ smart batteries ” have firmware as well ; UPSes have firmware ; external drive enclosures have firmware ( and there , replacing the firmware with some free software would definitely be useful , given how many bugs the Genesys Logic firmware has ! ) ; even keyboards have firmware , at least Apple ’s and probably Logitech ’s as well ; bluetooth dongles have firmware ; harddrives and SSDs have firmware ;
so okay , you use no external hard drive , a motherboard supported by coreboot and so on , your computer is fine ; what about the monitor connected to it ?
and finally , if you ’re not using computers ( so what are you doing advocating free software ? ) ; are you using a modern microwave oven , dishwasher or washing machine ?
While there are still lots of those appliances that use no computer - like parts , and thus no firmware , quite a lot of the new ones use firmware which is proprietary ; I actually find those quite obnoxious because , for instance , you cannot self - repair your washing machine if the mainboard fries up ; the firmware ( proprietary ) has to be flashed in ; and to make it even more impossible , they have to flash it with a special dongle , and a special phone , with UMTS connection ;
So really , are you using any proprietaryware at all ?
If so , stop harassing my freedom of choice for a supposedly higher freedom .
It was pouring rain just after 1 p.m. Monday , July 20 , when a man burst into a Honduran grocery store on NW 36th Street in Miami .
A shirt was wrapped around his face as he gripped a black semiautomatic handgun .
Twenty - year - old Charles Bell shoved the pistol into the face of a manager behind the counter .
Then he demanded the contents of the cash register and cartons of cigarettes in a plastic bag .
Next he began herding customers to the back of the small market .
But when he returned to the counter to collect his loot , a short , well - built 24 - year - old manager named Valentin Fiallos pointed a .38 and squeezed the trigger .
As Bell scampered from the store , he turned and shot back several times .
Fiallos , shielding himself , squeezed off several more rounds .
Info vigilante store clerks
The would - be robber missed every time , but the manager 's aim was true .
Bell burst out of the store and ran several steps before flopping onto the wet asphalt .
A bullet to the chest killed him .
Cops termed it " justifiable homicide . "
The ruling is backed up by former Gov. Jeb Bush 's 2005 " Stand Your Ground " law , which offers wide - ranging legal protection to violent - crime victims who open fire on their aggressors before trying to make peace .
All over South Florida , besieged employees are shooting back .
A few blood - soaked examples :
• On August 12 , 2007 , a 54 - year - old Pembroke Pines Super Stop clerk pulled a handgun on a shotgun - wielding pair of robbers , killing one .
• A month later , a clerk at OG's Corner Urban Wear in Oakland Park shot and whacked a 17 - year - old robber .
• Two months after that , the manager of a Naranja grocery store killed a 14 - year - old ski-masked robber strapped with what turned out to be a BB gun .
• In August last year , a Miami Gardens videogame store manager was murdered in a shootout after he nailed one of three armed robbers .
• And here 's a departure from the model .
At a Biscayne Boulevard Burger King this past March , a customer with a permitted Glock ended the life of an armed robber in a firefight .
The vigilante sustained hits from several bullets and is currently wrapping up physical therapy .
Then there was last month 's case of Fiallos killing Bell , which inspired a New Times road trip to find out more about clerks who shoot back .
They never know who might walk in when that little bell on the door rings .
First stop was the Pembroke Pines Stop - N - Go , where in December 2008 , gas station manager Shedahe Abdel pulled a .45 from a side holster and wounded two armed gunmen .
The burly 43 - year - old Venezuelan immigrant keeps a clean shop and treats everybody , including shoplifters he catches on camera , with courtesy .
But in the nine years he has managed Stop - N - Go stores , Abdel says , he has been targeted by armed robbers three times .
The first two times , he cleaned out the cash register with no hesitation , but his wife and daughter were working in the store with him the second time .
" I saw them lying on the floor crying , " he recalls , " and I realized I had to buy the gun . "
So Abdel purchased a .45 Kimber for $ 1,100 , took gun-handling classes , and read up on self - defense laws .
" My boss said , ' Why do you want to make a problem ? '
But I told him : ' I have to protect myself and my family . ' "
The small black handgun remains holstered under his T - shirt , with the safety off .
When robbers stormed his gas station that Monday in December , he did n't plan on drawing the weapon until they demanded cash from a safe that does n't exist .
He feared they might shoot a customer or his cowering wife and daughter .
So he dodged the gunman 's aim , plugged him in the arm , and then turned to fire a shot into the accomplice 's leg .
As one of the wounded gunmen dashed from the store , Abdel tended to the accomplice , 20 - year - old Joshua Hammond , who was writhing on the ground with a leg wound .
" He told me : ' Call my daddy , ' " recalls the manager .
" The moment happens so fast , and you 're so scared .
Afterwards , you try to remember , If you did n't shoot him first ...
But then it 's just , Oh , man , why did I do that ? "
Abdel pulls out a surprising document — a missive of gratitude from Hammond 's grandmother , handwritten on yellow lined paper and dated December 30 , 2008 , the day after the shooting .
" I am sending you this letter because I want to apologize for the actions my grandson Joshua Hammond took toward you and your customers , " wrote Shirley Riettie .
" I am very grateful that you did n't take his life .
I know it would have been justified . "
Next is a Quik Stop on NE Second Avenue at 29th Street in Miami .
It 's home to a check - cashing counter , so the place is usually bustling .
Manning the counter is Wilfredo Linares , an animated co-owner with gel - plastered hair , a sinewy frame , and an undying affection for the large black Glock tucked under the register .
In late 2007 , he says , a beefy 44 - year - old man named Anthony Tice cashed a $ 435 paycheck — and must have watched Linares pull big bills from one of two Dutch Master boxes under the counter .
Twenty minutes later ,
Tice returned with a shirt over his face and a gun in his hand .
Tice put the black metal snout to Linares 's temple and demanded both cigar boxes , says the co-owner .
Then he made off with around $ 7,000 .
The store owner gave Tice 's photo and driver 's license information , all stored in his computer webcam , to police .
Two weeks later , though , Tice was still a free man .
He came back — to cash another check .
Linares 's stepbrother , who was behind the counter , whipped out the Glock to keep Tice in the store while Linares called the cops .
Tice , already a multiple felon with grand theft auto and cocaine possession convictions on his record , was n't packing .
He stuck around until police carted him off .
Trial for the robbery is scheduled later this month .
If ever a screenshot could be called prescient …
A few weeks back , Australian censorship body the OFLC ( here represented by the chap smacking Australia in the gob ) refused to classify Left 4 Dead 2 , banning the game from being sold anywhere in the country .
In the OFLC ’s view , the zombie shooter “ contains violence that is high in impact and is therefore unsuitable for persons aged under 18 to play . ”
Publisher EA and developer Valve are still in the process of appealing this decision , but if that falls through ( a verdict is due on October 22 ) , Valve has a solution : censor the hell out of its game .
Valve ’s Gabe Newell has revealed that a heavily edited version of Left 4 Dead 2 has now been submitted , and has passed the OFLC test gaining an MA15 + rating .
Says Newell :
“ We think Left 4 Dead 2 is a lot of fun .
It ’s a game for adults .
But we ’re aware that different countries have different restrictions , and we want to make the choices that make the game the most fun for that country . ”
As it turns out , some big cuts have been made in this sanitized version .
News.com.au reports that the OFLC found “ the game no longer contains depictions of decapitation , dismemberment , wound detail or piles of dead bodies lying about the environment . ”
So Left 4 Dead 2 WILL be coming out in Oz now , though it ’s likely to be a nicer , less gory version , with more kittens or something .
The original build could still make it out , but we wo n’t know until a decision is made on EA and Valve ’s appeal .
It ’s plain which version Valve want to see released , and Newell was quite clear about this :
“ Our goal is not to ship this second version .
The goal , of course , is to get the original version through the Board via the appeal process .
If that fails , then the edited version is the back - up plan . ”
Obviously , the elephant in the room is the OFLC ’s inefficient rating system .
Australia desperately needs an R18 classification for games , and until that happens , expect this story to be repeated again and again .

EE.UU . atrae menos a los mexicanos
Pie de foto ,
El flujo de migrantes desde México hacia Estados Unidos alcanzó su nivel más bajo en el último año .
Florencio Cortés , campesino de Oaxaca , al suroeste de México , planeaba viajar sin visa a Estados Unidos cuando supo que hay pocos empleos para los indocumentados .
Canceló el viaje .
Sidronio Rivera también se quedó , porque tuvo miedo de ser detenido por la Patrulla Fronteriza .
Como ellos , miles de mexicanos dejaron de cruzar sin documentos la frontera norte del país .
Un estudio elaborado para la BBC por el Instituto de Políticas Migratorias , MPI por sus siglas en inglés , reveló que en los últimos tres años el número de nuevos migrantes de México hacia Estados Unidos bajó considerablemente , al pasar de 653.000 entre marzo de 2004 y marzo de 2005 , a sólo 175.000 en el mismo periodo de 2008 y 2009 .
Es la cifra más baja de la década , y de acuerdo con el estudio la caída se debe , entre otros factores , a la crisis económica en Estados Unidos , algo en lo que coinciden las autoridades mexicanas .
“ Hay pocas probabilidades de conseguir empleo y entonces desaparece el incentivo para emigrar al norte ” , le dijo a BBC Mundo Félix Vélez , secretario general del Consejo Nacional de Población ( Conapo ) .
Según analistas , un elemento adicional es el endurecimiento de la política migratoria de la Casa Blanca , que hizo más difícil cruzar la frontera sin documentos .
Balance cero
El estudio de MPI expuso además un dramático aumento en el desempleo de los migrantes mexicanos y los originarios de Centroamérica .
Pie de foto , A raíz de la crisis , ha aumentado la vigilancia en la frontera entre México y EE.UU .
La tasa de desocupación de los indocumentados fue , hasta junio , de 11,4 % , mientras que el promedio de desempleo entre los trabajadores estadounidenses fue de 9,5 puntos .
A pesar del adverso clima laboral , muchos decidieron permanecer en ese país , sobre todo los originarios de México .
De acuerdo con el estudio , a partir de 2006 se registró un descenso en el número de migrantes mexicanos .
El secretario de Conapo dijo que , este año , el flujo migratorio fue cercano a cero , es decir , que la cantidad de personas que emigraron fue prácticamente igual a la de quienes volvieron
“ No tiene precedentes , antes salían más personas de las que llegaban ” , recordó Vélez .

Círculo migratorio
Algunos especialistas han dicho que , tradicionalmente , la migración mexicana era como un círculo : los indocumentados trabajaban una temporada en Estados Unidos , regresaban a sus comunidades y luego emprendían camino al norte .
Ya no más .
Desde hace varios años Washington aumentó la vigilancia en su frontera , ordenó redadas en ciudades con alta población latina y aplicó sanciones a los empleadores de indocumentados .
A esta política disuasiva se sumó , primero , el riesgo de cruzar por zonas peligrosas , como el desierto de Arizona , y el aumento de secuestros de migrantes por bandas ligadas al narcotráfico .
La migración se encareció .
“ Antes cruzar la frontera costaba US $ 200 , ahora pagas hasta US $ 5.000 , y los centroamericanos el doble ” , dijo Jorge Durand , investigador de la Universidad de Guadalajara en conversación con BBC Mundo .
“ ¿A que me voy ? ”
El caso de los migrantes mexicanos es similar a los provenientes de Centroamérica , quienes deben cruzan por México para llegar a Estados Unidos , explicó el secretario de Conapo .
Por eso bajó el número de capturas de indocumentados en territorio mexicano : si no hay empleos en Estados Unidos , no hay razón para salir de sus países , añadió .
Es un nuevo círculo migratorio , señaló Durand : los migrantes latinos ya no regresan , no hay empleos suficientes y se cierra la puerta a nuevos migrantes .
También bajan las remesas , que en muchos casos costeaban el viaje a otros indocumentados , dijo el investigador .
Florencio Cortés sabe de eso .
En su familia era tradición que los emigrados contrataran al “ coyote ” ( traficante de personas ) para asegurar el viaje de sus paisanos .
Everyone can agree that 1+1=2 .
But the idea that 7 is greater than 13 -- that some numbers are luckier than others -- makes no sense to some people .
Such numerical biases can cause deep divisions .
And that is what happened earlier this month in Hong Kong .
Property developer Henderson Land Development Co. made news for selling a condominium ...
It was a long time since the Bustler had been so silent .
She lay in the Sirian spaceport , her tubes cold , her shell particle - scarred , her air that of a long - distance runner exhausted at the end of a marathon .
There was good reason for this : she had returned from a lengthy trip by no means devoid of troubles .
Now , in port , well - deserved rest had been gained if only temporarily .
Peace , sweet peace .
No more bothers , no more crises , no more major upsets , no more dire predicaments such as crop up in free flight at least twice a day .
Just peace .
Hah !
Captain McNaught reposed in his cabin , feet up on desk , and enjoyed the relaxation to the utmost .
The engines were dead , their hellish pounding absent for the first time in months .
Out there in the big city , four hundred of his crew were making whoopee under a brilliant sun .
This evening , when First Officer Gregory returned to take charge , he was going to go into the fragrant twilight and make the rounds of neon - lit civilization .
That was the beauty of making landfall at long last .
Men could give way to themselves , blow off surplus steam , each according to his fashion .
No duties , no worries , no dangers , no responsibilities in spaceport .
A haven of safety and comfort for tired rovers .
Again , hah !
Burman , the chief radio officer , entered the cabin .
He was one of the half - dozen remaining on duty and bore the expression of a man who can think of twenty better things to do .
" Relayed signal just come in , sir . "
Handing the paper across , he waited for the other to look at it and perhaps dictate a reply .
Taking the sheet , McNaught removed the feet from his desk , sat erect , and read the message aloud .
Terran Headquarters to Bustler .
Remain Siriport pending further orders .
Rear Admiral Vane W. Cassidy due there seventeenth .
Feldman .
Navy Op. Command , Sirisec .
He looked up , all happiness gone from his leathery features , and groaned .
" Something wrong ? " asked Burman , vaguely alarmed .
McNaught pointed at three thin books on his desk .
" The middle one .
Page twenty . "
Leafing through it , Burman found an item that said : Vane W. Cassidy , R - Ad. Head Inspector Ships and Stores .
Burman swallowed hard .
" Does that mean ? " " Yes , it does , " said McNaught without pleasure .
" Back to training - college and all its rigmarole .
Paint and soap , spit and polish . "
He put on an officious expression , adopted a voice to match it .
" Captain , you have only seven ninety - nine emergency rations .
Your allocation is eight hundred .
Nothing in your logbook accounts for the missing one .
Where is it ?
What happened to it ?
How is it that one of the men's kit lacks an officially issued pair of suspenders ?
Did you report his loss ? "
" Why does he pick on us ? " asked Burman , appalled .
" He 's never chivvied us before . "
" That 's why , " informed McNaught , scowling at the wall .
" It 's our turn to be stretched across the barrel . "
His gaze found the calendar .
" We have three days and we 'll need 'em !
Tell Second Officer
Pike to come here at once . "
Burman departed gloomily .
In short time , Pike entered .
His face reaffirmed the old adage that bad news travels fast .
" Make out an indent , " ordered McNaught , " for one hundred gallons of plastic paint , Navy gray , approved quality .
Make out another for thirty gallons of interior white enamel .
Take them to spaceport stores right away .
Tell them to deliver by six this evening along with our correct issue of brushes and sprayers .
Grab up any cleaning material that 's going for free . "
" The men wo n't like this , " remarked Pike , feebly .
" They 're going to love it , " McNaught asserted .
" A bright and shiny ship , all spic and span , is good for morale .
It says so in that book .
Get moving and put those indents in .
When you come back , find the stores and equipment sheets and bring them here .
We 've got to check stocks before Cassidy arrives .
Once he's here we 'll have no chance to make up shortages or smuggle out any extra items we happened to find in our hands . "
" Very well , sir . "
Pike went out wearing the same expression as Burman's .
Lying back in his chair , McNaught muttered to himself .
There was a feeling in his bones that something was sure to cause a last - minute ruckus .
A shortage of any item would be serious enough unless covered by a previous report .
A surplus would be bad , very bad .
The former implied carelessness or misfortune .
The latter suggested barefaced theft of government property in circumstances condoned by the commander .
For instance , there was that recent case of Williams of the heavy cruiser Swift .
He 'd heard of it over the spacevine when out around Bootes .
Williams had been found in unwitting command of eleven reels of electric - fence wire when his official issue was ten .
It had taken a court - martial to decide that the extra reel which had formidable barter - value on a certain planet had not been stolen from space - stores , or , in sailor jargon , " teleportated aboard . "
But Williams had been reprimanded .
And that did not help promotion .
He was still rumbling discontentedly when Pike returned bearing a folder of foolscap sheets .
" Going to start right away , sir ? "
" We 'll have to . "
He heaved himself erect , mentally bid good - bye to time off and a taste of the bright lights .
" It 'll take long enough to work right through from bow to tail .
I 'll leave the men's kit inspection to the last . "
Marching out of the cabin , he set forth toward the bow , Pike following with broody reluctance .
As they passed the open main lock , Peaslake observed them , bounded eagerly up the gangway and joined behind .
A pukka member of the crew , he was a large dog whose ancestors had been more enthusiastic than selective .
He wore with pride a big collar inscribed : Peaslake Property of S.S. Bustler .
His chief duties , ably performed , were to keep alien rodents off the ship and , on rare occasions , smell out dangers not visible to human eyes .
The three paraded forward , McNaught and Pike in the manner of men grimly sacrificing pleasure for the sake of duty , Peaslake with the panting willingness of one ready for any new game no matter what .
Reaching the bow - cabin , McNaught dumped himself in the pilot 's seat , took the folder from the other .
" You know this stuff better than me the chart room is where I shine .
So I 'll read them out while you look them over . "
He opened the folder , started on the first page .
" K1 . Beam compass , type D , one of . "
" Check , " said Pike .
" K2 . Distance and direction indicator , electronic , type JJ , one of . "
" Check . "
" K3 . Port and starboard gravitic meters , Casini models , one pair . "
" Check . "
Peaslake planted his head in McNaught 's lap , blinked soulfully and whined .
He was beginning to get the others ' viewpoint .
This tedious itemizing and checking was a hell of a game .
McNaught consolingly lowered a hand and played with Peaslake 's ears while he ploughed his way down the list .
" K187 .
Foam rubber cushions , pilot and co-pilot , one pair . "
" Check . "
· · · · ·
By the time First Officer Gregory appeared , they had reached the tiny intercom cubby and poked around it in semidarkness .
Peaslake had long departed in disgust .
" M24 .
Spare minispeakers , three inch , type T2 , one set of six . "
" Check . "
Looking in , Gregory popped his eyes and said , " What 's going on ? " " Major inspection due soon . "
McNaught glanced at his watch .
" Go see if stores has delivered a load and if not why not .
Then you 'd better give me a hand and let Pike take a few hours off . "
" Does this mean land - leave is canceled ? "
" You bet it doesuntil after Hizonner has been and gone . "
He glanced at Pike .
" When you get into the city , search around and send back any of the crew you can find .
No arguments or excuses .
Also no alibis and / or delays .
It 's an order . "
Pike registered unhappiness .
Gregory glowered at him , went away , came back and said , " Stores will have the stuff here in twenty minutes ' time . "
With bad grace he watched Pike depart .
" M47 .
Intercom cable , woven - wire protected , three drums . "
" Check , " said Gregory , mentally kicking himself for returning at the wrong time .
The task continued until late in the evening , was resumed early next morning .
By that time three - quarters of the men were hard at work inside and outside the vessel , doing their jobs as though sentenced to them for crimes contemplated but not yet committed .
Moving around the ship 's corridors and catwalks had to be done crab - fashion , with a nervous sidewise edging .
Once again it was being demonstrated that the Terran life - form suffers from ye fear of wette paynt .
The first smearer would have ten years willed off his unfortunate life .
It was in these conditions , in midafternoon of the second day , that McNaught 's bones proved their feelings had been prophetic .
He recited the ninth page while Jean Blanchard confirmed the presence and actual existence of all items enumerated .
Two - thirds of the way down they hit the rocks , metaphorically speaking , and commenced to sink fast .
· · · · ·
McNaught said boredly , " V1097 .
Drinking bowl , enamel , one of . "
" Is zis , " said Blanchard , tapping it .
" V1098 .
Offog , one . " " Quoi ? " asked Blanchard , staring .
" V1098 .
Offog , one , " repeated McNaught .
" Well , why are you looking thunderstruck ?
This is the ship 's galley .
You 're the head cook .
You know what 's supposed to be in the galley , do n't you ?
Where 's this offog ? "
" Never hear of heem , " stated Blanchard , flatly .
" You must have .
It 's on this equipment - sheet in plain , clear type .
Offog , one , it says .
It was here when we were fitted - out four years ago .
We checked it ourselves and signed for it . "
" I signed for nossings called offog , " Blanchard denied .
" In the cuisine zere is no such sing . " " Look ! " McNaught scowled and showed him the sheet .
Blanchard looked and sniffed disdainfully .
" I have here zee electronic oven , one of .
I have jacketed boilers , graduated capacities , one set .
I have bain marie pans , seex of .
But no offog .
Never heard of heem .
I do not know of heem . "
He spread his hands and shrugged .
" No offog . "
" There 's got to be , " McNaught insisted .
" What 's more , when Cassidy arrives there 'll be hell to pay if there is n't . "
" You find heem , " Blanchard suggested .
" You got a certificate from the International Hotels School of Cookery .
You got a certificate from the Cordon Bleu College of Cuisine .
You got a certificate with three credits from the Space - Navy Feeding Center , " McNaught pointed out .
" All that and you do n't know what an offog is . "
" Nom d'un chien ! " ejaculated Blanchard , waving his arms around .
" I tell you ten t'ousand time zere is no offog .
Zere never was an offog .
Escoffier heemself could not find zee offog of vich zere is none .
Am I a magician perhaps ? "
" It 's part of the culinary equipment , " McNaught maintained .
" It must be because it 's on page nine .
And page nine means its proper home is in the galley , care of the head cook . "
" Like hail it does , " Blanchard retorted .
He pointed at a metal box on the wall .
" Intercom booster .
Is zat mine ? "
McNaught thought it over , conceded , " No , it 's Burman's .
His stuff rambles all over the ship . "
" Zen ask heem for zis bloody offog , " said Blanchard , triumphantly .
" I will .
If it 's not yours , it must be his .
Let 's finish this checking first .
If I 'm not systematic and thorough Cassidy will jerk off my insignia . "
His eyes sought the list .
" V1099 .
Inscribed collar , leather , brass studded , dog , for the use of .
No need to look for that .
I saw it myself five minutes ago . "
He ticked the item , continued , " V1100 .
Sleeping basket , woven reed , one of . "
" Is zis , " said Blanchard , kicking it into a corner .
" V1101 .
Cushion , foam rubber , to fit sleeping basket , one of . "
" Half of , " Blanchard contradicted .
" In four years he has chewed away other half . "
" Maybe Cassidy will let us indent for a new one .
It does n't matter .
We 're okay so long as we can produce the half we 've got . "
McNaught stood up , closed the folder .
" That 's the lot for here .
I 'll go see Burman about this missing item . "
The inventory party moved on .
· · · · ·
Burman switched off a UHF receiver , removed his earplugs , and raised a questioning eyebrow .
" In the galley we 're short an offog , " explained McNaught .
" Where is it ? " " Why ask me ?
The galley is Blanchard 's bailiwick . "
" Not entirely .
A lot of your cables run through it .
You 've two terminal boxes in there , also an automatic switch and an intercom booster .
Where 's the offog ? "
" Never heard of it , " said Burman , baffled .
McNaught shouted , " Do n't tell me that !
I 'm already fed up hearing Blanchard saying it .
Four years back we had an offog .
It says so here .
This is our copy of what we checked and signed for .
It says we signed for an offog .
Therefore we must have one .
It 's got to be found before Cassidy gets here . "
" Sorry , sir , " sympathized Burman .
" I can't help you . "
" You can think again , " advised McNaught .
" Up in the bow there 's a direction and distance indicator .
What do you call it ? "
" A didin , " said Burman , mystified .
" And , " McNaught went on , pointing at the pulse transmitter , " what do you call that ? "
" The opper -popper . " " Baby names , see ?
Didin and opper -popper .
Now rack your brains and remember what you called an offog four years ago . "
" Nothing , " asserted Burman , " has ever been called an offog to my knowledge . "
" Then , " demanded McNaught , " why did we sign for one ? "
" I did n't sign for anything .
You did all the signing . "
" While you and others did the checking .
Four years ago , presumably in the galley , I said , ' Offog , one , ' and either you or Blanchard pointed to it and said , ' Check . '
I took somebody 's word for it .
I have to take other specialists ' words for it .
I am an expert navigator , familiar with all the latest navigational gadgets but not with other stuff .
So I 'm compelled to rely on people who know what an offog is or ought to . "
Burman had a bright thought .
" All kinds of oddments were dumped in the main lock , the corridors , and the galley when we were fitted - out .
We had to sort through a deal of stuff and stash it where it properly belonged , remember ?
This offog - thing might be anyplace today .
It is n't necessarily my responsibility or Blanchard's . "
" I 'll see what the other officers say , " agreed McNaught , conceding the point .
" Gregory , Worth , Sanderson , or one of the others may be coddling the item .
Wherever it is , it 's got to be found .
Or accounted for in full if it 's been expended . "
He went out .
Burman pulled a face , inserted his earplugs , resumed fiddling with his apparatus .
An hour later McNaught came back wearing a scowl .
" Positively , " he announced with ire , " there is no such thing on the ship .
Nobody knows of it .
Nobody can so much as guess at it . "
" Cross it off and report it lost , " Burman suggested .
" What , when we 're hard aground ?
You know as well as I do that loss and damage must be signaled at time of occurrence .
If I tell Cassidy the offog went west in space , he 'll want to know when , where , how , and why it was n't signaled .
There 'll be a real ruckus if the contraption happens to be valued at half a million credits .
I can't dismiss it with an airy wave of the hand . "
" What 's the answer then ? " inquired Burman , innocently ambling straight into the trap .
" There 's one and only one , " McNaught announced .
" You will manufacture an offog . " " Who ? Me ? " said Burman , twitching his scalp .
" You and no other .
I 'm fairly sure the thing is your pigeon , anyway . "
" Why ? "
" Because it 's typical of the baby names used for your kind of stuff .
I 'll bet a month 's pay that an offog is some sort of scientific allamagoosa .
Something to do with fog , perhaps .
Maybe a blind - approach gadget . "
" The blind - approach transceiver is called ' the fumbly , ' " Burman informed .
" There you are ! " said McNaught as if that clinched it .
" So you will make an offog .
It will be completed by six tomorrow evening and ready for my inspection then .
It had better be convincing , in fact pleasing .
In fact its function will be convincing . "
Burman stood up , let his hands dangle , and said in hoarse tones , " How can I make an offog when I do n't even know what it is ? "
" Neither does Cassidy know , " McNaught pointed out , leering at him .
" He 's more of a quantity surveyor than anything else .
As such he counts things , looks at things , certifies that they exist , accepts advice on whether they are functionally satisfactory or worn out .
All we need do is concoct an imposing allamagoosa and tell him it's the offog . "
" Holy Moses ! " said Burman , fervently .
" Let us not rely on the dubious assistance of Biblical characters , " McNaught reproved .
" Let us use the brains that God has given us .
Get a grip on your soldering - iron and make a topnotch offog by six tomorrow evening .
That 's an order ! "
He departed , satisfied with this solution .
Behind him , Burman gloomed at the wall and licked his lips once , twice .
· · · · ·
Rear Admiral Vane W. Cassidy arrived right on time .
He was a short , paunchy character with a florid complexion and eyes like those of a long - dead fish .
His gait was an important strut .
" Ah , Captain , I trust that you have everything shipshape . "
" Everything usually is , " assured McNaught , glibly .
" I see to that . "
He spoke with conviction .
" Good ! " approved Cassidy .
" I like a commander who takes his responsibilities seriously .
Much as I regret saying so , there are a few who do not . "
He marched through the main lock , his cod -eyes taking note of the fresh white enamel .
" Where do you prefer to start , bow or tail ? "
" My equipment - sheets run from bow backward .
We may as well deal with them the way they 're set . "
" Very well . "
He trotted officiously toward the nose , paused on the way to pat Peaslake and examine his collar .
" Well cared - for , I see .
Has the animal proved useful ? "
" He saved five lives on Mardia by barking a warning . "
" The details have been entered in your log , I suppose ? "
" Yes , sir .
The log is in the chart room awaiting your inspection . "
" We 'll get to it in due time . "
Reaching the bow - cabin , Cassidy took a seat , accepted the folder from McNaught , started off at businesslike pace .
" K1 . Beam compass , type D , one of . "
" This is it , sir , " said McNaught , showing him .
" Still working properly ? " " Yes , sir . "
They carried on , reached the intercom - cubby , the computer room , a succession of other places back to the galley .
Here , Blanchard posed in freshly laundered white clothes and eyed the newcomer warily .
" V147 .
Electronic oven , one of . "
" Is zis , " said Blanchard , pointing with disdain .
" Satisfactory ? " inquired Cassidy , giving him the fishy - eye .
" Not beeg enough , " declared Blanchard .
He encompassed the entire galley with an expressive gesture .
" Nossings beeg enough .
Place too small .
Eversings too small .
I am chef de cuisine an ' she is a cuisine like an attic . "
" This is a warship , not a luxury liner , " Cassidy snapped .
He frowned at the equipment - sheet .
" V148 .
Timing device , electronic oven , attachment thereto , one of . "
" Is zis , " spat Blanchard , ready to sling it through the nearest port if Cassidy would first donate the two pins .
Working his way down the sheet , Cassidy got nearer and nearer while nervous tension built up .
Then he reached the critical point and said , " V1098 .
Offog , one . "
" Morbleu ! " said Blanchard , shooting sparks from his eyes , " I have say before an ' I say again , zere never was  "
" The offog is in the radio room , sir , " McNaught chipped in hurriedly .
" Indeed ? "
Cassidy took another look at the sheet .
" Then why is it recorded along with galley equipment ? "
" It was placed in the galley at time of fitting - out , sir .
It 's one of those portable instruments left to us to fix up where most suitable . "
" Hm-m-m !
Then it should have been transferred to the radio room list .
Why did n't you transfer it ? "
" I thought it better to wait for your authority to do so , sir . "
The fish - eyes registered gratification .
" Yes , that is quite proper of you , Captain .
I will transfer it now . "
He crossed the item from sheet nine , initialed it , entered it on sheet sixteen , initialed that .
" V1099 .
Inscribed collar , leather oh , yes , I 've seen that .
The dog was wearing it . "
He ticked it .
An hour later he strutted into the radio room .
Burman stood up , squared his shoulders but could not keep his feet or hands from fidgeting .
His eyes protruded slightly and kept straying toward McNaught in silent appeal .
He was like a man wearing a porcupine in his britches .
· · · · ·
" V1098 .
Offog , one , " said Cassidy in his usual tone of brooking no nonsense .
Moving with the jerkiness of a slightly uncoordinated robot , Burman pawed a small box fronted with dials , switches , and colored lights .
It looked like a radio ham 's idea of a fruit machine .
He knocked down a couple of switches .
The lights came on , played around in intriguing combinations .
" This is it , sir , " he informed with difficulty .
" Ah ! " Cassidy left his chair and moved across for a closer look .
" I do n't recall having seen this item before .
But there are so many different models of the same things .
Is it still operating efficiently ? "
" Yes , sir . "
" It 's one of the most useful things in the ship , " contributed McNaught , for good measure .
" What does it do ? " inquired Cassidy , inviting Burman to cast a pearl of wisdom before him .
Burman paled .
Hastily , McNaught said , " A full explanation would be rather involved and technical but , to put it as simply as possible , it enables us to strike a balance between opposing gravitational fields .
Variations in lights indicate the extent and degree of unbalance at any given time . "
" It 's a clever idea , " added Burman , made suddenly reckless by this news , " based on Finagle 's Constant . "
" I see , " said Cassidy , not seeing at all .
He resumed his seat , ticked the offog and carried on .
" Z44 .
Switchboard , automatic , forty - line intercom , one of . "
" Here it is , sir . "
Cassidy glanced at it , returned his gaze to the sheet .
The others used his momentary distraction to mop perspiration from their foreheads .
Victory had been gained .
All was well .
For the third time , hah !
· · · · ·
Rear Admiral Vane W. Cassidy departed pleased and complimentary .
Within one hour the crew bolted to town .
McNaught took turns with Gregory at enjoying the gay lights .
For the next five days all was peace and pleasure .
On the sixth day , Burman brought in a signal , dumped it upon McNaught 's desk , and waited for the reaction .
He had an air of gratification , the pleasure of one whose virtue is about to be rewarded .
Terran Headquarters to Bustler .
Return here immediately for overhaul and refitting .
Improved power plant to be installed .
Feldman .
Navy Op. Command .
Sirisec .
" Back to Terra , " commented McNaught , happily .
" And an overhaul will mean at least one month 's leave . "
He eyed Burman .
" Tell all officers on duty to go to town at once and order the crew aboard .
The men will come running when they know why . "
" Yes , sir , " said Burman , grinning .
Everyone was still grinning two weeks later when the Siriport had receded far behind and Sol had grown to a vague speck in the sparkling mist of the bow starfield .
Eleven weeks still to go , but it was worth it .
Back to Terra .
Hurrah !
In the captain 's cabin , the grins abruptly vanished one evening when Burman suddenly developed the willies .
He marched in , chewed his bottom lip while waiting for McNaught to finish writing in the log .
Finally , McNaught pushed the book away , glanced up , frowned .
" What 's the matter with you ?
Got a bellyache or something ? "
" No , sir .
I 've been thinking . "
" Does it hurt that much ? "
" I 've been thinking , " persisted Burman in funereal tones .
" We 're going back for overhaul .
You know what that means ?
We 'll walk off the ship and a horde of experts will walk onto it . "
He stared tragically at the other .
" Experts , I said . "
" Naturally they 'll be experts , " McNaught agreed .
" Equipment cannot be tested and brought up to scratch by a bunch of dopes . "
" It will require more than a mere expert to bring the offog up to scratch , " Burman pointed out .
" It 'll need a genius .
McNaught rocked back , swapped expressions like changing masks .
" Jumping Judas !
I 'd forgotten all about that thing .
When we get to Terra we wo n't blind those boys with science . "
" No , sir , we won't , " endorsed Burman .
He did not add " any more , " but his face shouted aloud , " You got me into this .
You get me out of it . "
He waited a time while McNaught did some intense thinking , then prompted , " What do you suggest , sir ? "
Slowly the satisfied smile returned to McNaught 's features as he answered , " Break up the contraption and feed it into the disintegrator . "
" That does n't solve the problem , " said Burman .
" We 'll still be short an offog . "
" No , we wo n't .
Because I 'm going to signal its loss owing to the hazards of space - service . "
He closed one eye in an emphatic wink .
" We 're in free flight right now . "
He reached for a message - pad and scribbled on it while Burman stood by vastly relieved .
Bustler to Terran Headquarters .
Item V1098 , Offog , one , came apart under gravitational stress while passing through twin - sun field Hector Major - Minor .
Material used as fuel .
McNaught , Commander .
Bustler .
Burman took it to the radio room and beamed it Earthward .
All was peace and progress for another two days .
The next time he went to the captain 's cabin he went running and worried .
" General call , sir , " he announced breathlessly and thrust the message into the other 's hands .
Terran Headquarters for relay all sectors .
Urgent and Important .
All ships grounded forthwith .
Vessels in flight under official orders will make for nearest spaceport pending further instructions .
Welling .
Alarm and Rescue Command .
Terra .
" Something 's gone bust , " commented McNaught , undisturbed .
He traipsed to the chart room , Burman following .
Consulting the charts , he dialed the intercom phone , got Pike in the bow and ordered , " There 's a panic .
All ships grounded .
We 've got to make for Zaxtedport , about three days ' run away .
Change course at once .
Starboard seventeen degrees , declination ten . "
Then he cut off , griped , " Bang goes that sweet month on Terra .
I never did like Zaxted , either .
It stinks .
The crew will feel murderous about this , and I do n't blame them . "
" What d'you think has happened , sir ? " asked Burman .
He looked both uneasy and annoyed .
" Heaven alone knows .
The last general call was seven years ago when the Starider exploded halfway along the Mars run .
They grounded every ship in existence while they investigated the cause . "
He rubbed his chin , pondered , went on , " And the call before that one was when the entire crew of the Blowgun went nuts .
Whatever it is this time , you can bet it 's serious . "
" It would n't be the start of a space war ? " " Against whom ? " McNaught made a gesture of contempt .
" Nobody has the ships with which to oppose us .
No , it 's something technical .
We 'll learn of it eventually .
They 'll tell us before we reach Zaxted or soon afterward . "
They did tell him .
Within six hours .
Burman rushed in with face full of horror .
" What 's eating you now ? " demanded McNaught , staring at him .
" The offog , " stuttered Burman .
He made motions as though brushing off invisible spiders .
" What of it ? " " It 's a typographical error .
In your copy it should read off .
dog . "
The commander stared owlishly .
" Off. dog ? " echoed McNaught , making it sound like foul language .
" See for yourself . "
Dumping the signal on the desk , Burman bolted out , left the door swinging .
McNaught scowled after him , picked up the message .
Terran Headquarters to Bustler .
Your report V1098 , ship 's official dog Peaslake .
Detail fully circumstances and manner in which animal came apart under gravitational stress .
Cross - examine crew and signal all coincidental symptoms experienced by them .
Urgent and Important .
Welling .
Alarm and Rescue Command .
Terra .
In the privacy of his cabin McNaught commenced to eat his nails .
Every now and again he went a little cross-eyed as he examined them for nearness to the flesh .
The End
Jessica Chiccehitto
Hindman is four years old when she first hears the music that makes her want to play the violin .
It was an animated film called Sarah and the Squirrel about a young girl escaping the Holocaust , accompanied by music the likes of which she had never heard .
“ Violin music , ” her father tells her , and from that moment on , she wants to play that music .
Much later she will learn that the music in the movie is the opening of the Winter concerto from Vivaldi ’s Four Seasons , and chills go up my spine just imagining a four - year - old hearing that music for the very first time .
