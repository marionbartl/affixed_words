Weihong Tan and his research group at the University of Florida have found DNA strands that cling to cancer cells .
Doctors could use the adhesive molecules , which are known as aptamers , to check their patients for the deadly disease .
The new test could be a godsend for people with liver cancer , which often surfaces after it is too late for surgery .
It might work like this : A physician could take some blood or tissue from their patient and send it off to a lab .
Technicians would mix it with aptamers that are attached to a fluorescent dye .
If any of the cells happen to be cancerous , the luminous molecules will stick to them .
Under a fluorescence microscope or in a cell - counting machine called a flow cytometer , each one will be lit up like a Christmas tree .
In a more sophisticated world , clinicians could coat nanoparticles with the aptamers and inject them directly into their patients .
The tiny objects would drift around randomly unless they encountered tumor tissue .
In that case , they would all cluster in the same place and show up as a big bright spot on a whole - body scan .
More important than the chemicals themselves are the methods used to discover them .
Tan and his colleagues developed a procedure called cell - SELEX , which is essentially a molecular elimination tournament .
In the Feb. 1 issue of Analytical Chemistry , he told the story of his latest project .
His team started out by bathing liver cancer cells in roughly a billion billion different DNA strands .
By chance , some of the strands were able to stick .
Those that could not were discarded .
Next , the molecules that could adhere to the cancer cell were mixed with healthy cells .
If they also stuck to the healthy cells , they were punted .
Only those that survived both challenges would go on to be copied by a PCR machine .
Competing in a game of SELEX is not easy .
The pool of successful DNA was forced to face the same pair of obstacles fifteen more times .
In the end , when only a few molecules remained , the scientists read their sequences .
Then , they tested some of the winners individually .
All of them could firmly hold onto malignant liver cells .
Without a doubt , the same procedure could be used to identify DNA that can bind to other types of cancer cells .
Some of them may be used in revolutionary medical tests .

The Rove - Canary - Pryor Connection
Karl Rove became involved in Alabama politics in 1994 , when he joined with veteran GOP operative Bill Canary to help elect pro-corporate Republican judges to the Alabama state supreme court .
A further ally of Rove 's and Canary 's was Alabama Attorney General William Pryor .
Both Rove in Texas and Pryor in Alabama tried to discourage their respective states from actively pursuing the 1996 - 97 state lawsuits against the tobacco industry , which formed an important aspect of their pro-corporate agenda .
However , Alabama 's Democratic Lieutanant Governor Don Siegelman was a strong supporter of the tobacco lawsuits .
In November 1998 , Siegelman was elected Alabama governor , defeating the Republican incumbent , at the same time that Pryor was re-elected attorney general .
Just a few weeks after Siegelman took office , Pryor began an investigation of his administration .
It was this investigation that would lead many years later to Siegelman 's conviction and imprisonment .
1994 Karl Rove is hired by the Business Council of Alabama to work with veteran GOP operative Bill Canary on winning races for the state supreme court .
Rove brings with him from Texas the strategy of successfully demonizing Democratic judges by painting them as pawns of " wealthy personal - injury trial lawyers . "

The Abramoff - Reed - Riley Connection
Lobbyist Jack Abramoff had his own reasons for being opposed to Governor Don Siegelman .
Not only had Siegelman campaigned in 1998 on the issue of setting up an Alabama lottery to help fund public education , but he also supported Indian gambling in the state .
Abramoff saw both of these initiations as threatening the casino revenues of his own tribal clients , and early in 1999 , he arranged for Ralph Reed to run a stealth lobbying campaign against them , using his connections in the religious right .
Reed was a long - time associate of Abramoff's , going back to their College Republican days in the early 80's , and also an ally of Karl Rove , who had helped him get into the lobbying business when he left the Christian Coalition in 1997 .
Abramoff and Reed were aided in their lobbying campaign by then - Congressman Bob Riley , whose former press secretary , Michael Scanlon , had recently gone to work for Abramoff 's ally Tom DeLay and would become an associate of Abramoff 's the following year .
Riley wrote a fundraising letter for the campaign on the stationery of a group headed by former DeLay chief of staff Ed Buckham , and Abramoff and his wife donated to Riley 's re-election campaign in 2000 .
It was Bob Riley who would run against Siegelman for the governorship in 2002 .
At the same time as their anti-lottery campaign , Abramoff and Reed were also running a stealth lobbying campaign in Alabama on behalf of their client , Channel One , carried under the name of a front group whose leader was apparently employed by either Bill Canary or his business partner .
April 1999 Ralph Reed begins a lobbying effort against Governor Don Siegelman 's state lottery and Indian gambling initiatives , using funds from Jack Abramoff 's tribal clients .
The lottery plan will be defeated in October 1999 .
Alabama Congressman Bob Riley writes a fundraising letter in support of Reed 's campaign on the stationery the U.S. Family Network , headed by Ed Buckham , formerly the chief of staff to Texas Rep. Tom DeLay .
Riley 's former press secretary , Michael Scanlon , was on DeLay 's staff at this time and would go to work for Abramoff the following year .
Reed would lobby in Alabama again in early 2002 , using funding from both Abramoff and Scanlon .

At the same time as their anti-lottery campaign , Jack Abramoff and Ralph Reed are also conducting a stealth campaign in Alabama on behalf of their client Channel One , which is threatened with Senate hearings into its educational programming .
This campaign includes a series of radio ads produced by a fictitious front group , which Reed eventually acknowledged having been behind .
The nominal head of the front group , Dax Swatak , would be described in 2002 as a business partner of Bill Canary .
As of 1999 , Swatek appears to have been working either for Canary or for Pat McWhorter , a business partner of Canary's .

The 2002 Election -- Siegelman 's Enemies Join Together to Work for His Defeat
In August 2001 , Bill Canary 's wife Leura Canary was appointed a US Attorney for Alabama by President George W. Bush .
She quickly federalized William Pryor 's long - running state investigation of Governor Don Siegelman , and even though she was obliged to recuse herself in May 2002 because of her husband 's connections , she appears to have continued running things from behind the scenes .
When Siegelman was up for re-election in 2002 , the ongoing investigation became an issue in the campaign .
Siegelman 's opponent in the 2002 election was Congressman Bob Riley , who enjoyed both the support of Bill Canary and funding from Jack Abramoff and Michael Scanlon which allegedly amounted to millions of dollars .
The Riley campaign was also backed by Judge Mark Fuller , who had recently been nominated to a federal judgeship by George W. Bush after serving as a local district attorney .
After Fuller left the district attorney 's office , his Siegelman - appointed successor announced that he had found evidence of fraudulent accounting practices , which led Fuller to work for Siegelman 's defeat .
In 2005 , Fuller would refuse to recuse himself from judging Siegelman 's bribery trial .
On election night Siegelman was leading in the tally until a midnight recount abruptly shifted 6000 votes over to Riley .
The change was officially blamed on a computer glitch , but no other races were affected , which is considered statistically implausible .
There have also been anonymous allegations that the tally was altered electronically by a Riley campaign advisor , Dan Gans .
Gans soon thereafter joined the Alexander Strategy Group headed by Ed Buckham , the Abramoff ally for whom Bob Riley had written a 1999 fundraising letter .
However , what decisively determined the outcome of the election was that Attorney General William Pryor refused to allow a recount , saying that state law required ballots to be kept sealed .
A few months later , in April 2003 , Pryor was nominated by George W. Bush for a federal judgeship .
The Democrats in Congress stalled his confirmation -- in part over his role in questionable fundraising practices -- but he was recess - appointed to the position by George W. Bush in February 2004 .

Siegelman is Tried for Corruption -- and Then Tried Again
In 2004 , Don Siegelman was charged with attempted bid-rigging in a case brought by US Attorney Alice H. Martin After many twists and turns , the case was thrown out by a clearly exasperated judge on grounds of insufficient evidence .
A year later , in October 2005 , as Siegelman prepared for an attempt to take back the governorship , he was indicted on fresh charges of bribery , conspiracy , and other crimes stemming from the long - running Pryor - Canary investigation .
The case was assigned to Judge Mark Fuller , who refused to recuse himself on the grounds of either his business ties as a federal contractor or the possibility of his holding a grudge against Siegelman .
The indictment and trial helped ensure Siegelman 's defeat in the Democratic primary in June 2006 .
This was followed three weeks later by his conviction on 7 out of the 32 counts brought against him .
May 27 , 2004 Don Siegelman , his former chief of staff , and a physician are indicted on charges of attempting to rig Medicaid bids in 1999 .

Accusations of Political Interference
In May 2007 , one month before Don Siegelman was sentenced to an extended prison term , an Alabama Republican attorney , Jill Simpson , issued an affidavit claiming political interference in the outcome of the 2002 Alabama governor 's race and naming Karl Rove as having taken an interest in the matter .
Because this accusation came out at the same time that the US Attorneys scandal was breaking , and because Siegelman had been prosecuted by two Bush - appointed attorneys , there was immediate speculation that the prosecution might have been the product of a politicized Justice Department .
May 21 , 2007 Alabama Republican attorney Jill Simpson states in an affidavit that Don Siegelman conceded in 2002 because he was threatened with the release of photos of one of his supporters planting Riley signs at a KKK rally .
She also says that Bill Canary stated Karl Rove was taking an interest in the matter .
Prior to Simpson 's signing the affidavit , but after she began communicating with Siegelman 's lawyers , her house had burned down and her car had been run off the road .

A new report from independent warranty provider SquareTrade has found that the failure rate of an Xbox 360 is not as high as critics would have you believe , but it is still much higher than the official number from Microsoft .
The number , 16.4 percent , is much higher than the one cited by former Xbox front man Peter Moore ( 3 percent ) , and is about half the number reported by many retailers ( approximately 33 percent ) .
The now infamous " Red Ring of Death " was responsible for roughly 60 percent of all claims made to SquareTrade regarding the Xbox 360 .
Compared to the other two consoles on the market , 16.4 percent is high , as both the PlayStation 3 and the Wii have about a 3 percent failure rate .
This number is in line with electronics industry norms .
In comments made to 1up.com , SquareTrade CEO Steve Abernethy said the future could see an even higher percentage .
" It is reasonable to believe these failure rates will increase over time , since the Xbox 360 failure issues tend to increase with prolonged use where overheating appears the main culprit , " he said .
1 up makes note of the fact that the 1,000 Xbox 360 users used for the report sampling were people who had to seek SquareTrade 's warranty service out , and therefore the possibility exists that the randomness factor could be skewed , leaning towards heavy system users who are more likely to overheat their 360s .
This does not invalidate the survey , but it should be considered while evaluating its findings .
This story , " Report claims 16.4 % of all Xbox 360 consoles will fail " was originally published by GamePro .
OSLO ( Reuters ) - The 2007 Nobel Peace Prize could go to a climate campaigner such as ex-U.S. Vice - President Al Gore or Inuit activist Sheila Watt - Cloutier , reinforcing a view that global warming is a threat to world security , experts say .

The winner of the $ 1.5 million prize , perhaps the world ’s top accolade , will be announced in Oslo on October 12 from a field of 181 candidates .
The prize can be split up to three ways .
“ There are reasonably good chances that the peace prize will be awarded to someone working to stop the dramatic climate problems the world is facing , ” said Boerge Brende , a former Norwegian environment minister .
He noted that the U.N. Security Council , the top forum for debating war and peace , held a first debate in April about how far climate changes such as droughts , heatwaves or rising seas will be a spur to conflicts .
“ We have many good candidates for the prize and we are approaching a decision , ” said Geir Lundestad , director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute where the five - member committee meets .
Kenya ’s Wangari Maathai won the 2004 peace prize for her campaign to plant 30 million trees across Africa , the first Nobel for an environmental campaigner .
Lundestad declined to say whether fighting climate change could justify a peace prize .
Brende and another Norwegian parliamentarian nominated Gore for his Oscar - winning movie about climate change “ An Inconvenient Truth ” and Watt - Cloutier , who has highlighted the plight of indigenous cultures facing a quickening Arctic thaw .
Arctic sea ice has shrunk to record lows this year .
The head of the Nobel committee , Ole Danbolt Mjoes , has praised Gore ’s movie and lives in the Norwegian Arctic city of Tromsoe .
PEOPLE TO BLAME
Others suggested candidates include the U.N. Climate Panel and its leader , Rajendra Pachauri .
The panel said this year that it was more than 90 percent likely that mankind ’s activities were the main cause of warming in the past 50 years .
And Yvo de Boer , the U.N. ’s top climate change official , said that U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon could be a good candidate , or German Chancellor Angela Merkel for “ her leadership role in Europe ” in confronting climate change .
But there are objections to all of them .
“ Since the 2004 Peace Prize was given to an environmentalist ( Maathai ) it may not be repeated this year , ” said Shirin Ebadi , an Iranian human rights lawyer who won the Nobel Prize in 2003 .
“ Unfortunately there are several other issues in the world that need to be addressed , ” she said .
Non-environmental nominees range from former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari for peace - broking work to Bolivian President Evo Morales .
Others say climate change is an overwhelming issue in 2007 .
“ The greatest challenge in modern history for humankind may be climate change , ” said Norway ’s Jostein Gaarder , who funds an annual $ 100,000 environmental prize from sales of his 1990s best - selling philosophy guide “ Sophie ’s World ” .
“ It would be a very good initiative to give the Nobel Prize to a climate candidate , ” he said .
Among signs of growing concern , about 70 world leaders will meet on Monday at U.N. headquarters in New York for the largest meeting ever on climate change .
President George W. Bush , often criticized even by his allies for doing too little , has invited major carbon emitters to talks in Washington on September 27 - 28 .
A prize to Gore would make him the second Democrat laureate since ex-President Jimmy Carter in 2002 -- two Democrats during Bush ’s presidency might be too much of a slap to Republicans .
Canada ’s Watt - Cloutier , meanwhile , has stepped down from a former role as head of the main Inuit group .
And one member of the Nobel Committee is from Norway ’s populist right - wing Progress Party that is highly skeptical about Gore .
Still , the Nobel committee often seeks to link prizes to current affairs .
The world ’s environment ministers will meet in Bali , Indonesia , from December 3 - 14 to discuss ways to slow global warming .
the Nobel Peace Prize is presented on December 10 .

Quiz time :
So what do hundreds of millions of ordinary schoolchildren around the world possess that American kids almost never get ?
Answer : Worms .
My win -a - trip journey to Africa , with a teacher and a student , has taken us to regions where most people are “ poly - parasitized . ”
So while in Congo , I picked up doses of deworming medicine for myself and those travel partners who wanted it .
( It ’s over - the - counter here .
In the U.S. the simplest approach is to ask a vet for medication to deworm a St. Bernard . )
AIDS is the disease in the global spotlight , capturing celebrity attention and billions of dollars in treatment programs — and that ’s terrific , because it still kills almost three million people a year .
But it ’s also time to recalibrate our efforts and devote more money to other ailments .
Some 40 million people have H.I.V. or AIDS , and 600 million have hookworms .
Here in Congo , one study found that 82 percent of children have worms , and partly as a consequence 70 percent are anemic .
Some mutual fund families and reporting services currently report dollar - weighted returns for individual investors and funds .
Mr. Dichev ’s contribution is to apply this methodology to the stock market as a whole , weighting each month ’s return by the amount of money invested in the market during that period .
An investor who bought a value - weighted portfolio of stocks in the New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange in 1926 and held them until 2002 would have earned an average annual return of about 10 percent .
By contrast , an individual who bought in 1926 but moved his dollars in and out of the market in the same pattern as the average dollar invested in the market would have earned a return of only 8.6 percent a year .
For Nasdaq , the difference between buy - and - hold and dollar - weighted returns is even larger .
An investor who bought the Nasdaq index in 1973 and sold in 2002 would have earned an average yearly return of 9.6 percent .
But the typical investor in Nasdaq earned only 4.3 percent over this period .
This is true not just in the United States — the same thing occurred in 18 of 19 international markets that Mr. Dichev examined .
It appears that taken as a whole , investors just are n’t very good at market timing .
But why ?
There ’s an old adage on Wall Street : “ Buy on the rumor , sell on the news . ”
Unfortunately , small investors do not seem to follow this rule .
Terrance Odean , a finance professor at the University of California , Berkeley , has found that small individual investors tend to buy stocks when they are mentioned in the media : they buy on the news .
The professional and institutional investors are happy to sell to retail investors in such periods .
A recent article in The Financial Analysts Journal by Thomas Arnold , John H. Earl Jr. and David S. North , all finance professors at the University of Richmond , called “ Are Cover Stories Effective Contrarian Indicators ? ” offers an intriguing finding .
The professors look at how a company ’s stock responds to a cover story in BusinessWeek , Fortune and Forbes .
They find that positive stories follow periods of positive performance and negative stories follow periods of negative performance , which admittedly is not too surprising .
More interesting , they also find that the appearance of a cover story tends to signal the end of the abnormal performance .
Hence , individuals who trade on such “ news ” are not likely to do well .
Or : how to turn this ..
into this ..
I was given a lovely glowing cube by the generous people at Linden Labs as a freebie at a job fair yesterday , and I decided that it was far too attractive to simply sit there on a shelf , pulsating forlornly until its batteries went flat .
How about making it useful , while maintaining its visual appeal ?
The following guide is deliberately fairly high - level , because the exact details will vary depending on your operating system and particular hardware setup .
I did this with my Mac , but hopefully there 'll be enough information here for you make it work on your system , perhaps with a little Googling .
If you do n't happen to have a glowing cube lying around , you can modify this to work with almost any output device you could think of , from a simple LED , or a buzzer , to something far more clever like moving a servo ( Gmail Notifier Robot , anyone ? )
The basic system has three components :
the software that runs on your computer ,
the electronics hardware that sits between the computer and the output device ,
and the software that runs on that hardware .
Every so often , the computer checks for new emails in your Gmail account , and then tells the electronics board whether any have arrived .
If they have , the board turns on the output device ( the cube ) .
Simple .
Hardware
The hardware itself is the popular Arduino board , the tinkerer 's dream device .
I 'm actually using a Boarduino , but any variant should work ( subject to a small but important detail , see below ) .
This might be particularly interesting with a Bluetooth Arduino ..
The Arduino talks with your computer over a serial connection , which runs over the normal USB cable you use to communicate with your Arduino .
Here 's the first important note : the latest Arduino Diecimila has an " auto - reset " feature which allows you to upload programs to the board without manually pressing the Reset button every time .
This works by resetting the board whenever it receives any data over the serial port .
Because we are going to be sending serial data to the board regularly , this is not what we want .
Fortunately , this feature can be disabled on my Boarduino by simply removing a capacitor ( C6 ) , but it may be trickier on the official Arduino .
Any suggestions for how to get round this in software would be gladly received ( leave a comment ! ) .
One way is to simply keep the serial port open all the time ( perhaps using the Serial Proxy , link at the bottom of this page ) .
This solution is n't much use for me , as I 'll be unplugging the USB connection regularly and do n't want to have to disable anything first .
However this may be fine if your computer is a desktop and you can leave the Arduino plugged in all the time .
If you go this route , you 'll have to use a different script running on the computer , and make sure it runs continually rather than repeatedly .
I 'll leave this to you !
I connected up the cube using a PC fan extension cable from Maplin - simply because the connector on the end fits perfectly on the pins of my Boarduino .
Use your own method to connect your output device .
I chopped off the " plug " end of the cable and soldered it onto the battery connectors on the cube , drilling a hole in the battery cover to allow the wires to pass through :
Connected up to the Boarduino for testing :
Software
This project requires two bits of software : one running on the Arduino to receive serial data and toggle the output accordingly , and one running on the computer to check for new emails and send data out over the serial port .
To re-iterate , these code listings should only be used as a guide .
They work for me , but I do n't guarantee they 'll work for you , and I accept no responsibility for breaking things .
If you do n't understand what this code is doing , you probably should n't be running it .
The Arduino software is fairly trivial .
It just loops round , watching for bytes coming in over the serial port , and sets a variable called " mail " to be true if the data is an ' M ' , and false if it 's an ' N ' ( of course these characters are arbitrary ) .
It then updates the value of the output pin to be equal to this mail variable .
You can hack this and expand it or modify it however you like - perhaps you could make an LED blink when you have new email instead of just turn on ?
int out Pin = 12 ; // Output connected to digital pin 12 int mail = LOW ; //
Is there new mail ?
int val ; // Value read from the serial port void setup ( ) { pinMode ( outPin , OUTPUT ) ; // sets the digital pin as output Serial.begin( 9600 ) ; Serial.flush ( ) ; } void loop ( ) { //
Read from serial port if ( Serial.available ( ) ) { val = Serial.read ( ) ; Serial.println ( val ) ; if ( val == ' M ' ) mail = HIGH ; else if ( val == ' N ' ) mail = LOW ; } //
Set the status of the output pin digital Write ( out Pin , mail ) ; }
Upload this to your Arduino , and then connect your output device to pin 12 .
The software for the computer takes the form of a Python script , and is slightly trickier .
First , it tries to open the serial port for communication with your Arduino .
If it can't do this ( say , if your USB cable is unplugged ) , it quits immediately .
If the serial port opens successfully , the script has to talk to Google 's servers to determine if you have any new email waiting for you .
It does this by authenticating with your Gmail username and password , and then requesting the Atom feed for your inbox ( this part of the script is based on code from here ) .
It then parses out the line containing the number of unread messages ( the XML tag is called ) .
If the unread message count is zero , it sends an ' N ' over the serial connection .
If it 's greater than zero , it sends an ' M ' .
This requires the pySerial library and the Universal Feed Parser module from .
import serial , sys , feedparser # Settings - Change these to match your account details USERNAME=" username@gmail.com " PASSWORD =" yourpassword " PROTO = " https : // " SERVER=" mail.google.com "
PATH= " /gmail/feed/atom " SERIALPORT = " /dev/tty.usbserial-FTDK0P3
M " # Change this to your serial port ! #
Set up serial port try : ser = serial .
Serial ( SERIALPORT , 9600 ) except serial .
SerialException : sys.exit( ) newmails = int( feedparser.parse ( PROTO + USERNAME + " : " + PASSWORD + " @ " + SERVER + PATH ) [ " feed " ] [ " fullcount " ] ) #
Output data to serial port if newmails > 0 : ser.write ('M ' ) else : ser.write ( 'N ' ) # Close serial port ser.close ( )
Now , this script needs to be run regularly ( say , once a minute ) so that when you get a new email , your notifier will light up promptly .
On Mac OS X , the launchd service handles , among other things , launching programs at set intervals ( on other Unix systems liked Linux , you may need to use cron .
On Windows , I have no idea - but I 'd imagine it 's possible somehow ) .
Put this code in a . plist file ( mine 's called org.j4mie.check-gmail.plist - I have no idea if you have to follow the weird naming format , but it works for me ) and save it in ~/ Library / LaunchAgents ( create this folder if it does n't exist ) .
Do n't forget to change the second ProgramArguments string to the location of your Python script .
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?>
<!
DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-// Apple Computer //DTD PLIST 1.0//EN " " http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd " > < plist version = " 1.0 " > < dict > < key >
Label</key > < string>org.j4mie.check-gmail</string > < key > OnDemand </ key > < true /> < key > ProgramArguments </key > < array > < string>/usr/bin/python</string >
< string>/ Users/yourusername/path/to/check-gmail.py</string > </ array > < key > StartInterval</key > < integer >60</ integer > </dict > </ plist >
UPDATE : As Jonas Stenberg pointed out in the comments , you may need to alter the /usr / bin / python string in this plist file to point to the location of the Python interpreter on your machine , for example /usr / local / bin / python2.5 .
To load this plist file into launchd , type launchctl load ~/ Library / LaunchAgents/org.j4mie.check-gmail.plist at the terminal ( or reboot your computer ) .
And , with any luck , that should be it !
Once a minute , your Python script will execute , checking for any new emails in your inbox .
If any have arrived , your cube ( or other output device ) should spring into life !

WASHINGTON – While Israel has formally refuted allegations it was involved in the assassination of Hizbullah ' operations officer '
Imad Mugniyah in Damascus on Tuesday , former CIA official Bruce Riedel says all signs seem to indicate the Mossad was behind the killing .
Iran Blames Israel Iran : Mugniyah killing result of Israeli ' state terrorism ' Roee Nahmias Tehran praises assassinated Hizbullah leader as ' golden page in the history of mankind 's fight against Zionists . '
Syria : Assassination a cowardly act of terror .
Washington welcomes death of man on FBI 's most wanted list , says world ' a better place ' without Mugniyah Iran : Mugniyah killing result of Israeli ' state terrorism '
Riedel , who spent over 30 years with the CIA before serving as a senior advisor on South Asian and Middle East affairs under three US presidents , said Israel has already carried out similar operations in Syria .
Currently a senior fellow with the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institute , he says Mugniyah 's assassination proves Israel has successfully infiltrated Hizbullah and that even Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah knows he may also be in the crosshairs .
" Israeli intelligence services have motive and they have proven their ability to strike in Damascus in the past .
This is a significant operation , whether or not the Israelis want to publicly admit to it .
He ( Mugniyah ) has topped the US and Israel 's most - wanted list for a quarter of a century , " said Riedel .
The seasoned intelligence official said he believes Mugniyah was not the only name on a possible hit list .
" It definitely includes Hassan Nasrallah , " he said , " the Mossad is looking for Nasrallah and he knows it , that 's why he conducts his operations from underground . "
And the Hizbullah leader may have good reason to worry , said Riedel .
" He 's wondering who tipped off Mugniyah 's location .
That same individual could also reveal his own whereabouts . "
When asked if the United States did not also have a stake in seeing the elimination of a man responsible for the deaths of American citizens , among them a senior CIA figure , Riedel said that while it was true Mugniyah was responsible for the murder of William Buckley " and that as far as we 're concerned , he was
second only to Osama bin-Laden " – a car bombing was more consistent with the Mossad 's modus operandi .
" In all honesty over the years we 've become busy with many other issues , while ever since the summer of 2006 Hizbullah has returned to the forefront of Israel 's concerns .
Mugniyah also acted as a go - between with Iranian intelligence and Hamas . "
At least a couple of readers of this blog guessed that something was wrong when the Ten Cool Things About the New Girl blog entry that I wrote last week vanished .
They were right , but they probably had no idea how wrong things went .
I ’m going to tell the story — with names changed and a few non-essential details omitted .
I ’m trying to balance telling my story with protecting people ’s privacy .
Hopefully , I ’ve succeeded .
Then I ’m going to take a week - long holiday from this blog .
I ’m annoyed and exhausted , I have a considerable load of work to take care of , and after you ’ve read what appears below , you ’ll probably agree that I ’ve earned it .
Not What She Appears to Be
Among the cool things listed in the Ten Cool Things About the New Girl entry were :
She went to high school at the hoity - toity Trafalgar College in Montreal
She graduated from University of British Columbia with a degree in computer engineering
She worked as a webmaster at Alliance Atlantis
A day after I posted the entry , a reader of this blog sent me an email telling me that everything I knew about New Girl was wrong , specifically :
She did not graduate from computer science at UBC
She did not go to high school at Trafalgar College — she does n’t even have her high school diploma
She does not work at Alliance Atlantis , nor is she a Web programmer
There ’s a long line of people who ’ve been lied to or taken advantage of by her
I was shocked .
In a year and a half of writing The Adventures of AccordionGuy in the 21st Century , I ’ve never received any kind of crank message related to a blog entry .
“ She ’s not the person she claims to be ” sounds more like a line of dialogue from a Hollywood thriller , not real life .
In spite of my incredulity , I could n’t write it off as some kind of prank .
Whoever wrote the letter knew too many details about New Girl to just be some random person playing a joke .
Was this person telling the truth , or was this someone with a personal vendetta against New Girl ?
Background Check
As luck would have it , I know someone in the Web department at Alliance Atlantis .
I gave her a call .
Me :
This may sound strange , but I need to know if someone works in the Web department .
Friend :
That does n’t sound so strange .
What ’s this person ’s name ?
Me : It ’s [ New Girl ’s name ] .
Friend : Never heard of her .
Is she new ?
Me :
She ’s worked there since sometime last year .
She told me that she could n’t bear to see The Two Towers because she worked late nights on the site for three weeks and just sick of the whole thing by the end .
Friend : I ’ve never heard of her .
Look , let me check the company directory … nope .
There ’s only person with her first name , and she ’s in Finance .
Who is this person ?
Who is this person , indeed .
For the first time in a very long time , I experienced that Horrible Sinking Feeling .
Someone — either New Girl or the author of the email — was trying to con me .
Worse still was the fact that so far , the facts favoured the stranger .
Sanity Check
I must have read and re-read the email at least a half - dozen times before coming to a decision .
I knew that I was too deeply involved to be objective and decided to make a sanity check .
I phoned my friend Leesh in New York .
She ’s a dear friend whom I ’ve known for ten years and has seen me at my best and worst .
I figured it would be best to call a friend with loads of common sense who was far removed from the situation to be impartial and unaffected by any fallout from the situation .
“ The thing that bothers me most , ” I said after I telling her the story , “ is that one of them is trying to screw me over . ”
“ Look at it this way , ” she replied , “ who has more to gain from it ? ”
Good point .
Meeting the Whistleblower
I decided to go ahead with my plan .
I emailed my informant , whom I ’ll refer to as Whistleblower , asking if we could meet in person .
It would be one thing to make these claims in a faceless medium , but something completely different to do so face - to - face .
If that person was lying , I figured my schmooze - fu would be good enough to spot it .
I got a quick reply .
Whistleblower was willing to meet me , and even provided a contact phone number .
This was good news and bad news : good because it lent more credence to the possibility that Whistleblower was not yanking my chain , bad because it meant that the claims about New Girl were true .
We arranged to meet at Sneaky Dee’s .
I arrived early and stood near the entrance so as to be easily spotted .
Whistleblower , being a reader of my blog , knew what I looked like , but I could n’t say the same .
This is such a spy movie thing , I thought .
I ’d laugh if the reason for all this was n’t so craptacular .
Ten minutes later , Whistleblower arrived and we ordered drinks .
I did n’t know about Whistleblower , but I knew I ’d need at least one .
The story Whistleblower told me meshed with New Girl ’s , but in all the wrong ways .
Whistleblower , it turned out , knew New Girl from the days when they both lived in another city .
While in that other city , New Girl was taking courses towards getting a high school equivalency diploma .
She never completed them .
Then Whistleblower followed with a series of identity theft stories .
New Girl would take online photos of various goth girls and use them as her identity in various chat rooms .
She ’d chat up gothguys and , in some casesm , convince them to fly up to meet her .
One poor guy came incredibly close to doing just that , but the person she was impersonating caught wind of this and warned him in the nick of time .
Then there ’s this little matter :
Whistleblower :
Has she shown you photos of a niece and nephew ?
Me : Yeah , I ’ve seen them .
Cute kids .
Whistleblower :
They ’re not her niece and nephew , they ’re her son and daughter .
Me : ( sounds of choking on Guinness )
I wo n’t go into the details here , but New Girl left for Accordion City two years ago , and the kids were put in the care of Children ’s Services .
For an hour and a half , I listened to Whistleblower .
I tried to keep my calm - even - during - a- crisis demeanor even though it felt as though icy daggers were being shoved into my heart .
Whistleblower recited a list of people whom I could contact to double - check these claims .
There seemed to be a long line of people whom New Girl had screwed over in one way or another .
In the terms of Cory Doctorow ’s Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom , New Girl has serious negative whuffie .
Whistleblower also told me that a number of friends reported seeing me and New Girl — “ Is n’t that New Girl , making out with the Accordion Guy ?
Does he know ? ”
The accordion might have saved my bacon again .
Whistleblower must ’ve seen the look on my face — geez , I must ’ve looked pathetic just then — and decided change the topic after a pause .
“ So … you play accordion , huh ? ”
“ Yeah , ” I said , “ you would n’t believe the kinds of things it gets me into . ”
At the end of our meeting , I paid for the drinks .
Whistleblower objected , but I said “ Hey — you ’re a complete stranger , and still you stuck your neck out for someone you know only through a weblog .
You could ’ve stayed uninvolved , and you could ’ve decided not to meet me , especially during a snowstorm .
Thanks .
I owe you big time . ”
Whisteblower left and I went to use the washroom .
Afterwards , as I left the bar , the waitress stopped me — I was so unnerved that I ’d forgotten my umbrella at the table .
Pull it together , I thought to myself , there ’s serious business to attend to .
Confrontation
I arrived at the cafe where New Girl had gone to meet some mutual friends .
She greeted me with a kiss , after which I said “ Could I have a word with you …alone ? ”
We took a table in the quietest spot I could find .
I told her that I ’d met with Whistleblower .
At the mere mention of Whistleblower ’s name , her face darkened .
New Girl : [ Whistleblower ] does n’t know a thing .
She gets her so - called “ facts ” from someone who has a grudge against me .
That person will say anything to make me look bad .
I ca n’t believe that you ’d take the word of a stranger over your own girlfriend !
Me : Your photo album : are those pictures of your niece and nephew , or are they actually your kids ?
New Girl :
What kind of lies has this person been telling you ?!
Me : Do you work for Alliance Atlantis ?
New Girl :
Of course I do !
I ’m a webmistress there !
Me : Not according to my friend who works there .
She ’s in the Web department , and has never heard of you .
New Girl :
It ’s a big department .
Me : Come to think of it , did n’t you say that the team working on the Two Towers website was just you and some other guy ?
That ’s a small team for the site of one of the biggest films ever .
New Girl : Maybe it ’s because I was a contractor and not a full - time employee .
Me : She checked the company directory .
You do n’t exist there .
And c’mon , a contractor ?
Then how can you be on sick leave ?
Sick leave , I thought , a perfect excuse for not having to go to a non-existent job .
I ’ve been played .
New Girl : I can show you proof .
I ’ve got pay stubs .
I ’ll show you tomorrow .
Me : Prove it to me now .
Are you a Web programmer ?
New Girl : Yes !
Me ( very calmly ) :
What ’s the difference between HTTP GET and POST ?
New Girl ( taken aback ) : …uh , what ?
Me : GET and POST .
What ’s the difference ?
New Girl ( looking somewhat rattled ) : You …You ’ve got to be fucking kidding .
Her body language changed to a more defensive stance .
I leaned forward .
The Old Columbo Trick
At this point , even after all the evidence that had been presented to me , I still had the tiniest bit of hope that everyone was wrong about New Girl .
I needed to hear an admission — either intentional or accidental — from New Girl herself .
If I kept the pressure on , she would either cave and admit everything or make a mistake .
Me : I ’m not kidding .
C’mon , if you ’re really a Web programmer , you ’d know this .
This is straight out of chapter one of “ Web Forms for Dummies ” .
New Girl : I refuse to answer this question .
Such a simple question … it ’s …it ’s insulting !
Me : Answer it , and you ’ll shoot such a big hole in Whistleblower ’s story that I ’d have to believe you .
And trust me , right now , you look like the liar ..
New Girl : I wo n’t answer it !
I know the answer , but you still wo n’t believe me if I give it to you !
Me :
You know , if you accused me of not being a programmer , I ’d be dropping mad computer science on your head .
I ’d be saying “ Get me in front of a machine !
I ’ll write ‘ Hello World ’ in half a dozen languages ! ” New Girl : But I ’m not you !
Me :
And you ’re not a programmer .
You ’re a damned liar .
I guess I just dumped her , I thought .
This is not how I planned to spend Thursday night .
I walked out of the cafe .
New Girl , as I expected , chased after me .
New Girl : Look !
I ’m upset !
My head ’s a mess and I can’t think technically right now !
But I promise you , tomorrow I ’ll get all kind of stuff from my place to prove it to you .
Me :
You can wait until tomorrow to get proof ?
I can’t .
Why not answer my question now , and save us both time and aggravation ?
New Girl : Please , baby , you ’ve got to believe me …
Me : I want to believe you , more than anything , but how can I ?
Answer the question , please .
Give me a reason to believe you .
New Girl : I can ’t .
I ’m too much of a wreck .
Look —
I can show you all my papers from University !
I kept them all !
I decided to use a trick I ’d learned from an old episode of Columbo .
It was a stupid , cheesy 70 ’s TV detective show trick , but it was my best shot at getting to the truth .
Me :
So you really did graduate from computer engineering ?
New Girl : Yes I did , from UBC !
Me :
And you took the “ Algorithms ” course ?
New Girl :
Of course !
Me :
And you have all the papers you wrote ?
New Girl : Yes !
I kept them all , and I ’ll show them to you tomorrow !
I imagined what kind of excuse she ’d have when the papers mysteriously “ disappeared ” the next day .
It was time to set up the pieces for checkmate .
Me : I want to see the one we always called the “ Hell Paper ” at Queen ’s — the mandatory fourth - year paper .
You know the one , where we prove P = NP ?
New Girl : I did that !
I proved P = NP !
I placed near the top of the class , and the professor used my paper as an example !
Me : You proved P = NP ?
New Girl : Yes !
Me : Gotcha .
I ’m not going to bore you with the details of what the whole “ Is P equal to NP or not ? ” question is , other than the fact that it ’s one of the Great Mysteries of computer science .
From a mathematician ’s point of view , solving it would be a bigger deal than solving Fermat ’s Last Theorem .
It ’s so big a deal and so hard a problem that there ’s a US $ 1 million reward to the first person to submit a viable proof .
Simply put , I ’d just broken up with either the biggest liar I ’ve ever dated or the greatest computer scientist who ever lived .
Somewhere , Alan Turing ’s coffin was experiencing fantastic rotational torque .
I ’d outsmarted her into lying and giving herself away , just like my childhood literary hero , Encyclopedia Brown .
It gets worse
The next day , I decided to give New Girl ’s supposed home phone number a ring .
I was beginning to get the feeling that it was n’t actually hers .
A woman answered the phone .
“ Hello , ” I said , “ my name is Joey deVilla … ”
“ The guy with the hat and the accordion , ” the voice on the other end of the line said .
“ I ’ve been meaning to have a word with you . ”
Eek .
And so began an even stranger conversation .
The apartment was n’t New Girl ’s , but this woman’s .
The woman ’s musician friends had seen me with New Girl at Kensington Market , where I sometimes busked and performed at open mike nights .
“ And there was night you were at Grafitti ’s with her … ”
“ Last Thursday . ”
How is it that everyone but New Girl can provide evidence to corroborate their stories ?
“ So the stories about her fat cats and the noisy birds … they ’re not her pets , they ’re yours ? ”
“ Right . ”
She then told me about how she and New Girl met , at rehab meetings .
Rehab ?!
And later , since New Girl had no place to stay , she let her stay on her couch .
They grew closer and became lovers .
Lovers ?!
And then came the story about how New Girl tried to hide her pregnancy .
Pregnancy ?!
Apparently there was a third kid , born shortly before I met New Girl .
The kid was adopted a few days after its birth .
A couple of weeks after having given birth , she was flirting with me .
I felt ill .
I spent that night drinking copious quantities of Irish Stout .
Enough already
“ Dude , ” said my old buddy George the following day , “ you were saved by your blog ! ”
It ’s true .
I posted a gushy entry about New Girl , someone saw it and came forward to tell me the truth .
Maybe the Blogger or Moveable Type people should print up stickers and T - shirts that read BLOGS SAVE LIVES .
I ’d buy one .
As a programmer who used to work in the P2P world and is about to start developing software to socially connect people , I used to look at issues such as social software , trust networks , determining the truth without a trusted third party , identity and reputation in a rather abstract way , kind of like the way a non-chef watches programs on the Food Network ( “ Hey , an omelette made with an ostrich egg !
Would n’t that be neat to cook ? ” ) .
Now that I ’ve experienced the real - life version of all these concepts , I ’d like to look a little more seriously into their programmatic equivalents — might as well turn this lemon into lemonade .
As for me , I ’m unharmed and New Girl did n’t rob me .
I ’m really feeling incredibly craptacular , very creeped out , and — perhaps as some kind of defense mechanism — mildly amused at the ridiculousness of the situation .
I ’m proud of the fact that somehow I managed to keep my head mostly together during this descent into TV - movie - of - the - weekdom .
I ’m also exhausted — this kind of crap is incredibly draining , even for Mister - Play - Accordion - All - Night - Long .
I ’m taking a one - week vacation from blogging to get caught up on work , sleep and life in general .
To all my real friends out there , thank you for telling me who you really are .
To New Girl , all I can say — and I mean this with all sincerity — is “ seek professional help ” .
To Whistleblower , I owe you a debt of gratitude .
You probably saved me from a lot of misery .
And to all you ladies out there , I ’m back on the market .
Only those without skeletons in their closets need apply .
See you folks in a week .
Get this story in dead - tree form
This story ended up in an anthology titled Never Threaten to Eat Your Co-Workers : Best of Blogs in 2004 .
I once had a copy , but someone — whom I ca n’t remember now — borrowed it and never returned it .
I think we can all agree that gender equality is a Good Thing™ .
I think we can all agree that there should not be any barriers , legal or otherwise , to women reaching the highest levels of the workforce .
And I think we can mostly , if not all , agree that the “ old boy ’s club ” , to the extent that it exists , harms our economy by making it much harder for qualified women to reach that level of a company .
The real question , then , is what to do about it .
Personally , I ’m more of a “ let the market sort it out ” type .
After all , we ’ve seen a sea change on this issue in just my lifetime , and anyone who still harbors thoughts that business is just a “ man ’s game ” should keep his guard up before Oprah owns his ass .
Norway , though , has taken a different tack .
Not content to let the market sort it out , they ’ve mandated that 40 % of the countries seats on Boards of Directors be held by women .
Unfortunately , though , they ’ve put the cart before the horse , and simply crowned a few of the countries top business women :
Before the law was proposed , about 7 % of board members in Norway were female , according to the Centre for Corporate Diversity .
The number has since jumped to 36 % .
That is far higher than the average of 9 % for big companies across Europe — 11 % for Britain ’s FTSE 100 — or America ’s 15 % for the Fortune 500 .
Norway ’s stock exchange and its main business lobby oppose the law , as do many businessmen .
“ I am against quotas for women or men as a matter of principle , ” says Sverre Munck , head of international operations at Schibsted , a media firm .
“ Board members of public companies should be chosen solely on the basis of merit and experience , ” he says .
Several firms have even given up their public status in order to escape the new law .
Companies have had to recruit about 1,000 women in four years .
Many complain that it has been difficult to find experienced candidates .
Because of this , some of the best women have collected as many as 25 - 35 directorships each , and are known in Norwegian business circles as the “ golden skirts ” .
One reason for the scarcity is that there are fairly few women in management in Norwegian companies — they occupy around 15 % of senior positions .
It has been particularly hard for firms in the oil , technology and financial industries to find women with enough experience .
DNO , for instance , an oil and gas firm that operates in Yemen , Iraq and elsewhere , found women it was happy with last November , but their expertise is in finance and human resources , not oil , says Helge Eide , DNO ’s president .
“ However , we retain sufficient oil and gas experience in the men on our board , ” he adds .
When government tries to do something “ good ” , they end up bringing in unintended consequences and ill effects that they often seem surprised to find .
In this case , much like Sarbanes - Oxley , it has caused many companies to go private .
And rather than leveling the playing field for all women , it has simply elevated a few specific women to a level where they sit on so many boards that their efforts must be spread too thin to have any real effect .
What is also interesting here is the difference between allowing the market to sort it out , and not .
America tends to have relatively low business regulation in comparison to Europe , where the barrier to entry for a public company is tremendous .
Thus , America ’s more free market offers more opportunity for women to start public companies and to prove their mettle in the business world .
As the story points out , this has resulted in about 15 % of Board of Directors at American Fortune 500 companies to be women , with Britian , Europe , and Norway ( pre-mandate ) lagging behind .
This is a perfect example of government attempting to fix a problem through mandate , when all they have done is masked the problem .
America lets the market sort this out , and women hold more top - level positions than other industrialized nations .
It proves what we free - market advocates have long stated : the free - market is n’t simply the most efficient distributor of capital , it is also one of the most equal and fair systems for distributing opportunity .
Yesterday the WSJ reported about the most recent qui tam suit against Pfizer , and now there are people who claim . . .
Lipitor does n't save lives .
Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro yesterday filed a third amended complaint in the Polansky v. Pfizer case .
The amended complaint provides more detail and additional clarity about the allegations that Pfizer used an orchestrated campaign to increase the of off - label use of Lipitor .
To view the complaint , click here
The lawsuit claims Pfizer illegally boosted sales of its most successful drug , Lipitor , through a scheme designed to convince physicians to prescribe the drug for non-approved uses through ‘ education programs .
’The plaintiff , who once served as the company ’s director of outcome management studies , was fired after he claims he called into question the companies marketing tactics .
The lawsuit alleges Pfizer produced and distributed material for off - label uses , without FDA approval , in an effort to expand its market and profits .
Among the list of alleged violations includes hosting continuing medical education events for physicians , including dinner and valet service , which essentially served as a sales pitch for alternate uses of the drug .
The suit alleges these educational programs deliberately misrepresented the drug 's label to encourage Lipitor therapy for people in the moderate - risk category who did n't need the drug .
To date Lipitor is the most successful prescription drug worldwide with sales last year of $ 13.6 billion .

But there 's more , a new web site http://www.health-heart.org/
claims Lipitor does n't save lives , especially not among women , and uses graphs such as these ones to prove its point :
ESA has just done the first big press release for the Integral gamma-ray telescope , and the big woosh you 're hearing is the sound of numerous dark matter models flushing down the toilet .
For several years the community has been carefully eyeing an extended , apparently spherical excess of gamma-rays from the center of the galaxy .
Theorists have been busy generating crafty models where the excess in gamma-rays comes from the direct annhilation of dark matter particles , or from a decay chain from the dark matter particles themselves .
These models were attractive because the shape and extent of the gamma-ray detection was wrong for just about any Galactic source except for the dark matter halo itself .
The dark matter halo would produce just the right sort of signal , since it 's presumably highly cuspy in the center , leading to high rates of the sorts of interactions which might lead to detectable photons , but only near the center of the galaxy .
The halo is also expected to be mostly spherical , as was consistent with the previous observations .
Well , with the higher resolution of the new Integral telescope , the distribution of gamma- rays looks distinctly disklike and lopsided , which smells much more like a boring old astronomical explanation ( where " boring " means something to do with neutron stars and black holes , but still -- no one 's expecting the Nobel Prize for this one , yet ) .
We may soon learn what evidence the grand jury heard in the Breonna Taylor case .
Here 's what 's happened over the last few days
The Senate ’s second - ranking Democrat says the party ’s presidential nominating contest should n’t get ' too personal . '
Durbin warns Bill Clinton
Sen. Richard J. Durbin ( D - Ill. ) , the second - ranking party leader in the Senate , says President Bill Clinton ’s comments about Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) are getting “ too personal ” and called on the former president to refrain from attacking Obama ’s integrity .
“ I ’m really troubled by his questioning the sincerity of Barack Obama ’s opposition to the war in Iraq , ” Durbin said .
“ I really think it is unfortunate to question Barack ’s sincerity on the war .
He has been there from the start , opposing this war . ”

The unsolicited comments — in a phone call to Politico from Springfield , Ill . — were a sign that the Obama campaign is going to react aggressively to perceived attacks on the senator ’s character .
“ I really had hoped ... that it would n’t become too personal or too negative , ” Durbin said .
“ I do n’t think that ’s good for either of the candidates or for our party .
There may be clear some clear differences on some issues . ”
Durbin suggested that the former president has been giving somewhat revisionist accounts on the way the Iraq war debate played out .
“ It was not easy to be against that war back when we cast that vote in October of 2002 , ” Durbin said .
“ I was one of 23 who voted against the war .
Barack was supportive — one of the few candidates speaking out strongly against it in Illinois .
“ If President Clinton had opposed that war as strongly as Barack Obama at the time , it would have helped a lot of us who had voted against authorizing an invasion . ”
Durbin , the majority whip , was reacting to comments the former president has made in several recent forums suggesting that Obama ’s opposition to the Iraq war has not been as steadfast as he has suggested on the stump .
“ I think that his story line is not accurate , ” Clinton said Friday on a liberal talk show on Sirius satellite radio .
Clinton , seeking to tamp down discontent among black leaders about comments he made about Obama in New Hampshire , told Mark Thompson on the Talk Left channel :
“ This is what happens any time anyone tries to question a statement or a position of Sen. Obama .
The response is , ‘ You ’re attacking me personally , ’ and that relieves him of the obligation to address the substance . ”
Durbin has endorsed Obama but says he is friends with both Clintons and noted that his voting record was strongly supportive of Bill Clinton when he was in office .
Durbin and the former president overlapped at Georgetown University : Durbin got his undergraduate degree in 1966 , and Clinton graduated in 1968 .
“ I really worked hard for him when he was a candidate , ” Durbin said .
“ And I ’ve had a very strong and warm relationship with Sen. Clinton , as well .
So none of this is personal .
I respect them both very much . ”
Asked his outlook on the Democratic primary campaign , Durbin said : “ In this business , you step back as a candidate and you say , ' Would I rather be in my opponent ’s shoes or in my shoes ? '
I ’d rather be in the Obama camp today , I think .
We really have momentum behind us . ”

In my own case , I have spent a lot of time thinking about tools and languages .
So I am always tempted to like programmers who have also spent a lot of time thinking about tools and languages .
However , someone who is not particularly reflective about tools and languages might be a great contributor in certain roles that do n’t have a heavy “ sharpen the saw ” emphasis .
Or , they may be delighted to learn some new tricks if placed in a supportive environment .
So the lesson for me is that if someone says the kind of thing I like to hear , great .
If they do n’t , I need to try another icebreaker , not evaluate them based on their response .
Here ’s a dissenting view
One of the problems with all interviews is that the formality and importance of the meeting forces people into rote , scripted behaviour .
This makes it very difficult to determine whether someone is a good fit .
If someone tells you they are seeking “ an opportunity to apply their dynamic skills and team - orientation to furthering the company ’s mission in an upwardly mobile career position , ” are they a snot - nosed corporate drone ?
Or are they saying what they think interviewers want to hear because they have invested far more time improving their development skills than time improving their interviewing skills ?
Your job as an interviewer is to talk to the person , to get them talking about who they really are , not trying to guess what you might want to hear .
“ Icebreakers ” are interview questions designed to put you both at ease and break out of the scripted , stilted talk that results in bad hires and missing good hires .
( That being said , I do not suggest that they be used to determine whether someone is a good candidate or not : with all of these questions , there really is no “ right ” answer , and if you try to read too much into the answers , you run the risk of evaluating the interviewee on the basis of whether they are your clone .
So do n’t go overboard : an interview should not be dominated by questions like these , any more than it should be dominated by computational complexity questions , algorithm discussions , design explorations , review of past achievements , or any other single factor .
I suggest you use one or two of these in an interview as a way of loosening things up .
There ’s anecdotal evidence that even very good candidates may react poorly to the pressure of a job interview , generating “ false negatives . ”
Anything that lowers the pressure raises the chance of identifying great people for your team .
One final tip about icebreakers :
Try sharing your own answers to the questions .
You might not want to answer them first : some candidates will feel pressured to echo your responses , but there ’s a lot of value in turning a question into a conversation .
Do n’t turn the conversation into a monologue : this is n’t your interview , and these are icebreakers , not some sort of secret mechanism for identifying talent .
As soon as you feel the conversation relaxing , move on to something important , be it asking the candidate to solve a problem or working through their experience in a more structured manner .
Return to an icebreaker if thing stiffen up too much .
Learn a little .
Share a little .
Laugh .
Remember , you are looking for someone who can make or break your team .
You might want to talk with them first :-)

Haha , you say !
What bug could possibly have survived Microsoft 's insecticide for so long ?
Since Microsoft took over Hotmail in January 1998 , almost a full decade ago , Hotmail users have decried the loss of attachment emails .
For the uninitiated , here 's how it works .
Whether you are :
- Sending from a Hotmail account to another Hotmail or any other email address
and
- Receiving from another Hotmail account or any other email address to your Hotmail account
... you will lose many of your attachments .
The emails simply vanish in transit .
No mailer daemon , no bounces , no nothing .
Gone like Bill Gates ' sex appeal .
Microsoft has forever denied this .
Hotmail 's delivery statistics are next to perfect and there is no discrimination against attachments , they 've said for almost a decade .
And for almost a decade they have been making millions of Gigabytes of documents , spreadsheets and photos of grandma 's quilts disappear .
On the heels of my controversial Mac Plus Beats AMD Dual Core Test which raised quite a ruckus around the Internet , I figured it was time to drag Hotmail kicking and screaming into the secret laboratory and concoct a perfectly fair test that it was up to Hotmail to succeed at or fail .
I created one hundred emails .
Each one had a different attachment .
They were all .txt , .rtf , .doc , .jpg , .xls , or .ppt and of random sizes , the smallest being a 6 K . txt and the largest a 1.9MB .ppt .
These one hundred emails were split up into five groups of twenty each .
Two different Hotmail accounts were used , let 's call them Hotmail - 1 and Hotmail - 2 .
Two different " generic " ISPs email accounts were used in different locations on different servers , again , ISP - 1 and ISP - 2 .
To make it perfectly fair , ISP - 1 was a Canadian provider in Ontario and ISP - 2 an American provider in California .
To allow for different traffic patterns , these times were chosen for the testing , all times Eastern .
9 am Thursday
Noon Friday
3 pm Saturday
6 pm Sunday
9 pm Monday
Five different originating computers were used , one for each day .
Each PC was linked to the net via a different ISP , so five different ISPs were used in total to send and receive the files .
Each day , I would log onto Hotmail - 1 and send / receive that day 's twenty emails to Hotmail - 2 , ISP - 1 and ISP - 2 .
Then I would log onto Hotmail - 2 and send / receive that day 's twenty emails to Hotmail - 1 , ISP - 1 and ISP - 2 .
Then I would log onto ISP - 1 and send / receive that day 's twenty emails to ISP - 2 , Hotmail - 1 and Hotmail - 2 .
And finally I would log onto ISP - 2 and send / receive that day 's twenty emails to ISP - 1 , Hotmail - 1 and Hotmail - 2 .
Only the relevant web interfaces were used , no email clients as Outlook , Thunderbird , etc .
This schedule was determined to make it as fair as possible .
There is no way that the delivery or lack thereof was caused by a particular ISP , as we used five completely independent ones from five locations .
Neither could it be said that we only sent during peak times as we spread out our sends across five days and at various times of the day .
Each email was sent separately , no ccs or bccs .
The test was devised to be as unbiased as possible .
Either the emails would be delivered or they would n't .
Each email was given 48 hours for delivery .
If it was not delivered in that time then it was considered Vanished .
Interestingly only one email fell into this group , being delivered after 72 hours from Hotmail - 2 to ISP - 1 .
The final results bore out the " conventional wisdom . "
If emails were donuts , Hotmail would be HomerSimpsonMail .
I do n't need to reiterate the figures , there they are in blue and red .
But for a Hotmail account to destroy up to 81 % of all emails with attachments prior to their delivery to a " generic " ISP email account is nothing short of absurd , as these Hotmail accounts were not the free variety , but the fully paid ones .
Compare those figures to the ones where the generic ISP email accounts exchanged emails with attachments and you will clearly see the difference .
The worst performance was in making 2 % Vanish .
It has long been suspected that there is a silent policy that makes Hotmail automatically delete the majority of attachments to save on bandwidth and internal disk space .
Therefore it really does n't matter if every client has access to 2GB of storage since they do n't deliver the attachments to fill that space up anyway .
If that truly is the case , then Microsoft may be liable for several hundred million cases of conspiracy and mail fraud .
Hotmail is no longer a free only service where you get what you pay for .
There is simply no excuse for ripping off users who have paid a significant fee to obtain the reliability and confidence which the Microsoft brand should deliver .
Either that , or it may be time to ask the DOJ to step in and investigate what could be a multi-billion dollar scam .
Very few Americans , not directly affected by this man of many faces have no idea , of who really directs the duties of the 180,000 government employees in DHS : Duties that this man now holds in his stained and conflicted hands .
It seems that the variety of controversies which have paralleled Michael Chertoff 's meteoric rise in government have been allowed to languish in the shadows for far too long .
If the public does not soon become familiar with who their Director of Homeland Security really is - then they may live to regret that oversight .
The details of Michael Chertoff 's personal history should have disqualified him for high office : but instead his nomination for this job was approved without objection by the Senate .
" The Senate voted 98 - 0 to approve Chertoff on February 15 .
Chertoff , 51 , took the oath of office that night in " a private ceremony at the White House . "
DHS has a $ 32 billion budget , 180,000 employees , and jurisdiction over immigration , customs and transportation security , the Coast Guard , the Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
The question of Chertoff 's dual - nationality does n't seem to have concerned a single U.S. senator .
Many have wondered who let the detained suspected Israeli agents go back to Israel , immediately after 911 .
Apparently it was Michael Chertoff .
" Chertoff allowed scores of suspected Israeli terrorists and spies to quietly return to Israel .
In several cases , Israeli suspects working for phoney moving companies , such as Urban Moving Systems from Weehawken , N.J. , were caught driving moving vans which tested positive for explosives .
On September 14 , Dominic Suter , the owner of the moving company , which was found to be a Mossad front company , fled to Israel after FBI agents requested a second interview .
One group of 5 Israelis was seen on the roof of Urban Moving Systems videotaping and celebrating the destruction of the World Trade Center .
These Israeli agents were returned to Israel on visa violations .
These Israeli suspects , and others , who had apparently transported explosives in the New York area , were allowed to return to Israel without being properly interrogated or their presence and activities in the United States having been vigorously investigated . "
( 1 ) What is publicly available about Chertoff 's life and his various careers is not comforting , if you care about either law or justice - and it 's especially troubling if you demand a depth of character from those who occupy the highest offices in this land .
Ah but then this is the Cheney - Bush Era of Empire , so that ' quaint idea ' is probably now completely without merit .
" Chertoff is credited with authoring the Patriot Act , the 300 - plus page blueprint for the modern National Security State ; patterned to great extent on the successes of the KGB in the Soviet system .
He 's admired among his Bush cadres for making sure that government surveillance operates at maximum efficiency .
Under his stewardship at the Dept of Justice , the 4th amendment has withered like summer grass .
The long - held belief that citizens , have a right to a " reasonable expectation of privacy " has buckled under the demands of " Big Brother " and the new " intrusive " security paradigm . "
And : " Chertoff 's record of failure at Justice is second only to that of Ashcroft .
His 4 year tenure has n't produced even one identifiable success .
( Check out his " obstruction of justice " in the John Walker Lindh case on Democracy Now ) Instead , his personal ineptitude and his palpable contempt for the law have only showered more disgrace on the institution of American justice .
That probably explains why he 's being moved up the bureaucratic dog-pile to the top rung of Homeland Security .
In Bush - world " failing upwards " is more commonplace than cowboy boots at a Crawford tent - show . "
( 2 ) As someone that controls the largest Federal Agency in the US government ; the life and accomplishments of Michael Chertoff ought to be available and easy to locate : but that has not been the case .
Instead the important details concerning Michael Chertoff 's past have been meticulously scrubbed from the net .
The basics are available from Wikipedia but the facts surrounding the depth of his family 's involvement in the actual creation of the State of Israel , have disappeared .
" Chertoff is the co-author , along with Viet Dinh , of the USA PATRIOT Act , signed into law October 26 , 2001 .
As head of the Justice Department 's criminal division , he advised the Central Intelligence Agency on the outer limits of legality in coercive interrogation sessions . "
( 3 ) One of the little known aspects inside all the secrecy surrounding
The vile National ID Card , the HOMELAND Security Act , and the shadowy FEMA camps that many believe are about to be used - concerns the other master criminals that Cheney - Bush hired to ensure that Americans will become as completely controlled a population , as were the people of Communist East Germany or the old USSR .
For Instance : " This " card " ( the National ID Card ) was designed for Homeland Security by the former East German STAZI chief , Marcus Wolfe , a master of manipulation and intimidation and Primakov the former head of the KGB in the USSR .
These two former spy chiefs are who really run our SECRET National Interior Spy Service .
Bush employed them specifically for what they brought from their communist states - now they decide who lives and who dies in America !
These men have not changed , they are who they are , and that 's why Bush & the Bandits hired them for HOMELAND Security .
If these men appeared for work , in the uniforms of their former States , the public would be outraged , and rightfully so !
How is it that the radical right continues to decry Communism , yet they have allowed Bush to employ top communist counter - intelligence officers to oversee every facet of our lives ? "
( 4 ) Throughout this long international nightmare there remains the still incomplete tragedy of the insertion of Israel , as a State , into what was once Palestine .
This conflicted and war - torn place has been the international flashpoint of privilege over human rights and bondage over freedom for over half a century .
Flames and blood from this dispute were ignited by greed and by those dark and destabilizing dreams of Empire that were beginning even before the First World War .
Here 's something that one woman adds to the on - going dialogue in Palestine - because what she 's found is pivotal to the veracity of claims made by the Zionist extremists that control " Israel " today .
This is why the dual citizenship of our Homeland Security Czar is incompatible with his position in government today .
The USA is large enough to require that all our highest officials be Americans without dual citizenships , or conflicts of national interest , from any other nation .

North Korean Christians Arrested ; Current Status Unknown
BARTLESVILLE , Okla . ( Voice of the Martyrs ) --
In a highly unusual press conference in Pyongyang in September , the National Security Service of the Democratic Peopleâ€™s Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) announced the arrest of â€œforeign spiesâ€  and â€œnative citizens working for a foreign intelligence service .â€ 
The Voice of the Martyrs ( VOM ) , a ministry serving Christians in restricted nations who are persecuted for their faith , announced today that those arrested in North Korea were in fact Christian believers and not spies .
The security service spokesman at the press conference , Li Su Gil , said that those arrested â€œcarried out the missions by means of diverse espionage equipment .â€ 
He did not name any of those arrested .
VOM has identified the following North Korean Christians who disappeared between the end of May and the end of June this year and are believed to have been arrested by government authorities :
Onseong , North Hamgyong Province :
Chul Huh , male , 34 Myung - Chul Kim , male , 36 Chun - Il Jang , male , 39
Nam - Suk Kang , male , 48 Young - Su Jin , female , 32 ( husband and wife )
Hoeryong , North Hamgyong Province :
San -Ho Kang , male , 36 Young - Yae Lee , female , 37 ( husband and wife )
Cheongjin , North Hamgyong Province :
Mi-Hae Park , female , 30 Suk - Chun Suh , male , 29
These North Korean Christians had applied for government permission to open a portrait photography studio to help support themselves .
According to VOM sources working in North Korea , they were not involved in espionage activities .
It is believed that items taken by the government were in fact photography equipment to be used in their portrait work .
â€ œFollowing Jesus Christ is considered treason in North Korea , where the government mandates that worship is reserved for deceased dictator Kim Il Sung and his son , the current dictator , Kim Jong Il , â€ said Todd Nettleton , spokesperson for VOM .
â€ œThe Voice of the Martyrs is proud to stand with Christâ€™s followers in North Korea , and deeply concerned for the well - being of our brothers and sisters there .
We call on the North Korean government to release these Christian believers , who were involved in legitimate business activities to support themselves and their families.â€ 
The Voice of the Martyrs has been actively involved in helping North Korean Christians for decades .
Among the projects the ministry has carried out for North Korea is the launch of thousands of â€œscripture balloons , â€ mylar balloons filled with helium and printed on either side with scripture passages .
VOM has conducted other projects to help North Korean Christians but cannot discuss details publicly to protect the safety of VOM workers and contacts inside North Korea .
VOM sources do not know the whereabouts of the arrested believers .
It is possible that they have already been tried and executed .
â€ œWe pray that they are alive , â€ said Nettleton .
â€ œBut we know it is possible that they have finished their race on earth and gone on to their eternal reward in heaven .
We encourage Christians everywhere to pray for our brothers and sisters in North Korea , who must constantly face the threat of arrest , torture and execution simply for living out their faith in Jesus Christ.â€ 
Christians are encouraged to write letters protesting the arrest to the DPRK delegation to the United Nations :

The entire point of today 's " social conservatism " with respect to gay people is not to encourage responsibility , fidelity , marriage or love among gay people ; it is to tell gay people to marry straight people and suppress or " cure " their sexual orientation .
In fact , do yourself a favor and see if you know any social conservatives who actually favor social conservatism for the three percent or so of humanity that is gay .
It 's a useful test , no ?
And , of course , we know the actual consequence of such policies : they undermine and destroy family life .
Here 's one story of a woman who realized she had married a gay man eleven years previously :
There are so many obvious questions for a wife like me : Didn't I realize he was gay ?
Did I ignore red flags ?
And if I had suspicions , why did n't I confront him earlier or divorce him ?
I suppose I was always suspicious , but I was in denial .
Early in our relationship , Chris told me he'd had homosexual experiences as a teenager but assured me it was youthful curiosity .
I did n't think there was anything wrong with being gay I have an openly gay cousin .
And I did n't care what went on behind others ' closed doors .
But I also did n't believe that a gay man would ever be attracted to a straight woman , and I was naive too naive to see why a homosexual man would marry and spend years lying to his wife , his friends , his family and himself .
It 's time to realize that social conservatives who oppose equality in marriage , who defend the closet , and whose main response to emerging gay identity is to block its integration into the family are actually fostering divorce , disease , distrust and social disintegration .
If it 's not merely driven by bigotry and discomfort , why ?
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Senator Barack Obama has run a campaign criticizing what he calls the Politics of the Moment all the while campaigning for his moments .
Well , if this is true , an Obama Moment can emerge :
Despite their rhetoric about not wanting to hand President Bush another " blank check " for the Iraq War , Democrats appear poised to give him exactly that -- enough cash to keep the war going full steam for as long as six months , no strings attached .
. . . Democrats are quietly preparing to give the president enough spending flexibility to keep the war going anyway .
. . .
Democrats began approving billions in extra funding , starting with the first stopgap spending resolution [ I have no idea what Roll Call is talking about here .
I kow of no additional funding measrues that have been passed since the Iraq Supplelemental that was passed prior to Petraeus 's testimony .
Frankly , I think Roll Call is wrong . ]
Next up will be the regular Defense spending bill , expected to go to conference committee Tuesday .
Although the bill is not expected to include funding specifically targeted to Iraq , Democrats plan to allow much of the funding to be diverted from regular Defense accounts to the war .
. . .
( Emphasis supplied . )
The House can not pass such funding without the Senate .
Senator Obama , just say no .
Put a hold on such a bill .
Lead a filibuster against it .
This is your moment .
Prove you are more than just pretty words .

NBC News reported Thursday on an incident at the San Diego airport in which " an American airlines flight to Chicago was delayed because a passenger was scared of several Arabic - speaking men on board . "
" Those men she heard talking ?
They were Iraqi-Americans , in town to train US Marines at Camp Pendleton , " explained NBC 's Brian Williams .
The men were removed from the plane and questioned briefly before being released .
The flight was canceled and all passengers caught other flights the next day .
Al - Arabiya News in Dubai interviewed one of the six men , who explained that their company has a contract with the US government for defense training .
" I do not know why they treated us this way , " he said .
" We actually came to help the Americans . "
Another of the men told a local news station , " How can we be bad if we are helping our people here  American people ?
Why are we getting treated like that ? "
The following video clips is from NBC's Nightly News and Al - Arabiya News in Dubai , U.A.E .
Both clips were broadcast on August 30 .
Taiwan computer maker
Asus might have underestimated the local demand for its diminutive Eee PC , as the $ 499 laptop is now virtually sold out in Australia .
Neither Asus nor the exclusive retailer , Myer , will say how many units were sold , but an Asus spokeswoman said more stock would be shipped to Myer at the end of this week .
The Eee PC , Australia 's cheapest laptop , went on sale in Myer stores nationwide on Sunday and by close of business on Monday all the capital city stores were sold out .
The Asus spokeswoman said other metro stores might have a small amount of stock left .
This will be short , but fun .
Scott McClellan wrote a book .
Here is part of what he has to say
" The most powerful leader in the world had called upon me to speak on his behalf and help restore credibility he lost amid the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
So I stood at the White house briefing room podium in front of the glare of the klieg lights for the better part of two weeks and publicly exonerated two of the senior - most aides in the White House : Karl Rove and Scooter Libby .
" There was one problem .
It was not true .
" I had unknowingly passed along false information .
And five of the highest ranking officials in the administration were involved in my doing so : Rove , Libby , the vice President , the President ’s chief of staff , and the president himself . "
With the release date slipping yet further into the future , Spore seems even more distant than it ever did .
Will Wright 's latest and most ambitious project to date , Spore is almost guaranteed masterpiece status even before its release - and given that Wright seems to have the luxury ( in common with other great designers , such as Shigeru Miyamoto ) of holding the project back until its " ready " there seems little reason to doubt the quality of the finished article , whenever it should arrive .
The purpose of this piece is not to question whether or not Spore will be a great game - I am in little doubt that Spore players will love this game with an abiding passion - but rather to question the impact on the games industry this title has had , and may yet have .
Firstly , I wish to be blunt about the market potential for this title .
I do not believe this game can outsell The Sims , which to date has racked up 16 million unit sales ( and 70 million unit sales of expansions ) , making it the best selling PC game of all time .
Spore should clear 5 million units without breaking a sweat , after which it is likely to begin to struggle , as the early adopters will all be sucked into the vortex , and there may be a struggle to push the number higher .
I predict ultimate sales figure of approximately 8 million units for this game , assuming it is easy enough to use that it can reach out to a wider more " casual " market .
This would put it into the Top 40 Best Selling Games of all time , but a long way shy of the Top 10 ( The Sims , incidentally , is the number 6 Best Selling Game of all time ) .
The problem with this game 's ultimate appeal is that evolving an organism from a microbe to an interstellar empire is an awesome hook for many dedicated PC game players and science fiction geeks - but it is a poor hook outside of this kinds of people .
A World War II shooter has more inherent mass market appeal than anything so focussed on pseudo - scientific details .
Evolution games are not new , and have never been commercially successful - how many people remember Seventh Cross ( NEC Home Electronics , 1999 ) , which was probably the best of the crop so far ?
Only the talent of Will Wright and his team , and the money of EA , will permit Spore to break this trend , which it certainly will do .
Trouble is , EA are very much counting on Spore - and there seems to be a growing fear inside the company that they have banked too much on its success .
Because , frankly , until the announced restructuring , EA was still not signing original content : Spore was one of very few original titles in development inside EA .
Since the last announced delay on Spore , there seems to have been a change internally to EA , and a realisation in the wake of their dipping share prices that they might actually have to do more than continue the sports franchise production line .
And here we come to the next problem .
Spore has swallowed up the game industry 's available new talent .
I started to become concerned for this when Jenova Chen , whose inventive indie company was behind Cloud and Flow , was hired as an addition to the team .
I appreciate that Spore relies upon extremely inventive procedural content tools , and this requires a lot of talent to make it happen .
My concern is what happens to this team after Spore is finished .
If they take this awesome resume point and leverage it into their own inventive projects , then my concerns will be unwarranted .
My suspicion is that most will remain tied up inside EA , and thus unable to pursue their own projects .
A final problem with Spore is perhaps an unfair criticism .
The games industry is in desperate need of innovation - new directions to explore .
Spore does n't really give us that .
It 's going to be an amazing piece of software , and no doubt an engaging play experience .
But beyond that , it seems like a dead end .
If it proves to be more successful than I predict , it wo n't help the industry because no - one other than Wright 's team could afford to make a project of this nature .
And if it proves to be less successful than I predict , will that make it even harder than it already is to push innovative projects through the publishing mill ?
I have little to gain from Spore 's success nor , for that matter , from Spore 's failure .
That makes it hard for me to be excited about its release , now scheduled for sometime around April 2008 ( although do n't be surprised if it slips further ) .
This project will be a great achievement for Will Wright .
But alas , it does n't seem to hold the promise of expanding the market in that incredible and unanticipated manner than The Sims did .

On the night of her primary victory , Senator Clinton credited the people of New Hampshire with helping her find her own voice .
To judge by the rest of her remarks , it is the voice of an angry , divisive class - warrior , more like Senator Edwards than Senator Obama .
" The oil companies , the drug companies , the health insurance companies , the predatory student loan companies have had seven years of a president who stands up for them .
It 's time we had a president who stands up for all of you , " Mrs. Edwa sorry , Clinton told her audience .
She said she would deliver on the promise that " the government will be of the people , by the people and for the people , not just the privileged few . "
It was an echo of Vice President Gore 's Robert Shrum - influenced disaster of a 2000 Democratic convention speech in Los Angeles , in which the Democratic Party 's candidate for president vowed to take on , " Big tobacco , big oil , the big polluters , the pharmaceutical companies , the HMOs , " and said the president " is charged with the responsibility of fighting for all the people , not just the people of one state or one district , not just the wealthy or the powerful , all the people ; especially those who need a voice , those who need a champion , those who need to be lifted up , so they are never left behind . "
The upside is that Mrs. Clinton is raising money from the very industries she is bashing , making her sincerity open to question .
The Center for Responsive Politics reports that Mrs. Clinton has raised $ 269,436 from the pharmaceutical industry , more than any other candidate , including Republicans , and $ 220,550 from the oil and gas industry , more than double what her closest Democratic rivals raised from the industry .
Mrs. Clinton claims she learned from her mistakes the last time around on health care reform , but it's hard to see how demonizing drug companies and health insurers during the campaign would set her up for a successful overhaul of the health - care system on her second try .
Americans anxious about the economy want a president who will help our corporations prosper , not one who will depict vast risk - taking , innovative , and dynamic sectors of American business as public enemies .
If this is the voice Mrs. Clinton has found , it will either be bad news for America or good news for Republicans .
This Bolitoglossa species has a bold red stripe on its back
Video of new species
They were among some 5,000 plants and animals recorded by scientists from London 's Natural History Museum during three expeditions to Central America .
Two species are nocturnal , while the third is a dwarf variety , growing to little longer than a thumbnail .
The three new finds bring the number of Costa Rican salamanders known to science to a total of 43 .
Salamanders eat insects and worms , and live in water or in moist areas .
They usually feed at night and hide during the day , often hibernating during the winter .
Some 300 species are known around the world , mainly in the Northern Hemisphere , but there have been few new discoveries since 1998 , when five new salamanders were found in tropical east - central Mexico .
The three new salamanders were found in La Amistad National Park , a Unesco World Heritage Site on the Costa Rica - Panama border .
Two belong to the nocturnal Bolitoglossa genus ; while the third , from the Nototriton ( dwarf salamander ) family , is a diminutive 3 cm ( 1 inch ) in length .
" Finding so many new species in one area is exciting , particularly as this is probably the only place in the world you can find these animals , " said the NHM's Dr Alex Monro , who is leading the project .
The dwarf salamander is the strangest specimen found
" It shows we still have a lot to learn about the variety of wildlife in this region .
We have four more expeditions planned this year - who knows what we could find when we go back ? "
La Amistad National Park has few roads and treacherous terrain , so remains largely unexplored .
Scientists believe the region is a centre for diversity for these tailed amphibians .
It is thought to be home to some two - thirds of all Costa Rica 's native species , including hundreds of birds , mammals , reptiles and other amphibians , and thousands of plants .
The new species will be named and catalogued by scientists at the University of Costa Rica .
The Natural History Museum is working alongside scientists and officials in Costa Rica and Panama on the project , funded by the UK government 's Darwin Initiative to promote biodiversity conservation .
When I bought my first real car I became ( for the first time ) moderately curious about vehicle performance .
I set about to see how it compared to my previous car performance - wise and was immediately struck by a pivotal question :
What is the most important attribute for acceleration — horsepower or torque ?
My first approach was to ask those immediately around me and call some friends that were into cars and / or racing .
The results were not satisfactory .
I got a few decent responses , but nobody could explain the relationship to me in a way that I could understand .
Most people have strong opinions on this topic , but no actual grasp of the science .
All this did was confuse and intrigue me .
One thing I did figure out is that none of the people arguing were using hard science as the foundation for their argument ; they were invoking science , but were doing so very sloppily .
Well , that was n’t enough for me so I set out to find the real answers .
The fundamentals
So to start with I naturally consulted Google .
Most of the top hits for “ torque vs. horsepower ” are excellent pieces ; they break down the math in a very methodical way , so I wo n’t repeat that excellent work here .
Instead , I ’ll just summarize the basics that are accepted as fact by everyone .
Horsepower : James
Watt came up with the concept of horsepower — which is a measure of , interestingly enough , power .
1 HP is the equivalent of 33,000 ft / lbfs per minute .
The reason for the complex unit is that we ’re accounting for three things with this number : the amount of weight involved , the distance it ’s being moved , and how long it takes to do it ( that last one is important ) .
Torque : Torque is nothing more than a measurement of twisting , or rotational , force .
The easiest way to think of this is to imagine a long shaft — like a car ’s axle — and imagine it ’s in a room suspended in mid air .
Hanging on the bottom of one end is a rope with a weight attached — a very heavy weight .
Now imagine someone trying to , using their hands , twist the shaft so as to lift the weight .
Think of them as essentially trying to act like a winch and reel it up .
Notice this does n’t say anything about how fast you ’re twisting .
The amount of force they are able to generate by twisting is the torque that they ’re able to produce .
Stop thinking of horsepower and torque as completely separate
One unit for measurement of this is the foot - pound .
A foot - pound is the rotational ‘ force ’ generated by hanging a one - pound weight at the end of a 1 - foot wrench .
Why HP and Torque cross at 5252 RPMs
The mistake most people make when engaging in this debate is considering horsepower and torque independently .
Almost everyone argues as if they are separate , unrelated values — which they are not .
Horsepower = ( Torque x RPMs ) / 5252
This equation is the second most important thing on this page , and it ’s the reason that anyone telling you that horsepower and torque should be considered equally and separately is significantly mistaken .
Horsepower is the product of torque and another value — ( RPMs divided by 5252 ) .
It ’s not unrelated , separate , or different .
In fact , there ’s not a single machine in existence that measures a car ’s horsepower .
It ’s a man -made number .
When a car ’s performance is tested , its torque is measured using a dynamometer .
The measure of an engine ’s performance is torque .
Horsepower is an additional number that ’s attained by multiplying the torque by the RPMs .
The physics of acceleration
So now for the most important thing on the page .
What determines true acceleration for a vehicle is n’t at all debatable — it ’s force divided by mass .
The formula for acceleration is seen below .
f = m a
Which means …
a = f / m
The confusion only comes in determining which force we ’re actually talking about .
So we are solving for acceleration and we have a constant mass .
We ’ve already established that torque is the amount of rotational force being generated at the engine , but we are n’t concerned with the force at the engine .
What we ’re interested in is the force at the wheels .
The radius of the wheel matters some as well .
The force at the wheels is the f in f = ma .
But remember , the transmission ultimately gives the force to the wheels , not the engine .
And that ’s the trick to this whole mess !
Gearing is the translator between the engine and the wheels
So that ’s where gearing comes in — it ’s the magnifier for acceleration , given what the engine can produce in power .
Gearing magnifies torque , which is why it ’s so important in racing .
This is why the fastest racecars work at extremely high RPMs .
The torque at the wheels is the torque at the engine combined with the torque magnification given by the transmission through gearing .
So the transmission only sees what ’s coming off the engine , while the wheels see the resulting force combination of the engine plus the transmission .
That ’s what horsepower represents !
It ’s the combination of the benefits of the engine ’s raw abilities combined with RPMs .
And RPMs are what allow us to use gearing effectively , which gives us more torque at the wheels .
And torque at the wheels is the f in f=ma .
Conclusion
So a technical answer to the question of , “ What makes acceleration : torque or horsepower ? ” , is torque .
But torque at the wheels — not at the engine .
And becauase acceleration is torque at the wheels , the real answer is horsepower , because horsepower encompasses not only the engine ’s torque but the total torque that gets delivered to the wheels .
Notes
Sweet Caroline Kennedy
penned the hit song " Sweet Caroline " back in the late 60's .
The song , his first after a recording slump , went right to the top of the record charts and has endured .
He recently unburdened himself of a closely guarded secret .
The songwriter received his inspiration from a picture of 9 year old Caroline Kennedy .
Diamond held the information close to his vest , hoping that some day he would have an opportunity to share it with Caroline Kennedy , daughter and only surviving child of the late John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis .
That day arrived last week when the singer was asked to perform the song via satellite during Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg 's 50th birthday party .
So now Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg knows that she is Sweet Caroline .
We 've included a picture of Jackie Kennedy and her children as Caroline christened the aircraft carrier named for her father - at about age 9 .

The cosmic cloud is heading for us at more than 240km / s
Dubbed " Smith 's Cloud " , it may set off spectacular fireworks when it smacks into our galaxy in 20 - 40 million years .
It contains enough hydrogen to produce a million stars like our Sun , researchers believe .
When it does fully interact with our galaxy , the cloud could indeed set off a new burst of star formation in the Milky Way .
Details of the work , by a team at the US National Radio Astronomy Observatory and the University of Wisconsin - Whitewater , were unveiled at the 211th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Austin , Texas .
Impressive sight
Smith 's Cloud is named after the astronomer who discovered it in 1963 .
But until now , astronomers had no idea whether it was leaving the Milky Way or falling into it .
The new work , which used the Green Bank telescope ( GBT ) in West Virginia to observe the object , shows , unmistakably , that the latter is true .
Astronomers have taken detailed images of the cloud
The monster cosmic " fog bank " is careering towards our galaxy at more than 240 km /s ( 150 miles / s ) and is set to strike the Milky Way at an angle of 45 degrees .
Broadly speaking , the cloud is currently rotating with our galaxy , but is also moving in towards it .
Astronomers can see a wall of gas being ploughed up as Smith 's Cloud thuds into the outskirts of our galaxy 's atmosphere .
Lead author Dr Felix Lockman , from the NRAO , said the object , which lies at a distance of 40,000 light - years from Earth , would make an impressive sight if it could be seen with the naked eye .
" We do n't know quite where it came from yet , as its orbit is a little confused , but we can tell it is beginning to interact with the outskirts of the Milky Way , that it is suffering drag and that bits of it are falling off , " he told the BBC News website .
" But at the same time , it is feeling the gravitational pull of the Milky Way and is plunging in towards the disc . "
By the time it merges with our galaxy , Smith 's cloud will strike a region some distance from the location of our Solar System , about 90 degrees ahead of us in the disc of the Milky Way .
Celestial New Year
Where it does collide , the cloud will generate shockwaves in the gas already residing in the Milky Way .
" It will be just like letting a bomb go off , " said Dr Lockman , " but you also create a lot of new gas which may have different properties to the existing gas .
The shockwaves will set off a tremendous burst of star formation .
These stars will be massive , rushing through their lives quickly and exploding as supernova .
" Over a few million years , it 'll look like a celestial New Year 's celebration , with huge firecrackers going off in that region of the galaxy , " said Dr Lockman .
Co-author Dr Robert Benjamin , from the University of Wisconsin- Whitewater , told BBC News : " If the drag is sufficient , and the cloud fragments , there could be less of an effect .
But at the moment , it looks like it is holding together quite tightly . "
Astronomers had previously surmised that a region of bright stars called Gould 's Belt , which lies close to our own Sun , could have been created in just this way .
" This is the first time we 're actually seeing it happen , " said Dr Lockman .
" The Milky Way is still under bombardment - there are still fragments of it coming in and arriving on the scene .
When this happens , it can bring fresh gas and trigger new star formation .
And it 's interesting to speculate whether this [ once ] happened near the Sun . "
The gas cloud was discovered in 1963 by the young American astronomer Gail Smith working at Leiden University in the Netherlands .
She subsequently left science but still lives in the Netherlands .

Revealed : Bush EPA chief says she quit after Cheney rewrote coal power plant rules John Byrne
Published : Wednesday June 27 , 2007 Print This Email This Christine Todd Whitman is the media darling of talk shows , the conservative former governor of New Jersey and head of President George W. Bush 's Environmental Protection Agency who quit the Bush Administration to " spend more time with her family . "
Evidently , that 's not true .
In a groundbreaking article today by the Washington Post , the paper alleges that Whitman left the Administration because they pressured her to accept pro-industry coal power plant rules which threatened ghoulish levels of air pollution .
After industry officials complained to Vice President Cheney about Clinton - era rules requiring plants to update their technology when they conducted routine maintenance to comply with air quality standards , Cheney turned to Whitman , she said .
Whitman told the Post she'd " been stunned by what she viewed as an unquestioned belief that EPA 's regulations were primarily to blame for keeping companies from building new power plants .
"
" I was upset , mad , offended that there seemed to be so much head - nodding around the table , " she said .
She said she had to fight " tooth and nail " to keep Cheney from turning over the rewriting of the rules to the Energy Department .
Whitman says she wanted a return to Bush 's " Clear Skies " initiative , but that went nowhere .
Whitman brought two folders to show President Bush .
The first was 2 1 / 2 inches thick , detailing the dangers of raising legal levels of arsenic in drinking water -- another Administration proposal .
She pointed to a folder she 'd brought " four or five times as thick . "
" If you think arsenic was bad , " she recalled telling Bush , " look at what has already been written about this . "
Nothing changed .
After the EPA rewrote the coal power plant standards , the White House essentially rewrote the rules to favor industry .
Whitman said she 'd had enough .
" I just could n't sign it , " she told the Post .
" The president has a right to have an administrator who could defend it , and I just could n't . "
Soon thereafter , a federal appeals court found that the rule change violated the Clean Air Act -- according to the paper , the judges said the administration had redefined the law in a way that could be valid " only in a Humpty - Dumpty world . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The House voted Thursday to hold White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and former White House lawyer Harriet Miers in contempt in its probe of the 2006 firings of U.S. attorneys .
Former White House counsel Harriet Miers refused to appear at a hearing into the firings of U.S. attorneys .
The House voted 223- 23 to hold the two Bush aides in contempt of Congress .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino called the move " a partisan , futile act " that would not be enforced by the Justice Department .
And the chamber 's Republican minority staged a walkout before the vote , demanding that Democratic leaders vote instead on a revision of federal surveillance laws .
" We will not stand here and watch this floor be abused for pure political grandstanding at the expense of our national security , " Minority Leader John Boehner said to jeers from Democrats .
But Rep. Louise Slaughter , D - New York , said Congress has to uphold its authority against a White House that is refusing to cooperate with a congressional investigation .
And Rep. John Conyers , D - Michigan , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , said Congress has a right to hear from White House officials about the shakeup , which the Justice Department struggled to explain after it became public .
" There was plenty of evidence in our report that showed and suggested there had been many lines crossed between appropriateness and inappropriateness , legality and illegality , and perhaps constitutional violations as well , " Conyers said .
Three Republicans who did not take part in the walkout -- including current presidential hopeful Ron Paul of Texas -- supported the resolution , while one Democrat , Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar , opposed it .
The White House has insisted the firings were legal .
But Democrats said the central questions behind the dismissals -- who decided the prosecutors should be ousted , and why -- remain unanswered .
Miers and Bolten had refused to testify in the investigation , which stemmed from the Justice Department 's dismissals of federal prosecutors in eight cities .
President Bush has invoked a blanket executive privilege covering the testimony of all former and current White House officials and documents subpoenaed by Congress on the controversial firings .
The White House argues that the contempt - of - Congress laws do not apply to the president or any officials who invoke executive privilege , and that forcing the aides to testify would violate the Constitution 's separation of powers .
Perino said the administration will not act to enforce Thursday 's resolution .
" It 's been well understood that throughout history , that while the executive and legislative branches have had disputes , that the Justice Department will not ask the United States attorney to follow through on the contempt charges , " she said .
But Thursday 's resolution authorizes the House Judiciary Committee to go to court to enforce the subpoenas issued to Miers and Bolten .
The committee first recommended contempt proceedings in July , and Conyers said , " We waited as long as we could " to go forward .
While some conversations between the president and top advisers may be considered private , Rep. Brad Miller , D - North Carolina , said Bush 's claim " goes well beyond any privilege that 's been recognized by any court . "
" What is unacceptable is the idea that the president himself should decide , " he said .

BEIJING -- Rights groups on Wednesday praised Hollywood director Steven Spielberg 's decision to shun involvement with the Beijing Olympics opening and closing ceremonies because China was not doing enough to help end the crisis in Darfur .
Spielberg 's move marked a high - profile setback for Beijing and its efforts to keep at bay a monthslong campaign by activists to spotlight the authoritarian communist regime 's human rights record .
Although not entirely unexpected , it appeared to catch Beijing organizers flat - footed .
" The Darfur issue is not China 's internal affair and was not started by China .
Linking the two is nonsense ; it is also irresponsible and unfair , " an unidentified spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. was quoted as saying in the state - run Global Times newspaper on Thursday .
" Many people think the Olympics are a sports event but the West wants to bind sports and politics , this is a clumsy trick , " said the highly nationalistic daily , published by the Communist Party mouthpiece People 's Daily .
" Many people think the Olympics are a sports event but the West wants to bind sports and politics , this is a clumsy trick , " said the highly nationalistic daily , published by the Communist Party mouthpiece People 's Daily .
Spielberg , who won an Oscar for his 1993 Holocaust film " Schindler 's List , " said he had not signed his contract to serve as an artistic adviser to the Games ' opening and closing ceremonies in hopes that dialogue with China would produce results .
China is believed to have special influence with Sudan because it buys two - thirds of the country 's oil exports , while selling the regime weapons and defending Khartoum in the U.N. Security Council .
" While China 's representatives have conveyed to me that they are working to end the terrible tragedy in Darfur , the grim realities of the suffering continue unabated , " Spielberg said in a statement Tuesday .
Praising his decision , Human Rights Watch said Beijing must also be pressured to improve " deplorable " human rights conditions at home as well as to act on Darfur , where fighting between government - backed militia and rebels has left more than 200,000 people dead and an estimated 2.5 million displaced since 2003 .
" Corporate sponsors , governments and National Olympic Committees should urge Beijing to improve human rights conditions in China , " the New York - based group said .
Spielberg , whose 2005 film " Munich " dealt with the killings of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics , had indicated as early as August that he might not take part in the ceremonies , but Beijing seemed unprepared to respond when his formal announcement came .
Two spokesmen for the Beijing organizing committee said they were preparing a response .
A U.S. - based consultant from public relations firm Hill & Knowlton , hired by the organizing committee , did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment .
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was seeking more information before commenting .
Spielberg 's announcement Tuesday could be a major blow to Beijing 's promotion of the Aug.
8 - 24 Olympics as a symbol of China 's integration into mainstream global society .
In bidding for the Games in 2001 , China promised IOC members that the Olympics would lead to an improved climate for human rights , but most independent monitoring groups say Beijing has failed to live up to that pledge .
Beijing has invested billions of dollars and its national prestige into what it hopes will be a glorious showcase of China 's rapid development from impoverished agrarian nation to rising industrial power .
Already , however , the country has been heavily beset by criticism from rights groups , celebrities and international media that threatens to dampen the mood surrounding the Games .
Highlighting concerns over free speech in Beijing , the British Olympic Association on Monday was compelled to acknowledge that an agreement it asked its athletes to sign appeared to go beyond International Olympic Committee rules barring any " demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda " at an Olympic venue or area .
Rights groups had castigated the BOA for attempting to gag its athletes and a number of other national Olympic committees responded by ruling out similar restrictions .
China 's entirely state - controlled media carried no mention of Spielberg 's announcement and state censors earlier blacked out overseas satellite television reports about the complaints against the BOA .
However , the Global Times , a highly nationalistic tabloid published by the Communist Party mouthpiece People 's Daily , ran a front page report on the British Olympic Association issue Wednesday , casting China as the victim of prejudiced overseas media and pressure groups .
" It is hard to see Western bias dying down in the short term , " the paper said .
Officially , the government 's response to such criticism has been to angrily lash out at what it calls attempts to " politicize " the Games .
" To link the Darfur issue to the Olympics is a move to politicize the Olympics and this is inconsistent with the Olympic spirit and will bear no fruit , " Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said on Jan. 24 -- the ministry 's most recent comment on the issue .
A spokeswoman for Adidas , which is estimated to be spending $ 200 million for sponsorship rights to the Beijing Games , said the sporting goods maker was committed to its relationship with the Games .
The German company 's official statement on Darfur and the Olympics states , " We do not believe we have the political leverage that the campaigners attribute to us . "

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
An upsurge of technological change and a rising tide of new forms of data are working a deep transformation of the Internet ’s capabilities and uses .
In this third phase of Net evolution , network architectures and commercial business plans reflect the dominance of rich video and media traffic .
From YouTube , IPTV , and high - definition images , to “ cloud computing ” and ubiquitous mobile cameras — to 3D games , virtual worlds , and photorealistic telepresence — the new wave is swelling into an exaflood of Internet and IP traffic .
An exabyte is 10 to the 18th .
We estimate that by 2015 , U.S. IP traffic could reach an annual total of one zettabyte ( 1021 bytes ) , or one million million billion bytes .
We began using the term “ exaflood ” in 2001 to convey the vast gulf between the total traffic on the nation ’s local area networks , then 15 exabytes a month , and the thousandfold smaller flows across the Internet .
We predicted then that the deployment of broadband networks would bring exafloods of data to the Net .
Today it is happening .
We estimate that in the U.S. by 2015 :
movie downloads and P2P file sharing could be 100 exabytes
video calling and virtual windows could generate 400 exabytes
“ cloud ” computing and remote backup could total 50 exabytes
Internet video , gaming , and virtual worlds could produce 200 exabytes
non-Internet “ IPTV ” could reach 100 exabytes , and possibly much more
business IP traffic will generate some 100 exabytes
other applications ( phone , Web , e-mail , photos , music ) could be 50 exabytes
The U.S. Internet of 2015 will be at least 50 times larger than it was in 2006 .
Internet growth at these levels will require a dramatic expansion of bandwidth , storage , and traffic management capabilities in core , edge , metro , and access networks .
A recent Nemertes Research study estimates that these changes will entail a total new investment of some $ 137 billion in the worldwide Internet infrastructure by 2010 .
In the U.S. , currently lagging Asia , the total new network investments will exceed $ 100 billion by 2012 .
Technology remains the key engine of U.S. economic growth and its competitive edge .
Policies that encourage investment and innovation in our digital and communications sectors should be among America ’s highest national priorities .
Read the rest of the article here .
It is a good time to be a deceitful politician or a pay - for - favors lobbyist or a crooked corporate CEO .
That ’s because the profession that is charged in a democracy with ferreting out such miscreants is losing some members of its “ A ” team .
Despite its ills and errors , The New York Times remains the best newspaper in America .
But the business model to which the industry remains fanatically obsessed â€ ” maximize shareholder income at the expense of the quality of its product â€ ” is about to slip a knife into the muscle and bone of The Times ‘ reporting staff .
The Times will trim its newsroom staff of 1,332 by about 100 :
The cuts will be achieved â€œby not filling jobs that go vacant , by offering buyouts , and if necessary by layoffs , â€ the executive editor , Bill Keller , said .
The more people who accept buyouts , he said , â€ œthe smaller the prospect of layoffs , but we should brace ourselves for the likelihood that there will be some layoffs .â€ 
He said , â€ œWe intend to move quickly , to get any cuts past us so that we do not spend a year bleeding slowly .â€ 
More than any other set of job cuts in the news biz , these are the most troubling .
Like it or not ,
The Times has held fast to its reputation for credibility , accuracy and fearlessness for more than a century .
Yes , it ’s often too liberal .
Yes , Judith Miller ’s pro-Iraq reporting left some slime on the masthead .
Yes , The Washington Post beat it on Watergate .
And yes ,
The Times can be irritatingly patrician and arrogant .
But it ’s ability to latch onto a story and extract every last dram of news is unparalleled in American journalism .
The New York Times Co. , which owns
The Times , has not always been the best - run of American media .
But it ’s still making money :
For 2007 , the Times Company recently reported earnings of $ 208.7 million on revenue of $ 3.2 billion .
The companyâ€™s newspaper segment had an 8 percent operating margin last year , compared with 13 to 22 percent for several other large newspaper publishers .
Newspaper industry ad revenue fell about 7 percent last year , and 4.7 percent at the Times Company , hurt by both the slowing economy and the rise of Internet advertising .
Executives around the industry have projected that 2008 will be equally bad .
[ emphasis added ]
By now , it ’s an old story â€ ” falling revenues from print advertising caused , in part , by declining readership .
Rapidly increasing online readership has produced dramatic gains in online ad revenue â€ ” but gross online ad revenue still pales with gross print ad revenue .
Apparently , there ’s just not enough breathing room , newspaper management believes , between shifting high gross ad revenues from a print - dominated enterprise to an online - dominated one .
And The Times does well online â€ ” at least in terms of readership :
Revenues are falling even as readership of major newspapers climbs sharply because of the Web .
Most major papers set records for Internet traffic last month , Nielsen / NetRatings reported Thursday ; the Web site of The Times had more than 20 million unique visitors , more than any other newspaper site .
[ emphasis added ]
But cutting the reporting resources of The Times will have consequences â€ ” just as newsroom cuts at other newspapers nationally have .
Fewer reporters will be available to do the more stories desperatedly needed about an increasingly complex society .
The Times has a newsroom budget of more than $ 200 million .
It is one of a few news organizations that has not reduced its coverage of Iraq , which costs about $ 3 million a year .
Expenses have also been increased by an unusually long and competitive presidential campaign .
Cutting 100 reporters may reduce the effectiveness overall of The Times ‘ commitment to Iraq and political coverage .
The Times Co. ’s shareholders may gain , but we , the readers , will lose some measure of quality in the old Grey Lady ’s news columns .
Said editor Keller :
To meet our budget goals , we will have to do a little less , and every time we do less , we cede a bit of advantage .
Our challenge will be to set our priorities in such a way that we do less in the areas that damage our competitiveness least .
This is not a positive development for American journalism .
If the nation ’s best newspaper becomes less effective journalistically , it will be costly in ways we can not yet predict .
At the least , those who seek to hide misdeeds from sunlight will be emboldened .

Forget the glitzy restaurants of New York and London : only in Zimbabwe would a hamburger actually cost millions of dollars .
The central bank of the southern African country has a issued a 10 million Zimbabwe dollar note .
The move increases the denomination of the nation 's highest bank note more than tenfold .
Even so , a hamburger in an ordinary cafe in Zimbabwe costs 15 million Zimbabwe dollars .
Scroll down for more ...
The hope is that such a move will help end chronic cash shortages and disperse long , chaotic lines at banks and automated teller machines .
Reserve Bank Governor Gideon Gono said in a statement the 10 million Zimbabwe dollars notes will be issued along with 1 million and 5 million Zimbabwe dollars bills .
Previously , the highest existing note , introduced last month , was for 750,000 Zimbabwe dollars .
The new 10 million note is the equivalent of about £ 2 at the dominant black market exchange rate .
A hamburger at an ordinary cafe costs about 15 million Zimbabwe dollars ( £3 ) .
That hamburger has trebled in price this month amid shortages of bread , meat and most basic goods .
Zimbabwe faces the world 's highest official inflation of an estimated 25,000 per cent .
Independent financial institutions say real inflation is closer to 150,000 per cent .
Acknowledging the inflation crisis , Gono said individuals would be allowed to withdraw an increased limit of 500 million Zimbabwe dollars ( £ 100 ) in a single daily withdrawal , up from 50 million ( £ 10 ) .
He said special arrangements were being made to pay soldiers , police and other uniformed services " because it is not desirable to see them queuing for cash " .
Gono said with higher denomination bills businesses might be tempted to again raise prices of scarce goods .
" If this happens the whole objective of solving the cash shortages and to bring convenience to the people will be defeated , " he said .
In August 2006 , the central bank slashed three zeros from the nation 's old currency .
Yesterday , the White House released their 2009 NASA budget that Congress will amend , rework and hopefully pass by the end of the 2008 fiscal year .
You can see some responsiveness to the science and environmental communities with increased dollars for the science directorate and two additional climate change monitoring missions added in .
In Washington DC , rather than watch the groundhog in February to see what the future holds , we watch what the President sends to Congress for NASA 's budget ...
Funding for the human lunar missions , the COTS program ( which invests lightly in alternative commercial paths to Low Earth Orbit ) , and fulfilling our international commitments remained intact .
Overall the NASA Presidential request amounts to a 2.9 % increase over last year .
The budget includes money for six new earth science missions .
According to a post by Frank Morring of Aviation Week :
One of them , the Soil Moisture Active / Passive ( SMAP ) mission , would measure soil moisture following a planned 2012 launch .
The Ice ,
Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite - 2 ( ICESat - 2 ) mission would measure the height of ice sheets , sea ice and forests when it orbits in
2015 .
According to an article by The Associate Press , the associate administrator for science was pleased :
" Think of NASA 's blue logo as turning a little bit greener , " NASA
sciences chief Alan Stern [ said ] Monday .
" We are amping up our emphasis on Earth sciences . "
There is also a new science mission , a top priority of the agency 's
" Beyond Einstein " advisory committee , called
the Joint Dark Energy Mission that will be launched in the middle of the next decade .
Further astrophysics missions will also be added in response to the results of the National Academy 's " Decadal " Survey in 2010 .
The 2009 budget also promises a flag ship mission to the outer planets in the next decade as well as a Mars sample return mission by 2020 .

The Dutch ISP LeaseWeb can't take the pressure from BREIN anymore .
As a preliminary measure they have now ordered dozens of BitTorrent sites - including some big - shots - to pack their stuff before December 1st , leave LeaseWeb and find a new home .
Last week we reported that LeaseWeb forced SumoTorrent to move to another ISP due to pressure from BREIN .
In that article we published a list of other potential BRIEN targets hosted by LeaseWeb ( we left out dozens of other sites ) including mybittorrent.com , btmon.com , btjunkie.org , seedpeer.com , what.cd and waffles.fm .
Over the past few days several admins of the sites in this list confirmed to TorrentFreak that they indeed got a letter from LeaseWeb in which they were asked to move their websites before the end of the month .
At this point it is not sure whether the dozens of other , mostly smaller private BitTorrent communities , received a similar letter .
A questionable request since BitTorrent sites are not considered to be illegal according to Dutch law .
However , it seems that LeaseWeb has succumbed to BREIN ’s pressure as it orders its clients to take all BitTorrent related material from their servers before December 1st .
LeaseWeb takes this proactive measure to protect their clients they say , but it ’s not needed since the court order that BREIN has applies ONLY to everlasting .nl and not to all other BitTorrent sites
One of the biggest mistakes they made in the process is to hand over the personal details of the SumoTorrent administrator .
Somehow LeaseWeb was under the impression that they had to give this information to BREIN , thereby violating the privacy of one of their clients .
This mistake also contradicts a statement LeaseWeb gave earlier this week to ISPam.nl , where they said that they are not allowed to give customer information to a third party without a funded request .
One of the big questions right now is where on earth all the BitTorrent sites will go now that LeaseWeb is a no - go .
There are still some other options in The Netherlands and countries like Canada and Sweden , but they are slowly running out of alternatives .
LeaseWeb announced that it will appeal the decision in the everlasting .nl case , “ LeaseWeb has filed an appeal and will keep fighting for its client ’s privacy and right of freedom of expression up to the highest court . ”
We wish them well .
Last week , we learned that struggling music download service Napster will be raising prices on its subscription service for the first time in four years .
Today , the company has announced that they will begin offering MP3 downloads in the second quarter of this year , allowing customers to play their music on more devices , including iPods .
With all four of the record labels now offering DRM - free music that can be played on most any device , competitors to iTunes such as Napster and Amazon now have at least a fighting chance by being able to sell music that works on the ubiquitous iPod .
For Napster , the hope is obviously that offering MP3s will lead to more downloads , which , the company charges 99 each cents for on top of their unlimited streaming plan that now costs $ 12.95 / mo .
As noted in our coverage last week , Napster has enough cash to last about 18 more months at its current burn rate , so short of raising more capital , the company needs to begin pulling in more revenue through music sales .
MP3s are a step in the right direction , and with 750,000 subscribers according to Reuters , the company has a substantial user base to upsell which might help them turn things around .
However , competition is fierce , with Amazon already offering an extensive catalog of DRM - free music in its digital music store .

What do you get someone if you want to show you appreciate them , but if you do n’t have a lot of money to spend ?
If you have a lot of money , you can buy just about anything for that person .
But for those of us with limited budgets , you ’ll have to show that appreciation with a little creativity .
Australian reader Victory recently asked :
I ’m in my final year of high school and in about a fortnight we graduate before heading off to exams ( in Australia for those who live in Victoria ) and so I was wondering if you could perhaps make a post about Teacher gifts .
I ’m a little low on ideas for showing gratitude to my teachers but I know they deserve something decent for helping me getting into university and such so perhaps you could offer frugal but tasteful advice on gifts other than the usual wine / beer / chocolate ?
It ’s a great question .
Teachers are some of the most selfless people I know , and the work they do benefits us individually and as a society .
However , I thought I ’d broaden the topic for those who are n’t in school … and talk about frugal gift ideas for showing your appreciation to someone .
Let ’s first identify what ’s essential : that we show the person who has done something nice for us how much we appreciate them .
It ’s not essential that the gift be big , or expensive , or anything like that .
It ’s a token of our appreciation … and let me tell you , no matter how small , the person will likely appreciate the gesture .
The gift should also be appropriate to the person — if it ’s personal , it ’s likely to mean more .
So while wine is always a nice gift , if the person is into other types of drinks ( such as coffee ) , that would make a better gift .
So take a moment to consider the person , what they like , and the times you ’ve spent together .
So , let ’s look at some ideas … some obvious , perhaps , but this list is meant only to spark your own ideas .
Also , the definition of “ frugal ” is broad here … some ideas cost more than others , and some can be made for very little .
Clean Tech : " It 's the institutional investors , stupid . "
February 15th , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
Nearly 50 leading U.S. and European institutional investors managing over $ 1.75 trillion in assets released a climate change action plan at the United Nations that calls on Congress to introduce national policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90 % below 1990 levels by 2050 .
U.S. institutional investors also pledged $ 10 billion dollars over two years in renewable energy technologies and project development , energy efficiency , green building and clean technologies .
The group of investors also wants the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , to insist that companies listed in New York and elsewhere disclose their exposure to climate change risk .
The plan aims for a 20 % reduction in energy used in core land and building investments over a three - year period .
The two largest pension funds in the US , the California Public Employees ’ Retirement System , with some $ 246.7 billion under its management , and the California State Teachers ’ Retirement System , $ 168.8 billion strong , were both on board with the institutional investor coalition .
These two large and incredibly wealthy pension funds tend to be leaders in the institutional investor arena .
George McPherson , senior managing director of the DC - based private equity firm Global Environment Fund said he expects other pension funds to create more programs geared towards clean technology over the next year .
The initiative was unveiled at the Investor Summit on Climate Risk hosted in New York by the United Nations Foundation and Ceres’ Investor Network on Climate Risk .
Ceres is a national network of investors , environmental organizations and other public interest groups working with companies and investors to address sustainability challenges such as global climate change .
John Sweeney , the president of the AFL - CIO , a federation of unions , told the summit that some of the $ 5 trillion of union workers ’ retirement funds should be invested in ways that help fight climate change .
“ These deferred wages of working people are the capital that can fuel the energy economy of the future , ” he said .
Summit attendees were also given information from a new report , which concluded that major investments in energy productivity over the next 10 years could bring in double - digit rates of return .
The Take - Home Points :
Institutional investors are one of the most important macro-economic drivers in this economy .
Many of the assets that the large institutional investment funds have to invest , are collections of people ’s retirement funds and 401Ks .
People often do not worry a whole lot about their pension funds , and how they are invested , as long as they see a return on their investment .
With that said , it is good to see institutional investors combine their tremendous clout to put pressure on the federal government while taking some social responsibility themselves .
The record - breaking profits of the big oil companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron over the last few years was made possible , in part , by the large amount of broad - based investment from large institutional investors .
People may talk out of one side of their mouth about the evils of big oil without even knowing that their retirement nesteggs are being lined with the profits of those same companies .
Institutional transparency and accountability are important to socially - conscious investors , and I see this as a step in the right direction .
Clean tech investors ( both large and small ) want long term security and stability before they are willing to invest significant capital .
Investors and industry need certainty over what the regulatory regime will be over the next two to three decades before they release the billions of investment capital that will finance the shift we need to make to a low - carbon economy .

Oh , those crazy liberals with their conspiracy theories !
Now they 've wondering whether the fire in Cheney 's office was deliberately set in order to burn incriminating records .
They obviously do n't understand either digital technology or the nature of evil .
For one thing , Cheney 's staff has been shredding paper documents for months .
They do n't need to destroy them in such a conspicuous way .
For another , most records of importance are stored on computer disks nowadays , not paper .
If you 've erased 5 million emails , God ( or Somebody Else ) knows how many hard drives you 've wiped .
There 's a much more innocent explanation for the Cheney fire , and all I 'm going to say is ...
See , kids !
That 's why I wo n't let you conduct Satanic rituals in the basement .
Oh , sure .
Recite a harmless prayer to Asmodai , draw a harmless Pentangle on the floor in chalk ... then somebody trips over a candle , and next thing you know Smokey the Bear is wrestling Old Scratch to keep the rec room paneling from going up in flames .
So , in all probability , they were just doing their usual heat - the - sacrificial - blood - with - candle - wax routine at the weekly staff meeting when the candelabra tipped over .
These things happen .
No need to get all conspiratorial about it .
Now we learn that the mantle of obsessive secrecy has been handed from Cheney to Giuliani , and that Rudy - who described his mayoralty as " an open book " - took 2000 boxes of records with him when he left office .
That is to say , all of them .
Could that " open book " actually be ... the Necromicon ?
I think I 've seen this movie .
Rudy has now officially inherited Cheney 's legacy of good old - fashioned evil .
He 's got Dick 's secrecy obsession ... the dubious clients and national - security profiteering ... and he 's using the same cabal of discredited neocons .
Who knows how long he 's been joining the Vice President in secret rituals to propitiate the Horned One ?
After all , it worked once before .
There might even have been a formal ceremony to pass down Satan 's earthly Viceregency , in which the VP handed over his hooded cloak , the Evil Eye amulet , and his crooked staff ( and no , we do n't mean Scooter Libby ) .
It would have been a good career move for Rudy , and the sacrifices the Dark Lord requires are n't great : just a few minutes of your time each day for worship , your immortal soul ... oh , and if you 're a guy , you get male pattern baldness .
That 's a small price to pay to rule the world .
Until recently this Lucifer gambit had been paying off for the Mayor , but now he 's slipping in the polls .
Does it have something to do with that ceremony in Cheney 's office ?
Did something go terribly wrong , accidentally binding Satan to a candidate other than the one they had planned ?
Only the Antichrist himself knows for sure .

How to Rig an Election : Convicted Phone - Jammer Tells All Disgraced ex-GOP consultant Allen Raymond reveals his secrets and dirty tricks .
Jan. 6 , 2008  --
What does it take to win the New Hampshire primary — dirty tricks or retail politics ?
Stick to good old - fashioned politicking , says disgraced former GOP consultant Allen Raymond .
" Retail politics and authenticity , " he tells ABCNEWS.com .
" Up in New Hampshire , they have great expectations of what you need to do as a candidate and you have to do it . "
Raymond should know .
After all , he 's the one who ran an illegal scheme to make hundreds of calls to jam the phone lines of the state 's Democrats on Election Day in 2002 .
The former consultant , who served three months in jail last year , tells his story and reveals secrets of the trade in his new book , " How to Rig an Election : Confessions of a Republican Operative . "
Raymond blames the Republican Party for making him the fall guy and claims that his scheme was approved by a top state GOP official and the Republican National Committee 's northeast regional director .
Raymond says that the RNC 's former New England chairman , James Tobin , called him Oct. 18 , 2002 , asking , " If I had a couple of phone numbers that I wanted to shut down on Election Day , could you do that ? "
Tobin and state official Chuck McGee were later convicted of charges related to the ploy , which helped John Sunnunu win a 19,000 - vote victory to the Senate over Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen .
But defense lawyers , who were paid more than $ 6 million by GOP committees , recently won a retrial for James Tobin , the former official with the RNC .
Raymond lashes out at his " old pals " at the RNC for spending money on Tobin 's legal defense " while at the same time labeling me a liar , a rogue and a thief to any news outlet that would listen . "
And he claims that the state GOP wrote him to demand its money back after paying him to carry out the scheme .
" They were going to throw me under the bus , but first they wanted to check my pockets to see if there was any cash there , " he writes .
Tobin and his lawyer did not return calls seeking comment .
A spokesman for the RNC said , " It would be hard to find two less credible individuals than Allen Raymond and [ co - writer ] Ian Spiegelman . "
Raymond also describes his career in opposition research and political dirty tricks , outlining some tactics he observed or participated in .
Here 's a handy check list of ways to rig an election , based on Raymond 's account :
For now , Raymond is unemployed and looking for a new career , since his life in politics is finished .
" No one would hire and if they wanted to hire me , why would I want to work for them , " he tells ABCNEWS.com .
" It 's like that old Groucho Marx line about not joining a club that would have me as a member . "
But he can't help following the campaign and takes mental notes on the dirty tricks that he 's seen so far .
" The most blatant dirty trick is when Republicans go on to TV to talk about ' Barack Hussein Obama . ' "
Raymond was struck by the calls to the pastors in Iowa that threatened them with IRS subpoenas .
" That 's some rough stuff . "
Raymond is also following New Hampshire Attorney General Kelly Ayotte 's investigation of the anti-Mormon calls that targeted Mitt Romney and his faith in November .
Avotte described the role of two firms in the ploy : Western Wats , of Orem , Utah , which made the calls , and Moore - Information Inc. , of Portland , Ore. , which hired Western Wats .
" That was not nickel - and - dime stuff , " says Raymond , explaining that the cost of such an operation narrows the field of suspects .
" It could n't have come from Huckabee , McCain or Thompson — they do n't have enough money to pay for that kind of operation . "
" All campaigns have an element of dirty tricks , " he says .
" Guys who practice this trade are hired to engineer a victory .
This is not about morality — this is about winning . "
So far , he 's most impressed with Barack Obama 's campaign and not for the reasons you 'd think .
" What is refreshing about him is that he is bringing a level of energy , to rise above the partisanship we 've seen , " he says .
" I do n't know what 's more amazing about last night , his win or his speech .
I never got that in my life in politics — working for someone who inspires you . "
Not that it matters .
" I ca n't even vote and no one 's asked me for my support . "
Pupils queue at the fingerprint point before collecting lunch
Parents pay in advance , often over the internet , at the Deanes School in Benfleet to avoid issues linked with children having cash .
The schools said the system also helped it promote healthy eating .
Children can no longer buy sweets or fizzy drinks and the risk of losing their money is reduced , it added .
Web service
Head teacher Jan Atkinson said : " As a specialist Sports College with over 1,000 pupils we have had a healthy living focus for the past 18 - months .
" The implementation of cashless catering further enables us to ensure that the students receive nutritious healthy meals .
" A significant number of parents are now also using a web service to make secure online payments to schools by credit and debit card .
" This allows parents to put money in their children 's account and be sure that it is spent in the school dining room and not elsewhere . "
System expands
In addition , parents can get a report showing what their child has bought .
" This has been found to be very reassuring for parents whose children have allergies , childhood diabetes or similar conditions where their diet needs careful monitoring , " Mrs Atkinson added .
At the point of payment the pupil places their finger on the fingertip scanner , and once successfully verified their account is debited .
The head teacher said the school was now looking at other ways of using the technology , such as school travel .

According to Wikipedia , " the increasing salinity , algae , and bacteria levels have taken their toll on tourism , and many of the Salton Sea resorts are now closed and abandoned .
Before recent water control measures were implemented , the Salton Sea 's surface tended to rise and fall severely , causing flooding in some of the surrounding communities .
The area still draws over 150,000 vacationers a year , primarily to the local campsites , trailer parks , and the Salton Sea State Recreation Area " .

" Once known as the “ California Riviera ” , the Salton sea is now called one of America ’s worst ecological disasters : a fetid , stagnant , salty lake , coughing up dead fish and birds by the thousands " .
According to Wikipedia , " the increasing salinity , algae , and bacteria levels have taken their toll on tourism , and many of the Salton Sea resorts are now closed and abandoned .
Before recent water control measures were implemented , the Salton Sea 's surface tended to rise and fall severely , causing flooding in some of the surrounding communities .
The area still draws over 150,000 vacationers a year , primarily to the local campsites , trailer parks , and the Salton Sea State Recreation Area " .

Letters and e-mail messages from 48 foreigners inquiring about transplants were discovered in Dr. Kumar ’s office , Mr. Lal said .
Five foreigners  three from Greece and two Indian - born American citizens  were found in one of the clinics during the raids .
The police suspected that they were about to receive kidney transplants , Mr. Lal said , but they were allowed to return home because the evidence was insufficient to detain them .
Mr. Mohammed , 25 , said Monday that he had no idea that it was possible to sell a kidney .
He had been picking up odd jobs in Delhi for the past two years and sending money to his family in Gujarat , he said .

Two weeks ago , he was approached by a bearded man as he waited at the early - morning labor market by the Old Delhi train station , he said .
The man offered him an unusually generous deal : one and a half months ’ work painting , for a little less than $ 4 a day , with free food and lodging .
Mr. Mohammed said he was driven four or five hours , to a secluded bungalow , where he was placed in a room with four other young men , under the watch of two armed guards .
“ When I asked why I had been locked inside , the guards slapped me and said they would shoot me if I asked any more questions , ” Mr. Mohammed said , lying in a hospital bed , wrapped in an orange blanket , clenching his teeth and shutting his eyes in pain .
He said the men were given food to cook and periodically nurses would take blood samples .
One by one , he said , they were taken away for operations .
“ They told us not to speak to each other or we would pay with our lives , ” he said .
“ I was the last one to be taken . ”

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Scientists in China have identified about 400 genes that appear to make some people more easily addicted to drugs , opening the way for more effective therapies and addiction control .
Experts believe genetic factors account for up to 60 percent of a person ’s vulnerability to drug addiction , with environmental factors accounting for the remainder .
The researchers focused on four addictive substances -- cocaine , opiate , alcohol and nicotine -- and mapped out five main routes , or “ molecular pathways ” , that lead to addiction , they wrote in the journal PLoS Computational Biology .
Figuring out pathways are important in the study of complex diseases as they narrow down the genes and proteins involved .
In diseases such as cancer , pathways help doctors make more accurate diagnoses and predictions of the course of the disease .
For drug addiction , the researchers said : “ These common pathways may underlie shared rewarding and response mechanisms and may be targets for effective treatments for a wide range of addictive disorders . ”
The researchers trawled through more than 1,000 peer - reviewed medical publications that linked genes and chromosome regions to drug addiction over the past 30 years and assembled a list of 1,500 addiction - related genes .
Some of these genes turned up more frequently than others in the pathways and scientists narrowed the list to 396 .
President Bush has already warned the Senate not to delay the bill
Senate Republicans narrowly blocked the Democrat - backed plan , which would have provided extra money to retired people and veterans .
The US House of Representatives has approved a White House - backed $ 146bn ( £ 73 bn ) economic stimulus package .
It was not immediately clear what action the Senate would now take .
The Senate plan , worth $ 157bn , was backed by some key Republican senators .
But the Democrats narrowly failed to get the 60 votes they needed to end the debate and move the bill to a final vote with the tally at 58 to 41 .
Delays
The Senate 's version reduced the tax rebates on offer in the original package but extended the group to benefit from these .
It also expanded unemployment benefits , offered heating aid for the poor and gave tax breaks for renewable energy firms and coal companies .
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid criticised Republicans for blocking the bill .
" Given a chance to act as a recession looms , more than 40 Republicans said no to helping 20 million seniors and no to 25,000 disabled veterans . "
But US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson had earlier expressed scepticism about some of the add-ons , urging Senators to keep the stimulus measures focused on simple tax breaks .
" I 'm concerned if we see things that are n't stimulus and are n't going to get money to the American people quickly , we 'll get bogged down , " he said .
Proposed plan
Under the president 's proposed package , some 117 million US homes would receive a rebate of up to $ 600 for individuals and up to $ 1,200 for married couples .
Couples with children will also get an extra $ 300 per child .
The tax rebates for households should total $ 100bn , while businesses will benefit from up to $ 50bn of tax cuts .
It follows the Federal Reserve 's decision to slash US interest rates to 3 % from 4.25 % over the past two weeks , the most aggressive move for many years .
Economists say the stimulus package needs to be put into action as soon as possible , before it is too late to help the economy .
The latest figures show that US economic growth fell sharply in the final three months of 2007 to an annualised rate of just 0.6 % .
Congressional leaders have vowed to send a bill to the White House by 15 February .
I was talking to Tim via AOL IM , and I decided it was probably worthwhile to bring this up for everyone .
One of the things that is so surprising ( for me , at least ) about the whole Graeme Frost episode is that rather than make their case against this program with their vicious assault against this family , they Malkin / Freeper / Limbaugh brigade are doing just the opposite .
Rather than expose this family as a bunch of frauds and lazy slackers and welfare queens , they are making the family ’s case .
If you look through this family ’s dossier , it appears they are doing everything Republicans say they should be doing - hell , their story is almost what you would consider a checklist for good , red - blooded American Republican voters : they own their own business , they pay their taxes , they are still in a committed relationship and are raising their kids , they eschewed public education and are doing what they have to do to get them into Private schools , they are part of the American dream of home ownership that Republicans have been pointing to in the past two administrations as proof of the health of the economy , and so on .
In short , they are a white , lower - middle - class , committed family , who is doing EVERYTHING the GOP Kultur Kops would have you believe people should be doing .
They are n’t gay .
They are n’t divorced .
They did n’t abort their children .
They are n’t drug addicts or welfare queens .
They are property owners , entrepeneurs , taxpayers , and hard - working Americans .
I bet nine times out of ten in past elections , if you handed this resume to a pollster , they would think you were discussing the prototypical Republican voter .
Hell , the only thing missing from this equation is membership to a church and an irrational fear of Muslims and you HAVE the prototypical Bush voter .
They are , however , not without fault .
They are unable to afford insurance through normal means ( and now that they have pre-existing conditions , probably could n’t get traditional insurance anyway ) , and managed to get several of their family members injured in a traumatic accident .
And , it appears , those are the big blind spots for compassionate conservatism .
That , and the real big sin- allowing themselves to advocate for a policy that the Decider was going to veto .
Here it is , so you can see their grievous sin that requires they be destroyed :
“ Hi , my name is Graeme Frost .
I ’m 12 years old and I live in Baltimore , Maryland .
Most kids my age probably have n’t heard of CHIP , the Children ’s Health Insurance Program .
But I know all about it , because if it were n’t for CHIP , I might not be here today .
“ CHIP is a law the government made to help families like mine afford healthcare for their kids .
Three years ago , my family was in a really bad car accident .
My younger sister Gemma and I were both hurt .
I was in a coma for a week and could n’t eat or stand up or even talk at first .
My sister was even worse .
I was in the hospital for five - and - a - half months and I needed a big surgery .
For a long time after that , I had to go to physical therapy after school to get stronger .
But even though I was hurt badly , I was really lucky .
My sister and I both were .
“ My parents work really hard and always make sure my sister and I have everything we need , but the hospital bills were huge .
We got the help we needed because we had health insurance for us through the CHIP program .
“ But there are millions of kids out there who do n’t have CHIP , and they would n’t get the care that my sister and I did if they got hurt .
Their parents might have to sell their cars or their houses , or they might not be able to pay for hospital bills at all .
“ Now I ’m back to school .
One of my vocal chords is paralyzed so I do n’t talk the same way I used to .
And I ca n’t walk or run as fast as I did .
The doctors say I ca n’t play football any more , but I might still be able to be a coach .
I ’m just happy to be back with my friends .
“ I do n’t know why President Bush wants to stop kids who really need help from getting CHIP .
All I know is I have some really good doctors .
They took great care of me when I was sick , and I ’m glad I could see them because of the Children ’s Health Program .
“ I just hope the President will listen to my story and help other kids to be as lucky as me .
This is Graeme Frost , and this has been the Weekly Democratic Radio address .
Thanks for listening . ”
Pretty strong stuff .
I can see why this rabid dog needs to be put down with the full force of the wingnutosphere .
And it just goes downhill from there .
We learn from our intrepid “ reporters ” on the right that $ 45,000 is now rich , which is news to me and everyone else who remember mocking Democrats when they tried to claim $ 100 k combined income was considered rich .
You righties do remember that , do n’t you ?
At any rate , let ’s look at some of the pithy advice offered from the right for how the Frost family should deal with millions of dollars of medical bills :
I think the property was valued at around $ 225,000 .
I dunno , I have no sympathy for them .
Looks like they have more than enough money for luxuries they wo n’t sacrifice , yet they expect everyone else to sacrifice for them .
My family had to sell our house because we could n’t afford to keep it , have one used minivan and a clunker my husband uses to get back and forth to work , and until this past weekend we did n’t have a television because it was a luxury we could n’t justify spending on .
No private schools for my 3 kids - ca n’t even afford daycare .
Yet we manage to afford health insurance , keep our rental home comfy , and have food on the table .
I ’m content with what I have and certainly do n’t want anyone else paying for what I can afford , after cutting out the luxuries .
And :
15 years ago , when my then - wife and I discovered we were going to have a child – I had a job with no health insurance .
I changed jobs – period .
I was stupid and willing to go without insurance for myself – but with my child there was no way I was going to risk it .
These parents have the same opportunity .
They chose not to find jobs that offered health insurance – and they chose to spend their money elsewhere .
Then , when tragedy strikes , they ’re held up as models of “ what ’s wrong with this country ” .
Sorry – but they should be held up as models of “ What ’s wrong with many Americans ” .
My bad - they do n’t have any advice other than “ SUCKS TO BE YOU ” or “ SELL YOUR HOUSE ” or “ GET ANOTHER JOB . ”
Because , as we all know , the hallmark of responsibility is making your children homeless so they can maybe get healthcare .
Nobody even pointed to the numerous charities that we conservatives are supposed to expect to fill the gap so the government does n’t have to pay for things .
Instead , it was taunts , catcalls , contempt , and jealousy ( because these folks are in SUCH an enviable situation ) .
I simply can not believe this is what the Republican party has become .
I just can’t .
It just makes me sick to think all those years of supporting this party , and this is what it has become .
Even if you do n’t like the S - Chip expansion , it is hard to deny what Republicans are - a bunch of bitter , nasty , petty , snarling , sneering , vicious thugs , peering through people ’s windows so they can make fun of their misfortune .
I ’m registering Independent tomorrow .
*** Update ***
They have even pissed off Joe Gandelman , which I did n’t think was possible .
The harshest language I have ever seen him use is “ drat , ” or “ shoot . ”
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A previously unknown virus may be to blame for a rare but deadly form of skin cancer , opening the prospect of new ways to treat and prevent the condition , scientists said on Thursday .
Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) mainly affects older people and those whose immune system has been compromised by AIDS or organ transplant drugs , raising suspicions it could have an infectious cause .
Now researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute believe they have found the culprit , after identifying viral DNA sequences present in 80 percent of Merkel cell tumors .
The foreign DNA belongs to a virus , dubbed Merkel cell polyomavirus ( MCV ) , which integrates into the tumor ’s own genome in a way suggesting it is a trigger for cancerous growth .
If the new virus is proved to be the cause it should give new leads for treating a particularly aggressive cancer .
Experts suspect the virus is deadly because it produces a cancer - causing protein or knocks out a gene that suppresses tumor growth .
“ Information that we gain could possibly lead to a blood test or vaccine that improves disease management and aids in prevention , ” said Dr Patrick Moore , who with colleagues published the findings in the journal Science .
Merkel cell carcinoma develops from specialized nerve cells that respond to touch or pressure .
Its incidence has tripled over the past 20 years and there are now about 1,500 cases a year in the United States .
About 50 percent of patients with advanced disease live nine months or less .
Merkel cell carcinoma is not the first cancer linked to a virus , and will likely not be the last .
The best known cancer - causing virus is HPV , or human papillomavirus , which can lead to cervical cancer and is the target of two new anti-cancer vaccines , Gardasil and Cervarix , from Merck & Co Inc and GlaxoSmithKline Plc .
Kaposi ’s sarcoma , the most common malignancy in AIDS patients and the most common cancer in Africa , is also caused by a virus .
Signaling a rapid about - face after last month ’s parliamentary elections , Prime Minister Donald Tusk pledged Friday to end Poland ’s military deployment in Iraq in 2008 and said his nation would engage in more “ dialogue ” with its neighbors before accepting a U.S. missile defense system on Polish soil .
The three - hour speech before Parliament marked a significant departure from the politics of the last two years , when President Lech Kaczynski and his twin , former Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski , set Poland on a nationalist course .
The government largely supported U.S. military objectives but antagonized neighboring nations in the European Union and was at times openly hostile to Russia .
Lech Kaczynski remains president , but his brother , who lost the premiership when his party was tossed from power in the Oct. 21 elections , was reduced Friday to grumbling from the opposition benches .
He accused Tusk ’s new coalition government of taking Poland “ back to the ‘ 90s ” on a course of rapid privatization , lower taxes and what he described as inappropriate government skulduggery and political warfare .
Tusk , the 50 - year - old leader of the pro-market Civic Platform party , pledged to proceed with economic overhaul and said he would uphold the party ’s campaign promise to end Poland ’s military role in Iraq .

“ In a year ’s time , I will tell you here in this chamber that our military mission in Iraq is over , ” Tusk said , as the lower house erupted in applause .
“ We have taken the decision , as far as the government powers go , to make 2008 the year when the pullout of Poland ’s military mission is started and completed , ” Tusk said .
“ We will carry out that operation with the conviction that we have done more than what our allies , especially the U.S. , had expected from us . ”
He said Poland would leave its 1,200 troops in Afghanistan next year while phasing out its 900 - troop deployment in south - central Iraq .
But he was relatively noncommittal on whether Poland would allow the United States to position 10 interceptor missiles in the country .
Russia has warned that the program would start an arms race in the region .
Advertisement
In a shift from the previous government , Tusk ’s ministers have made it clear that they will consult Russia and other nations before making any decision on the missile defense system .
He hinted that Poland might expect additional incentives from the United States , which some of his political allies have interpreted to mean additional military aid .
Of Moscow , he said , “ We want dialogue with Russia .
The absence of dialogue helps neither side . ”
Washington says the missile defense system is aimed at countering not Russia but potential aggression from nations such as Iran .
But Russia is opposed to new American military infrastructure on Europe ’s boundaries , particularly in a country that was once a Soviet ally .

In his policy address , Tusk focused on domestic issues , but also made it clear that Poland intends to engage rather than bicker with neighbors such as Germany and France over issues that include the Iraq war , European Union voting rights , reparations to Germans who lost property in Poland during World War II and an energy pipeline across the Baltic Sea planned jointly by Germany and Russia .
Tusk repeatedly called for a new era of trust between government and citizens , which he said was a crucial underpinning of economic development and the creation of a modern civil society .
“ For example , he said , if you trust each other , you can decentralize , and decentralization means more power to local government , ” said Lena Kolarska - Bobinska , who heads the Warsaw - based Institute of Public Affairs .
“ It means decentralization of the European regional policy , it means a bigger role of self - governance in education , in health .
He showed how this can develop positive energy in many different spheres .
“ All this positive energy is completely opposite from the philosophy of the Kaczynskis in the last two years , ” Kolarska - Bobinska said .

In the first of several hours of opposition speeches that preceded a divided vote of confidence in the new government , Jaroslaw Kaczynski said it was the “ aggressive attacks ” of the election victors that instigated Poland ’s recent months of political warfare .
Yet he left the door open to conciliation .
“ The message of what he [ the new prime minister ] says is obviously right , ” he said .
“ We accept it : Let us finish the political war . ”

AN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE - FRONTLINE
Special Presentation ( two 90 - minute episodes , April 2007 )
The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter - day Saints is one of America 's fastest growing religions , and its influence circles the globe .
The church has 11 million members today and over half of them live outside the U.S.
Yet the birth of Mormonism and its history is one of America 's great neglected narratives .
This three - hour documentary brings together FRONTLINE and AMERICAN EXPERIENCE in their first co-production to provide a searching portrait of this fascinating but often misunderstood religion .
Produced by award - winning filmmaker Helen Whitney ( " Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero , " " John Paul II : The Millennial Pope " ) , the film will explore the richness , the complexities , and the controversies of the Mormons ' story as told through interviews with leaders and members of the church , with leading writers and historians , and with supporters and critics of the Mormon faith .

Katie Holmes ' Mad Money ' Movie Trailer
is set to hit the big screen in her first film since giving birth to daughter .
Maybe this will help to shift attention away from husbandwho is having a bad week because of 's new unauthorized biography .
In Mad Money , the 29 year old actress shares the big screen are Woody Allen , Diane Keaton and Queen Latifah .
The plot has the three female employees of the Federal Reserve planning to steal money that is about to be destroyed .
The film premieres on January 18 , 2008 .
We 've got the Mad Money movie trailer below .
THOSE who fall foul of the law because of their internet - surfing habits are often assumed to be sheepish - looking middle - aged men .
On December 6th a different sort of criminal was in the dock for downloading illicit material .
Samina Malik , a slight 23 - year - old in a headscarf , last month became the first Muslim woman to be convicted of a terrorism offence in Britain when she was found guilty of collecting a library of jihadist manuals from the internet .
This week Miss Malik , who worked at an airport bookstore and called herself the “ lyrical terrorist ” in online forums , was given a suspended nine - month prison sentence and community service .
She is not the first person to be punished for flirting with terrorism on the web .
In July three British men were jailed for terms from seven to ten years for using the internet to incite others to wage holy war .
In the same month four Bradford students and an Essex schoolboy were collectively sentenced to just over 13 years for having a treasure - trove of jihadist texts and videos , which a court determined they planned to use for terrorist purposes .
The “ lyrical terrorist ” has attracted attention mainly because of her bloodthirsty poetry .
“ Kafirs your time will come soon / And no - one will save you from your doom ! ” went one effort .
Another was called “ How to Behead ” .
But Miss Malik was convicted not for these offerings ( which she says were inspired by popular American rap music ) but for downloading documents from the web .
Police discovered “ The Al Qaeda Manual ” and “ The Mujahideen Poisons Handbook ” , among other titles .
Miss Malik 's trial judge admitted that he had found her “ a complete enigma ” .
It is hard to know what to do with people who are clearly drawn to terrorism but are not actually plotting .
Wallowing in jihadist nonsense online harms no one in itself , but it may well have devastating consequences if it leads to action .
Miss Malik was cleared of breaching section 57 of the Terrorism Act , which bans possessing any article “ for terrorist purposes ” .
She was found guilty instead under section 58 , which outlaws possessing documents “ likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism ” — even if there is no proof that the defendant is planning such an act himself .
In October a 17 - year - old was convicted under the same clause when he was caught with bomb - making instructions under his bed .
On December 6th the government proposed plans to increase the maximum time suspected terrorists may be held before being charged , from 28 days to 42 , in special circumstances .
The point at which terrorist sympathies pose a specific enough threat to merit imprisonment may be as hard to ascertain as the proper limit of that controversial power .
In November 2006 , 92 - year - old Kathryn Johnston was killed by police during a raid conducted at the wrong house .
Ms. Johnston fired at the police officers as they were breaking in through her living room window .
Three officers were injured , but Ms. Johnston was struck 39 times and died at the scene .
In July 2007 , Mike Lefort , 61 , and his mother , Thelma , 83 , were surprised and thrown to the ground when Thibodeau , Louisiana police burst into the wrong house with a " no knock " warrant .
Thelma suffered from a spike in her blood pressure and had a difficult time overcoming the shock .
In March 2007 , masked police officers in Jacksonville , Florida , mistakenly burst into the home of Willie Davis , grandfather of murdered DreShawna Davis , and his mentally disabed son .
The pair were forced to the ground , where they watched helplessly as police tore apart the memorabilia from DreShawn 's funeral .
The drug sale that never happened was said to involve all of two crack rocks worth $ 60 .
Location :
One would think after Atlanta police killed 92 - year - old Kathryn Johnston , that they would get the idea , but they have n't .
Last Friday , 1/4/08 , a SWAT team , serving an ordinary drug search warrant , invaded the Ohio home of Tarika Wilson -- an innocent woman -- shot and killed her , and shot her one - year - old son .
" They went in that home shooting , " her mother said at a vigil that night .
The boy lost at least one of his fingers .
Two dogs were shot too .
SWAT teams were created to deal with extreme situations , not routine ones .
Yet police now conduct tens of thousands of SWAT raids every year , mostly in low - level drug enforcement .
The result is that people like Wilson and Johnston continue to die in terror , with many thousands more having to go on living with trauma .
But it 's all for a drug war that has failed and can't be made to work .
It 's time to rein in the SWAT teams .
Please sign our online petition : " > Enough is Enough : Petition to Limit Paramilitary Police Raids in America . "
A copy will be sent in your name to your US Representative and Senators , your state legislators , your governor , and the president .
When you 're done , please tell your friends and please spread the word wherever you can .
This is a first step .
Take it with us today , and there can be more .

It can be hard to keep track of all the various financial tasks you need to do during a given year .
Today I thought I would share a list so you can map it out on whatever calendar application you like to use .
Here are some of the key financial tasks that should be done at least once per year .
Beginning of the Year Activities
1. Set Financial Goals and Personal Financial Plan
Set up your Personal Financial Plan with SMART goals is one of the most important things you can do to improve your finances .
There are three basic steps you should follow when setting financial goals :
Make a List of Your Financial Goals Prioritize Your Goals Calculate How Much You Will Need Accomplish Each Goal Figure Out How You Will Fund Your Goals ( Action Items ) Track Your Progress
Make a note to review and update your plan every quarter
2. Set Up Your Budget
Re-evaluate your budget and make adjustments .
You should look at the full - year budget at the beginning of the year to take into account irregular expenses so that you can plan ahead .
After the initial budget is set up , review it regularly , e.g. , weekly or monthly .
Think about things you can do to improve your cash flow and make budgeting easier .
Here are some ways to increase your income and reduce your expenses :
3. Increase Your Contribution to Retirement Plans and Savings
The government generally increases the contribution limits on 401( k ) and IRAs each year .
If you were able to max out your contributions the previous year , or even if you did n’t , it is a good idea to increase your contribution each year .
For 2019 :
IRA Contribution Limit is $ 6,000 , or $ 7,000 if you ’re age 50 or older ( per person )
is $ 6,000 , or $ 7,000 if you ’re age 50 or older ( per person ) 401(k ) Contribution Limit is $ 19,000 , plus $ 6,000 catch - up contribution if you ’re age 50 or older ( per person )
is $ 19,000 , plus $ 6,000 catch - up contribution if you ’re age 50 or older ( per person ) 529 Plan or Education Savings Account – if you have a child , there are some great tools to help you save for education expenses .
If you do n’t have automatic contribution sets up , you will have to do this throughout the year .
During the Year Activities
1. Rebalance Your Portfolio
Setting your investments on an automatic contribution schedule is fantastic .
Ignoring your portfolio too long is dumb .
At least once a year , you should be taking a look at your portfolio and rebalancing your asset allocation .
That sounds like a complicated concept , but all it means is to make sure you have the right percentage of money in each asset class according to your financial plan .
For example , if you want 70 % of your money in stocks and 30 % in bonds , checking your allocation will show how far off you are .
If you find yourself at 75 % stocks and 25 % bonds , you would then rebalance your portfolio by selling the extra 5 % of stocks and reinvesting that money into bonds — restoring the 70 - 30 asset allocation
Why is rebalancing so important ?
It ’s really simple : it forces you to sell high and buy low .
It is easy to “ let things ride ” when stocks have had a great run , but regularly selling the areas of your portfolio that have grown and buying the areas that have shrunk will enhance your investment returns in the long term .
Tip :
You can also rebalance your portfolio whenever there is a substantial increase or decrease in the stock market .
2. Harvest Tax Losses
Harvesting your tax losses is where you sell investments that are worth less than what you paid .
You can use the resulting difference to either offset capital gains from profitable investments that you sold , and use up to $ 3,000 of the loss to offset your income tax owed to the government ( you can roll any extra loss above $ 3,000 to the following years until it is used up ) .
Another benefit to harvesting tax losses : you do n’t have to leave your investment forever .
Let ’s say you invested $ 10,000 in an S&P 500 index fund right at the market ’s peak .
You could sell the fund when the market drop , take that loss against your income that tax year , and repurchase the shares 31 days later .
Just be careful about the wash sale rule — there are very specific rules the IRS has in place to where you ca n’t repurchase the same or very similar share for a month after you sell .
Tip :
You can also harvest tax losses whenever there is a significant decrease in one of your investments .
3. Shop Your Insurance Rates
Just because you got lower rates this year does n’t mean that rate will be the lowest next year .
Premiums tend to go up each year without any reason .
Spending a few hours dedicated to shopping for better insurance rates can result in a significant saving of money over the coming years .
You can usually group them into two parts :
Life , health , dental , and vision – These are often part of your employer ’s benefits package , and you can choose your coverage during the Open Enrollment Period .
If not , or if you need additional coverage , be sure to put these on your calendar .

Home and auto –
Here is an article I wrote on how you can significantly save money on your home and auto insurance .
While you ’re on the phone , you can also ask the insurance agent about your umbrella policy .

Umbrella –
You should also consider getting an umbrella insurance policy if your net worth exceeds the liabilities coverage amount on your car and home insurance .
As you shop for better insurance rates , be sure to make adjustments to accommodate any changes in your situation .
4. Shop Around for Better Checking and Savings Accounts
When was the last time you take a look at your banking accounts ?
Is your money still sitting in accounts that are earning you virtually nothing ?
Did you know that there are savings and checking accounts that pay over 2 % interest for your money ?
Take a look at these :
5. Shop Around for Better Credit Cards
The same goes for credit cards .
If you pay off your cards every month , you should absolutely use them to get the rewards .
I personally like cashback reward cards and here are some of the best cashback credit cards with a 5 % reward .
6. Review Your Home Services
Your home uses many services , such as television , internet , telephone , cell phone , home security , etc. Negotiate for a lower rate or change to a different provider .
If you own a business , do the same for your business as well .
Cancel unused or underutilized subscriptions , memberships , and services
7. Check Your Credit Score
There are plenty of free credit score websites where you can check your scores regularly .
Do this at least once quarterly .
See How to Get Free Credit Score ( No Credit Card Needed ) .
8. Check Your Credit Report
The free credit score website Credit Karma also lets you see your TransUnion report .
But to see all 3 , you have to use AnnualCreditReport.com , which let you get one free report from the three bureaus once a year .
Spread this out once every four months so you can check your reports regularly .
See How to Get Free Credit Reports .
9. Adjust Your Tax Withholding
Right after you file your taxes , you should adjust your tax withholding .
If you owe money to the IRS and State , withhold more money .
If you got a big refund check , that is an interest - free loan to the government .
You are better off lowering your withholding and get a little more money in each paycheck .
Your goal should be getting as close to $ 0 as possible as far as a tax refund / tax owe goes .
10 . Review Your Net Worth
About once a quarter , you should review your net worth to see if you are moving in the right direction .
Using a free money management tool like Personal Capital makes it super easy to see your net worth at any given moment .
See How to Calculate Your Net Worth .
End of the Year Activities
Some of these activities could be done any time during the year , but doing it at the end of the year allows you to make sure you maximize all the opportunities .
1. Set Holiday Shopping Budget
Sometime around October to November , you should start planning for your holiday spending .
This is also a great time to review and update your budget for the rest of the year .
2. Pay Property Taxes for Next Year
If you need a little extra tax deduction , you can pay your next year ’s property taxes early .
Tax payments can be claimed in the year it is paid .
3. Pay January Mortgage in December
Similar to the pay your property taxes early trick , this allows you to deduct mortgage interest paid against next January in the current tax year .
4. Donate to Charities
Charitable donations are tax - deductible as long as you can produce proof when requested .
Non-cash donations are also tax - deductible , but it ’s a little more involved ; especially if you donated more than $ 500 worth .
Besides cash , here are some of the things you can donate :
Appreciated Assets –
For example , you can donate stocks , bonds , etc. .
This is a better than cash option because you could deduct the full value of the stocks without paying the capital gains tax .

Old Car – Typically , the organization would take it away for free , coordinate the title transfer , and provide a tax - deductible donation receipt .
The IRS allows you to deduct the fair market value of your vehicle .

Items –
You can donate some items at the fair market value .
For example , used clothes , furniture , electronics , appliances , etc. are tax - deductible .
See How to Maximize Your Charitable Contributions .
5. Use Up Flexible Spending Account ( FSA )
If you have a Flexible Spending Account ( FSA ) for dependent care , healthcare , or transportation expenses , the funds may be expiring at the end of the year .
If they ’re not expiring on December 31 , they will almost certainly expire by March or April .
Start planning on how you ’ll be using up the money because if you miss the deadline , the remaining balance is lost .
If you can not use up your FSA , use it as a lesson for next year , and estimate expenses accurately before locking your money away !
6. Plan Your Doctor and Dentist Visits
Each year , you go through the pain of paying the deductible .
If you already fulfill your deductible requirement this year , you should take advantage of your insurance coverage and visit your doctors for last - minute check - up and treatments .
Try to schedule the appointments before December 31st .
They ’ll cost you less now than they will at the beginning of next year when your deductibles reset .
Moreover , your medical expenses exceeding 7.5 % of your adjusted gross income ( AGI ) , the excess amount is tax - deductible .
7. Buy Business Equipment and Supplies
If you own a business , you can make your purchases before December 31st and claim these expenses against your business income .
For bloggers and other small business owners , take a look at “ 46 Tax Deductions that Bloggers Often Overlook ” at ProBlogger for additional ideas .
8. Pay Your Vendors Early
Likewise , pay for any services rendered by your vendors before the end of the year to claim these expenses against your business income this tax year .
9. Max Out Your Retirement Plans and Savings
Do the final check - up on your retirement plans and savings to make sure you ’re on track to max out ( if you can ) your contributions before the deadline .
401 ( k ) contribution deadline is the last business day of the year ; for other accounts , you have some time in the following year to make your contributions .
10 . Take Your Required Minimum Distribution
If you ’re 70.5 years or older , and you have n’t withdrawn from your retirement account (s ) this year , you have to take a minimum distribution from your accounts .
Be sure to follow the required minimum distribution rule and withdraw money from your IRA and 401( k ) .
11 . Review Your Will and Estate Plan
Has there been any significant life event during the year ?
If the answer is yes , review your will and estate plan to make sure it still meets your current needs .
12 . Review Your Beneficiaries
Listed beneficiaries for your retirement accounts and insurance plans take precedence over your will .
So review them carefully so that these funds are distributed as intended .
Your To - Do List
Set up a financial calendar —
Remembering to do financial tasks that only occur every 6 to 12 months is difficult .
Make sure you set up a calendar plan to remind yourself of these tasks .
Set up an alert so that you ’ll remember what needs to be done .
Follow through and take care of the task .
Let me know what you think : have I missed any major annual financial events ?
The Hill Country is renowned for lovely vistas , country living , and meandering tourists .
There 's also a darker side to the Hills .
It is hard to stay calm after seeing the baby ’s autopsy photograph .
Entered into evidence in a Hill Country courtroom earlier this year , it shows the infant Ramiro Pérez looking like a victim of African famine or the atrocities at Buchenwald .
His tiny ribs are starkly outlined through his skin – every one of them .
His belly sinks into his spinal column .
His buttocks are no thicker than his thighs , and the skin hangs on them like the wrinkled sleeves of an old sweatshirt .
On his face , the cheeks cave like a very old man’s .
His shrunken corpse weighed barely five and one - half pounds .
That is eight ounces less than at birth , seventy - five days before he was put on the coroner ’s scales hours after his death in early 1998 .
The person deemed most responsible for this horror is Ramiro Perez ’ mother , Tina Rodríguez .
She is a lifelong Hill Country resident , and this spring , the media from Kerrville to San Antonio buzzed about her trial for the capital murder of two - and - a - half - month - old Ramiro .
“ Starvation , ” boomed the headlines , for that was what the state of Texas was saying : that Rodríguez had deliberately deprived her infant son of food in order to kill him .
The plan was carried out , prosecutors noted , in a rickety tin shack with no running water .
Pictures of the miserable dwelling popped up repeatedly in the papers and on nightly TV news .
In February of this year , Rodríguez had a trial in Boerne .
The verdict was guilty , and she was sentenced to automatic life imprisonment .
It was one of the harshest punishments ever meted out in a child starvation case .
Rodríguez wo n’t be eligible for parole for forty years .
Her husband , Noel Perez , was also originally charged with capital murder .
But he was offered a plea to the less serious charge of child endangerment , which carries a maximum twenty - five years imprisonment and possible parole in half that time .
He took the deal in May .
It got little publicity ; the Hill Country by then had moved on to other things .
The case , it seemed , was closed .
But disturbing questions remain .
People who knew and worked with Rodríguez before she was arrested believe she was a troubled woman , but they do n’t think she deliberately murdered her infant .
People who got acquainted with her at the trial – including members of the jury who convicted her – question why her lawyers did n’t effectively suggest other possibilities for little Ramiro ’s death besides the prosecutor ’s monstrous scenario of maternal sadism .
Nutrition experts speculate that the culprit was health problems : in Ramiro , Rodríguez , or both .
A sociologist notes that women accused of killing their children are being judged and punished far more harshly now than they used to be .
She worries that the new vengeance , with its images of mothers as wicked threats to their children , is the flip side to the equally pernicious myth of mothers as perfect nurturers .
And the Rodríguez case was but one in a worrisome statewide trend : a 71 percent increase in child abuse homicides in Texas in 1998 .
There were 176 such cases during fiscal 1998 , compared with about 100 per year through most of the nineties .
The early 1999 numbers are also high , and officials are at a loss to explain the increase .
The details of Ramiro Perez ’ death , and of his mother ’s life up to that death , are complex , unruly , and mostly unknown to the public or to Rodríguez ’ jury .
The story takes place within the economic and social backwaters of places like Kerrville and Bandera , where the cheery antique stores and dude ranches hide an astonishing amount of poverty and trouble – perhaps especially for young mothers .
Tina Rodríguez ’ life exemplifies a darker side of the Hill Country , one that never appears in tourist ads or travel magazines .
Entering this bleak territory , we may be able to see more deeply , even past the terrible last picture of her child .
“ We called her Gordy , ” Tina ’s mother , Lionor Rodríguez , testified on the second day of her daughter ’s trial , and she went on to explain that the nickname stuck because Tina is “ big , like me , a little on the chubby side . ”
Although mother and daughter both are barely five feet tall , each weighs at least 165 pounds .
In Tina the bulk shows up in her round face , thick neck , and in her belly , which strains her dresses and pants even when she ’s not pregnant .
But “ Gordy ” did n’t always fit her .
At birth in 1973 , Tina and her twin sister , Cristina , were two months premature and weighed little more than two pounds apiece .
Back then , doctors were just managing to save such small , undeveloped babies .
With her twinhood , prematurity , and tiny size , Tina ’s infancy was remarkable .
It was probably the last thing in childhood to make her feel special .
After their discharge from the hospital , Tina and Cristina joined five other siblings in a home where it was hard for any of the seven kids to get much parental attention .
One problem was poverty .
Lionor ’s husband , Mike Rodríguez , has always supported the family as a construction worker .
The work is hard and low - paying .
But Rodríguez ’ education and earnings were constrained by the prejudice and segregation that reigned during his youth in the Kerrville area in the fifties .
Lionor also grew up in the Hill Country , on a ranch where her parents worked as day laborers .
For young Mexican Americans like them , the civil rights era still lay in the future .
They were still relegated to segregated neighborhoods .
In school they were punished for speaking Spanish , and their Anglo teachers told them not to bother with academic subjects or college .
Amid the ensuing cultural isolation , traditional customs continued , including the old - country , Catholic practice of marrying early and having many babies .
Lionor was fifteen when she had her first child .
Six more followed over the next fifteen years .
The family lived in a run-down , ghettoized part of Kerrville known variously as The Barrio and Nigger Town .
They are still there today , in an old clapboard house with peeling paint , moldy floorboards , and cracks snaking down the walls .
The Rodríguezes ’ insularity , large family size , and poverty were and still are common among Hill Country Hispanics .
In addition , Tina ’s family had its own problems when she was young .
Due to marital difficulties – Lionor was jealous of Mike and convinced he was running around on her – the couple split up for nine years , beginning when Tina was only a few months old .
As Tina ’s kindergarten teacher , Jean Tally , remembers , Lionor had a rough time managing the household alone .
Tina was a willful , mischievous child , recalls Tally .
She and sister Cristina often came to school infested with lice .
Lionor did n’t seem neglectful , says Tally – just “ overwhelmed . ”
( When told of Tally ’s recollections recently , Lionor said she did n’t remember anything about lice . )
Despite the problems she perceived , Tally thought Tina “ had what it takes ” to make something of herself .
She ran into her former pupil a couple of years ago in Kerrville .
“ She looked like she was doing so well ; she said everything was great .
I was so pleased . ”
But Tally was mistaken .
Long before her meeting with Tina , things had started to go wrong .
It ’s not that she was a bad student .
By the early nineties , Tina was at Kerrville ’s Tivy High School , where she earned Cs , Bs , and an occasional A .
Outwardly , she was a cheerful girl with full cheeks , a quick smile , and friends .
She was also a devoted aunt to her big brother and sisters ’ babies , who were being born one after another in quick succession , just as their parents ’ had been .
Tina changed her nieces and nephews ’ diapers , prepared bottles , and babysat .
But she also told her mother she did n’t want her own children until she finished school and got married .
She talked of attending college , and as an upperclassman , applied to the Navy , thinking the government could help fund her higher education .
Yet Tina was also involved in a world her family was only dimly aware of .
By high school , she was leaving home for daysat a time , with no word where she was going .
Her mother figured she was at friends ’ houses , and the assumption had a precedent .
Earlier , Tina had begun hanging out at the Lopez Club , a tavern and dance hall just outside of Kerrville on the road to Bandera .
Since the late eighties , the area has seen an influx of newcomers , mostly young men , from Mexico .
They ’ve come to work in ranching and in the construction industry , which has burgeoned during the last two decades as the Hill Country has attracted retirees and affluent refugees from cities such as San Antonio .
Many of the immigrants who build infrastructure for these people are undocumented .
But Lopez ’ is known as a place that the Border Patrol leaves alone .
The father of one of Tina ’s girlfriends owned the club , and Tina started spending a lot of time with that family and away from hers .
Saturday nights , she would go to the club and party .
That is where she met Noel Perez , a Mexican who spoke little English and had no papers .
With his football - player shoulders , longish black hair , high cheekbones , and cowboy shirts , Noel was as hard - looking as Tina is soft .
The two started dancing together regularly .
He was nineteen .
She was twelve .
By the time she was fifteen , Noel and Tina were “ dating , ” she says , but they were n’t having sex .
Then , sometime in her junior year , according to her mother , Tina got pregnant by someone else who apparently abandoned her soon afterward .
“ She would n’t tell us who the father was , ” Lionor Rodríguez remembers .
Today Tina still wo n’t talk about him ; she will say only that she had a Hispanic boyfriend who was native - born and cruel to her .
Lionor remembers the miscarriage in Tina ’s third or fourth month of pregnancy .
The dead babies were twins .
Tina was devastated .
She still mourns eight years later , Lionor says , and sometimes muses about what the babies would be doing now had they lived .
These are very private thoughts , though .
To reporters , Tina will say only that a boy treated her very badly , and she vowed never again to get involved with someone raised in the United States .
Noel Perez was there for the rebound .
“ He was nicer to me than the one from here , ” Tina says .
“ He used to tell me endearments , to invite me to Mexico and tell me he would show me his land .
He made me happy . ”
But Tina says her mother rejected Noel because he was Mexican .
Lionor denies this : “ Whether they ’re from there or here does n’t matter , ” she insists .
Tina , however , says her mother thinks Mexican men are invariably violent : “ Once we were at my mom ’s house and there was a Mexican movie showing .
A woman was with some some guy and her husband came home and killed the woman and the man .
And Mom said , ‘ See ?
That ’s why I do n’t like Mexican men . ' ”
Accurate or not , Tina ’s perception of her mother ’s xenophobia echoes observations from other Kerrville - area Hispanics about relations between local Mexican Americans and Mexican nationals .
Martha Toles , a Mexican American who works at the Kerr County Mental Health Center , notes that foreign - born men often are looked down on by the area ’s Mexican Americans .
Yet native - born Hispanic young men are moving out of the Hill Country .
Thus , young women who want to “ stay in the culture ” increasingly are gravitating to Mexican - born partners , Toles says .
That can provoke conflict between girls and their friends and families .
In Tina ’s case , the conflict seems less about foreigners versus natives than mother versus daughter .
By the time she hooked up with Noel , Tina was already doing “ rebellious ” things to worry Lionor , says her sister , Connie .
Hanging out with Noel was just one more disturbing act .
But as Lionor explains it , her antipathy towards Noel was justified : she thought her daughter ’s partner was abusing her .
Lionor says she noticed something wrong shortly after Tina graduated from high school in May , 1993 .
She could have joined the Navy then ; she ’d been accepted , but she passed on the offer and instead married Noel in September , without telling anyone in her family about the wedding .
Lionor knew only that Tina was pregnant , and that she and Noel were living in a trailer in Center Point .
She was shocked when she visited and discovered the dwelling had no electricity or water .
“ Tina ’s hair was filthy ! ” Lionor recalls .
“ I had to wash it for her . ”
Connie remembers
Tina telling her during this time about what happened when she broached the idea of a separation with Noel .
“ She said he threatened her with a gun .
He said if she left he would kill her , the child she was expecting , and whoever she was living with . ” ( Noel Perez ’ lawyer would not allow interviews with his client . )
At the end of May , 1994 , eight months after her secret wedding , Tina gave birth to her first child , a son she and Noel named Paublo .
Daughter Kassandra followed twelve months later .
Barely eighteen months afterwards , Noel , Jr. was born .
It was now January , 1997 , and Tina had three children in diapers – three children born in two and a half years .
Ask her today why she had so many kids so quickly , and she seems not to relate to the question .
“ I ’ve always wanted children , ” she said recently .
“ Noel and I planned to have six before we stopped . ”
But her family remembers that after Kassandra ’s birth , Tina seemed overwhelmed .
During her next pregnancy , with Noel , Jr. , she denied for six months that she was expecting , even though people started noticing and asking her about it .
By then , “ she was quiet most of the time , ” Connie Rodríguez remembers .
“ She looked sad and sleepy .
She seemed depressed .
She had too many kids and too much work . ”
The work was not just motherhood .
A few months after the birth of her oldest , Paublo , in 1994 , Tina had taken a fulltime job at Kerrville ’s Hilltop nursing home .
Her supervisor , Tom Ventro , says she was a “ terrific , hard worker ” who made lots of friends .
At first , she poured and served juice for the home ’s elderly residents .
Her pay was minimum wage – at the time $ 4.75 an hour .
Full time , that works out to less than $ 10,000 a year .
Ventro later promoted Tina to a more responsible position , preparing desserts and serving meals .
Yet she was still making only $ 6.50 an hour .
Such poverty wages are common for women in and around Kerrville .
Newcomer retirees , vacationers , and getaway homeowners need fast food outlets like Long John Silver ’s and Little Caesar ’s , where Tina ’s sisters , Connie and Mary Anne , work to support Connie ’s five children and Mary Anne ’s three .
They need WalMarts , where another sister , Eva – who has eight children – is employed .
They need old age homes , and someone to empty the bedpans .
Or feed the patients , as Tina did .
Huge numbers of Hill Country women work hard at these low - paying jobs while their children are with babysitters or in day care .
They do this in a region that – as Tina ’s former teacher Jean Tally puts it – “ has always been rich and poor and nothing in between . ”
Yet in the Hill Country ’s carefully groomed tourist image , only the affluent have a public face .
“ Poverty seems invisible , ” notes Sister Marge Novak .
Novak , a Franciscan nun and nurse practitioner , teamed up with a doctor two years ago to open a free clinic in Kerrville for under - and uninsured women .
When the two went out to drum up support from local socialites , Sister Marge remembers being told there was “ absolutely no need for a clinic because there are no poor people around here . ”
They opened the facility anyway .
They are still shocked at their numbers : in less than twenty - four months , they ’ve served 5,000 woman patients – about evenly distributed between Anglos and Hispanics .
So , in addition to having too many children and too much work , Tina had too little money .
But the problem was n’t just her low - paid job , or the need to pay for a baby sitter for the three kids while she worked .
After all , she had a husband who did construction work – which , in the Hill Country , can pay upwards of ten dollars an hour .
That adds up to $ 20,000 a year .
Put that with Tina ’s $ 10,000 to $ 13,000 , and the family might have been scrabbling .
But it should n’t have been destitute .
Yet Tina was keeping another secret : in addition to her and the three children in Kerrville , Noel had a wife and children in Mexico , and he was sending them his and Tina ’s money .
Tina says she knew about the bigamy and the Mexican family when she married Noel .
For years , he had been making visits to his hometown , and in the early nineties he already had four small children there by the same woman .
She later announced that she was expecting a fifth child by Noel .
One would think this would be a last straw for Tina .
Yet today , she seems strangely impassive about the whole affair .
“ He was honest with me , ” she says .
“ He never beat around the bush .
It might have made us short of cash .
But I accepted the other family and loved those children like they were my own . ”
Tina ’s parents and siblings knew nothing about this second family .
Norma Medina did .
A middle - aged Honduran immigrant who works in housekeeping at Hilltop , she was good friends with Tina there .
“ Once she told me her husband was married , ” Medina recalls .
“ Once she said they were sending money to the kids . ” Medina could n’t understand why Tina would go along with this .
She was working full time , and sometimes double shifts so she could earn time - and - a - half wages .
Yet on pay days , she would ask Medina for small loans – five , ten , or fifteen dollars – to buy milk for her babies .
Medina started wondering if her friend was a victim of spousal battering .
“ Tina had Noel on a pedestal ; she said he was a good man . ”
But she also told Medina he was very jealous .
When he picked her up from work , he never talked to her coworkers , and he acted as though Tina should n’t , either .
“ I think he did n’t want her to have friends , ” Medina says .
And there was evidence of violence .
“ Once , she told me she hit him with a frying pan after he started hitting her .
I think she was scared of him . ”
Tina ’s family was also noticing mistreatment .
Connie Rodríguez regularly heard Noel ordering Tina around in a raised voice .
Lionor remembers a hot summer day when Tina showed up for a visit in long sleeves .
She had no explanation for the clothing , but when Lionor tried to touch her , Tina pulled back her arm and said it was “ sore . ”
Around the same time , Connie saw Noel hit his children .
Connie urged Tina to break off with Noel , and suggested that she hide with relatives in Austin , or in the Mexican border city Juárez , where the Rodríguezes have family .
“ I do n’t know , ” Tina replied .
“ What if he finds me and goes through with his threats ? ”
She made no move to leave .
Connie became especially angry after Noel approached her one night and asked her to sleep with him .
She told her parents , who told Tina .
She said she did n’t believe them .
During the time Tina ’s friends and family were becoming aware of her troubles , she and Noel and their three children were living in Kerrville , in a rented mobile home in a trailer park .
In the tight Hill Country housing market , such places go for $ 500 a month , often excluding utilities .
They are crowded with nearby neighbors , and in Tina and Noel ’s case , the neighbors apparently were watching them .
In 1997 , someone called Child Protective Services and anonymously reported suspicions that daughter Kassandra , about two at the time , had been sexually abused .
An inquiry ensued , but the accusation was declared unfounded .
Meanwhile , Tina was expecting again .
As with her other pregnancies , she did not see a doctor .
So she did her own math , which set her due date for late December or early January .
Life went on : she went to work , sometimes volunteered for extra shifts , and occasionally brought the children to work after picking them up from the babysitter .
Given her hard circumstances , things seemed as normal as could be expected .
Then things took a turn for the worse .
Late in 1997 , the family moved – to Bandera Pass , a rural slum on the outskirts of Bandera ( see “ Hill Country Colonias , ” page 14 ) .
There , they rented the shack that would later become notorious in the media .
Actually , “ shack ” may be too generous : according to people who live near the ten - by - fourteen - foot tin structure , it was really intended to house goats .
It had one room , one bed , and no running water .
It was surrounded by mud , burnt trash , old toilet paper , and the smell of urine .
Its location , in a colonia rivaling the worst such neighborhoods on the Texas - Mexico border , was a shocking world away from even the poorest homes in Kerrville .
And it was yet another secret – both a public secret in the Hill Country , and one that Tina kept from her friends and family .
“ She told us she and Noel had found land and a trailer they were making payments on .
She told us it was white and had a fence around it , ” remembers Tina ’s mother , Lionor .
“ She was so excited telling me about this new piece of land , ” adds Tom Ventro .
“ She said it had a trailer . ”
Tina says she and Noel ended up in the shack after they heard about a very cheap piece of land and a trailer in Bandera Pass , owned by relatives of a friend of Noel’s .
She says that by the time they arrived , someone else had taken the property .
But she and Noel opted to stay in the area while they waited for another plot and trailer to open up .
While waiting , they rented the shack for $ 200 a month .
As miserable as it was , Tina says she preferred it to being “ smothered ” in Kerrville by her family ’s criticism of her husband .
She did n’t tell her parents her exact address .
Once , they went to see her .
Lionor recalls , “ We looked and looked and never could find the trailer or the white fence .
We were about to go to the police when we saw Tina and Noel ’s station wagon .
My husband went up and knocked and knocked .
Noel would n’t let Tina open the door . ”
Lionor now thinks
Noel tricked Tina into moving to the shack .
Tina now was living in virtual isolation .
Her only respite was her job , and not long after the move , her coworkers noticed she was going downhill .
“ The last few months of her pregnancy , she was coming into work dressed really ragged , ” recalls supervisor Ventro .
“ Like her shoes did n’t match what she was wearing .
She said it was because they were still unpacking . ”
Norma Medina remembers that Tina seemed tired and depressed , and her skin looked yellow , as though she were anemic or sick .
And Connie Rodríguez recalls a disturbing incident when Tina and the children visited her mother ’s house in Kerrville .
“ We had bought a whole box of chicken from Church ’s .
Tina ate a lot , and her oldest kids ” – who were only two and three years old – “ ate two or three pieces each , and lots of rolls , and mashed potatoes .
My kids said , ‘ Mom , look ! ’
It was weird .
We had to go buy more food . ”
That was in October of 1997 .
A few weeks later , just after Thanksgiving , Tina went into labor , even though she had n’t expected to for at least another month .
While giving birth at Kerrville ’s Sid Peterson Hospital , she says she heard a nurse comment that the baby was premature .
He emerged weighing five pounds thirteen ounces – small for a newborn , but not dangerously so .
A doctor who later reviewed the infant ’s medical records said he seemed to have a gestational age of thirty - seven weeks instead of the average forty .
That is early , but still considered normal , and the records say nothing about prematurity .
The records also indicate that at first the infant ’s glucose levels were a bit low .
But a later test was normal , so Ramiro was promptly discharged with his mother .
She took him to the shack , and she and Noel named him Ramiro .
Tina was on maternity leave from work , but about two weeks after the birth , she visited Hilltop to show Ramiro off .
“ She had a baby carrier , filled with diapers and bottles , ” Ventro remembers .
“ She looked really happy – happier than a pig in fresh mud .
But she still looked really ragged .
And she was n’t her usual cheery self .
It took us a little while to get her going . ”
As for Ramiro , he “ just looked tiny ” to Ventro .
Tina ’s explanation was that “ he was premature . ”
A few weeks later , she brought Ramiro to work again .
Norma Medina remembers that the baby looked weak and skinny .
But she did n’t say anything to Tina .
She did n’t want to offend her .
Tina never came to Hilltop again .
Almost daily , though , Noel drove her to her mother ’s house in Kerrville so she and the kids could take baths .
Lionor had twenty - eight grandchildren at the time ; she was caring for seven or eight of them every day while their mothers worked , and was also shopping and running errands .
She was like the Old Woman in the Shoe , overwhelmed , as usual , and she and Tina did n’t get along anyway .
She noticed Tina breastfeeding Ramiro or giving him bottles .
But the newborn was just one more child among many in the house .
Lionor seldom took a good look at him .
Just before New Year ’s , Noel , Jr. , who was by then eleven months old , came down with pneumonia .
Tina took him to the hospital , and records show that besides treating him for his illness , medical workers also instructed his mother to stop feeding him watered down milk .
That was a practice the women in Tina ’s family had handed down for generations : making “ formula ” by mixing canned , evaporated milk with water and a little Karo syrup .
The custom used to be universal and respectable in the United States : recipes appeared in baby - care books at the turn of the century , and were still showing up as late as 1994 in best - selling texts .
Today , the mixture is considered risky , since cow ’s milk has been found to be hard for small babies to digest .
More affluent , educated , literate parents have known this for a generation .
Others have n’t gotten the message .
When they are short of funds for commercial baby formula , they frequently resort to cheaper cow ’s milk and the old recipe .
And when they are really hard up for milk money , poor mothers are tempted to compensate by adding more water than usual .
Tina was definitely hard up .
Often , when she visited her family in Kerrville , sister Connie would give her formula for Ramiro that Connie had bought for her own baby .
Tina also sometimes breastfed Ramiro – an unusual practice among working - class and poor women .
Dedicated breastfeeding demands that a mother be with her baby almost constantly , which is impossible for women who have to work .
Even to breastfeed part time , working women need several long breaks during the day to pump and save their milk .
That perk is not available to most blue - collar and service workers .
Today , breastfeeding in the United States is mostly confined to affluent women .
Tina was exceptional : she says she tried it with all her children .
She wanted to bond with them , and thought “ breast milk is the best thing for babies . ”
Yet there were no models among her friends or family to guide her .
Her mother had bottle fed all her children .
So had her sisters .
Tina got some instruction from the hospital after one of her children was born .
After that , she was on her own .
Apparently , Tina did not understand that for a lactating woman to produce enough milk , breastfeeding should be done regularly , if not exclusively .
Instead , she seems to have randomly fed Ramiro commercial formula , cow ’s milk , and breast milk , with no fixed schedule for these different foods .
It ’s thus impossible to know whether Ramiro was getting enough nutrition , or – when his mother nursed him – if he got any nutrition at all .
It was also impossible for a medical specialist to evaluate Ramiro ’s health .
Tina never took him in for checkups .
Everything crashed on Wednesday , February 11 , 1998 .
That evening , Bandera ’s Emergency Medical Services and Sheriff ’s Department got a call from Bandera Pass .
An infant there was reported in serious distress after his mother discovered he was not breathing .
When the ambulance and sheriffs arrived , they found Ramiro dead .
According to affidavits produced later by emergency medical technicians Cindy Martin and Lynda Cook , Tina was at the scene , crying and distraught .
When she remembered that Ramiro had not been baptized , she got so beside herself that Cook tried to calm her by faking the rite .
Tina ’s grief over her son ’s death seemed wrenching and genuine .
Next day , however , Ramiro ’s body was sent to Austin for an autopsy .
There , Travis County Coroner Roberto Bayardo took the gruesome photograph of the baby ’s wizened corpse .
He cut it open , drained an eyeball , and sent the fluid for testing to measure biochemicals such as glucose , whose levels are used to diagnose many diseases .
Even before the tests came back , Bayardo pronounced Ramiro ’s death due to starvation .
Bandera - area child protective services investigators entered the case .
They noted disturbing details , such as that baby bottles found in the shack the night Ramiro died contained milk that was sour .
By the end of February , Tina and Noel had been arrested .
From that point , the story might have taken the usual turn .
As horrific as it is to find a dead , emaciated infant in its parents ’ care , law enforcement authorities traditionally have blamed such tragedies on ignorance or carelessness .
According to U.T. - El Paso sociologist Martha Smithey , an expert on infant homicide , women such as Tina used to be put on probation or referred to parenting or nutrition classes .
Since the late eighties , however , a national move to protect children has led to dramatically increased punishments for abusive and neglectful mothers .
Even so , punishment for the accused in starvation cases has been relatively lenient .
In Washington , D.C. in 1993 , in the Chicago area in 1997 , and in Kansas City in 1998 , mothers of babies who died after wasting to skin and bones were charged with involuntary or other types of manslaughter .
Such charges usually carry penalties ranging from probation to a handful of years in prison .
Bruce Curry , District Attorney for the Hill Country judicial region that includes Bandera County , yanked out all the stops as he charged Tina and Noel under a draconian statute , Texas Penal Code 19.03 ( a ) ( 8 ) .
Enacted in the early nineties , the code upgraded to a capital crime the first degree murder of a child under the age of six .
When the statute was being debated in the Legislature , proponents painted culprits as homicidal male sex offenders , and divorcing dads who kill their ex-wives and children .
In fact , simply because children ’s caretakers are much more often female than male , most killers of small children are mothers and other women .
The capital charges leveled against Tina implied that she had cold - bloodedly planned her baby ’s death .
Or if she had n’t planned it , she had at least known that what she did to Ramiro would make him die .
Noel Perez was charged under the same statute .
Tina ’s family and coworkers did n’t know what to make of Noel .
But they were shocked that Tina was labeled a murderer .
Her mother and sisters were angry with her for not noticing something wrong with Ramiro and taking him to a doctor .
Yet they did not think she deliberately killed her son .
They wondered whether he had succumbed to some undiagnosed illness .
Or perhaps Tina herself had been sick in a way that interfered with her milk supply .
Or maybe she had been been so worn out by the demands of four very small children in a claustrophobic , rural shack with no running water or telephone – and so demoralized by an abusive husband – that , as Lionor Rodríguez puts it now , “ Something went off and she was n’t there , like she was in outer space . ”
Because he was indigent , Noel was assigned two court - appointed attorneys .
Tina ’s family wanted better for her than charity .
They scraped together their savings and came up with $ 10,000 – a huge sum for them , but laughable compared to the hundreds of thousands of dollars private lawyers typically charge to represent a capital murder defendant .
The Rodríguezes took their money to Bruce Perkins , a Corpus Christi lawyer the family had used once before when one of Tina ’s brothers - in - law was in legal trouble .
Perkins recruited Michael Collins , of San Antonio , as co-counsel .
The family got what it paid for .
By early 1999 , Tina ’s case had been downgraded : the district attorney had decided a jury might balk at the idea of executing her , and besides , Bandera County could n’t afford the money it would take to prosecute a death penalty case .
But the state was still asking for a capital murder conviction , which would carry a heavier penalty than first - degree murder .
Despite the gravity of the charge , the trial , which took place in February , was a bargain - basement fiasco .
Perkins and Collins failed to present any testimony about their client ’s confusion over how to feed babies .
They offered virtually no evidence of possible abuse by her husband .
They made only the most cursory attempt to suggest that Ramiro might have had a disease that caused him to waste away .
( The one illness they hypothesized was quickly discounted by a prosecution witness who pointed out that electrolytes in the baby ’s eyeball fluid contradicted the diagnosis . )
Perhaps worst of all , the lawyers never interviewed Tina ’s co-workers to hear their recollections of her joy over Ramiro ’s birth .
Nor did they talk to the emergency medical technicians , who could have testified about a mother ’s grief the night of her son ’s death .
Absent these witnesses , Tina came across as aHill Country Colonias Questions remain about the reasons f for the death of Ramiro Perez .
But as for where it happened , there ’s no dispute .
In the heart of the Hill Country , the infant took his last breaths in a colonia .
The Spanish word is not just a figure of speech .
Bandera Pass , where the Rodríguez - Perez family lived , is filled with jerryrigged houses without a public water or sewer system .
These are characteristics typical of colonias , which abound on the Texas side of the Rio Grande .
They got their start more than a generation ago , when unscrupulous developers bought farmlands and cut them into micro-plots .
They marketed the lots to poor people desperate to own land and a house – any house , even a beat - up trailer .
Buyers often were told utilities would come later .
They did n’t .
Community groups in El Paso and the Rio Grande Valley have been organizing since the eighties to bring government aid to these areas .
Their efforts have garnered wide publicity .
As a result , people generally associate colonias with scuzzy living near Mexico .
What they do n’t know – or do n’t want to know – is that the same or worse conditions exist in the high - rent country southwest of Austin .
Bandera Pass is invisible to outsiders .
It lies on a side road off Highway 173 , about four miles north of Bandera , twenty miles south of Kerrville , and just a few hundred yards from an exotic animal farm that charms tourists with herds of baby antelope .
Once , Bandera Pass was a ranch .
Today it is dusty , unpaved roads that turn to mud when it rains .
It is oddly - shaped houses built without contractors , mobile homes in various ramshackled states , and corrals that teem with junk .
It is where Tina Rodríguez and her family lived in a goat shed .
According to Don White , an investigator with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission , the basis for these conditions was laid in the fifties .
A Bandera real - estate developer bought the ranch then and asked Bandera County Commissioners Court for permission to divide it into hundreds of miniscule , thirty - by - ninety - foot lots .
The Court was dominated by realtors who quickly certified the subdivision .
They did the same for land near Medina Lake , now known as Bandera Falls .
Later , the Hill Country started burgeoning with upper - middle - class newcomers , and with blue - collar workers who came to provide services for the affluent .
The influx has pushed housing costs sky high – in Kerrville these days , one - bedroom apartments often go for $ 500 a month .
Decent low - income housing is scarce .
So people are moving to places like Bandera Pass .
There , says an Anglo resident , “ You can pay as little as $ 150 per lot at a delinquent tax sale , and pick up a used trailer for $ 1,200 .
This is Poor People ’s Alley . ”
White calls the area “ a time bomb … doomed to become the colonia capital of the Hill Country . ”
White says places like Bandera Pass will improve if residents organize for non-profit water systems and public monies for treatment plants .
But organizing takes time .
And it can be especially difficult in colonias , where many people see themselves as rugged individualists .
“ We moved here because I was sick of my family in Kerrville minding my business , ” says one Bandera Pass resident who did not want her name published .
She is a young Mexican immigrant whose husband does construction work in the Hill Country .
Her neighbor , also an immigrant , nods approvingly as she explains in Spanish that “ the people around here , we do n’t have anything to do with each other . ”
Between them , these women have several young sons and daughters .
They did n’t move to Bandera Pass until after Ramiro Perez died .
Had they been there before , chances are they would n’t have known Tina Rodríguez , nor about what was happening in the goat shed .
Colonias are like that in the Hill Country ; disorganized , hidden , and the last place to be when it takes a village to keep you – and your child – from falling off the edge .
Crystal Island in Moscow
At 1500 ft ( 450 m ) high , the Crystal Island project wo n't be the tallest piece of architecture on the planet , but covering 27 million sq ft ( 2.5 million sq. m ) of floor space , it will be gimungeous .
Basically , the structure in Moscow will be a city within a building and will have its own weather system .
London 's prestigious Foster +
Partners have designed the mega - structure incorporating solar and wind energy systems , making it eco-friendly .
The $ 4 billion dollar structure that looks like an enormous crystal Christmas tree will have 3,000 hotel rooms and 900 apartment units .
Other amenities include an international school , a theater , cinemas and a sports center .
For comparison , the Burj Dubai , the structure that holds the record for world 's tallest building ( 810 +m ) for the foreseeable future will contain about 3,595,100 sq ft ( 334,000 m² ) when completed .
So , the Crystal Island project will have 7.5 times the indoor space .
It 's expected to be completed between 2012 and 2013 .

Surprise !
Mukasey Covers Up Torture Last month , Democratic Sens. Charles Schumer of New York and Dianne Feinstein of California joined Republicans to ensure Michael Mukasey ’s confirmation as Attorney General , even though he refused to acknowledge that the simulated drowning of waterboarding was torture .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada helped the Bush administration , too , by rushing a floor vote on Mukasey before rank - and - file Democrats could get organized and push for a filibuster .
To show thanks , Mukasey now is slapping the Democratic - controlled Congress in the face by demanding it back off any oversight investigations into how and why the CIA in late 2005 destroyed videotapes of the waterboarding of al - Qaeda suspects .
Mukasey is pressing the House Intelligence Committee to shelve its investigation into the videotape destruction and is refusing to turn over information to other congressional committees .
He claims that to do so would interfere with his own investigation of what appears to be criminality that his Justice Department may have sanctioned .
And , to add insult to the stonewalling , Mukasey justified his refusal to provide information to Congress by citing his promise during his confirmation hearing that he would “ ensure that politics plays no role in cases brought by the Department of Justice . ”
In other words , Mukasey is arguing that congressional oversight of possible criminal wrongdoing by President George W. Bush and other senior administration officials represents “ politics ” – and that the only legitimate investigation of Bush ’s Executive Branch is one carried out by Bush ’s Executive Branch .
Some senior Democrats objected to Mukasey ’s actions , though mostly in muted tones .
Sen . Patrick Leahy of Vermont , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , expressed disappointment and restated that his panel “ needs to fully understand whether the government used cruel interrogation techniques and torture , contrary to our basic values . ”
Rep. Silvestre Reyes , D - Texas , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , and Rep. Peter Hoekstra of Michigan , the ranking Republican , issued a joint statement saying they were “ stunned ” by Mukasey ’s decisions .
“ There is no basis upon which the Attorney General can stand in the way of our work , ” Reyes and Hoekstra said .
What Will Congress Do ?
But it ’s less clear what Congress can – or will – do .
Over the past year , since Democrats won control of both houses , Bush has bested them time and again , with the Democrats often surrendering their most promising opportunities for pressuring the administration to make concessions .
In line with that pattern , Schumer and Feinstein broke with other Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee and joined with Republicans in November 2007 to clear Mukasey ’s confirmation .
They did so despite Mukasey ’s adamant refusal to designate the centuries - old tactic of waterboarding as torture .
Furious rank - and - file Democrats argued that Mukasey ’s equivocation on torture should have disqualified him to be the nation ’s chief law - enforcement officer , since torture violates domestic law , international law and the U.S. Constitution with its ban on “ cruel and unusual punishment . ”
They also noted that Mukasey embraced the Bush administration ’s view of an all - powerful executive and , as a federal judge , had endorsed indefinite incarceration of hundreds of Muslims on phony material witness warrants after the 9/11 attacks .
Ironically , the post - 9/11 round - up of Arab cab drivers , pizza delivery men and students came as the Bush administration was granting special permission for rich Saudis , including members of Osama bin Laden ’s family , to flee the United States after only cursory FBI questioning .
The arresting of the “ usual suspects ” – while the well - connected who actually might know something were whisked away – was perhaps the first signal of how Bush ’s “ war on terror ” would proceed , draconian actions that create the appearance of a tough crackdown when the reality is entirely different .
Bush made clear , too , that he was prepared to say anything , no matter how transparently false , to fend off public oversight .
For instance , he has said repeatedly that his administration does n’t “ torture ” although U.S. intelligence operatives have acknowledged subjecting terror suspects to waterboarding , which has been considered torture since the days of the Inquisition .
Waterboarding involves strapping a person to a board tilted so the head is lower than the feet , covering the face with cellophane and pouring water over it to create the sensation of drowning .
Bush ’s semantic defense of his administration – claiming that whatever he approved was not torture – made Mukasey ’s word games to the Senate Judiciary Committee necessary .
If Mukasey agreed that waterboarding was torture , he would have had little choice but to mount criminal investigations of Bush and other senior officials .
So , it should come as no surprise now that Mukasey is trying to fend off any independent investigation of Bush ’s possible criminal exposure , while twisting words and logic again – this time , by defining outside inquiries as playing “ politics ” and insisting that his internal investigation will be impartial .
Democratic Failure Schumer and Feinstein claim they voted for Mukasey in November because he was an improvement over Alberto Gonzales , who helped establish the framework for Bush ’s torture policies both as White House counsel and Attorney General .
Nevertheless , the failure to force clear answers on torture from Mukasey represented another moment when the Democrats abandoned a pressure point that might have won them some concessions – or at least some straight talk – from the administration .
That has been the Democrats ' pattern dating back to the November 2006 elections when they followed up their stunning victories by reverting to their timid practices of taking Bush at his word and avoiding aggressive oversight .
The Democrats not only failed to mount a sustained challenge to Bush ’s policies , they avoided any systematic hearings that would educate the American public about why Bush ’s presidency has represented such an extraordinary threat to the Republic .
[ For details , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Democrats ’ Year of Living Fecklessly . ” ]
In exchange for their repeated surrenders , the Democrats have gotten nothing from Bush and the Republicans , other than their contempt .
As the first session under the new Democratic majority nears an end this month , Bush is riding roughshod over the Democrats on a wide range of issues .
He insists that they sign off on his budget figures ; he demands another blank check for the Iraq War ; and his Attorney General is obstructing congressional oversight of the torture scandal .
Yet , the Democrats are in a far worse position today to stand up to Bush than they were a year ago .
Then , they had a majority of the American people behind them , hoping that the Democrats would protect the nation from Bush ’s executive power grab and would bring Bush ’s disastrous Iraq War to an end .
Today , only a tiny fraction of Americans believes that the congressional Democrats will do much more than run up the white flag , once again .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
The ABC network said on Monday it will go ahead with plans to air an episode of its new legal drama “ Eli Stone ” despite objections from pediatricians who say the show may discourage parents from having their children immunized .
The debut episode features the show ’s title character and hero , a trial lawyer for big corporations who decides to fight for the little guy , convincing a jury that a mercury - based preservative in a vaccine caused a child ’s autism .
On the show , a jury awards the boy ’s mother $ 5.2 million in damages after it is revealed the CEO of the vaccine maker kept his own daughter from getting the company ’s vaccine because of autism concerns .
The “ Eli Stone ” plot ventures into a highly charged debate between the U.S. medical establishment and some parents and advocates for autistic children over the safety of vaccines for youngsters .
Critics of childhood immunization have argued that thimerosal , a mercury - based preservative formerly used in vaccines , is a primary cause of an autism in young children .
Major health authorities , including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) , cite numerous studies that rule out any scientific link between autism and vaccines .
The American Academy of Pediatrics , reacting to a synopsis of the “ Eli Stone ” episode in a recent New York Times article , issued a statement criticizing the show as “ leaving audiences with the destructive idea that vaccines do cause autism . ”
The academy also made public a letter to ABC , a unit of the Walt Disney Co. , calling on the network to cancel the show ’s premiere episode , which is scheduled to air Thursday .
“ Many people trust the health information presented on fictional television shows , which influence their decisions about heath care , ” academy president Dr. Renee Jenkins wrote in a letter to Disney - ABC Television Group President Anne Sweeney .
ABC said it plans to broadcast the episode without changes , but would run a disclaimer at the opening of the show stating the story is fictional .
A message at the end will refer viewers to a CDC Web site for information about autism .
The show ’s two creators , Greg Berlanti and Marc Guggenheim , disputed the notion that their show would frighten parents away from vaccines .
“ We actually share the concern of the American Academy of Pediatrics .
We believe that children should be vaccinated , ” Berlanti told Reuters .
But he also said , “ We hope that people do watch the episode and draw their own conclusions . ”
Jenkins , in her letter to ABC , said the pediatricians group is “ alarmed that this program could lead to a tragic decline in the immunization rate . ”
“ In the United Kingdom , erroneous reports linking the measles vaccine to autism prompted a decline in vaccination and the worst outbreak of measles in two decades , including the deaths of several children , ” Jenkins wrote .
Over a decade after he bankrollled conservative sting operations into Bill Clinton ’s personal life — adding serious oomph to what Hillary Clinton famously dubbed a “ vast right - wing conspiracy ” — Richard Mellon Scaife , scion of Pittsburgh ’s famous Mellon banking and industry dynasty , has also been busted for cheating , and has recently broken bread with Bill in the former president ’s New York office .

“ I do n’t want people throwing rocks at me in the street .
But I believe in open marriage . ”
Philandering , Scaife says with a laugh , “ is something that Bill Clinton and I have in common . ”
Those are surprising words indeed to hear from a man who spent so lavishly to uncover Bill Clinton ’s sexual peccadilloes and to advance the movement fueled by family values .
But it would be a mistake to read the saga of Richard Mellon Scaife ’s divorce as simply a story of moral hypocrisy .
His treatment of women , especially his first wife , suggests a high regard for his own gratification .
His commitment to conservative politics has never been primarily about upholding traditional morality ; it has been about promoting policies that help to preserve his own wealth and that of people like himself .
On the subject of Clinton , his weather vane is now spinning wildly .
Scaife speaks of a “ very pleasant ” two - hour - and - fifteen - minute private lunch with Bill Clinton at the former president ’s New York office last summer .
“ I never met such a charismatic man in my whole life , ” Scaife says , glowing with pleasure at the memory .

Buchanan : McCain win would mean war with Iran David Edwards and Muriel Kane

Print This Email This Says McCain would provoke new wars , ' he 's in everybody 's face ' " More wars " could prove to be the oddest of all presidential campaign slogans .
Especially if it works .
Presidential candidate John McCain shocked observers on Sunday when he told a crowd of supporters , " There 's going to be other wars .
...
I 'm sorry to tell you , there 's going to be other wars .
We will never surrender but there will be other wars . "
MSNBC's Joe Scarborough asked old - line conservative Pat Buchanan about McCain 's remarks , saying , " He talked about promising that more wars were coming .
...
Is he so desperate to get off the economic issue ? "
Pat Buchanan replied that McCain never used the word " promise " but simply said there would be more wars , and that from McCain 's point of view , " that is straight talk .
...
You get John McCain in the White House , and I do believe we will be at war with Iran . "
" That 's one of the things that makes me very nervous about him , " Buchanan went on .
" There 's no doubt John McCain is going to be a war president .
...
His whole career is wrapped up in the military , national security .
He 's in Putin 's face , he 's threatening the Iranians , we 're going to be in Iraq a hundred years . "
" So when he says more war , " Scarborough commented , " he is promising you , if he gets in the White House , we 'll not only be fighting this war but starting new wars .
Is that what conservative Republicans want ?
" I do n't say he 's starting them , " Buchanan answered .
" He expects more wars .
... I think he 's talking straight , because if you take a look at the McCain foreign policy , he is in everybody 's face .
Did you see Thad Cochran 's comment when he endorsed Romney ?
He said , look , John McCain is a bellicose , red- faced , angry guy , who constantly explodes . "
" Not a happy message , " commented Scarborough .
" Not Reaganesque . "

Know of other indiscretions that were missed ?
Add a comment and a link , and I ’ll include it on this post .
While much attention has been given to Senator Hillary Clinton ’s support for the U.S. invasion of Iraq , her foreign policy record regarding other international conflicts and her apparent eagerness to accept the use of force appears to indicate that her fateful vote authorizing the invasion and her subsequent support for the occupation and counter - insurgency war was no aberration .
Indeed , there ’s every indication that , as president , her foreign policy agenda would closely parallel that of the Bush administration .
Despite efforts by some conservative Republicans to portray her as being on the left wing of the Democratic Party , in reality her foreign policy positions bear a far closer resemblance to those of Ronald Reagan than they do of George McGovern .
For example , rather than challenge President George W. Bush ’s dramatic increases in military spending , Senator Clinton argues that they are not enough and the United States needs to spend even more in subsequent years .
At the end of the Cold War , many Democrats were claiming that the American public would be able to benefit from a " peace dividend " resulting from dramatically - reduced military spending following the demise of the Soviet Union .
Clinton , however , has called for dramatic increases in the military budget , even though the United States , despite being surrounded by two oceans and weak friendly neighbors , already spends as much on its military as all the rest of the world combined .
Mama Warbucks
Her presidential campaign has received far more money from defense contractors than any other candidate 
Democrat or Republican  and her close ties to the defense industry has led the Village Voice to refer to her as " Mama Warbucks . "
She has even fought the Bush administration in restoring funding for some of the very few weapons systems the Bush administration has sought to cut in recent years .
Pentagon officials and defense contractors have given Senator Clinton high marks for listening to their concerns , promoting their products and leveraging her ties to the Pentagon , comparing her favorably to the hawkish former Washington Senator " Scoop " Jackson and other pro-military Democrats of earlier eras .
Clinton has also demonstrated a marked preference for military confrontation over negotiation .
In a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations , she called for a " tough - minded , muscular foreign and defense policy . "
Similarly , when her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination Senator Barack Obama expressed his willingness to meet with Hugo Chávez , Fidel Castro or other foreign leaders with whom the United States has differences , she denounced him for being " irresponsible and frankly naive . "
Senator Clinton appears to have a history of advocating the blunt instrument of military force to deal with complex international problems .
For example , she was one of the chief advocates in her husband ’s inner circle for the 11 - week bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999 to attempt to resolve the Kosovo crisis .
Though she had not indicated any support for the Kosovar Albanians ’ nonviolent campaign against Serbian oppression which had been ongoing since she had first moved into the White House six years earlier , she was quite eager for the United States to go to war on behalf of the militant Kosovo Liberation Army which had just recently come to prominence .
Gail Sheehy ’s book Hillary ’s Choice reveals how , when President Bill Clinton and others correctly expressed concerns that bombing Serbia would likely lead to a dramatic worsening of the human rights situation by provoking the Serbs into engaging in full - scale ethnic cleansing in Kosovo , Hillary Clinton successfully pushed her husband to bomb that country anyway .
Military Intervention
She has also defended the 1998 U.S. bombing of a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan which had provided that impoverished African country with more than half of its antibiotics and vaccines , falsely claiming it was a chemical weapons factory controlled by Osama bin Laden .
Immediately following the 9/11 attacks , Clinton went well beyond the broad consensus that the United States should go after al - Qaeda cells and their leadership to declare that any country providing any " aid and comfort " to al - Qaeda " will now face the wrath of our country . "
When Bush echoed these words the following week in his nationally - televised speech , she declared " I ’ll stand behind Bush for a long time to come . "
She certainly did .
Clinton voted to authorize the president with wide - ranging authority to attack Afghanistan and was a strong supporter of the bombing campaign against that country , which resulted in more civilian deaths than the 9/11 attacks against the United States that had prompted them .
Despite recent pleas by the democratically elected Afghan president Harmid Karzai that the ongoing U.S. bombing and the over - emphasis on aggressive counter - insurgency operations was harming efforts to deal with the resurgence of violence by the Taliban and other radical groups , Clinton argues that our " overriding immediate objective of our foreign policy " toward Afghanistan " must be to significantly step up our military engagement . "
Nuclear Weapons
Particularly disturbing has been Senator Clinton ’s attitudes regarding nuclear issues .
For example , when Senator Obama noted in August that the use of nuclear weapons  traditionally seen as a deterrent against other nuclear states  was not appropriate for use against terrorists , Clinton rebuked his logic by claiming that " I do n’t believe that any president should make any blanket statements with respect to the use or nonuse of nuclear weapons . "
Senator Clinton has also shown little regard for the danger from the proliferation of nuclear weapons to other countries , opposing the enforcement of UN Security Council resolutions challenging the nuclear weapons programs of such U.S allies as Israel , Pakistan and India .
Not only does she support unconditional military aid  including nuclear - capable missiles and jet fighters  to these countries , she even voted to end restrictions on U.S. nuclear cooperation with countries that violate the Non-Proliferation Treaty .
She has a very different attitude , however , regarding even the possibility of a country the United States does not support obtaining nuclear weapons some time in the future .
For example , Senator Clinton insists that the prospect of Iran joining its three Southwest Asian neighbors in developing nuclear weapons " must be unacceptable to the entire world " since challenging the nuclear monopoly of the United States and its allies would somehow " shake the foundation of global security to its very core . "
She refuses to support the proposed nuclear weapons - free zone for the Middle East , as called for in UN Security Council resolution 687 , nor does she support a no - first use nuclear policy , both of which could help resolve the nuclear standoff .
Indeed , she has refused to rule out the use of nuclear weapons against such non-nuclear countries as Iran , even though such unilateral use of nuclear weapons directly contradicts the Non-Proliferation Treaty , the same treaty she claims the United States must unilaterally and rigorously enforce when it involves Iran and other countries our government does n’t like .
Senator Clinton also criticized the Bush administration ’s decision to include China , Japan and South Korea in talks regarding North Korea ’s nuclear program and to allow France , Britain and Germany to play a major role in negotiations with Iran , claiming that instead of taking " leadership to keep deadly weapons out of the hands of rogue states and terrorists … we have outsourced over the last five years our policies . "
In essence , as president , Hillary Clinton would be more unilateralist and less prone to work with other nations than the Bush administration on such critical issues as non-proliferation .
Latin America
In Latin America , Senator Clinton argues that the Bush administration should take a more aggressive stance against the rise of left - leaning governments in the hemisphere , arguing that Bush has neglected these recent developments " at our peril . "
In response to recent efforts by democratically elected Latin American governments to challenge the structural obstacles which have left much of their populations in poverty , she has expressed alarm that " We have witnessed the rollback of democratic development and economic openness in parts of Latin America . "
Apparently wishing that the Bush administration could have somehow prevented the elections of leftist governments in Venezuela , Bolivia , Ecuador , and elsewhere , she argues that " We must return to a policy of vigorous engagement . "
Though she has not clarified what she means by " vigorous engagement , " regional examples in recent decades have included military interventions , CIA - sponsored coups , military and financial support for opposition groups , and rigged national elections .
She also supports Bush ’s counter - productive and vindictive policy towards Cuba , insisting that she would not end the trade embargo  recently denounced in a 184 - 4 vote by the United Nations General Assembly  until there was a " democratic transition " in that country .
She has even backed Bush ’s strict limitations on family visitations by Cuban - Americans and other restrictions on Americans ’ freedom to travel .
Israel and Palestine
Regarding Israel , Senator Clinton has taken a consistently right - wing position , undermining the efforts of Israeli and Palestinian moderates seeking a just peace that would recognize both the Palestinians ’ legitimate national rights and the Israelis ’ legitimate security concerns .
For example , she has defended Israeli colonization of occupied Palestinian territory , has strongly supported Israel ’s construction of an illegal separation barrier deep inside the occupied territory , and has denounced the International Court of Justice for its near - unanimous 2004 decision calling on Israel to abide by international humanitarian law .
Senator Clinton has consistently put the onus of responsibility on the occupied Palestinians rather than their Israeli occupiers .
She has been particularly outspoken in her condemnation of the Palestine Authority , even prior to Hamas gaining the majority in their parliament , for publishing textbooks which she claims promotes " anti-Semitism , " " violence , " and " dehumanizing rhetoric " and thereby breeds a " new generation of terrorists . "
On several occasions she has blamed this alleged anti-Semitic indoctrination  and not the Israeli occupation  for Palestinian violence .
The only source she has cited to uphold these charges , however , has been the Center for the Monitoring the Impact of Peace ( CMIP ) , a right - wing Israeli - based group whose board includes Daniel Pipes and other prominent American neoconservatives , which was founded in 1998 as part of an effort to undermine the peace process by attempting to portray the Palestinians as hopelessly hostile to Israel ’s existence .
It has been directly challenged by other studies from more objective sources .
Senator Clinton ’s insistence on repeating the propaganda of long - discredited reports by a right - wing think tank instead of paying attention to well - regarded investigations by credible scholars and journalists may be a dangerous indication of how little difference there is between her and Bush in terms of what sources she would rely upon in formulating her policies .
Israel and Lebanon
Senator Clinton was also an outspoken supporter of Israel ’s massive military assault on the civilian infrastructure of Lebanon and the Gaza Strip last summer , which took the lives of at least 800 civilians .
She claimed that the carnage was justified since it would " send a message to Hamas , Hezbollah , to the Syrians [ and ] to the Iranians , " because , in her words , they oppose the United States and Israel ’s commitment to " life and freedom . "
Despite detailed reports from Amnesty International and Human Rights
Watch noting that there was no evidence to suggest that Hezbollah used Lebanese civilians as human shields , Senator Clinton has repeatedly insisted that they did , in an apparent effort to discredit these human rights groups and absolve Israel of any responsibility for the enormous civilian casualties inflicted during the assault .
Senator Clinton ’s statements were challenged by her opponent in last year ’s Democratic primary for Senate in New York , union activist Jonathan Tasini , who pointed out that " Israel has committed acts that violate international standards and the Geneva Conventions . "
Her spokesperson , however , dismissed Tasini ’s concerns about Israeli violations of international humanitarian law as " beyond the pale . "
Senator Clinton supporters also denounced him as " anti-Israel , " even though he is a former Israeli citizen who has lost close relatives in the Arab - Israeli wars and to Palestinian terrorism , whose father fought with Zionist forces in the Israeli war of independence , and has repeatedly referred to himself as a " friend of Israel . "
Clinton even continues to defend Israel ’s decision to launch the devastating 2006 war on Lebanon even though an Israeli government report released earlier this year acknowledged it was a major setback to Israeli security .
Syria
Senator Clinton has also aimed her militaristic sights at Syria .
In a typical example of her double - standards , she was a co-sponsor of the 2003 " Syrian Accountability Act , " which demanded  under threat of sanctions  that Syria unilaterally eliminate its chemical weapons and missile systems , despite the fact that nearby U.S. allies like Israel and Egypt had far larger and more advanced stockpiles of chemical weapons and missiles , not to mention Israel ’s sizable arsenal of nuclear weapons .
( See my article , The Syrian Accountability Act and the Triumph of Hegemony . )
Included in the bill ’s " findings " were charges by top Bush Administration officials of Syrian support for international terrorism and development of dangerous WMD programs .
Not only have most of these particular accusations not been independently confirmed , they were made by the same Bush Administration officials who had made similar claims against Iraq that have since been proven false .
Yet Senator Clinton naively trusts their word over independent strategic analysts familiar with the region who have challenged many of these charges .
Her bill also called for strict sanctions against Syria as well as Syria ’s expulsion from its non-permanent seat Security Council for its failure at that time to withdraw its forces from Lebanon according to UN Security Council resolution 520 .
This could hardly be considered a principled position , however , since she defended Israel ’s 22 - year long occupation of southern Lebanon that finally ended just three years earlier which was in defiance of this same resolution , as well as nine other UN Security Council resolutions .
Nor had she ever called for the expulsion of Morocco , Turkey or Indonesia from the Security Council when they held non-permanent seats despite their violations of UN Security Council resolutions regarding their occupations of neighboring countries .
Despite the fact that Syria is far weaker than it was 20 years ago when it was being generously armed by the Soviet Union , Senator Clinton insists that it is now " among the most difficult and dangerous [ countries ] in the world " and that it somehow poses " direct threats to … neighbors … and far beyond the region . "
She also offered her " strong support " for Israel ’s unprovoked air strikes in northern Syria in September .
She has echoed the administration ’s charges that Syria is a major supporter of Hamas , even though the bulk of the Islamist Palestinian group ’s foreign support has come from Saudi Arabia and Iran , not the secular regime in Damascus .
And , despite Syria ’s longstanding opposition to Sunni extremists and Iraqi Baathists  the major components of the insurgency fighting U.S. forces in Iraq  she has also accused Syria of backing anti-American forces in that country .
Iran
In response to the Bush administration ’s ongoing obsession with Iran , Senator Clinton ’s view is that the Bush has not been obsessive enough .
In a speech at Princeton University last year , she argued that the White House " lost critical time in dealing with Iran , " and accused the administration of choosing to " downplay the threats and to outsource the negotiations " as well as " standing on the sidelines . "
She has insisted that " we cannot take any option off the table in sending a clear message to the current leadership of Iran  that they will not be permitted to acquire nuclear weapons . "
Though going to war is still very high on her list of options , apparently supporting a nuclear weapons - free zone for the entire Middle East , normalizing economic and strategic relations in return for eliminating Iran ’s nuclear weapons capability , and other possible negotiated options are not .
In defending her vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , she has claimed that Bush " deceived all of us " in exaggerating the threat posed by Saddam Hussein ’s regime .
Yet , when it comes to the similarly exaggerated Iranian threat , she has again repeated the Bush administration ’s talking points almost verbatim .
Indeed , as recently as last month she was insisting that " Iran is seeking nuclear weapons , " even though the consensus of the United States ’ 16 intelligence agencies was that Iran ended its nuclear weapons program back in 2003 .
Senator Clinton was the only Democratic member of Congress seeking the presidential nomination to support the Kyl - Lieberman amendment which , among other things , called on the Bush administration to designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps  the largest branch of the Iranian military  as a foreign terrorist organization .
To designate a branch of the armed forces of a foreign state as a terrorist organization would be unprecedented and was widely interpreted to be a backhanded way of authorizing military action against Iran .
Indeed , Virginia Senator Jim Webb referred to it as " Cheney ’s fondest pipe dream . "
She initially justified her vote in part because of the Revolutionary Guard ’s alleged involvement in Iran ’s nuclear weapons program , a position she has had trouble defending since it was revealed such a program has not existed for at least four years .
In language remarkably similar to her discredited rationalization for her 2002 vote to authorize the U.S. invasion of Iraq , she claimed that it was not actually a vote for war , but simply to give Bush a means " to apply greater diplomatic pressure on Iran . "
( Fortunately , Senator Clinton ’s position was too extreme even for the Bush administration , which designated only the al - Quds Force  a sub-unit of the Revolutionary Guards which does n’t always operate with the full knowledge and consent of the central government  as a terrorist organization . )
She has also decried Iran ’s " involvement in and influence over Iraq , " an ironic complaint for someone who voted to authorize the overthrow of the anti-Iranian secular government of Saddam Hussein despite his widely predicted replacement by pro-Iranian Shi’ite fundamentalist parties .
She has also gone on record repeating a whole series of false , exaggerated and unproven charges by Bush administration officials regarding Iranian support for the Iraqi insurgency , even though the vast majority of foreign support for the insurgency has come from Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and that the majority of the insurgents are fanatically anti-Iranian and anti-Shi’ite .
Though Iran ’s threat to the national security of the United States is grossly exaggerated , they are a far more powerful country today in terms of their military prowess than was Iraq in 2002 , when Senator Clinton supported invading that country because of its alleged danger to U.S. national security .
It would be naïve , therefore , to ignore the very real possibility that , if elected president , she would find reason to invade Iran as well .
A Liberal ?
Given Senator Clinton ’s militaristic foreign policy , why are so many of her supporters apparently in denial of this unfortunate reality ?
Part of the problem is that most of the public criticism of the former first lady has been based on false and exaggerated charges from the far right , often infused with a fair dose of sexism .
As a result , many liberals become defensive and reluctant to criticize her .
Many also ironically start believing some of the lies of the far right when they claim she is some kind of left - winger .
There is also an understandable nostalgia for the eight years of relative peace and prosperity under her husband ’s administration after the horrors of nearly seven years under President George W. Bush , which have made it easy to forget the lesser but very real failings of President Bill Clinton .
There is also the fact that after 43 male presidents , the prospect of finally having a woman as chief executive is understandably appealing .
Yet , what ’s the advantage of a female president if her foreign policies are still centered on patriarchal notions of militarism and conquest ?
What would it mean to the women of Iraq , Iran , Palestine , Lebanon and other countries who would suffer as a result of her policies ?
Did the position of British women improve as a result of the militaristic policies of their first female prime minister , Margaret Thatcher ?
These are the kinds of questions , along with a critical examination of her overall foreign policy record , that need to be considered by Democrats before making Hillary Clinton their nominee for president .
Senate OKs One - Year AMT Relief Deal on Alternative Minimum
Tax now goes to the House for approval .
Dec. 6 , 2007  --
After months of back and forth , the Senate approved a one - year patch to shelter millions of middle - class Americans from the Alternative Minimum Tax .
The temporary one - year fix will give between 19 and 23 million Americans billions in tax relief from the AMT .
The notion that something should be done about the AMT is nearly unanimous as it passed the Senate by an 88 to 5 margin Thursday night -- but Democrats and Republicans disagreed on how best to enact reform .
As a result , the Senate opted for the one - year fix and the issue will have to be revisited before the 2009 tax season .
The AMT is an antiquated chapter in the complicated U.S. tax code .
When it was originally passed it was meant to close a tax loophole for the wealthy , but because it was not pegged to inflation , the tax has ensnared millions more Americans each year , erasing their deductions .
Senate Republicans were able earlier in the day to defeat an AMT proposal pushed by Democrats in the House of Representatives that would have sheltered middle - class Americans from the AMT , but offset the revenue lost to government coffers by changing the tax laws for wealthy subsets of taxpayers .
The Democrats were aiming at groups like hedge fund managers who defer paying taxes on their offshore income as well as private equity , venture capital and real estate firms that are compensated based on the appreciation of the value of their company and so are liable only for a 15 percent capital gains tax rate instead of the 35 percent income tax rate .
Raising taxes on these people , many Republicans argued , would cool economic expansion and drive business overseas .
Sen . Judd Gregg , R-NH , said the Democratic plan " would chill economic expansion in this country , would undermine our ability to create capital in this country , and as a result would undermine the ability of entrepreneurs to go out and create jobs . "
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- KY , said it does not make sense to protect one group of Americans from taxes while hiking taxes on others .
The AMT proposal is not finished .
House Democrats must first vote on it and it is unclear if either the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - CA. , or the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , Charlie Rangel , D - NY , will sign off on a bill that is not " paid for . "
Democrats have argued that passing tax relief without offsetting it with revenue gains someplace else was fiscally irresponsible .
In the Senate , Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - NV. , said he was frustrated to have to vote for the AMT patch without any offsetting taxe hikes .
" I am relieved that the Senate has acted this evening to extend AMT relief for 19 million taxpayers – including nearly 100,000 Nevadans .
But I want to make it perfectly clear that I am very disappointed Republicans prevented the Senate from passing AMT relief in a fiscally responsible manner .
Instead , Republicans insisted that the $ 50 billion cost of this proposal be added to the national debt – a debt that is already growing at a rate of $ 1 million a minute , " Reid said .
Meanwhile , the IRS is waiting to print its 2007 tax forms .
From our experience consulting to entrepreneurs , start - ups , and small businesses over the past ten years , we ’ve gained much exposure to the realities of starting and growing businesses .
We thought it would be interesting — and hopefully instructive — to lay out some of the myths and assumptions of aspiring entrepreneurs .
7 . It Is All Dependent on Hard Work .
Hard work is an absolutely necessary , but not sufficient , condition for starting and growing a business .
It is the given , but without a solid business plan and compelling value proposition for customers and partners , all of the hard work in the world will be for naught .
The world is filled with over - worked , over - stressed , and not terrible successful small business people who struggle not because of lack of appropriate effort , but rather for lack of appropriate planning .
6 . If Your Product or Service is Compelling Enough , Customers Will Beat a Path to your Door .
Unless you are building a business based upon intellectual property and / or technology that provides and creates such a competitive advantage and compelling customer value proposition , the early success of your business will be based as much on your ability to market and sell your product and service as it will on the product or service offering itself .
Remember : in a capitalistic marketplace there is NO distinction between value and perceived value .
5 . If Your Product or Service is Compelling Enough , Investors Will Beat a Path to your Door .
Those that identify themselves as prospective investors in earlier - stage , small companies are mostly INUNDATED with investment opportunities .
As such , no matter how good and unique your business opportunity , there is always a strong , initial prejudice AGAINST investment that needs to be overcome .
4. It Is All About You .
The myth of the charismatic , “ do and be everything ” entrepreneur is just that — a myth .
Any and all companies of value are great teams much more than they are the by - product of a highly talented individual .
The best entrepreneurs and business leaders inspire the mission , values and philosophy of a company by their own example .
This inspiration is then communicated to all of the business ’ stakeholders — employees , customers , investors , partners , vendors , and its wider community .
3. The Government Is Your Friend .
We are constantly astounded by the regulatory and paperwork maze that a startup company needs to negotiate and constantly monitor to both start and maintain a business .
It is a significant time , money , and energy drain that detracts from the main value creation intent of a new business .
Our best advice in this regard — as resources are available — is to find competent legal and accounting counsel , to both advise upon and outsource the regulatory burden , so you can focus on business - building .
2. The Government Is Your Enemy .
Having said the above , in the mixed economy in which we live , government revenue opportunities , on a local , state , federal , and international level , have never been greater for small business .
While slow , meandering , and confusing to approach , governments have much to recommend them as clients and customers , not the least of which is that once sold , government clients pay well and are not bad debt risks .
A somewhat trite but very important credo to remember when selling to governments , even more so than in business , is that “ it is not as much what you know but who you know . ”
1. It Is Only Worth Doing If You Become the Next Google .
The vast majority of small businesses will always remain just that — small businesses .
The odds of starting a business and have it become the next Google or a publicly - traded company are very , very small .
While we would never discourage entrepreneurs for aiming for the stars , it is also important to have success metrics grounded in probability .
An expectation of a minimum of 2 years of very , very hard work with little financial return but with a lot of learning ( and some fun hopefully as well ) involved is a good starting point .
From this first milestone , then and only then should there start to be an expectation of significant wealth - building .
Find that balance between the long term vision and the Monday morning action plan — and success , while not guaranteed , is very likely .

On Wednesday 's Hardball Senator Barbara Boxer talked with Chris Matthews about testimony given to the Senate Environment Committee by CDC Director Julie Gerberding about global warming and related health issues .
Boxer says that Gerberding admitted that her original testimony had been heavily redacted by the White House and much of that was information on the public health impact of Global Warming .
When a letter was sent to President Bush asking for clarification on the redacted portions of the testimony , Boxer claims she received a letter back from White House Counsel , Fred Fielding , refusing her request claiming .... you guessed it -- Executive Privilege .
Sea cucumbers live on the ocean floor
The slug - like creature produces a protein , lectin , which impairs development of the parasites .
An international team genetically engineered mosquitoes - which carry the malaria parasite - to produce the same protein in their gut when feeding .
The PLoS Pathogens study found the protein disrupted development of the parasites inside the insects ' stomach .
Ultimately , one aim of our field is to find a way of genetically engineering mosquitoes so that the malaria parasite cannot develop inside them
Professor Bob Sinden
Imperial College London
Malaria causes severe illness in 500 million people worldwide each year , and kills more than one million .
It is estimated that 40 % of the world 's population are at risk of the disease .
To stimulate the mosquitoes to produce lectin , the researchers fused part of the gene from the sea cucumber which produces the protein with a gene from the insect .
The results showed that the technique was effective against several of the parasites which cause malaria .
Lectin is poisonous to the parasites when they are still in an early stage of development called an ookinete .
Usually , the ookinetes migrate through the mosquito's stomach wall , and produce thousands of daughter cells which invade the salivary glands , and infect a human when the mosquito takes a blood meal .
But when exposed to lectin the ookinetes are killed before they can start their deadly journey .
Work left
Researcher Professor Bob Sinden , from Imperial College London , said : " These results are very promising and show that genetically engineering mosquitoes in this way has a clear impact on the parasites ' ability to multiply inside the mosquito host . "
You would have to get the modified version to become the predominant species , and that has never been done in any setting before
Dr Ron Behrens
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine
However , he said much more work still had to be done before the technique could be used to curb the spread of malaria .
" Although the sea cucumber protein significantly reduced the number of parasites in mosquitoes , it did not totally remove them from all insects .
" At the current stage of development , the genetically modified mosquitoes would remain dangerous to humans .
" Ultimately , one aim of our field is to find a way of genetically engineering mosquitoes so that the malaria parasite cannot develop inside them . "
Professor Sanjeev Krishna , an expert in malaria at St George 's Hospital Medical School , London , said new treatments for malaria were vital , as there was some sign that the parasites which cause the disease were developing resistance to the current artemisinin drugs .
He said : " This is a very important first step in developing a potential new way to control this infection . "
Dr Ron Behrens , of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said the technique showed promise in theory - but he warned that introducing genetically modified mosquitoes could be fraught with practical difficulties .
" You would have to get the modified version to become the predominant species , and that has never been done in any setting before , " he said .
Professor Brian Greenwood , London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said : " This is elegant science but only one of the ways that have been found to inhibit development of the malaria parasite in the mosquito midgut using genetic manipulation .
" The key factor that will determine whether these approaches will ever become a practical malaria control tool is finding a way of ensuring that the genetically engineered mosquitoes take over from the wild ones . "
Democrats drop demand for documents as prerequisite to confirming Bush AG nominee John Byrne
Published : Thursday October 4 , 2007

Print This Email This Senate Democrats who bemoaned the White House 's refusal to turn over subpoenaed documents in their investigation of the firing of eight US Attorneys wo n't block Bush 's nominee for Attorney General , Michael Mukasey , despite the fact he wo n't promise to release the files .
Mukasey , the man Bush tasked to enforce the laws of the United States , has no said whether he 'll allow Democrats access to files and email messages about the prosecutors ' firings and legal justifications for Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program .
In a public letter dated Tuesday and released Wednesday , Senate Judiciary Chairman Pat Leahy ( D - VT ) said he'd go forward with confirmation hearings regardless .
In the letter , Leahy said he'd hoped President Bush would " work with us to fulfill longstanding requests for information so that we could all agree about what went so wrong at the Department of Justice and work together to restore it " but instead " have left you to answer the unanswered questions and left longstanding disputes unresolved . "
" Regrettably , the White House has chosen not to clear the decks of past concerns and not to produce the information and material it should have and could have about the ongoing scandals that have shaken the Department of Justice and led to the exodus of its former leadership , " Leahy added .
" Those matters now encumber your nomination and , if confirmed , your tenure . "
The White House called Wednesday for swift confirmation of their nominee , and added that the only way to address the US Attorney scandal was to have someone new at the helm .
" Members of the committee have been outspoken about the vacancies [ at the Department of Justice ] , and they have an opportunity to do something about it by confirming him swiftly , " said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino .
" The Senate Judiciary Committee has now received all of Judge Mukasey s documents in preparation for a confirmation hearing ,  she added .
" I think theres no reason to delay scheduling a hearing . "
Democrats say the hearings were likely to begin by late October .
Caracas , Venezuela
IF President Hugo Chávez has dreamed of turning Venezuela into a Cuba with oil , the Venezuelans who oppose him have discovered the perfect antidote : the student movement .
At the time of last month ’s referendum on Mr. Chávez ’s efforts to remake the Constitution to his liking , I got to know some of the “ chamos , ” as the student activists are known .
What struck me was not only how effective they were , but how different their movement was from almost all its many antecedents in the region .
Most important , the Venezuelans are not calling for socialist revolution , but for liberal democracy .
Instead of vindicating the statist ideologies of the 20th century or the romantic passions of the 19th , they have embraced classic 18th - century humanism .
“ Our struggle is historic , ” Yon Goicoechea , a law student at Andrés Bello Catholic University and one of the political movement ’s leaders , told me as we sat , along with eight of his fellow leaders , in the offices of the independent newspaper El Nacional .
They had brought with them pads and pens , but I was the one who learned and took notes .
As Mr. Goicoechea puts it , “ Like Martin Luther King , we do not fight against a man , we fight for the vindication of civil and human rights for everyone in Venezuela . ”
As with the radicals who preceded them , they have genuine concern for the poor .
But they also have concrete plans to develop their country , and they embody a hope for reconciliation across the brutal divisions of Venezuelan society .

Peace !
By most conventional measures , Paul Fredo is an American success story .
The son of a coal miner , he made almost $ 200,000 in the last year , enough to place him in the top 2 % of wage earners .
As a financial manager for the U.S. unit of Alstom , the French bullet - train maker , he has lived an expense - account life , spending most nights in hotels and jetting to meetings in Washington and Paris .
But look carefully at Fredo ’s circumstances and a less appealing picture begins to emerge — one in which , over the last 25 years , economic risk has been steadily shifted from the broad shoulders of business and government to the backs of working families like his .
By the time Fredo joined Alstom here last year , he had become an itinerant executive , a contract worker brought in for a particular purpose , then sent packing .
“ They tell me every Friday whether to come back , ” the 57 - year - old explained .
Between his last regular job as the chief financial officer of another company and his hiring at Alstom , Fredo was unemployed for nearly two years and saw his income decline by two - thirds .
He has long been without health benefits , holidays , paid vacation or job security .
“ We come from the old school that you work hard and give it your all , and the job will be there for you , ” said Fredo ’s wife of 35 years , Donna .
“ It ’s different today . ”
From his perch several rungs down the economic ladder , Ron Burtless sees the same forces at play — forces that have caused his family ’s income to swing sharply up and down .
Unlike Fredo , Burtless never aspired to the executive suite .
Instead , almost three decades ago , he reached for a union card and went to work as an electrician at a Bethlehem Steel Corp. plant in Indiana .
Until recently , he seemed the very embodiment of Middle American stability , with a $ 60,000 annual wage , two grown daughters , a red Ford pickup and a five - bedroom suburban home .
But in a matter of just two weeks last year , Burtless ’ finances were thrown into disarray when Bethlehem collapsed and , adding injury to insult , he was badly hurt on the job and saddled with more than $ 90,000 in medical bills .
Having fallen through cracks in the workers ’ compensation system , he now ponders a wrenching question : “ Am I going to have to go bankrupt ? ”
In their own ways , the problems encountered by Fredo and Burtless can be traced to the same source — a set of economic policies shaped by government officials and corporate executives intent on creating a more prosperous America .
Starting in the late 1970s , the nation ’s leaders sought to break a corrosive cycle of rising inflation and stagnating output by remaking the U.S. economy in the image of its frontier predecessor — deregulating industries , shrinking social programs and promoting a free - market ideal in which everyone must forge his or her own path , free to rise or fall on merit or luck .
On the whole , their effort to transform the economy has succeeded .
But the economy ’s makeover has come at a large and largely unnoticed price : a measurable increase in the risks that Americans must bear as they provide for their families , pay for their houses , save for their retirements and grab for the good life .
A broad array of protections that families once depended on to shield them from economic turmoil — stable jobs , widely available health coverage , guaranteed pensions , short unemployment spells , long - lasting unemployment benefits and well - funded job training programs — have been scaled back or have vanished altogether .
“ Working Americans are on a financial tightrope , ” said Yale University political scientist Jacob S. Hacker , who is writing a book called “ The Great Risk Shift . ”
“ Business and government used to see it as their duty to provide safety nets against the worst economic threats we face .
But more and more , they ’re yanking them away . ”
The yanking may be far from finished .
On the campaign trail this year , President Bush has made the case that people are better off relying on themselves , rather than on business or government , in case of trouble .
Under the banner of the “ Ownership Society , ” the president has proposed a series of new , tax - break - heavy accounts to let families pay for their own retirements , healthcare and job training .
He also has called for partially replacing the biggest of the government ’s protective programs — Social Security — with privately held stock and bond accounts .
Such arrangements might help people build up their personal assets .
But the approach also would expose them to even more economic risk than they ’ve already taken on .
Leaps and Plunges
Nowhere is the risk shift of the last quarter century more apparent than in the widening swings in working families ’ incomes .
Although average family income adjusted for inflation has risen in recent decades , the path that most households have followed has hardly been a steady line upward — the historical norm for most of the post - World War II era .
Instead , a growing number of families have found themselves caught on a financial roller coaster ride , with their annual incomes taking increasingly wild leaps and plunges over time .
In the early 1970s , the inflation - adjusted incomes of most families in the middle of the economic spectrum bobbed up and down no more than about $ 6,500 a year , according to statistics generated by the Los Angeles Times in cooperation with researchers at several major universities .
These days , those fluctuations have nearly doubled to as much as $ 13,500 , the newspaper ’s analysis shows .
This growing volatility — and the rising risk it signals — has cut a wide swath .
It has touched families from the working poor to those , like the Fredos , near the top of the earnings pyramid .
The shifting of risk , in other words , is proving to be a democratic phenomenon .
The Times ’ analysis is based on the Panel Study of Income Dynamics , which is underwritten by the National Science Foundation and run by the University of Michigan .
Unlike most economic measures , which involve taking snapshots of random samples of Americans at different times and comparing them , the panel study has followed the same 5,000 nationally representative families and their offshoots for nearly 40 years .
As such , it is the most comprehensive publicly available record of family earnings and income in the world — and it goes a long way toward explaining why , even in the midst of a recovery such as the one underway , so many Americans feel so uncertain about their economic circumstances .
In using income volatility to gauge risk , The Times is taking a page from the financial markets , where the chief measure of a stock ’s riskiness is how much its price bounces up and down compared with changes in a market measure such as the Standard & Poor ’s 500 index .
And just as with the stock market , there can be a big payoff .
Families in the economic middle saw their incomes , adjusted for inflation , climb by almost one - quarter to an average of nearly $ 50,000 between the early 1970s and the beginning of this decade , the newspaper ’s analysis shows .
At the same time , middle - class families saw their average net worth grow 40 % to $ 86,100 in the last decade alone , according to the Federal Reserve .
The rewards near the top of the economic heap have been even greater .
The average income of families in the upper 10 % of earners nearly doubled in the last generation to $ 130,400 .
Their average net worth nearly doubled as well , according to the Fed , to $ 833,000 .
Free -market advocates cite these pocketbook advances as proof that the economy has been overhauled in the right way .
“ On the whole , we have moved toward a freer market , a more competitive economy and a richer one , ” said University of Chicago economist and Nobel laureate Gary S. Becker .
“ There has been a shift toward people taking more risk on themselves ... and the economy has gained for it . ”
But there is another , less sanguine way to view what has unfolded .
The more that a family ’s income fluctuates , the greater the chance it will be caught in a downdraft when a crisis — such as a layoff , divorce or illness — strikes .
Then , it can be extremely tough to bounce back .
Over the last three decades , working families have faced ever - changing — and , for the most part , increasingly more perilous — risk - reward bargains .
During the 1970s , families in the economic middle enjoyed a comparatively favorable run .
Although their incomes generally swung up or down as much as 16 % a year , they ended each year an average of 2 % ahead of where they began .
The result by the decade ’s close was that the reward of extra annual income had more than covered the potential loss from a single year ’s sudden plunge .
But the story during the 1980s and early 1990s was basically the reverse .
The volatility of families ’ income nearly doubled to as much as 30 % a year .
But now , instead of growing amid all the ups and downs , average family income dropped at an annual rate of 0.3 % in the 1980s and an even steeper 2.3 % in the early ‘ 90s .
The bottom line : more risk for less reward .
Although volatility remained high in the late 1990s , with typical annual swings of as much as 27 % , incomes finally began to grow again , improving families ’ odds of being able to get ahead .
But the good times did n’t last .
Since 2000 , incomes have reversed course and fallen about 1 % a year , according to recently released census figures .
In other words , things are back to the unattractive equation of more risk for less reward .
A separate analysis by Hacker , the Yale political scientist , found even more dramatic changes in income swings .
In a study published in May , Hacker and a colleague reported that income volatility among households in the University of Michigan database had more than doubled between 1973 and 1998 .
The pair concluded that at its peak in the mid-1990s , volatility was roughly five times greater than in the early 1970s .
“ The incomes of American families have grown more unstable over the last generation , ” said Johns Hopkins University economist Robert A. Moffitt , who along with Boston College economist Peter Gottschalk pioneered techniques for analyzing earnings volatility more than a decade ago .
“ All other things equal , ” added Moffitt , who assisted The Times with its analysis , “ rising income instability suggests that families from the working poor to those fairly far up the income distribution are bearing more economic risk . ”
Protector of Last Resort
It was not always so .
With workers ’ compensation , welfare , unemployment benefits , Social Security , Medicare , workplace rules , environmental regulations , product liability laws and more , government officials spent most of the 20th century adding to the economic protections that Americans could count on — and reducing the risks they had to tackle alone .
“ State and federal lawmakers continually expanded the circle of public risk - management programs ... to include workers , the elderly , consumers and , in the end , just about everybody in some form or another , ” said David A. Moss , a Harvard University economic historian whose book “ When All Else Fails ” traces Washington ’s role as a protector of last resort .
Not everyone favored these developments .
During the 1935 congressional debate over Social Security , one House member , Republican Charles A. Eaton of New Jersey , fumed : “ This is a crazy notion ... that somehow ... the government of the United States can make it ... unnecessary for any of its citizens to face any difficulty , to run any risk . ”
But so strong was the conviction that working families needed protection , and so firm the consensus that government must help provide it , that leaders of virtually all political stripes sounded as if they were reading from the same script .
It would remain this way from the New Deal programs of the 1930s through President Nixon ’s push for national health insurance and expanded unemployment benefits .
However , by the late 1970s and certainly by Ronald Reagan ’s election in 1980 , new notions began to take hold , ones that turned many an established view about the needs of working Americans on its head .
The sense that something had to change — and that the free market was the answer — was fed by a variety of factors : fear that American business was being overtaken by Japan ; concerns that the 1970s near - bankruptcies of Lockheed Corp. , New York City and Chrysler Corp. betrayed some deep flaw in the U.S. economy ; the influence of economist Milton Friedman , author George Gilder and Wall Street Journal editor Robert Bartley ; and Reagan ’s sunny conservatism .
“ Government is not the solution to our problem , ” the new president famously declared .
“ Government is the problem . ”
Safety nets that were designed to help people were now said to be ensnaring them .
Economic upheaval that was long thought to hurt people was now praised for sifting winners from losers .
Ordinary Americans who were once simply seen as workers were now regarded as entrepreneurs and investors as well .
Along the way , wittingly or not , they became something else too : huge risk takers .
Consider :
Government used to provide substantial help in coping with joblessness .
In the mid-1970s , jobless workers could collect up to 15 months of unemployment compensation .
By last December , Congress had pared the program to just six months .
Additionally , federal legislation in 1978 and 1986 effectively reduced the value of benefits by making them taxable .
And state eligibility restrictions imposed in the late 1970s and early ‘ 80s shrank the fraction of the workforce entitled to collect benefits from about one - half to a little more than one - third .
Of the 8 million people who were unemployed last month , only 2.9 million were collecting benefits .
The minimum wage was once the government ’s chief means of ensuring that “ work pays ” — that those willing to head to a job each day would make enough to live on .
For decades , Democratic and Republican administrations alike maintained the minimum wage at about half of average hourly earnings in the U.S.
But starting in the early 1980s , the minimum wage was allowed to slip .
At $ 5.15 , it is now only one - third of average hourly earnings , its lowest level in 50 years .
Washington once sought to help people adjust to global competition , industrial restructuring and technological change by offering job training .
Twenty - five years ago , the federal government spent $ 27.3 billion annually ( in 2003 dollars ) through the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act , or CETA .
Even if one does n’t count CETA ’s “ public service ” jobs , which were widely criticized as boondoggles , it was still spending $ 17.1 billion .
By contrast , the government now spends about $ 4.4 billion on CETA ’s successor , the Workforce Investment Act .
“ It ’s largely a place holder , ” said Anthony P. Carnevale , an authority on education and training who was appointed to major commissions by presidents Reagan and Clinton .
“ It gives politicians something to point to but does n’t do much good . ”
Welfare was created to protect poor women and children , but by the late 1970s a growing chorus of analysts complained that the system had backfired by fostering a culture of dependency .
In 1996 , President Clinton and a Republican - controlled Congress approved a “ work first ” law that has cut welfare rolls by one - half and reduced inflation - adjusted welfare spending by at least one - third , or about $ 10 billion a year .
On balance , the changes appear to have benefited people who can find jobs and hold them .
But those who ca n’t work or have lost their jobs can often find themselves in far worse shape .
Twenty - five years ago in California , a mother of two who depended on welfare collected about $ 15,000 in cash assistance and food stamps .
By last year , a woman in the same circumstances brought in $ 3,300 less , in inflation - adjusted terms .
“ Washington , ” said Hacker , “ has been in a quarter - century - long retreat from what was once one of its primary responsibilities : helping provide economic security .
” Upward Striver Paul Fredo was born in a Pennsylvania coal town called Spangler to a father who lost his mining job to automation ; his pension , according to Fredo , to union corruption ; and , ultimately , his life to black lung disease .
The son was determined to have an easier go of it .
Fredo lifted himself up the way many poor kids do :
He joined the military .
He spent four years in the Air Force , including a stint in Vietnam , then went on to the University of Pittsburgh , studying accounting at night .
During his early career , he worked for a dairy , a nuclear waste processor and a company that sold tire - making equipment .
His Social Security records show that his salary moved progressively higher .
He earned $ 7,800 in 1970 , $ 24,500 in 1980 and $ 51,300 in 1990 .
By 1985 , at age 37 , he had snared a vice president ’s title .
“ I ’m going up the ladder , ” he remembers thinking .
He and Donna picked out a design from a Ryan Homes catalog and had a house built along the Ohio River north of Pittsburgh — a blue aluminum - and - brick colonial with four bedrooms , two - and - a - half baths and a 15 - year mortgage .
Fredo ’s income began to dance around during the 1990s as more and more of it came in the form of bonuses rather than straight pay — up $ 25,000 one year , down $ 5,000 or $ 10,000 the next .
Still , by 2000 Fredo was pulling in more than $ 160,000 annually .
And he thought he was in line for the top spot at steel - plant builder Voest - Alpine Industries Inc. , where he had been chief financial officer for eight years , helping the company grow from 14 employees to 450 .
But in October 2001 , as the steel industry swung from boom to bust , Voest - Alpine began to winnow its executive ranks .
Instead of a promotion , Fredo was handed a pink slip .
The setback seemed to stun family and friends even more than Fredo himself .
“ I called my fiancee and said , ‘ Dad ’s been downsized , ’ ” remembered Fredo ’s son Stephen .
“ She said , ‘ Did the company go under ? ’ ” Don Battaglia , a Pittsburgh computer consultant who has worked for Fredo , was equally incredulous .
“ I was convinced he’d be the guy who turned out the lights , ” Battaglia said .
The Fredos quickly made adjustments .
They canceled plans to trade in their 1998 Chrysler sedan .
They drew up a bare - bones budget for groceries , utilities , Christmas gifts and an occasional permanent for Donna ’s hair .
They started collecting buy - one - get - one - free coupon books at the Walgreens pharmacy .
Meanwhile , Fredo pulled down his copy of the Iron and Steel Institute ’s industry directory .
Before , whenever he needed a job , he landed one by writing to a few of the companies listed in the book and calling a couple of Pittsburgh employment agencies .
He assumed this time would be no different .
Little did he realize how much the world of work had changed .
Employers Break a Bond For most of the post - World War II era , Washington had a partner in helping to shield working families from risk : corporate America .
Businesses considered themselves duty - bound to provide stable jobs and strong ties to employees , cushioning workers against the vicissitudes of the economy .
Employers must find ways “ of protecting the individual against the more damaging effects of inevitable change , ” Standard Oil of New Jersey President Eugene Holman said in the late 1940s .
“ So far as the management of my own company is concerned , ” he added , “ we have formed the habit of thinking in terms of ... lifetime employment .
That is our goal . ”
For decades , employers delivered on the promise of job security .
“ The workers of our parents ’ generation typically had one job , one skill , one career — often with one company , ” Bush said last month at the Republican National Convention .
Beyond that , businesses erected a bulwark against the risk of illness by raising the number of workers with employer - provided health insurance from 1.5 million before World War II to more than 150 million .
They helped families deal with the economic costs of death by giving life insurance to 160 million of their employees , up from 9 million .
And they offered seemingly ironclad protection against the insecurity of old age by boosting the number of workers with pensions from 4 million to 44 million .
But like the government ’s safety net , corporate America ’s began to fall apart in the late 1970s — shifting still more risk onto working families .
Twenty - five years ago , almost 40 % of the nation ’s private full - time workforce was covered by traditional pensions , under which the employer bears the risks and pays the benefits .
That number has fallen to 20 % .
In the place of pensions have come defined - contribution plans such as 401 ( k ) s , under which an employer may kick in some funds — typically about half what would have been spent previously — but employees alone bear the burden of ensuring that they have enough money to retire on .
A similar shift is underway in health insurance .
As recently as 1987 , employers provided health coverage for 70 % of the nation ’s working - age population , according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington .
By last year , that had dropped to 63 % .
The change translates into nearly 18 million people who would have been covered under the old system scrambling to make their own arrangements .
What ’s more , even when employers continue coverage , they increasingly push more of the costs onto employees .
Since 2000 alone , employers have raised the premiums their workers must pay by an average of 50 % , or about $ 1,000 a family , according to a recently released study by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust .
When it comes to job security , employers have largely broken the bond they had with workers .
A late 1980s study by the Conference Board , a business research group , found that 56 % of major corporations surveyed agreed that “ employees who are loyal to the company and further its business goals deserve an assurance of continued employment . ”
A decade later , that number dropped to just 6 % .
Sometimes the pressure is n’t so quiet , either .
In 2004 , after efforts to have a creationist textbook adopted were stymied , a creationist majority on the school board in Dover , Pennsylvania , passed a policy misleadingly describing evolution as “ a theory ... not a fact ” and recommending “ intelligent design ” — the latest incarnation of creationism — as a scientifically credible alternative , and tried to force the science teachers to read a disclaimer to that effect .
I work at the National Center for Science Education , a non-profit organization that defends the teaching of evolution in the public schools .
Even eighty - two years after the Scopes trial , that ’s a job that keeps us busy .
In a 2005 survey conducted by the National Science Teachers Association , for example , 30 % of the science teachers responding indicated that they experienced pressure to omit or downplay evolution and related topics , while 31 % indicated that they experienced pressure to include nonscientific alternatives to evolution , such as “ creation science ” or “ intelligent design , ” in their science classrooms .
I send a lot of e-mail in the course of the average day , and ordinarily nobody is fired as a result .
But I ’m not always so lucky .
Eleven Dover parents filed a lawsuit , contending that the policy violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment .
NCSE consulted pro bono for the plaintiffs , and no fewer than three members of NCSE ’s board of directors served as expert witnesses .
Among them was Barbara Forrest , a professor of philosophy at Southeastern Louisiana University and the coauthor , with Paul R. Gross , of Creationism ’s Trojan Horse — the definitive exposé of the “ Wedge strategy ” of the “ intelligent design ” movement .
The verdict in the Kitzmiller case was devastating for the ambitions of “ intelligent design . ”
The judge in the case was scathing , both about the behavior of the defendants ( who were castigated for “ breathtaking inanity ” in adopting the objectionable policy ) and about the scientific credibility of " intelligent design " ( which , the judge wrote , “ is not science and cannot be adjudged a valid , accepted scientific theory as it has failed to publish in peer - reviewed journals , engage in research and testing , and gain acceptance in the scientific community ” ) .
Forrest ’s testimony was instrumental .
In his decision , the judge wrote , “ Dr. Barbara Forrest ... has thoroughly and exhaustively chronicled the history of ID in her book and other writings for her testimony in this case .
Her testimony , and the exhibits ... admitted with it , provide a wealth of statements by ID leaders that reveal ID ’s religious , philosophical , and cultural content . ”
In the wake of the Kitzmiller case , Forrest continued to speak about the career of the “ intelligent design ” movement , lecturing at institutions like Columbia University and Loyola University and to groups like the American Society of Cell Biology and the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
( She also featured prominently in the recent PBS documentary about the case , Judgment Day : Intelligent Design on Trial . )
So when she mentioned to me that she was going to be giving a talk in Austin , Texas , entitled , “ Inside Creationism ’s Trojan Horse , ” I dropped a quick note to people in the area , as is my usual procedure .
“ Dear Austin - area friends of NCSE , ” it began .
“ I thought that you might like to know that Barbara Forrest will be speaking in Austin on November 2 , 2007 . ”
After giving the details of the place , time , and sponsor , it explained , “ In her talk , Forrest will provide a detailed report on her expert testimony in the Kitzmiller v. Dover School Board trial as well as an overview of the history of the ‘ intelligent design ’ movement .
Forrest is a Professor of Philosophy in the Department of History and Political Science at Southeastern Louisiana University ; she is also a member of NCSE ’s board of directors . ”
Among the people to receive the note was Chris Comer .
Apparently she did n’t have a good idea who Forrest was — she later told “ Science Friday ” that she searched the web to find out -- and was impressed with Forrest ’s credentials and accomplishments .
Having satisfied herself that Forrest was a worthwhile speaker , she promptly forwarded my e-mail to a few individuals and mailing lists , adding , “ FYI . ”
Unfortunately , Comer works at the Texas Education Agency , as its director of science curriculum — or , rather , she worked there .
Less than two hours after sending the e-mail , she was called on the carpet and instructed to send a disclaimer .
And then she was forced to resign .
Although a memorandum recommending her dismissal referred to various instances of alleged “ misconduct and insubordination ” on her part , it was clear what her real offense was : “ the TEA requires , as agency policy , neutrality when talking about evolution and creationism . ”
It ’s absurd , of course , to regard Comer ’s forwarding of my announcement of Forrest ’s talk as endorsing Forrest ’s view ( ask a linguist ) .
But that absurdity pales in comparison to the absurdity of the Texas Education Agency trying to adopt a position of “ neutrality ” on evolution , when ( as the National Academy of Sciences observes )
“ The scientific consensus around evolution is overwhelming . ”
As Forrest commented , “ Maybe the TEA ca n’t afford to take a position on what constitutes good science education — maybe it must remain neutral on whether or not to lie to students about evolution — but if so , that 's just sad . ”
Both Comer and the TEA kept quiet about her resignation , but eventually the Austin American - Statesman got wind of it , and a spate of reportage and editorials , even as high in the media ’s pecking order as The New York Times , followed .
The interest was not only due to Comer ’s plight , however , but also due to what it foreshadows about the upcoming revision of Texas ’s state science standards — which is to be overseen by Don McLeroy , the chair of the state board of education , and himself a creationist .
Texas is n’t the only state preparing to revise its state science standards ; Florida is , too .
Trouble is on the horizon there as well : it was recently revealed that a state education official abused her position to rally public opposition to the section of the draft standards that present evolution .
( Was she forced to resign ?
No : she was “ counseled . ” )
And with a constant climate of ignorance of , skepticism about , and hostility toward evolution across the country , it looks as though my colleagues at NCSE and I wo n’t be out of a job any time soon .
So we ’ll continue to defend the teaching of evolution in the public schools , and to help concerned teachers , parents , and citizens in general to do the same .
We ’ll keep the e-mails coming , too .
Micro-electrodes were placed on a mosquito ’s antennae to record its response to specific human odours ( Image : Royal Society )
The Y - tube olfactometer tests how mosquitoes choose between two people based on their odours ( Image : Royal Society )
Some unfortunate people are irresistible to mosquitoes , while the scent of some lucky individuals drives the blood - suckers away .
Now the smelly chemicals from the sweat of these lucky people have been identified by researchers , who are testing its effectiveness as a natural mosquito repellent .

Everybody produces a mixture of odorous chemicals in their sweat , some of which attract biting insects , such as lactic acid .
But people who do not get bitten also produce smelly chemicals that appear to mask the scent of the attractive chemicals .
This masking can offer an effective camouflage against mosquitoes , explains James Logan , who carried out the research with John Pickett at Rothamsted Research in Harpenden , and colleagues at the University of Aberdeen , both in the UK .
These helpful chemicals probably occur naturally in everybody ’s sweat but some people have a much higher ratio than others , Logan says .
What is more , the same benign sweat chemicals that repel the tropical mosquitoes Aedes aegypti – responsible for spreading yellow fever throughout Africa and South America – appear also to disgust the persistent biting midge that terrorises the west coast of Scotland , the researchers discovered .
Sweat collectors
Logan constructed a Y - shaped chamber and wafted the scent of different people down two of the branches by getting volunteers to place their hands at the ends .
The blood - sucking insects flew from the thin end of the “ Y ” towards the human hand they preferred .
He then analysed the body odour of those individuals found to be unattractive by sealing their bodies in a foil sack , tied under the chin , and collecting and distilling the sweat that poured off them .
The most potent repellent chemical were then isolated by strapping miniature electrodes to the antennae of female mosquitoes and checking their responses to specific compounds .
Logan will not divulge the names of the chemicals until they are patented .
But he does reveal that although the scent of the chemicals is normally undetectable by humans , they have a fruity smell when highly concentrated .
Food additive
“ It ’s very exciting , ” Logan told New Scientist , “ because these are totally natural chemicals with an effectiveness that compares favourably to harsher chemicals such as DEET , which is the best repellent available but has unwanted effects , including dissolving plastics . ”
A key chemical identified by Logan as a repellent is also “ a natural food additive , so has proven safety ” , he says .
“ And because it can be made by plants , it may one day be possible to mass produce it cheaply . ”
The repellent is currently being trialled with 16 volunteers in Africa .
Meanwhile , the researchers are testing the repellent against other biting insects , including malaria carrying mosquitoes .
The research was presented at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition in London , UK , and has been submitted to a leading peer review journal for publication .
Using ESO 's Very Large Telescope , an international team of astronomers [ 1 ] has discovered a stunning rare case of a triple merger of galaxies .
This system , which astronomers have dubbed ' The Bird ' - albeit it also bears resemblance with a cosmic Tinker Bell - is composed of two massive spiral galaxies and a third irregular galaxy .
The galaxy ESO 593 - IG 008 , or IRAS 19115 - 2124 , was previously merely known as an interacting pair of galaxies at a distance of 650 million light - years .
But surprises were revealed by observations made with the NACO instrument attached to ESO 's VLT , which peered through the all - pervasive dust clouds , using adaptive optics to resolve the finest details [ 2 ] .
Underneath the chaotic appearance of the optical Hubble images - retrieved from the Hubble Space Telescope archive - the NACO images show two unmistakable galaxies , one a barred spiral while the other is more irregular .
The surprise lay in the clear identification of a third , clearly separate component , an irregular , yet fairly massive galaxy that seems to be forming stars at a frantic rate .
" Examples of mergers of three galaxies of roughly similar sizes are rare , " says Petri Väisänen , lead author of the paper reporting the results .
" Only the near - infrared VLT observations made it possible to identify the triple merger nature of the system in this case . "
Because of the resemblance of the system to a bird , the object was dubbed as such , with the ' head ' being the third component , and the ' heart ' and ' body ' making the two major galaxy nuclei in - between of tidal tails , the ' wings ' .
The latter extend more than 100,000 light - years , or the size of our own Milky Way .

Subsequent optical spectroscopy with the new Southern African Large Telescope , and archive mid-infrared data from the NASA Spitzer space observatory , confirmed the separate nature of the ' head ' , but also added further surprises .
The ' head ' and major parts of the ' Bird ' are moving apart at more than 400 km /s ( 1.4 million km / h ! ) .
Observing such high velocities is very rare in merging galaxies .
Also , the ' head ' appears to be the major source of infrared luminosity in the system , though it is the smallest of the three galaxies .
" It seems that NACO has caught the action right at the time of the first high - speed fly - by of the ' head ' galaxy through the system consisting of the other two galaxies , " says Seppo Mattila , member of the discovery team .
" These two galaxies must have met earlier , probably a couple of hundred million years ago . "
The ' head ' is forming stars violently , at a rate of nearly 200 solar masses per year , while the other two galaxies appear to be at a more quiescent epoch of their interaction - induced star formation history .
The ' Bird ' belongs to the prestigious family of luminous infrared galaxies , with an infrared luminosity nearly one thousand billion times that of the Sun .
This family of galaxies has long been thought to signpost important events in galaxy evolution , such as mergers of galaxies , which in turn trigger bursts of star formation , and may eventually lead to the formation of a single elliptical galaxy .
The findings presented here are reported in a paper to appear in a future issue of the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society ( " Adaptive optics imaging and optical spectroscopy of a multiple merger in a luminous infrared galaxy " , by P. Väisänen " et al . ) .

The fire sent smoke billowing over Las Vegas
Footage of the blaze
Plumes of smoke billowed from the Monte Carlo hotel on the city 's main street , the Strip , but the blaze was quickly contained by firefighters .
The fire broke out at about 1100 ( 1900 GMT ) but the flames were brought under control about an hour later .
No - one is reported to have been injured and the cause is not yet known .
Guests , including a bride in wedding dress , were relocated to nearby hotels .
Tim Szymanski from the Las Vegas Fire Department told the BBC the blaze appeared to be confined to the outside of the building :
" It 's a little difficult because ... you do n't have fire ladders that can reach up to the 32nd floor , they can only go up to about the sixth or seventh floor .
The fire appears to be on the exterior of the building , not on the inside , " he said .
He added that the building was fully equipped with automatic fire sprinklers .
' Burning debris '
Local officials said the hotel 's top floor penthouse suites , traditionally used by the casino 's high rollers , seemed not to have been affected by the fire .
Clark County fire chief Steven Smith denied local media reports that there were people still trapped in the building .
" We will do a thorough look through the building to make sure everyone is accounted for , " he said , quoted by AFP news agency .
Larry Wappel , from Indiana , told AP news agency that he and his brother were in a room on the 30th floor when they heard hotel staff banging on doors and telling guests to evacuate .
He said it took about 10 minutes to walk down the stairs to get to the ground floor .
" There were a couple of ladies crying , but it was pretty calm , " he added .
Another guest , Renza Badilla , was on the main casino level when the fire alarms went off and said she exited through the hotel kitchen to find burning debris and embers falling from the roof .
The entire Las Vegas Strip was shut to traffic and neighbouring hotels also evacuated .
The 3,000 - room Monte Carlo hotel and adjoining casino are owned by entertainment company MGM Mirage .
Modelled on the Place du Casino in Monaco , it was completed in 1996 costing more than $ 300 m to build .
A fire at Las Vegas ' MGM Grand Hotel in 1980 claimed more than 80 lives and injured nearly 700 people .
The Tree of Life has lost one of its branches due to the discovery that two formerly separated branches share a similar evolutionary history .
It 's more than just re-drawing textbooks .
The discovery by Norwegian and Swiss researchers has gained attention from biologists worldwide .
The findings come from the largest ever genetic comparison of higher life forms on the planet .
Of 5000 genes examined , researchers identified 123 common genes from all known groups of organisms ; these common genes have been studied more closely .
The study has required long hours of work from the researchers and an enormous amount of computing resources — supplied through a large network of computers at the University of Oslo .
“ The results were pretty astounding .
All non-bacterial life on Earth — called eukaryotic life — can now be divided into four main groups instead of the five groups that we have been working with up to now , ” says Kamran Shalchian - Tabrizi , an associate professor from the University of Oslo ’s Department of Biology who has also worked with the Department of Zoology and Animal Biology and the Department of Genetic Medicine and Development , at the University of Geneva , Switzerland .
Eukaryotes are organisms with one or more cells that are characterised by cell components that do not appear in prokaryotes ( bacteria and Archaea ) .
The most important eukaryote cell components are the nucleus , membrane structures such as the endoplasmatic reticulum and golgi apparatus , cell walls , mitochondria and chloroplasts .
( source : Shalchian - Tabrizi )
The research group has found that brown algae and silica algae , and groups of single cell organisms like the malaria parasite , marine foraminifera , and the green sun animalcule ( acanthocystis turfacea ) actually belong to the same group .
Previously , these species were thought to be completely unrelated .
“ Kinship says a lot about shared traits .
Our findings can be important in many fields , such as in the study of the development of life and in the manufacture of new medicines ” says Shalchian - Tabrizi in an interview with the University of Oslo ’s research magazine Apollon .
“ Our knowledge of organisms and the development of medicines are often based on comparative studies across species .
It is , therefore , essential that we know the relationships between the largest groups in the great diversity of eukaryotes , ” he adds .
The New Branch
All life on Earth can be divided into two essentially different life forms — eukaryotes and prokaryotes .
The eukaryotes gather their genetic material in a nucleus , while the prokaryotes ( bacteria and archaea ) have their genetic material floating freely in the cell .
Eukaryotic organisms — such as humans — can , as a result of the new findings , be divided into the following four categories :
Plants ( green and red algae , and plants )
Opisthokonts ( amoebas , fungi , and all animals — including humans )
Excavates ( free - living organisms and parasites )
SAR ( the new main group , an abbreviation of Stramenophiles , Alveolates , and Rhizaria , the names of some of its members )
“ The SAR group has to some extent been identified earlier , but we could not know if it was a correct observation because we lacked statistical data .
To get that data , we first had to reconstruct the entire eukaryote tree with the help of these 123 genes .
Chromalveolates and rhizaria were clearly separate groups until we published our results , ” says Shalchian - Tabrizi .
“ To make the picture a little less clear , one branch of chromalveolates is still in no man ’s land .
It may be that these also belong to SAR , but we will require additional genes and genomes to study this .
We have set our sights on doing that in the course of the next few years , ” he adds .
Evolutionary biologists Marianne Minge , Kamran Shalchian - Tabrizi , and Kjetill S. Jakobsen ( at right ) , and bioinformatician Åsmund Skjæveland ( at left ) from the University of Oslo ’s Department of Biology have helped to reorganise the Tree of Life .
They are pictured here with a Ginkgo biloba tree — one of the first true seed plants in existence .
The Ginkgo biloba appeared approximately 270 million years ago and has almost not changed at all .
The newly defined SAR group is much older .

“ The Tree of Life tells the story of life on Earth , and our research can say something about how quickly life developed .
Our discovery suggests that there were fewer big “ events ” than we have previously assumed in the development of higher life forms .
The more we know about the branches on the Tree of Life , the more we can find out about life ’s Big Bang , the beginning of life on Earth , ” says Shalchian - Tabrizi .
Three billion years ago , there was only bacteria and Archaea .
Eukaryotic life , which comprises all multi-celled organisms , developed in the sea — probably between 1.2 and 1.6 billion years ago .
It was not before about 500 million years ago that the first creatures crept onto land .
“ By digging down into the historical layers with the help of phylogenetic reconstruction , where we can find out about kinship between organisms at the genetic level and we can find answers to questions about how new traits developed .
We are working , in a matter of speaking , with genetic archaeology .
In this manner , we can also discover the cause of the Earth ’s biological diversity , ” says Jakobsen .

Warner Music has bent beneath the force of the anti-DRM winds sweeping the globe .
The label will now offer its complete catalog , DRM - free , through Amazon 's new MP3 store .
The announcement means that EMI , Universal , and Warner now offer their catalogs in DRM - free digital formats , making Sony BMG ( of rootkit fame ) the lone holdout among the majors .
Amazon now claims to offer for than 2.9 million songs in MP3 format from over 33,000 unique labels .
Warner 's announcement says nothing about offering its content through other services such as iTunes , and represents the music industry 's attempt to make life a bit more difficult for Apple after all the years in which the company held the keys to music 's digital kingdom ; no one could sell major label tracks to iPod owners except for iTunes , and iTunes even become a go - to destination for non-iPod owners who wanted a simple , cheap way to pick up some songs .
Now , with the move to MP3 , the labels that have chosen to open their music have a way to encourage multiple download services to flourish , keeping labels safe from being dominated by any single digital distributor .
The move comes just before Amazon plans to give away one billion tracks , a promotion that will begin with the Super Bowl in January , and Warner was no doubt interested in jumping on board the promo train before it left the station .
Will Sony BMG , which has apparently never met a form of copy protection that it does n't like , follow suit ?
The " Mene , mene ... " is already on the wall , and it looks likely that Sony BMG will go DRM - free , too , by the end of 2008 .
The entire movement to free music from DRM 's shackles has had stunning success in 2007 after years in which such widespread moves to MP3 looked impossible .

Katie and Gemma had all their own clothes taken away
The Bray family
Gemma Bray , 15 , and her 13 - year - old sister Katie also had their clothes taken off them and were asked if they had been abused or were suicidal .
Their mother Yvonne Bray of Appledore , Devon , says their human rights were infringed by the authorities .
She was hospitalised with pneumonia during a trip to New York .
The Administration for Children 's Services in New York has declined to comment on the matter .
I 'm not guilty of anything other than getting ill in a country without family or friends
Yvonne Bray
" What should have been the trip of a lifetime turned out to be a complete disaster from start to finish , " Ms Bray told BBC News .
" I was going to give the girls money for their Christmas , but with the exchange rate being so good , I decided to book the trip to New York .
" This was their Christmas present and it was totally ruined . "
The family flew out to New York on 27 December .
When Ms Bray began coughing later that day , she initially put it down to her asthma and the air conditioning on the flight .
The following night , she became more unwell with laboured breathing and was admitted to the Queen 's Medical Centre in Harlem .
Yvonne Bray said she had now received a letter from social workers
But Ms Bray was told her daughters could not stay with her at the hospital as they were minors .
" A doctor told me they would make the arrangements , then a few hours later a social worker arrived and said they'd try to find a foster family for the girls , " she said .
" Instead of that they were taken to a orphanage and subjected to the kind of treatment you would n't even expect criminals to go through . "
The frightened teenagers had their clothes , including their underwear , removed and were issued with a uniform of T - shirt and jeans before being spilt up and given a medical examination .
" Being away from Mum when you are alone in New York in an strange place with people you do n't know - it 's just scary , " said Katie .
You did n't know how long you'd be there or if Mum would get better
Katie Bray
" At first it was so shocking - it was as if it was n't happening but then it hits you .
" You did n't know how long you 'd be there or if Mum would get better . "
Photographs were taken and the girls were told they would not be allowed to visit their mother in hospital .
When the duty social worker told Ms Bray her daughters could not leave the orphanage , she discharged herself from the hospital against medical advice .
She said : " I was so cross .
I did n't sign anything saying they could be examined or interrogated - they even asked them if they had been raped .
" They had to shower in front of strangers .
What they went through would be a breach of anyone 's human rights , let alone two girls on holiday . "
' It 's disgraceful '
Ms Bray has now received a letter from the Administration for Children 's Services ( ACS ) to say she is now being investigated .
" It 's disgraceful , but I 'm trying to totally dismiss this , " Ms Bray said .
" It seems like a standard letter because the children have been entered into the child care system .
" I 'm not guilty of anything other than getting ill in a country without family or friends . "
A spokeswoman from ACS told BBC News it was an " entirely confidential matter " and the department would not comment .

In his autobiography former Randian Alan Greenspan says he has , " always harbored a nostalgia for the gold standard 's inherent price stability - - a stable currency was its primary goal . "
A stable currency implies that its purchasing power would remain the same .
But under a gold standard , there would be a trend for prices to fall as production and innovation would not be set off by increases in the money supply ( or very minor increases ) .
If this fact was explained to the American people , maybe they would not " have tolerated the inflation bias as an acceptable cost of the modern welfare state . "
If Greenspan went before the American people to explain that , " there is no inherent anchor in a fiat - money regime , " maybe there would be a change of opinion .
People are done with the " wisdom " of the policymakers .
They want to return to the Constitution where power is decentralized in the market among individuals .
Greenspan says , " There is no support for the gold standard today and I see no likelihood of its return . "
But he does predict , " We could ... see a return of populist , anti-Fed rhetoric , which has lain dormant since 1991 . "
Contradictions do not exist .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters Life ! ) -
The price was all wrong for one contestant on “ The Price Is Right ” who claims the TV game show and its authorized auto dealership tried to pass off a rehabilitated wreck as a new car she won .
Donna Tillman said she won the 2004 Pontiac GTO Coupe during her June 28 , 2004 , appearance on the game show .
But she was told after she paid the taxes and license fees that the vehicle that appeared on the stage had mechanical problems , according to a lawsuit filed on Thursday in Los Angeles .
When the car was delivered about eight weeks later , it was not the model that had been displayed on the show and it had more miles on the odometer than the car she had been promised .
Several months later when Tillman took her prize for a service at a dealership in her hometown of Puyallup , Washington , she learned the car had major damage to its frame that had been repaired and concealed , the lawsuit said .
A spokeswoman for “ The Price Is Right ” had no immediate comment .
No one from the Pontiac dealership could be reached for comment .
“ The Price is Right , ” which airs on the CBS television network , is one of the longest - running game shows on U.S. television .
Contestants win prizes by guessing the cost of consumer goods .
1 Venezuela ’s Everlasting Storm
The mysterious “ Relámpago del Catatumbo ” ( Catatumbo lightning ) is a unique natural phenomenon in the world .
Located on the mouth of the Catatumbo river at Lake Maracaibo ( Venezuela ) , the phenomenon is a cloud - to - cloud lightning that forms a voltage arc more than five kilometre high during 140 to 160 nights a year , 10 hours a night , and as many as 280 times an hour .
This almost permanent storm occurs over the marshlands where the Catatumbo River feeds into Lake Maracaibo and it is considered the greatest single generator of ozone in the planet , judging from the intensity of the cloud - to - cloud discharge and great frequency .
The area sees an estimated 1,176,000 electrical discharges per year , with an intensity of up to 400,000 amperes , and visible up to 400 km away .
This is the reason why the storm is also known as the Maracaibo Beacon as light has been used for navigation by ships for ages .
The collision with the winds coming from the Andes Mountains causes the storms and associated lightning , a result of electrical discharges through ionised gases , specifically the methane created by the decomposition of organic matter in the marshes .
Being lighter than air , the gas rises up to the clouds , feeding the storms .
Some local environmentalists hope to put the area under the protection of UNESCO , as it is an exceptional phenomenon , the greatest source of its type for regenerating the planet ’s ozone layer .
2 Honduras ’ Rain of Fishes
3 Morocco ’s Climbing Goats
The Rain of Fish is common in Honduran Folklore .
It occurs in the Departamento de Yoro , between the months of May and July .
Witnesses of this phenomenon state that it begins with a dark cloud in the sky followed by lightning , thunder , strong winds and heavy rain for 2 to 3 hours .
Once the rain has stopped , hundreds of living fish are found on the ground .
People take the fish home to cook and eat them .
Since 1998 a festival known as “ Festival de la Lluvia de Peces ” ( Rain of Fish Festival ) is celebrated every year in the city of Yoro , Departamento de Yoro , Honduras .
Goats on trees are found mostly only in Morocco .
The goats climb them because they like to eat the fruit of the argan tree , which is similar to an olive .
Farmers actually follow the herds of goats as they move from tree to tree .
Not because it is so strange to see goats in trees and the farmers like to point and stare , but because the fruit of the tree has a nut inside , which the goats ca n’t digest , so they spit it up or excrete it which the farmers collect .
The nut contains 1 - 3 kernels , which can be ground to make argan oil used in cooking and cosmetics .
This oil has been collected by the people of the region for hundreds of years , but like many wild and useful things these days , the argan tree is slowly disappearing due to over - harvesting for the tree ’s wood and overgrazing by goats .
As a result a group of people and organizations have banded together to try to save the tree .
To do so one of the primary locations where the trees grow has been declared a biosphere preserve .
It was also decided that by making the world aware of the oil , it ’s great taste and supposed anti-aging properties , would create a demand for it .
However , the people who planned to market the oil could not envision people wanting to put an oil on their food or their face that was collected from goat excrement .
As a result , a campaign is being led to ban grazing on the trees by goats during certain parts of the year to allow the fruit to ripen and fall off on its own .
The fruit is then collected and turned into oil by oil cooperatives .
So far , this arrangement seems to be working .
4 Kerala ’s ( extraterrestrial ? )
Red Rain
From 25 July to 23 September 2001 , red rain sporadically fell on the southern Indian state of Kerala .
Heavy downpours occurred in which the rain was coloured red , staining clothes with an appearance similar to that of blood .
Yellow , green , and black rain was also reported .
It was initially suspected that the rains were coloured by fallout from a hypothetical meteor burst , but a study commissioned by the Government of India found that the rains had been coloured by airborne spores from a locally prolific terrestrial alga .
Then in early 2006 , the coloured rains of Kerala suddenly rose to worldwide attention after media reports of a conjecture that the coloured particles were extraterrestrial cells , proposed by Godfrey Louis and Santhosh Kumar of the Mahatma Gandhi University in Kottayam .
The terrestrial origins of the solid material in the red rain were supported by an investigation into the isotopic ratios of nitrogen and carbon .
5 Brazilian ’s longest wave on the Earth
Twice a year , between the months of February and March , the Atlantic Ocean waters roll up the Amazon river , in Brazil , generating the longest wave on the Earth .
The phenomenon , known as the Pororoca , is caused by the tides of the Atlantic Ocean wich meet the mouth of the river .
This tidal bore generates waves up to 12 feet high which can last for over half an hour .
The name “ Pororoca ” comes from the indigenous Tupi language , where it translates into “ great destructive noise ” .
The wave can be heard about 30 minutes before its arrival , and it ’s so powerful that it can destroy anything , including trees , local houses and all kind of animals .
The wave has become popular with surfers .
Since 1999 , an annual championship has been held in São Domingos do Capim .
However , surfing the Pororoca is especially dangerous , as the water contains a significant amount of debris from the margins of the river ( often , entire trees ) .
The record that we could find for surfing the longest distance on the Pororoca was set by Picuruta Salazar , a brazilian surfer who , in 2003 , managed to ride the wave for 37 minutes and travel 12.5 kilometers .
A surfer ’s dream : riding an almost never - ending wave .
6 Denmark ’s Black Sun
During spring in Denmark , at approximately one half an hour before sunset , flocks of more than a million European starlings ( sturnus vulgaris ) gather from all corners to join in the incredible formations shown above .
This phenomenon is called Black Sun ( in Denmark ) , and can be witnessed in early spring throughout the marshlands of western Denmark , from March through to the middle of April .
The starlings migrate from the south and spend the day in the meadows gathering food , sleeping in the reeds during the night .
7 Idaho ’s Fire Rainbow
The atmospheric phenomenon known as a circumhorizon ( tal ) arc , or “ Fire rainbow ” , appears when the sun is high in the sky ( i.e. , higher than 58° above the horizon ) , and its light passes through diaphanous , high - altitude cirrus clouds made up of hexagonal plate crystals .
Sunlight entering the crystals ’ vertical side faces and leaving through their bottom faces is refracted ( as through a prism ) and separated into an array of visible colors .
When the plate crystals in cirrus clouds are aligned optimally ( i.e. , with their faces parallel to the ground ) , the resulting display is a brilliant spectrum of colors reminiscent of a rainbow .
The example shown above was captured on camera as it hung for about an hour across a several - hundred square mile area of sky above northern Idaho ( near the Washington border ) on 3 June 2006 .

ARTICLE UPDATE ( 1-18-08 ) :
Please be sure to check out page three for the exciting conclusion to this article !
It 's been two weeks now , and Network Solutions still has no idea how somebody managed to breach their security system and hijack our domain .
As a scant few of you might have noticed , Something Awful was hijacked and redirected to another IP on Wednesday , January 2nd .
Internet users who failed to receive the memo informing them our site stopped being funny two years before it was created were redirected en masse to a completely different website , essentially serving as a DDoS attack .
Let me try to explain this crap to you average human beings out there :
Non-technical analogy for normal people : A bunch of drunk criminals are heading to a big silly foreign person soccer game .
They pile into countless ramshackle buses and Mad Max-ian flatbed trucks lumbering down the one single road leading to the stadium .
Unfortunately , a dastardly trickster placed a fake street barricade ahead of them , redirecting all traffic directly to your nearby lonely grandmother 's house .
Grandma peeks through her doily - enhanced window and suffers a heart attack upon noticing the incoming influx of rowdy , angry people , all of which are specifically not her grandson who never calls .
More and more violent , confused weirdos show up with each passing second .
Grandma 's house soon collapses ; it was not designed to withstand so many horrible people .
30 minutes later and grandma is dead .
Congratulations internet , you killed grandma .
Our domain name hijacking was apparently part of some ridiculous ongoing feud between bitter rival IRC channels or something equally asinine and completely unrelated to our site .
My brain grows kind of hazy when pondering anything remotely related to " internet drama , " so I really do n't have a clue about what group of social deviants hates what group of slightly different social deviants .
Internet drama tends to lose its amazingly addictive appeal once you get married , have a kid , and discover real - life activities that do n't revolve around perpetually asking obese white people for ops .
Let 's just close this issue by saying I finally discovered a group of folks whose lives would significantly improve if they became addicted to World of Warcraft .
Oh man I hate that Whammy guy !
Regardless , some group of IRC trolls was mad at some other group of IRC trolls , so they decided to overload their website using a Network Solutions exploit , one which unfortunately involved Something Awful .
Here 's a consolidated timeline of these exciting events .
Feel free to read along and pretend you 're Kiefer Sutherland trying to protect the president from seeing the internet .
January 2nd , 1:15 PM - My coworker Kevin " Fragmaster " Bowen helpfully notices our website ( www.somethingawful.com for those of you who ran out of Ritalin ) is pointing to the Network Solutions domain placeholder page .
After some consideration , we both agreed such a change contradicts our site 's slogan , " Something Awful : not just another Network Solutions domain placeholder page . "
1:18 PM - I call up Network Solutions ' " Gold VIP Member " tech support , which is exactly like Network Solutions ' non-Gold VIP member tech support except the people answering the phones hate you slightly less .
I ask them to please cancel our recent , unauthorized nameserver change , additionally inquiring as to who requested the initial redirect .
" Hmmm , I do n't know , " replied the Network Solutions Gold VIP Tech Support employee .
" It was n't you ? "
I 'm not sure there 's enough sarcasm in the world to properly address such a question in this scenario .
1:21 PM - I log on to my Network Solutions account , update both my username and password to randomly generated , 28 - character hexadecimal entries , replacing my security question with something nonsensical and impossible to guess .
Since I have no idea where this security breach originated , I am forced to assume everything has been compromised ; we begin locking servers down as tightly and securely as possible .
1:26 PM - Despite generating a new password , username , and security question , somebody manages to change our nameservers yet again .
I successfully log in to my Network Solutions account using the new username and password , just to ensure my security changes went through .
At this point , I was able to rule out a few possible security holes .
The hijacker could n't have possibly brute force cracked my username and password , two 28 - character hex blocks of random garbage , in less than 10 minutes .
I was running a fresh install of Vista less than two hours old ( firewalled , anti-virus software , behind a blocked off router on a secure network ) , so my PC was n't infected with any type of trojan or malware .
Since nothing local could be compromised , I suspected somebody had gained access to our email address associated with Network Solutions , and were possibly obtaining our login information through lost username / password requests .
This theory was debunked after searching through the mail server 's logs , which did n't contain any recent messages from Network Solutions .
Social engineering was additionally ruled out , as the possibility of some person duping Network Solutions ' tech support twice in half an hour seemed somewhat unbelievable .
Ann Tucker is pushing a shopping cart through the produce section of a supermarket in Plainview , N.Y. , when she turns to kiss her husband .
The supermarket kiss is a regular ritual for the Tuckers .
So are the restaurant kiss and the traffic - light kiss .
" I guess we do kiss a lot , " says Mrs. Tucker , a 39 - year - old mathematician at a money - management firm .
Mrs. Tucker is living happily ever after , and scientists are curious why .
She belongs to a small class of men and women who say they live in the thrall of early love despite ...
Last week , I was sitting in a hotel bar in Jerusalem when a fellow passenger on my tour told me there was a guy with us selling a supposedly less - lethal weapon .
" It works with sound frequencies , " he said .
" It 'll make you a sick . "
A puke ray ?
An honest - to - God puke ray ?
Right here in Jerusalem ?
Well , more like a sonic blaster .
Dr. Maurice Goldman , a retired dentist , is the U.S. managing director for Inferno , a line of products that markets itself as a " sound barrier . "
The primary effect of the device , which sounds like a loud siren , is to force people to leave the protected area , he says .
However , if the intruder does n't leave immediately , Inferno's effects include " vertigo , nausea , and pain in the chest . "
The unit is made in Sweden , but Dr. Goldman has already sold a couple units to U.S. Special Operations Command , and he 's hoping soon to close a contract with the U.S. State Department , which would use the device in embassies .
He also offered to let me try it out .
My old rule was : never volunteer to to be a test subject for a less - lethal weapon ( or a lethal one for that matter ) .
Life is short enough as it is , and my hearing and vision are important to me .
But since breaking that rule over the summer with the " pain ray , " the Pentagon 's Active Denial System , I thought , well , why not ?
Two days later , we sat in a hotel office , with Dr. Goldman ( pictured above ) , holding the device .
The version of Inferno he was demonstrating looked a bit like a long , slim speaker .
You can't take a pair of nail scissors on a plane these days , but Dr. Goldman has traveled around the world with Inferno and has had few , if any problems , boarding aircraft .
First , I dispatched Nathan , my husband , out of the room , using the logic that if it really did make us sick , one of us should be spared .
Then I realized I needed pictures , so I called him back in , and without warning , Goldman turned the Inferno on .
I 'm not sure words can do justice to what can only be described as the most unbearable , gut - wrenching noise I 've ever heard in my life .
I screamed a few expletives , Nathan almost dropped the camera , and Dr. Goldman turned it off .
Here 's how it works : Inferno uses four frequencies spread out over 2 to 5 kHz .
The idea behind it is that unlike a regular siren , these particular frequencies have a uniquely disturbing effect on people ( and presumably cats , dogs and any other living thing ) .
At 123 dB , it 's loud , but not significantly louder than any other alarm system .
The advantage , according to Dr. Goldman , is the combination of frequencies .
The human ear just does n't like it .
I agree , I really did n't like it .
How did I feel after the impromptu test ?
Nauseous , dizzy , or in pain ?
Hard to say , but Nathan looked pretty unhappy with me for the next hour or so .
In fact , he still grumbles a bit when I mention his unwitting recruitment as a camera man / guinea pig .
Love hurts .
Summary verdict : Being a guinea pig for a sonic ray was truly a whole lot worse than being a guinea pig for the pain ray .
I would happily volunteer again to be hit by the Pentagon 's pain ray .
It was fun , like being Bugs Bunny dancing around when Elmer Fudd tries to shoot him .
I never , ever again want to be hit by the Inferno .
But here 's the question : what does a really unbearable sound do to a person ?
The Active Denial System appears to effectively prompt people to get out of its way .
The Long Range Acoustic Device , a hailer , was famously used to thwart a pirate attack .
But there is considerable debate over whether LRAD , when used as something other than as a warning device , is more effective than any other loud speaker .
In other words , will the Inferno work better than just a loud noise ?
For example , when I 've accidentally set off my ADT alarm at home , it 's pretty damn annoying , and according to web references , it 's 120 dB .
Inferno counts on the unique frequency spread to make it work better , but what does better mean ?
Does that mean a criminal / terrorist / insurgent will stop what they 're doing ?
The trick with acoustic weapons is demonstrating that there is a unique , deterrent effect on humans .
Penn State 's Applied Research Laboratory , as we 've written here earlier , is planning to test at ranges of about 130 dB to see if sound can have a deterrent effect .
It would be interesting , in my view , to test whether louder is better , or whether , as Dr. Goldman says , that the frequency combination is better .
The problem in all these areas is the lack of test data .
Dr. Goldman notes that the only human tests on Inferno were done informally with workers in South Africa ( the workers , who were promised money for sitting through an Inferno blast , did n't last more than a few seconds , he says ) .
Will Inferno be the next sonic blaster ?
Dr. Goldman knows it 's an uphill battle to break into the security market , but he 's confident that Inferno could be used for everything from alarms systems and prison riot control , to law enforcement and personal protection .
Other applications , like maritime self - defense , are also possible .
" Right now , I 'm having fun , " he says .
Update :
In answer to a few of the comments below , yes , earplugs , or any other hearing protection device would mitigate the effects of Inferno .
In my case , just covering my years with my hands helped a lot .
ALSO :
Over the past week , some servers used for updating the anti-virus software NOD32 were labeled as anti-p2p by a popular list maker for PeerGuardian .
In response , NOD32's company , ESET , has categorised PG2 as malware in some of its latest updates .
It started off with Bluetack adding some IP addresses to its “ Level 1 blocklist ” that belonged to ESET ( NOD32 ) update servers .
“ Level 1 ” is the term that Bluetack use for their lists containing ( according to site admin ‘ monk ’ ) :
Companies ( Or organizations .
I wo n’t repeat orgs .
over and over ) who are clearly involved with trying to stop filesharing .
Companies which anti-p2p activity has been seen from .
Companies that produce or have a stong financial interest in copyrighted material .
Government ranges or companies that have a strong financial interest in doing work for governments .
Legal industry ranges .
IPs or ranges of ISPs from which anti-p2p activity has been observed .
The IP addresses added were 89.202.149.32 to 89.202.149.63 , 89.202.157.88 to 89.202.157.95 and 89.202.157.128 to 89.202.157.159 , according to this forum post on the NOD32 support forum .
These blocked IP ranges contain many of the servers used to provide anti-virus signatures for NOD32 .
These were added to the blocklist for alleged anti-p2p activities .
However , what kind of anti-p2p activity was taking place is unclear .
Bluetack administrator ‘ m00re ’ told TorrentFreak that the IPs were added because “ someone noticed them on a torrent ” .
‘ m0nk ’ , another administrator later told TorrentFreak that he noticed an IP belonging to ESET on a private tracker ’s movie torrent that he was on .
“ It was only 1 IP , but since they ’re a commercial software company with a strong financial interest in copyrighted material , they go on level 1 regardless ” .
However , ESET did n’t take too kindly to this disruption of its business .
A representative from ESET tried to contact Bluetack , to see about the removal from the list .
He later posted a screenshot of the discussion to the ESET support forum .
This was the same kind of attitude experienced by Ludvig Strigeus almost exactly two years ago , after utorrent.com was added to the Bluetack lists .
Similarly by the Opentracker people , and the German Chaos Computer Club .
Based on the feedback from Bluetack , ESET added PeerGuardian to their anti-virus updates .
Two signatures called Win32 / PeerGuardian were added in update number 2894 on the 21st of Feb , with another 5 added in update number 2895 the following day .
These updates identify the PeerGuardian application as malware , and offer the user the ability to deal with the ‘ infection ’ .
Those that do , have been unable to use PeerGuardian afterwards .
Phoenixlabs , which makes PeerGuardian , put out this statement in response .
Their representatives would not comment further on the subject , referring only to the statement .
Bluetack , on the other hand , have been very vocal about it .
‘ m00re ’ said “ whomever the person / persons are that made the flawed decision to maliciously target a non threatening application like PG2 is clearly a moron . ” whilst ‘ firstaid ’ suggested that “ people call them and have them stop having their product remove PG2 from their systems . ”
ESET defended the addition , “ By blocking update and threatsense servers detection of PeerGuardian as potentially unwanted application is fully justified as it could disrupt normal operation of NOD32 and or ESS . ”
However , ESET has now changed it ’s mind , saying “ We have reconsidered detection of PeerGuardian and it will be removed in the upcoming update .
However , we will actively continue protecting our users from blacklists that contain the IP addresses ( ranges ) of our update servers and thus preventing our paying or trial users receiving updates and keeping their computers protected . ”

The bible teaches a lot about " good " and " evil " but if God is the ultimate creator , is n't he responsible for evil ?
Perhaps evil is part of God 's plan ?
Or maybe he is simply evil himself ?
Let 's see what scripture says ...
God is responsible for " Evil "
Isaiah 45:7
" I form the light and the darkness , I make peace and create EVIL : I the Lord do all these things . "
Deuteronomy 30:15
God says
" See , I have set before thee this day life and good , and DEATH and EVIL . "
Amos 3:6 " Shall a trumpet be blown in the city , and the people not be afraid ?
shall there be EVIL in a city , and the LORD hath not done it ? "
Jeremiah 18:11
" Thus saith the Lord ; Behold , I frame EVIL against you , and devise a device against you . "
These verses affirm that God himself is the creator of evil and disasters .
The Hebrew word used here for evil could also mean " wickedness " , " hurt " , " affliction " or " adversity " .
Not only is he the creator of evil , but he does it too
Objection : The Hebrew word used here for evil is " ra " , however " ra " can also mean " calamity "
Response # 1 : Even if that 's what it really meant :
The event of the 1931 Yellow River flood in China killed at least a million people , the event 1556 Shaanxi earthquake killed about 800 thousand people , and the Bhola cyclone killed an estimate of 500 thousand people .
Is God admitting he made these horrors ?.
Notice that Isaiah 45:7 speaks in the PRESENT tense , this means that God is still making natural disasters
Response # 2 : Deuteronomy 30:15
God says
" See , I have set before thee this day life and good , and DEATH and EVIL . "
This paraphrases Isaiah 45:7 , which says God created bad things such as " Darkness " and " Evil " along with good things such as " Light " and " peace " .
It 's quite clearly that God is the creator of all things as Isaiah 45:7 says , whether it 's good or evil .
In fact even Satan himself could n't hurt Job and asked permission from God to do so ; God even told him how far he could go .
Does this sound like Satan is the creator of evil , or is he merely an agent of God ? , Deuteronomy 30:15 even says God himself made Death rather that it came by man .
The word " Death " here can also be used to mean natural / violent death and destruction .
For example , Job 2:3
God says he was moved against Job , to destroy him WITHOUT A CAUSE .
This shows that God has the ability to do evil
Response # 3 : what is the real meaning of " ra " ?
Genesis 2:9
" And out of the ground the Lord God caused to grow ... the tree of the knowledge of good and evil "
Here , the word translated as the opposite of good is " ra , " the exact word used in the exact word used in Isaiah 45:7 .
Genesis 3:22
... knowing good and evil ... one of the ways in which someone becomes like God is by knowing good and evil - - again , " ra . "
According to Genesis , God knew good and evil .
He created a tree that was able to convey a knowledge of good and evil unto others .
This seems to attribute to God a creative role in bringing evil unto the world .
When Moses received religious rituals from God , he suddenly tells Moses that the Hebrews are worshiping a golden calf .
He was , after all , omniscient and his response was : Exodus 32:10 " So now , let me be , that my anger may burn against the Hebrews and i may destroy them . "
Moses immediately tries to get God to relax exodus 32:11 " then Moses entreated the lord his god "
One excellent translation of this verse is " the five books of moses " by Everett Fox which states
exodus 32:11 " Moses soothed the face of yahweh his God ... "
exodus 32:12 " turn away from your flaming anger , be sorry for the evil you intended against your people "
exodus 32:14 " and yahweh let himself be sorry concerning the evil that he had spoken of doing to his people "
In this dialog , there is no doubt that God can do evil even against his own people .
Christians are just putting the theological cart before the translation horse when looking at Isaiah 45:7 .
The Bible repeatedly confirms what Isaiah 45:7 .
" Acts of God "
The Bible teaches without a doubt that all natural disasters are either caused or allowed by God .
- Matthew 10:29 -31 :
" Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin ?
And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father 's will .
But the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
Do not fear therefore ; you are of more value than many sparrows . "
Bad things perpetrated by God as documented in the Bible
Mark
Twain once said , " It ai n't the parts of the Bible that I can't understand that bother me , it is the parts that I do understand . "
In Genesis 38:7 - 10 , we read : “ Er , Judah 's firstborn , was wicked in the LORD 's sight ; so the LORD put him to death . ”
One could laugh easily at this , killing a firstborn just like that is n't what we would expect from God who was ready to forgive everybody 's sin
In Genesis 6 - 8
God drowns everyone , except for Noah and his family .
An estimated 200 million civilians die .
If he saw them as evil then why did he create these people with the knowledge that they would turn out to be that way ? , after all he is omniscient .
And why would God drown the entire population of the world when a much less sadistic method exist such as simply snapping his fingers and vanished them instantly , after all , he is omnipotent .
Millions of firstborns , animals , and little children who did n't even learn how to walk have been killed by God , why kill cute little rabbits and babies ? , Could a just God destroy innocent life ?
Sadistic God
God seems to do a lot of things just to be really mean and sadistic .
If you are God and you 're omnipotent , why torture people physically and emotionally when you can just change things to the way they should be in the blink of an eye ?
Unless you like to watch people suffer ...
Abraham & Isaac : Torture your child for God
The one story most Christians know is the story of Abraham and Isaac , where God ordered Abraham to kill his son , Isaac , and present him as a " Burnt Offering . "
Abraham ties Isaac to a wooden alter ( as instructed ) and , knife in hand , gets ready to kill his son .
Then , an angel stops him just in time and God let 's him kill a ram instead .
This story is n't about love or loyalty ; it 's about fear as in verse 12 the angel says , " now I know that thou fearest God . "
So how many " Christians " would murder their child if God told them to ?
And what God would be worthy of respect that would ask for such a thing ?
- Genesis 22:1-2,6,9,10-12 :
22:1
And it came to pass after these things , that God did tempt Abraham , and said unto him , Abraham : and he said , Behold , here I am .
22:2
And he said , Take now thy son , thine only son Isaac , whom thou lovest , and get thee into the land of Moriah ; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of .
22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering , and laid it upon Isaac his son ; and he took the fire in his hand , and a knife ; and they went both of them together .
22:9
And they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Abraham built an altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand , and took the knife to slay his son .
22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven , and said , Abraham , Abraham : and he said , Here am I . 22:12
And he said , Lay not thine hand upon the lad , neither do thou any thing unto him : for now I know that thou fearest God , seeing thou hast not withheld thy son , thine only son from me .
Christians have cited numerous bible references to justify various types of conquest and control over others .
If you " resisteth " God 's messengers , you get what you deserve :
- Romans 13:2 :
" Whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God : and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation . "
Ask God and he 'll give you whatever you want from the " heathens " - God says it 's your inheritance :
- Psalms 2:8 :
" Ask of me , and I shall give thee , the heathen for thine inheritance , and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession . "
God mandates the invasion and takeover of foreign lands and says in no uncertain terms , there shall be no peace , no compromise , and no mercy .
You must destroy these people " totally " and take all that they have .
- Deuteronomy 7:1-2 :
When the LORD your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nations — the Hittites , Girgashites , Amorites , Canaanites , Perizzites , Hivites and Jebusites , seven nations larger and stronger than you - 2 and when the LORD your God has delivered them over to you and you have defeated them , then you must destroy them totally . [ a ]
Make no treaty with them , and show them no mercy .
On second thought , offer " peace " but really what you offer is slavery or death .
Take the women , children , lifestock and anything else in the city as plunder for yourselves .
This is what the " lord " gives you .
- Deuternomy 20:10 - 17 :
When you march up to attack a city , make its people an offer of peace .
If they accept and open their gates , all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you .
If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle , lay siege to that city .
When the LORD your God delivers it into your hand , put to the sword all the men in it .
As for the women , the children , the livestock and everything else in the city , you may take these as plunder for yourselves .
And you may use the plunder the LORD your God gives you from your enemies .
This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby .
However , in the cities of the nations the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance , do not leave alive anything that breathes .
Completely destroy [ a ] them — the Hittites , Amorites , Canaanites , Perizzites , Hivites and Jebusites — as the LORD your God has commanded you .
NIV
God the torturer
Dismemberment , pestilence , cannibalism ... nothing is too vile for the Lord to perpetrate upon others
- Jerimiah :
11:11 Therefore thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will bring evil upon them , which they shall not be able to escape ; and though they shall cry unto me , I will not hearken unto them .
11:14 Therefore pray not thou for this people , neither lift up a cry or prayer for them : for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble .
15:3 And I will appoint over them four kinds , saith the LORD : the sword to slay , and the dogs to tear , and the fowls of the heaven , and the beasts of the earth , to devour and destroy .
15:14 And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not : for a fire is kindled in mine anger , which shall burn upon you .
19:3
And say , Hear ye the word of the LORD , O kings of Judah , and inhabitants of Jerusalem ;
Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will bring evil upon this place , the which whosoever heareth , his ears shall tingle .
19:7
And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place ; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies , and by the hands of them that seek their lives : and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven , and for the beasts of the earth .
19:9
And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters , and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness , wherewith their enemies , and they that seek their lives , shall straiten them .
21:6
And I will smite the inhabitants of this city , both man and beast : they shall die of a great pestilence .
51:20
Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war : for with thee will I break in pieces the nations , and with thee will I destroy kingdoms ; 51:21 And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider ; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider ; 51:22 With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman ; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young ; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid ; 51:23 I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock ; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen ; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers .
Jesus will return and anyone who offends him will be burned alive
- Matthew 13:41 - 42 :
The Son of man shall send forth his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend , and them which do iniquity ;
And shall cast them into a furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
More Bible evils yet to be organized
God entraps humans by placing the tree of knowledge in the garden and telling Adam and Eve not to eat of it .
This is rather similar to placing a toy in front of a child and telling them they are not allowed to play with it .
God created us with instinct , rebellion , and curiosity .
Soon he punishes us for only doing what is part of our nature .
Genesis 2:16.47
God now commands that all women must have health hazardous labors for Eve ate the fruit .
In no way shape or form is it just that I must pay for the sins of my ancestors .
Genesis 3:16
God caused sibling rivalry by favoring Abel over Cain , with absolutely no attempt at justification .
This act of favoritism led to Abel ’s death .
Genesis 4:3-5
Genesis 7:23
He killed , intentionally , every man , woman , and child on the planet save eight of them .
God commands
Hagar go back into servanthood and bear children for her master though she does not want to .
Genesis 16:7-9
Genesis 19:23 - 25
God burns down a whole city ( women and children included ) simply because they were supposedly homosexual .
Er , Judah ’s firstborn , was wicked in the sight of the Lord ; and that the Lord slew him .
How was Er wicked ?
The Bible does n’t give us this bit of information , only that Er was wicked in the sight of the Lord .
Genesis 38:7
Genesis 38:10 God murders
Onan for refusing to commit incest with his sister in law .
Exodus 12:29
God repeatedly tells
Moses exactly what calamity he will next visit upon the Egyptians if the Pharaoh does not allow the Israelites to be set free from slavery .
Then he tells Moses ( also repeatedly ) that he will harden Pharaoh ’s heart , so that he will refuse to allow the Israelites to go , thus bringing a calamity upon his own people , as well as showing him the awesome power of the Israelites ’ Lord .
This occurs over and over , bringing calamity upon calamity upon the Egyptian people .
What is troubling about this verse is that when god “ hardens the pharaoh ’s heart ” he is interfering with the Pharaoh ’s free will and ultimately bringing punishment on the Egyptians for something they are not responsible for .
As a final punishment god decides to kill all the first born of Egypt .
The lord reduced himself to murdering innocent kids when he could have simply freed the Israelites himself with his “ omnipotent ” power .
God punishes children for the sins of their fathers , unto the third and fourth generations .
Punishing a child for the sins of their ancestors is not very just .
Exodus 20:5&34:7
God endorses slavery .
He even set up laws as to how slavery was to be carried out , and goes as far as Okaying beating them .
Exodus 21:2-6
God sanctioned the selling of ones daughter .
How can any being tell another to literally sell their child into slavery ?
Disgusting !
Exodus 21:7
Exodus 22:18
God orders the death of witches , sorceresses and anyone who practices magic .
Sadly enough , this verse was justification for the Inquisition .
Exodus 32:27
God ordered to be killed , 3,000 Israelites for no greater crime than worshipping a golden calf .
I do n’t know about you but death is a pretty harsh fucking punishment .
Leviticus 20:9 -10
God commands death for cursing out ones parents and death for adultery .
Gee , with these types of laws the population should be almost nil by now .
Once again god is a homophobe , or at the very least , a bigot .
Leviticus 20:13
Handicapped people must not approach the altar .
Leviticus 21:16 -23
Leviticus 26:30
“ And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons , and the flesh of your daughters shill ye eat . ”
Leviticus 27:28 -29
God ordered and allowed human sacrifices .
Numbers 16:27
God buries alive Korah and his family .
Numbers 16:35 God killed 250 Levite princes who disagreed with Moses ’ leadership .

Comparing certain descriptions of God in the Old Testament with certain descriptions of God of the New Testament is like comparing Jesus to Charles Manson .
As seen in the Bible verses above , some of the Old Testament descriptions of God have a number of characteristics that certainly appear to be satanic .
Of course , most descriptions of God in the Old Testament portray a Father of infinite love .
The ridiculous Bible verses portraying God as a satanic figure only shows how some writers of the Old Testament were merely creating God in their own image . "

Talk is a common name used to refer to several species of Asian freshwater fish that are closely related to the piranha .
They are mainly carnivorous , but they also eat green leafy vegetables , fruits , and food that is not meat .
Their teeth , which may resemble human teeth , are used to cut through vegetation and crush seeds that fall into the water .
Pinoy Money
Talk and piranha are distinguished from each other by their teeth and jaw alignments ; piranha have pointed , razor - sharp teeth in a pronounced underbite , whereas Pinoy Money Talk have square , straight teeth in a less severe underbite , or a slight overbite .
Additionally , full - grown Pinoy Money

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - With the U.S. government fast approaching its current $ 8.965 trillion credit limit , the Senate on Thursday gave final congressional approval of an $ 850 billion increase in U.S. borrowing authority .
Senate Majority leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) speaks to the media at the Capitol building , July 17 , 2007 file photo .
The Senate on Thursday passed and sent to President Bush a temporary spending measure to keep the federal government running through November 16 , giving Democrats and Republicans time to work out budget disagreements .

The Senate voted 53 - 42 to raise the debt ceiling to $ 9.815 trillion , the fifth increase in the U.S. credit limit since President George W. Bush took office in January 2001 .
The U.S. House of Representatives approved the higher debt limit earlier this year as part of the overall budget resolution and the legislation now goes to Bush for his signature .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson commended Congress for quickly passing legislation he said “ ensures the U.S. government can deliver on promises already made . ”
“ The Senate ’s swift action on the debt limit today helps to protect the full faith and credit of the United States and avoids creating unnecessary uncertainty in the U.S. Treasuries market , ” Paulson said in a statement .
The Treasury Department had been pressing Congress to pass the debt increase quickly .
Last week Paulson said the government would hit its current $ 8.965 trillion debt limit on October 1 .
But Sen . Tom Coburn , an Oklahoma Republican , urged lawmakers to reject the debt increase and concentrate on spending cuts instead .
“ Families across America do n’t have the luxury of loaning themselves any money when they ’ve maxed out their credit .
But that ’s what we ’re going to do , ” Coburn said .
Lawmakers said the $ 850 billion increase in borrowing authority , the second largest since Bush took office , should be enough to last the government through next year ’s congressional and presidential elections .
U.S. debt stood at about $ 5.6 trillion at the start of Bush ’s presidency .
“ Increasing the debt limit is necessary to preserve the full faith and credit of the United States of America , ” said Iowa Sen .

During a protest in Gaza City against Bush ’s visit , Palestinians carry empty coffins symbolizing 62 Gazans who have died since June 2007 from not being to receive proper medical care due to the Israeli siege , 8 January 2008 .

When the Israeli high court previously agreed to ban the transfer to Gaza of fuel to supply the main power plant , there were power cuts for at least eight hours a day .
Power and fuel cuts mean that hospitals , factories and other essential services suffer as a result .
Such Israeli court decisions ignore the humanitarian impact on Gaza .
I drove back home and I found the streets without light and not even much traffic as if Gaza was under curfew .
When I arrived home , my family was sitting in darkness with a little candlelight .
My three - and - a - half - month - old son was crying .
I felt that he did n’t want to be in darkness as darkness to him means bed time .
The power cuts that Gazans were experiencing before the last electricity cut was even then too much to bear and now the necessities of daily life are even harder to come by .
What drives me and other Gazans crazy is that the international community can see all of the human rights violations being committed in Gaza and yet they choose not to take any action and instead remain silent .
In the past I remember hearing the international community condemn such Israeli violations , but now , nothing .
One must conclude they are in favor of the Gaza siege because they support Israel ’s declaration that Gaza is an “ enemy entity ” since Hamas took over the Strip , ignoring that there are civilians living in Gaza that cannot be blamed for anything other than residing in Gaza .
My family and I are suffering like many others in Gaza .
We are all waiting for an improvement in the situation in Gaza , hoping that things will get better .
Most Gazans have nothing to do but hope for a better life for our children , families and ourselves .
I wish I could tell George W. Bush that if he is coming to Palestine to complicate the lives of Palestinians while showing sympathy with Israel then you are not welcome .
We want solutions in easing our lives , the opening the borders and the breaking of the siege .
I am not optimistic about Bush ’s visit as it ’s nothing but more talks .
I am expecting a huge Israeli military attack against Gaza with the approval of the US .
And as always , occupied Palestinians will receive nothing but the blame .
I am sorry Gorge W. Bush , you are not welcome .

More than 3 million acres in Alaska ’s Tongass National Forest would be open to logging under a federal plan that supporters believe will revive the state ’s struggling timber industry .
Environmentalists , however , fear that the proposal will devastate the forest .
The Bush administration released Friday a management plan for the forest , the largest in the country at nearly 17 million acres .
The plan would leave about 3.4 million acres open to logging , road building and other development , including about 2.4 million acres that are now remote and roadless .
About 663,000 acres are in areas considered most valuable for timber production .
Alaska Regional Forester Denny Bschor , who approved the Tongass management plan , said its goals are to sustain the diversity and health of the forest , provide livelihoods and subsistence for Alaska residents and ensure a source of recreation and solitude for forest visitors .
At more than 26,000 square miles , the Tongass — often labeled the crown jewel in the national forest system — is larger than 10 states .
” There may be disappointment that the ( allowable timber sales ) has n’t increased or diminished , depending on your viewpoint , ” Bschor said in a statement .
” What is significant in the amended plan , however , is our commitment to the state of Alaska to provide an economic timber sale program which will allow the current industry to stabilize , and for an integrated timber industry to become established . ”
Environmentalists said the plan continues a Bush administration policy of catering to the timber industry .

American politicians , from Lincoln to FDR and even Bill Clinton , have tried to claim the political mantle of Thomas Jefferson .
Lincoln was truly the anti-Jefferson who nevertheless mouthed Jefferson ’s words of " all men are created equal " to try to win the support of Jeffersonians in the North in the 1864 election .
FDR even more ludicrously tried to paint the New Deal as a Jeffersonian program for similar reasons ; and political junkies may recall that President William Jefferson Clinton made a point of stopping off at Jefferson ’s home , Monticello , on the way to his first inauguration .
( He then turned around and proposed to nationalize the health care sector of the economy , funded by the largest tax increases in history — decidedly anti-Jeffersonian positions . )
American politicians understand that there are — and always have been — a great many Americans who believe in the Jeffersonian philosophy that " that government is best which governs least . "
They may want minimal government , as called for by the Constitution , but by and large they want to be left alone to live their own lives within the rule of law and the norms of civilized society .
They distrust centralized political power and hold the commonsense view that government is always easier to control the closer it is to the people .
That ’s why politicians from Lincoln to Clinton have mouthed Jeffersonian slogans .
They want the votes , but have no intention of adopting any of Jefferson ’s political beliefs and policies based on them .
( For his part , George W. Bush is probably more familiar with " The Jeffersons " television show of the 1970s than the political ideas of our third president . )
In reality , Grover Cleveland was the last American president who actually believed in Jeffersonian principles of government and was even moderately successful in implementing them ( he vetoed literally hundreds of pieces of legislation ) .
It ’s been almost 120 years since a genuine Jeffersonian has been a major candidate for the highest office in the land , but we finally have in our midst the genuine item — the real deal — in the person of Ron Paul .
Unlike all other candidates for the presidency , Ron Paul does not attempt to dupe the public into believing that he is in favor of fiscal responsibility , limited and decentralized government , and individual liberty .
He has spent the past three decades demonstrating that he is single - mindedly devoted to these principles , and sincerely believes that he can succeed in returning them to the American polity .
When Ron Paul proposes abolishing the Federal Reserve Board and returning to the gold standard , he is taking Jefferson ’s position in his great debate with Hamilton over the propriety of a government - run bank .
As explained in my forthcoming book , Hamilton ’s Curse , Hamilton wanted a big , expansive and intrusive central government that would centrally plan the economy and pursue " imperial glory " in foreign affairs .
He wanted America to imitate the British empire .
In order to achieve this , he knew that a government - run bank would be necessary .
Jefferson , on the other hand , believed that the sole purpose of government was to protect the lives , liberty and property of the people , and that such a bank would be a danger to liberty .
The two men debated the issue in long essays submitted to President George Washington , who eventually adopted the position of his fellow Federalist , Hamilton .
( The Federalists in Congress played a role by passing legislation that enlarged the District of Columbia so that it would be adjacent to Washington ’s property on the Potomac River .
They had blocked Washington ’s request for this until he signed the bank bill . )
It was a Jeffersonian Democrat , President Andrew Jackson , who would de-fund Hamilton ’s Bank of the United States some forty years later , after it had fueled decades of political corruption and economic instability .
Hamiltonian central banking was subsequently revived by one of his political heirs — Lincoln — and then cemented into place by the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 .
Ron Paul also calls for a dramatic reduction in government debt by abolishing unnecessary and harmful government bureaucracies , such as the U.S. Department of Education , as well as a foreign policy that defends America instead of attempting to centrally plan and police the entire planet .
It was Jefferson who argued that the federal government ’s debt was only legitimate in emergencies , such as a defensive war , and even then it should never exist for more than 19 years .
He believed it was immoral for one generation to incur debt — even in a defensive war — that would financially burden future generations .
" I consider the fortunes of our republic , " he wrote , " as depending , in an eminent degree , on the extinguishment of the public debt . "
As president , his party abolished all of Hamilton ’s ( and the Federalists ’ ) excise taxes and reduced the government debt from $ 83 million to $ 57 million .
Hamilton , on the other hand , wanted a large national debt because it would tie the affluent of the country to the government , just as welfare ties the poor to the government today .
The affluent would be the government bondholders , he argued , and would therefore provide political support for all the tax increases he had in mind to assure that they would be paid their principal and interest .
He called the national debt a " blessing . "
The Jeffersonian view of government debt prevailed , more or less , until the Woodrow Wilson administration , after which Hamiltonian Keynesianism became the order of the day .
Today the U.S. government is in debt to the tune of some $ 70 trillion if one includes all the unfunded Social Security , Medicare , and government pension liabilities .
Ron Paul wants to reverse the economically devastating and immoral policy of rampant government debt accumulation .
The income tax has centralized all political power in Washington , D.C. , eviscerated the independence of the states , and has made tax slaves out of millions of Americans .
Once again , Ron Paul ’s call for the abolition of income taxation is a genuine Jeffersonian sentiment .
How inspirational and revolutionary would it be to hear President Ron Paul quote Jefferson ’s first inaugural address at his first inaugural : " [ A ] wise and frugal Government , which shall restrain men from injuring one another , shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement , and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned .
This is the sum of good government . . . " ( emphasis added ) .
Jefferson was of course a strict constructionist in regard to the Constitution , as is Ron Paul .
This was the key to Jefferson ’s debate with Hamilton over a national bank , with Jefferson arguing that the Constitution did not provide for such a function , and Hamilton inventing the subversive notion of " implied powers " of the Constitution to defend his proposal .
The Hamiltonian position has prevailed for several generations now , making a complete mockery of the Constitution itself .
Ron Paul wants to reverse the damage done by the political heirs of Hamilton .
Along with his strict constructionist views of the Constitution , Jefferson believed that the keystone of the entire document was the Tenth Amendment .
After delegating a few express powers to the central government , the citizens of the states reserved all others to themselves , and to the states respectively .
The Tenth Amendment announced , essentially , that the citizens of the free and independent states were sovereign .
They were the masters , not the servants , of the federal government which they had created by ratifying the Constitution in state political conventions .
In his first inaugural he announced his support of " the State governments , in all their rights , as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns and the surest bulwarks against antirepublican tendencies . . . "
This is how government was to be consistent with the protection of individual liberty in Jefferson ’s opinion .
It is also Ron Paul ’s opinion .
Jefferson advocated a modest foreign policy , unlike his nemesis Hamilton , the original Neocon , who wanted to invade France and become an imperialistic power .
" [ P]eace , commerce , and honest friendship with all nations , entangling alliances with none , " was his foreign policy philosophy ( from the first inaugural ) .
Jefferson understood that war is the mother of the state , and did everything he could to avoid it .
When the British began confiscating American ships and kidnapping American sailors , he imposed an economically destructive trade embargo rather than risk an even more economically destructive war with England .
Ron Paul is the only presidential candidate in memory to espouse the wisdom of Jefferson and Washington when it comes to foreign policy .
When Ron Paul sounds the alarm about how the current regime has attacked civil liberties , including the freedom of speech , with its totalitarian " PATRIOT Act , " its lust to suspend habeas corpus , and even calls by the likes of Newt Gingrich to " rethink " the First Amendment , it is reminiscent of Jefferson ’s great confrontation with the enemies of civil liberty during his time — the Adams administration and the Federalist Party .
One of the first things the Federalist Party did upon assuming power was to make criticism of the government illegal with its Sedition Act .
Jefferson orchestrated nationwide opposition to this totalitarian policy , and authored his famous Kentucky Resolve of 1798 : " Resolved , that the several States composing the United States of America , are not united on the principles of unlimited submission to their General Government . . . and that whensoever the General Government assumes undelegated powers [ such as the abolition of free speech ] , its acts are unauthoritative , void , and of no force . "
This would also be an appropriate quote for President Ron Paul ’s first inaugural address .
The dominance of the Hamiltonian , Big Government philosophy , and the marginalization of Jefferson and his ideas , is the fundamental source of America ’s biggest problems , including a foreign policy that has run amok ; a tax system that treats citizens like medieval serfs ; an arrogant and unresponsive central government ; the evisceration of the states as independent political sovereignties ; the economic boom - and - bust cycle that is generated by " the Fed " ; the eagerness of Washington politicians to strip away more and more of our civil liberties ; and the infantilization of America that has been created by a gargantuan welfare state .
Ron Paul is the only national politician who is devoted to reversing all of these dangerous trends .
All other candidates propose either minor tinkering at the margins , or an expansion of the same failed policies .
He is the Jefferson of our time , and our true hope of returning to the guiding principles of the founding fathers .
We can take this road , or we can continue along on the road to serfdom .
The Best of Thomas DiLorenzo
by Mikael Rudolph of ImpeachforPeace.org
I spoke Monday evening , June 18th at the Minnesota 5th District ( Minneapolis ) Central Committee meeting on the topic of impeachment .
Two resolutions that I suggested were passed with only one dissenting voice out of the forty or so in attendance :
1 ) . To issue a resolution supporting House Resolution 333 to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney with an addendum added to also impeach President George W. Bush ( their suggestion ) .
2 ) .
To communicate to our Representative Keith Ellison that his 5th District DFL ( Democratic - Farmer - Labor Party ) Central Committee strongly encourages him to become a cosigner of House Resolution 333 .
They also asked me to give my contact information to be on a speakers list for possible other engagements .
Fellow ImpeachforPeace.org member Dan Fearn joined me and we moved some stickers and buttons and I bought a shirt for one especially ardent supporter of impeachment .
Now if we can do the same in the 4th ( St. Paul ) to put pressure on Betty McCollum as well as in the other six Minnesota districts Minnesota could become the 18th State Democratic Party to pass an impeachment resolution .
See ImpeachPAC.org / resolutions for a developing list of impeachment resolutions from around the country .
We need people to get letters endorsing impeachment from business owners in the wards of each Minneapolis City Council member to pressure them as well .
Anyone ?
The speech I gave was very close to the one I gave last week at the Green Party meeting with two Minneapolis City Council members .
The basic text last night ’s speech you can read below :
“ I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend … ” … what ?
Our borders from the Mexican terrorists ?
No .
My political party , my staff ? , tax breaks for the wealthiest and profit margins for multi-national corporations ?
No .
Article II Section 1 of the Constitution calls for the incoming President to swear on his or her honor to “ … preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . ”
All other civil servants swear an oath to do their job and most often “ to support and / or defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic ” .
oath : A solemn , formal declaration or promise to fulfill a pledge , often calling upon God , a god , or that which is held most sacred or valuable by the swearer .
To some , one ’s word and name in and of themselves are regarded sacred – always being witnessed – as exemplified by the character of John Proctor in Arthur Miller ’s “ The Crucible ”  , which means “ A severe test , as of patience or belief ; a trial . ” 
Proctor simply had to lie to have his life spared from a witchhunt .
Proctor did not lie , saying : “ Because it is my name !
Because I cannot have another in my life ! ”  and after continuing that he was “ not worth the dust on the feet ”  of those of such character that they were hung for standing on principle and telling the truth in full integrity , Proctor said “ How may I live without my name ? ” 
That , my friends , is an oath .
Article II , Section 4 of the Constitution states :
The President , Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States , SHALL BE , – not can be , or could be – shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for , and Conviction of , Treason , Bribery , or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors .
The definition of “ high crimes & misdemeanors ”  is under continual debate , but it seems to be generally agreed upon that if a crime is committed , not able to be justifiably excepted on national security grounds , it by definition becomes a “ ˜high crime ’ as an abuse of authority .
But criminal activity is not the only impeachable offense .
Jon Roland of the Constitution Society wrote :
“ Holding a particular office of trust is not a right , but a privilege , and removal from such office is not a punishment . ” 
In other words , public office is a gift from the populace given daily .
If no longer deserved , that gift should cease and that privilege should be revoked ..
Roland went on to say : “ … the appropriate subject matter for an impeachment and removal proceeding is the full range of offenses against the Constitution and against the rights of persons committed by subordinate officials and their agents which have not been adequately investigated or remedied .
( This was written in January of 1999 concerning the merits of a previous impeachment trial ) .
1 ) . The Supreme Court in Rosul v. George W. Bush ruled detainees were being wrongfully imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay Detention Center in Cuba .
These policies and actions were ruled unconstitutional and illegal – in violation of Amendments V , VI &VII .
The use of torture , legally justified by now Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and others and henceforth condoned by Bush and Cheney is an additional violation to the 8th Amendment .
2 ) . The Supreme Court again in Hamdan v. Donald Rumsfeld , George W. Bush , et al. ) ruled that the Military Commissions instituted by the Bush Administration violate the Universal Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Conventions to which we are bound by American law .
Again , the Bush Administration ’s actions were found by the highest court of the land to be illegal and unconstitutional – again violating Amendments V , VI , VII
3 ) . A Federal Court in NSA vs. ACLU found the NSA program of broad data - mining and warrantless wire - tapping of U.S. citizens illegal and unconstitutional – violating the Fourth Amendment .
One could argue that these were Administration policies and programs that temporarily pushed the envelope of questionable legality until the courts judged them illegal .
However , each of these programs have continued in direct contravention of the law , spitting in the face of our nation ’s highest courts , having their names and definitions changed or modified slightly like a gold ring in a pig ’s snout .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ’ bill , House 333 , to impeach Cheney , recently gained very significant 6th , 7th and 8th cosponsors , Maxine Waters – the Chair of the Out of Iraq caucus and the co-chairs of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , Lynn Woolsey and Barbara Lee .
The bill focuses on the manipulation of pre-war intelligence , lying about WMDs , lying about a connection between Iraq & Al Qaeda and lying about Iran posing an immediate and dire threat ( Deja vu anyone ? ) .
An argument for impeachment could be made about the legality of this self - appointed Unitary Executive Bush ’s signing statements – more than all previous Presidents combined – thus largely taking upon himself the Constitutionally mandated law - making authority which rightfully belongs to Congress .
Remember that impeachment is an investigation , so an argument could be made regarding possible criminal financial interactions with convicted felon Jack Abramoff , illegal profiteering – possibly involving that which could be construed as bribery given or recieved – by Cheney through Halliburton & subsidiaries and the Bush family ’s Carlyle Group and especially the compromising of our national security with the “ ˜outing ’ of Non-Official Cover CIA agent Valerie Plame in an act of political retribution against her husband Joseph Wilson who stood on principle to tell the truth .
It is not hyperbole to consider this bootless , cowardly “ ˜outing ’ coming during wartime as possibly high treason for various members of this “ ˜all hat and no cattle ’ Connecticut Cowboy administration .
Even if not convicted of any direct wrong doing himself , Bush could and should be impeached and removed from office for neglecting to hold those under him accountable in violation of his oath of office .
Conversely , this President has bent over backwards shielding and protecting Karl Rove and Cheney from legal liability in the Scooter Libby case and especially now in protecting Gonzales from justice being served for his role in politicizing the Judicial Branch through wrongful firings of federal attorneys to be replaced by lock - step loyalists .
The most common argument against impeachment is that if we impeach Bush , we ’ll get Cheney as President .
Personally I fear impeaching Cheney might make Bush President , but actually nearly all resolutions of the hundreds passed or in process around the nation include both of them .
Most importantly , 17 state Democratic Parties – more than one third – have passed resolutions to impeach President Bush and Vice President Cheney .
The argument that such a resolution would be non-binding is specious as well .
Since when are the opinions of the local citizenry as embodied by our local elected officials not of value ?
Impeachment is not extreme .
We are a nation of laws .
No American is above the law , and those privileged to be granted the authority to lead should be held more stringently to the law , not less .
Is it too late ?
Impeachment hearings against Richard Nixon began on May 9th , 1974 .
Nixon resigned on August 8th – less than 3 months later .
Nixon was to be impeached for obstruction of justice , abuse of power and defiance of subpoenas – all of which are coming to light in the “ ˜ Attorneygate ’ scandal .
When House Speaker Nancy Pelosi decreed impeachment to be “ off the table ”  and said Democrats were “ ready to govern ”  , the nation – which had spoken clearly in the November mid-term election – was told to look forward to an end to the Iraq War , accountability for the Bush Administration and the passage of progressive domestic legislation to help so many damaged by this most atrocious administration .
Instead , the national Democrats recently split , thus handing over another virtually blank check to Bush ’s War .
Modest yet decent gains such as a raise in the minimum wage only have come by making huge concessions to the corporate Republicans and some Democrats – and to Bush ’s veto and signing statement threats .
Democrats gambling on waiting out the Bush term and expecting another landslide win in “ ˜08 take heed : Last week ’s Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll says just 27 percent of Americans approve of the way the Democratic - led Congress is doing its job – down 9 % since January – lower approval ratings than President Bush ’s curent nadir of 29 % .
The possibility of at least the Senate returning to the GOP if not both Houses and the swearing in of President Fred Thompson , or whomever is a real concern , not some nightmarish fantasy if the Democrats continue to appear weak and divided
When one party has shown strength and integrity in holding the other accountable historically , they have made gains in the next elections .
If impeachment evidence is brought to light in the House and Americans finally get the truth through every media outlet and then impeachment moves to the Senate , Republican Senators will be faced with a lose - lose choice : Distance themselves “ ˜with great pain and regret ’ from these now - public criminals and their crimes , or go down with the sinking ship in the next election .
Thank you again for allowing me to speak tonight .
I do n’t have family in the Minnesota National Guard or currently serving “ ˜over there ’ , but it is my Constitution , my Bill of Rights , those are my freedoms and my liberties that are under comprehensive assault by these confirmed domestic enemies to the Constitution who took our White House by bloodless coupe d-etat in Florida in 2000 and extended their infestation of it in like manner in Ohio in 2004 .
If you have any doubts about this , grab a back issue of Rolling Stone with Robert Kennedy , Jr ’s account of these election thefts .
An extremely dangerous precedent is being set if impeachment does not take place .
Lying to congress to initiate a war of aggression , an ongoing occupation for war - profiteers of a country 80 % of whose citizens want us to leave , 50 % of whom feel violence against American troops is justified , whose parliament has passed a resolution asking us to leave , pervasive suppression of the press and free speech , false news reports … it goes on and on …
I celebrated my 49th birthday Friday .
I am in pretty good health .
Habeas Corpus – due process , the Great Writ , the very basis of the democratic ideal and dream since 1215 celebrated its 792nd birthday on Friday on life support in Washington D.C .
Congress is discussing … DISCUSSING … restoring habeas corpus .
And finally , on May 9th Bush signed National Security Presidential Directive 51 , also called Homeland Security Presidential Directive / 20 .
Did you miss it ?
No surprise since it was n’t in the news .
Under this directive , President Bush entrusts himself with leading the entire government – not just the Executive Branch – during a “ catastrophic emergency . ” , to be defined , of course , by the Emperor himself .
What more do we need ?
If this President is not impeached , if this Vice President is not impeached , the impeachment clause should be lifted from the Constitution through Amendment .
I am calling upon you to fulfill your oath or promise to whatever you regard most sacred to ( a ) pass a resolution to Impeach President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney , to ( b ) send this resolution to the State Democratic Pary asking them to do the same , ( c ) send this resolution to the Minnesota State House and Senate asking them to do the same , and ( d ) to strongly encourage Rep. Keith Ellison to co-sign House 333 .
America desperately needs leaders at this time , this crucible in our nation ’s history .
I am calling upon you to lead .
Let the rest be followers .
Justice must and will be served or there will be no peace .
Despite billions of dollars in U.S. military payments to Pakistan over the last six years , the paramilitary force leading the pursuit of Al Qaeda militants remains underfunded , poorly trained and overwhelmingly outgunned , U.S. military and intelligence officials said .
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf cited the rising militant threat in declaring a state of emergency on Saturday and suspending the constitution .
But rather than use the more than $ 7 billion in U.S. military aid to bolster its counter - terrorism capabilities , Pakistan has spent the bulk of it on heavy arms , aircraft and equipment that U.S. officials say are far more suited for conventional warfare with India , its regional rival .
That has left fighters with the paramilitary force , known as the Frontier Corps , equipped often with little more than “ sandals and bolt - action rifles , ” said a senior Western military official in Islamabad , even as they face Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters equipped with assault rifles and grenade launchers .

The arms imbalance has contributed to Al Qaeda ’s ability to regroup in the border region , and reflects the competing priorities that were evident even before this weekend between two countries that are self - described allies in the “ war on terrorism ” but have sharply divergent national security interests .
The situation also has emerged as a significant obstacle as the United States and Pakistan seek new approaches after a series of failed strategies in the frontier region , where Osama bin Laden and other top Al Qaeda leaders are believed to be hiding .
U.S. officials have urged Pakistan to move more aggressively against militants and bolster the capabilities of the Frontier Corps , an indigenously recruited force of about 80,000 troops , half of them based in the tribal areas , that was formed under British rule and is traditionally used to guard the border and curb smuggling .
Even front - line units with upgraded weapons are woefully unschooled in counterinsurgency tactics , other officials said .
Late last month , Islamic militants captured dozens of fighters and paraded them before Western journalists , the latest in a series of embarrassing encounters .

Pakistan has recently indicated that it will enlarge the corps and expand its role in pursuing Al Qaeda .
But because the Frontier Corps has been all but shut off from U.S. military aid and payments to Pakistan , U.S. officials said the new strategy amounts in some ways to starting from scratch more than six years after the Sept. 11 attacks .
“ The view in Washington is that the Frontier Corps is the best way forward because they are locally recruited , speak the language , and understand the culture , terrain and local politics , ” said a senior Pentagon official , discussing internal deliberations on Pakistan policy on condition of anonymity .
But transforming the corps into a force that can contend with militants in the tribal area “ will take years to bring to fruition , ” he said .
Partly because of that timetable , the goal of dismantling Al Qaeda and its hub of operations in the border region has given way to expectations among U.S. intelligence and military officials that the United States and Pakistan face a years - long struggle simply to contain the terrorist network and keep it from expanding .
Advertisement
“ I think it ’s worse than starting from scratch , ” said Bruce Riedel , a former South Asia expert at the CIA and the White House now with the Brookings Institution ’s Saban Center for Middle East Policy .
“ The most optimistic of scenarios we ’re looking at is a very long - term effort to try to stabilize the badlands of northwestern Pakistan , ” Riedel said .
“ The alternative is . . . a more or less permanent Taliban state within a state in northwest Pakistan . ”
Plans to build up the Frontier Corps are not universally supported by U.S. military officials .
Loyalties within the corps are thought by many observers to be divided .
Members are recruited mainly from Pashtun tribes with long - standing mistrust of outsiders .
Most reject militant ideology , and have suffered hundreds of casualties in the fighting .
But many also are devoutly religious and feel some degree of sympathy for the Islamists ’ cause .
“ There is a push - back among some that the Frontier Corps is not a reliable ally of the United States , ” said Seth Jones , a military expert at Rand Corp .
“ The concern is that you give them additional training and equipment , and they could end up helping militants rather than taking action against them . ”

Perhaps as a hedge against those concerns , the U.S. Special Operations Command has recently begun exploring efforts to pay off tribal militias in the region that are not affiliated with the Pakistani government , and arm them to root out Al Qaeda and Taliban militants , a source familiar with the discussions said .
“ You ca n’t buy them , but you can rent them , ” said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions .
“ There is a very serious effort to look at this . ”
The CIA also operates in the area , and has doubled the number of case officers based in Pakistan in recent years , former agency officials say .
Despite the concerns , U.S. officials said there is widespread agreement that boosting support to the Frontier Corps is worth the risk , a position that reflects deep frustration with a string of failed strategies in the border region .

An early failure was a plan to keep Al Qaeda operatives from crossing into Pakistan when U.S. troops invaded Afghanistan in late 2001 .
That was followed by ineffective forays by thousands of Pakistani regular army troops and aborted peace agreements with tribal leaders who did not fulfill pledges to clamp down on the militants .
By last summer , U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that the peace deals had given Al Qaeda room to regroup and rebuild its ability to train and plan attacks on Western targets .
Under new pressure from the United States , Musharraf resumed military incursions earlier this year , with Frontier Corps fighters teaming up with Pakistani regular army units .
The effort produced a series of bloody and clumsy confrontations that may have strengthened the militants ’ position in the tribal areas .
Especially demoralizing was the Aug. 30 capture of about 250 troops , most of them members of the Frontier Corps , who surrendered without a fight .
Over the next two months , a few dozen were released but at least three were beheaded .
Over the weekend , 211 were freed in exchange for 25 militants held by the army .

Taking on Al Qaeda and Taliban militants represents a significant departure for the Frontier Corps , whose members are typically outfitted with castoffs from the regular army .
Led by army officers who often disdain the assignment , Frontier Corps units have obsolete artillery pieces , have to travel by foot because they have no ground transport , lack night - vision equipment , and have almost no air power .
“ Yesterday they had one helicopter operating , ” a senior Western diplomat in Islamabad said during a recent interview .
“ If they had two , it was a good day . ”
Reluctant to offend a crucial ally , the United States has placed few conditions on the military aid , part of a larger package of U.S. aid and payments totaling more than $ 10 billion .
As a result , Pakistan used much of it to acquire big - ticket weapons systems and other items to shore up its conventional defense capabilities , U.S. officials said .
The Defense Security Cooperation Agency , which oversees U.S. weapons transfers , said that shipments to Pakistan since the Sept. 11 attacks had included some equipment that could be useful in pursuing militants in the tribal areas , including 4,000 radios and 12 refurbished attack helicopters .
But even those items went to the regular army , the agency said , and are unlikely to be shared with the Frontier Corps , which falls under a separate branch of the Pakistani government .

The majority of Pakistan ’s purchases have been of items that would be difficult to deploy in counterinsurgency fights , including harpoon missiles designed to sink warships , F - 16 fighter jets , maritime surveillance aircraft and refurbished howitzers that have to be towed into position .
“ It ’s hard to make arguments that the bulk of what is being provided by the U.S. is very effective for counter - terrorism operations , ” said Alan Kronstadt , a specialist in South Asian affairs at the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service .
“ A lot of the military assistance has been much more useful for a potential war with India . ”
Musharraf ’s emergency declaration could force a review of U.S. aid , a move Democratic lawmakers said Sunday they would support .
The U.S. and Pakistan have spent part of the last year developing what one Pentagon official described as a “ multiyear plan ” to bolster the Frontier Corps ’ capabilities , U.S. officials said .

Pakistan has already begun recruiting more troops , with plans to expand the corps to 100,000 .
U.S. funding would help pay for the increase , as well as a training center that will focus on counterinsurgency tactics .
The Pentagon has budgeted $ 55 million in counter - narcotics funds for the Frontier Corps this year to pay for night - vision equipment and communications gear .
But the Pentagon is also seeking additional funding in a separate category that could be used for weapons .
Officials declined to discuss specifics .
“ It ’s nothing really sexy , ” said the senior Pentagon official involved in Pakistan policy .
“ But they need to be at least on par with the militants . ”

I ’M black again .
I was black in Mississippi in the 1970s but sometime in the 1980s I became African - American , with a brief pause at Afro-American .
Someone , I think it was Jesse Jackson , in the days when he had that kind of clout , managed to convince America that I preferred being African - American .
I do n’t .
Now I live in Britain where I ’m black again .
Blacks in Britain come from all over , although many are from the former colonies .
According to the last census , about half of the British people who identify as black say they are black Caribbean , about 40 percent consider themselves black African , and the rest just feel plain old black .
Black Brits are further divided by ancestral country of origin , yet they are united under the term black British  often expanded to include British Asians from the Indian subcontinent .
The term African - American was contrived to give black Americans a sense of having a historical link to Africa , since one of slavery ’s many unhappy legacies is that most black Americans do n’t know particulars about their origins .
Black Americans whose ancestors arrived after slavery and who can pinpoint their country of origin are excluded from the definition  which is why , early in his campaign , people said Barack Obama was n’t really African - American .
Yet , since he has one parent from the African continent and one from the American continent , he is explicitly African - American .
Distinguishing between American black people based on their ancestors ’ arrival date ignores the continuum of experience that transcends borders and individual genealogies and unites black people all over the world .
Yes , scientists have shown that black means nothing as a biological description , but it remains an important signal in social interaction .
Everywhere I travel , from North Africa to Europe to Asia , dark - skinned people approach me and , usually gently but sometimes aggressively , establish a bond .
Egyptian forces have largely avoided border confrontations
" Anyone who breaches the border will have their legs broken , " Ahmed Abul Gheit said in a television interview .
Many Egyptians were openly sympathetic to the plight of their Gaza neighbours when they streamed across the border last month to stock up on supplies .
Frontier defences were blasted away by militants defying an Israeli blockade .
Mr Abul Gheit met US Deputy Secretary of State David Welch to discuss the situation in Gaza on Thursday , four days after Egyptian forces sealed the last gaps in the border .
His earlier threatening remarks came during a late - night interview on state television , in which he criticised Israel and Gaza 's de facto rulers , Hamas , for creating the instability .
He blamed Israel for imposing " collective punishment " on Gaza in response to rocket attacks , and he described Hamas 's self - styled resistance as a " laughable caricature " which harmed the perpetrator more than the enemy .
A Hamas spokesman in called the remarks " inappropriate " and said he did not believe they reflected the official Egyptian stance .
" All we want is an open border crossing , " said Sami Abu Zuhri said .
" Instead of making these threats against the Palestinian people , he should voice his anger against the Israeli occupation , which is what is closing the border crossings between Gaza and Egypt . "
Egypt is Israel 's longest - standing Arab ally , and has been holding talks with the Palestinian Authority , based in the West Bank , and Israel about future border arrangements .
Clashes broke out on Monday when crowds of Palestinian youths threw stones at an Egyptian border post .
Guards responded with tear gas , before gunfire erupted from both sides of the border .
If all goes well , there will be more than just this post .
I ’m planning a series discussing Fascism , the origins of the modern American state , and the reality of whether a fascist , authoritarian government , similar to Fascist Italy or Nazi Germany , could happen here .
There are a lot of reasons for this series , but the most recent catalyst is this a comment .
There are several things in the comment that demonstrate the commenter ’s misunderstanding of what fascism is and what happened in this country during the New Deal .
For example :
smedley butler and fdr stood up to the facists in the 1930s and 1940s .
Technically our commenter is correct , FDR stood up to Adolf Hitler , the Nazi ’s and Germany ’s quest to dominate Europe during WWII .
However , given the context of the post he is responding to , he is definitely offbase .
Here is the specific point that it appears he is responding to :
Even if he [ ed : Ron Paul ] is unsuccessful at forcing a brokered convention , his candidacy has inoculated a significant part of the U.S. electorate against making the same mistake our grandparents made in the late 1920 ’s and 1930 ’s when they embraced the fascism of Hoover and FDR , plunging the U.S. into a depression that lasted well into 1947 .
Tarran , the author , is not discussing whether FDR confronted the Nazi’s ( and the Japanese militarists and Italian Fascists ) directly during WWII .
Instead , he is discussing the political underpinnings of the New Deal itself , and FDR ’s political beliefs .
This is a fairly common mistake .
People believe that , because they fought the Fascists in WWII , FDR and Churchill were not Fascists .
It does not logically follow that FDR and Churchill were not fascist simply because they fought Hitler and Mussolini .
Prior to late 1938 Italy and Germany were opposed to each other and , at least to some degree , Mussolini had sided with France and England as recently as 1936 .
During the Anschluss of Austria there was a quite real likelihood of Italy intervening militarily against Germany .
Yet no one would claim that Mussolini was not a fascist .
We cannot determine if FDR and the New Deal were fascist from a military conflict .
Instead , we will have to look at the actions and characteristics of the man and the policies .
Another key fallacy is brought out in our commenter ’s post :
over the past 75 years the social safety net has saved lives whereas the free market — the playground of both the facists AND the libertarians — has dictated the destruction of anyone and any thing that stands in the way of material profit .
It is an incredibly common belief that Fascists ( to include Nazi’s , generally ) believe in the free market and capitalism and that they are part of the right wing of politics .
A cursory examination of the writings , speeches and actions of Hitler , Mussolini and Tojo reveals this to be completely untrue .
Understanding where Fascism and National Socialism fits on the political spectrum requires a bit deeper digging , all the way back to the Second International , the Zimmerwald Conference and an understanding of what constitutes the revolutionary left and reformist right of socialism .
When a Communist refers to a National Socialist as “ right wing ” , he actually is referring to his position within the socialist framework .
It is ( and has long been ) a vast misunderstanding of socialism to conflate National Socialism and Fascism ( both socialist movements ) with right wing conservatives , descendants of England ’s Burkean Whigs .
It has been necessary to create a new method of understanding political orientation in order to undo the damage that this confusion has caused .
One such system was created by Jerry Pournelle , known as The Pournelle Political Axes .
Another one is explained by Liberty Papers founder , Eric , in his post A Better Political Spectrum .
In either of these logical and well structured approaches to understanding politics we can see that National Socialists and Fascists are clearly not in the same portion of the political spectrum as libertarians and conservatives .
So , with this ground work established , let ’s start with a common understanding of what Fascism and National Socialism are and how they relate to free market capitalism .
First , some reference material and excerpts from them :
1. Mussolini defines Fascism
The foundation of Fascism is the conception of the State , its character , its duty , and its aim .
Fascism conceives of the State as an absolute , in comparison with which all individuals or groups are relative , only to be conceived of in their relation to the State .
2. From Wikipedia ’s entry on Fascism
Stanley Payne ’s Fascism : Comparison and Definition ( 1980 ) uses a lengthy itemized list of characteristics to identify fascism , including the creation of an authoritarian state ; a regulated , state - integrated economic sector ; fascist symbolism ; anti-liberalism ; anti-communism ; anti-conservatism .
He argues that common aim of all fascist movements was elimination of the autonomy or , in same cases , the existence of large - scale capitalism .
3. Ludwig von Mises Socialism argues that Fascism is an inevitable evolution of Socialism .
He says in the preface to the second edition :
Neither is there any substantial difference between the intentions of the self - styled ‘ progressives ’ and those of the Italian Fascists and the German Nazis .
The Fascists and the Nazis were no less eager to establish all - round regimentation of all economic activities than those governments and parties which flamboyantly advertise their anti-Fascist tenets .
4. Dr. Lawrence Britt wrote an article which appeared in the Spring 2003 edition of Free Inquiry , page 20 , and was called “ Fascism Anyone ? ” .
The article is reposted here .
In that article he includes 14 defining characteristics of fascism , which I ’m going to list here :
Powerful and continuing expressions of nationalism .
Disdain for the importance of human rights .
Identification of enemies / scapegoats as a unifying cause .
The supremacy of the military / avid militarism .
Rampant sexism .
A controlled mass media .
Obsession with national security .
Religion and ruling elite tied together .
Power of corporations protected .
[ note : this only applies to corporations that support the fascist government ]
Power of labor suppressed or eliminated .
Disdain and suppression of intellectuals and the arts .
Obsession with crime and punishment .
Rampant cronyism and corruption .
Fraudulent elections .
While I do not fully agree with Britt , this list of characteristics is going to be interesting when we start digging into the New Deal and FDR as the series progresses .
In any case , he is describing characteristics and behaviors of a fascist government rather than the ideals , principles and philosophies they espouse .
Reading Hitler and Mussolini is quite enlightening .
We quickly discover that they do not believe in the free market , economic freedom or the independence of corporations from government regulation .
If we remove their anti-communist rhetoric and listen to how they want to organize society it becomes remarkably clear that they are socialists with a strong nationalist and militarist bent .
What is truly interesting is that this is rarely , if ever , made clear in political science courses , the media or any other common forum for discussing politics .
Given this , how does National Socialism and Fascism relate to Capitalism ?
Capitalism is a method of organizing economic life that calls for the state to not be involved in regulating the economic marketplace ( among other things ) .
Fascism does not allow for individual choice independent of the State .
Capitalism cannot work if the individual is not free to choose within the marketplace .
Fascism and Capitalism cannot co-exist .
In fact , Capitalism is only possible within a Liberal society ( not liberal in the sense that the political parties in the USA currently use the word , however , where it is roughly equal to progressive or democratic socialism ) .
In Part II we ’ll start tackling the foundations of FDR ’s politics and the New Deal .
Rove flubs on Romney ; Is Fox getting its money worth ?
Michael Roston and David Edwards

Print This Email This Fox News has trumpeted its acquisition of former top White House aide Karl Rove as a political analyst in recent days .
But is the " fair and balanced " news network getting its money 's worth from President Bush 's political architect ?
As rumors circulated that Mitt Romney would end his presidential campaign , the network turned to Rove on Thursday afternoon for remarks based on conversations between " Bush 's Brain " and his supposedly well - placed sources .
And moments before the Associated Press released clips from Romney 's speech before the Conservative Political Action Conference indicating that he would certainly end his candidacy , it did not appear Rove 's privileged insights were as well - developed as other commentators in the world of political news .
" What I 'm hearing is that there 's a strong sense inside the campaign that he is going to withdraw .
I 'm not certain that he 's necessarily going to withdraw today , in his speech , though that is a possibility , " said Rove as he started his informed commentary .
Rove drove home before the end of the segment that he was n't certain Romney would quit the race .
" I want to be cautious about this , " Rove emphasized .
" It strikes me that while the path is working against him , this may not be the moment he decides to withdraw , decides to announce his withdrawal . "

:: jane : what are your sources telling you at this point ?
: : i am telling you there is a strong sense within the campaign he will withdraw .
there ' s a sense from people inside the campaign that the decision has been made and he will shortly be out of the race .
jane : it sounds like you are hearing that the contracts have not been renewed ?
: : on a separate front , they had a series of contracts with vendors that went through february 4 . it is generally decided that campaign is ramping back , and the only reason to be grabbing back right now is that they worked either running out of cash , work since he has a big wallop , he is shot in the wallet .
jane : give us the top reasons why .
:: john mccain has roughly -- when they finish allocating delegates , he will have more than two - thirds to win the nomination .
that makes the mathematics of catching up to him very difficult .
tuesday night , mccain one , albeit not by huge margins , but he won in every situation , and one more delegates than the others .
what percentage just need to win ?
jane : some have suggested that there is potential that the romney campaign will be powered by this talk show host , rush limbaugh situation .
a suggestion that there was still a chance for inroads .
yet it was still close to a mathematical impossibility .
how would you frame that ?
:: it is true that people like limbaugh have big sway .
but candidates have to deliver the message , and by the end of the day , no matter how persuasive the argument is by talk radio -- it is decided on the basis of the candidates themselves and how they deliver the message .
mccain ' s message struck home , that romney and huckabee struck delegates , he but they made fewer than mccain .
jane : mitt romney will step to the microphone to address them .
laura ingram is stepping up .
she will introduce romney .
as jim angle said , there is not an indication of what is to come .
:: i want to be cautious about this pre it strikes me that , while the map is working against him , this may not be the moment he decides to withdraw .
jane : i am getting in my ear from ground sources that fox news is confirming that romney will drop out at some point today .
a couple other organizations are as well .
we ' re not sure exactly when that would happen .
carl , i want to ask you , moving forward , the gop -- healing that party .
the draft is wide .
:: plenty of material senator mccain can draw on to heal the wounds .
he does have a conservative record in congress , she has issues that -- he has issues that unite republicans .
he has great qualifications and a strong message in this regard .
In a two - part column in Asimov 's Science Fiction Magazine , Robert Silverberg tells the incredible story of the Cleve Cartmill affair : in 1944 , John W Campbell published a story by the writer Cleve Cartmill that laid out an eeriy accurate depiction of how the atom bomb would work , prompting a panicked — and sometimes comical — intelligence investigation into a putative conspiracy of science fiction writers :
Campbell provided the Military Intelligence man with Cartmill 's address–in Manhattan Beach , California .
The link to the top- secret Manhattan Project based in Los Alamos was too obvious to overlook .
Riley sent word to the California branch office of Intelligence that Cartmill should be placed under immediate surveillance ; plainly he knew too much about our hush - hush A - bomb research .
Who had tipped him off ?
Both Cartmill and Campbell would need further watching .
And before long it began to seem as though a whole network of science fiction writers might be involved–a chain of conspirators .
For example , the report continues , " It is established that Cartmill is very friendly with [ ] , Retired U.S.N.R. , who is associated with [ ] at the Philadelphia Navy Yard .
This [ ] formerly was doing research work at Columbia University , and he is said to have accepted some material thought to be atomic copper from [ ] in order to measure it in the mass spectroscope at Columbia University .
[ ] was advised by [ ] that the device was broken .
He never received the material back from [ ] .
One [ ] who has written for [ ]
Magazine is said to be working with [ ] also .
The possibility of the transmittal through [ ] to Cartmill has not so far been resolved .
. . . "
Well , now it can be told , and you are quite familiar with the names of these sinister people .
The retired naval man was Robert A. Heinlein .
His Philadelphia Navy Yard associate , the former Columbia man , was Isaac Asimov .
The one who sent the copper to Asimov and never got it back was Will F. Jenkins , who wrote science fiction under the pseudonym of Murray Leinster .
The blanked - out magazine was Astounding , and the other writer working at the Navy Yard with Heinlein and Asimov was L. Sprague de Camp .
DirectX vs. OpenGL
Igor writes :
Not only that Avery , just look at yourself using platform specific DirectX API instead of OpenGL -- how did they manage that ?
Uh , well , it should n't be too surprising .
I 'm primarily a Win32/x86 programmer .
To some people , it 's a minor miracle anytime we write code that is in any way portable and does n't declare at least one HRESULT variable per function .
In this specific case , it 's more of an issue of practicality .
I know both , I 've used both , sometimes I prefer one over the other .
I do like portable and multivendor APIs , but for me , deployment , ease of use , stability , and licensing are also factors .
Truth be told , I do like OpenGL better .
It has a real spec , written in a precise manner , and the base API is better thought out than Direct3D , which has been hacked together over the years and still has garbage such as the infamous D3DERR_DEVICELOST .
I learned a lot about 3D graphics by reading the OpenGL API and extension specs .
It 's portable , it makes easy things easy ( like drawing one triangle ) , it 's extensible , and it 's faster since the application talks directly to the user - space IHV driver .
Microsoft tried improving its API with Direct3D 10 , but the documentation is still incomplete , it 's still non-extensible , and it 's even less portable than before since it 's Vista - only .
Before anyone says anything else , though , theory and practice are a bit different .
In practice , OpenGL drivers tend to have their own nice collections of bugs , and some are better optimized than others .
Most games use Direct3D , so a lot of effort has been put into optimizing drivers and hardware for that API .
Extensions also mean extension hell , and figuring out which extensions are widely available and work as advertised is just as frustrating as Direct3D caps hell .
And then there 's the shader issue  whereas Direct3D has standardized assembly and HLSL shader languages , OpenGL has gone through numerous vendor - specific combiner - style , assembly - style , and high - level language shader extensions .
Now , as for how this pertains to what I do , well , VirtualDub is n't exactly a 3D centric application .
It does have 3D display paths , and I have dabbled with hardware acceleration for video rendering as well , so here 's my VirtualDub - centric take :
When you write OpenGL code , you do n't have to write an entire framework to make sure the application does n't blow up when the screensaver appears .
( I use lots of render targets which have to be allocated D3DPOOL_DEFAULT . )
What other API requires you to free all objects of certain types at random times ?
The shader situation on OpenGL sucks .
When I was implementing OpenGL - accelerated capture support , I wanted to support older cards and looked into the NV_fragment_shader and ATI_fragment_shader extensions .
Programming those directly was so painful that I wrote my own assembler for it ( " asuka glc " in the build process ) .
I later looked into Cg , and that was much improved except that it was a bugfest  the first day I broke the compiler with the vector expression ( a + ( a - b ) * 1.0 ) .
I have n't tried ARBfp or GLSL , but I 'm hoping those work somewhat more reliably .
OpenGL 's coordinate system makes sense : bottom - up orientation , pixel and texel centers on half - integer coordinates , normalized device coordinates are - 1 to 1 in all axes .
Direct3D is a mess : device coordinates are bottom - up with centers on integers  which has the nice side effect of making the projection transform viewport - dependent  but functions that take integer screen - space rects are top - down , and textures are top - down with centers on half - integers .
NDC X and Y are - 1 to 1 but Z is 0 to 1 .
Argh !
In terms of off - screen rendering , OpenGL has a distinct advantage over D3D9 due to better support for readback .
Reading back the results from the video card into system memory where it can be processed by the CPU or written to disk is a major bottleneck when using the GPU to accelerate video .
Direct3D 9 has the infuriating GetRenderTargetData( ) , which has the stupid restriction that it can't do a subrect read and also tends to stall in unexpected ways .
OpenGL not only has the more flexible glReadPixels ( ) , but in my tests it did readback noticeably faster on both ATI and NVIDIA cards .
With asynchronous readback via pixel buffer objects ( PBOs ) on NVIDIA hardware , the readback advantage rises to ~ 2 x .
( If you 're on Vista with a WDDM driver , Direct3D 9.L can supposedly do a subrect readback via StretchRect .
If anyone knows if this is faster and if it can be done asynchronously I 'd be interested in knowing . )
I believe that NVIDIA 's CUDA is also able to push into buffer objects in OpenGL , which allows for texture upload , whereas with D3D9 it can only push into a vertex buffer .
On the flip side , one of the more annoying aspects of OpenGL I 've found is the tying of sampler parameters  filtering , addressing , mip map LOD bias , etc.  to textures .
For a software renderer that modifies texture data for these changes , this makes sense , but it does n't make sense for modern hardware where these are usually sampler states .
It can also make sense if you consider them intrinsic to the texture , but that then breaks down if you want to do something beyond what the hardware can support .
A high quality image processor really needs to support higher quality filtering than bilinear ; bilinear filtering gives a really crappy gradient map .
To do this , you have to emulate the higher - order filtering using lower - order filtering , and you run into the problem that if you ever need the same texture bound with different parameters in the same pass , you 're screwed , because you only have one set of parameters on the texture .
I do this when rendering bicubic in VirtualDub 's D3D9 driver , and I can't port it to OpenGL because it 's impossible to do so .
I looked at the source for various OpenGL binding layers , and they all seem to emulate sampler states by pushing them into texture parameters .
This sucks .
I guess I should say something else good about Direct3D .
Well , the diagnostic tools are better , at least on Windows .
I have NVPerfHUD , PIXWin , and D3D debug mode for debugging , I have NVShaderPerf , FX Composer , and GPU ShaderAnalyzer for shaders , and I have debugging symbols for the Direct3D and D3DX runtimes from Microsoft 's public symbol server .
For OpenGL , well , I have glGetError ( ) which returns GL_INVALID_OPERATION if I remember to call it , GL debug mode if I 'm using an NVIDIA card , and a GL debugging tool that everyone 's pushing but is only available as a trial edition unless I pay about as much as a full VTune license costs .
Another annoying aspect of OpenGL is that NVIDIA 's practically the only one really supporting it on the desktop side .
They 're pushing out all the cool functionality via extensions and have their OpenGL docs about as well updated as the Direct3D ones .
ATI , well ... not that they have many useful docs on their site anyway , but their OpenGL docs are way behind and their extension support in their OpenGL driver was way behind the last time I checked .
They 've put more effort into Direct3D support , even " extending " D3D9 with API hacks to support Fetch4 and R2VB .
Disclaimer : I am an NVIDIA fanboy .
I still want ATI to better support OpenGL so that it continues to be a viable competitor to Direct3D 9/10 on Windows .
With both APIs , it would be nice to have more flexibility in application structure .
Even in games , I think we 're long past the era where programs are all single - threaded , have nothing better to do with the CPU than spin in Present ( ) or SwapBuffers ( ) waiting for vertical blank , and do n't need to render anything except to the screen .
I want better support for multithreading , better ability to avoid unexpected stalls in the driver , the ability to detect / count / wait for vertical blank intervals without polling , and to not lose 3D rendering capability whenever someone locks their workstation or logs in remotely .
What I do with 3D in VirtualDub is simple  most of the time , I draw a quad .
The complexity is that I still have to write a whole lot of framework around that code to handle lost devices , shaders , hopping commands between threads , managing invisible placeholder windows , and dynamically linking to 3D APIs .
As you may have guessed , this is another article about the Clinton family .
It is probably also the only time you will see me agree to anything published in The Nation .
Giving credit where credit is due , the Nation has some rather controversial coverage of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s campaign .
True , it would n’t be a Clinton story without controversy , but I thought this coverage was surprising .
Turns out , I was wrong .
When one reads The Nation , the expectation is plenty of liberal talking points and a veritable cornucopia of Clinton love .
The Nation ’s website is currently adorned with ads for leftwing books and causes .
If you want liberal propaganda , the Nation is some of the best on the web .
That ’s why I was shocked by a negative Clinton article .
After I read the article on Hillary ’s campaign planting questions in town hall meetings , I looked for further information on the Nation ’s website .
I expected more Clinton love .
I found it , as long as the Clinton we are speaking of is Bill .
It seems there is no love for Hillary at the Nation …
Headlines such as “ Clinton Under Fire for Planting Fake Questions ” and “ Hillary 's Mystery Money Men ” have been staples within the pages of the Nation recently ?
Why would one of the United States oldest most well respected publications turn on the Democratic Party ’s holy family ?
It ’s simple , really .
It ’s a lack of faith .
I do n’t think that the editorial staff of the Nation believes that she can win .
The liberal media is jumping off the Clinton bandwagon like rats deserting a sinking ship .
The Nation is not alone in this .
Major papers are lining up behind a ridiculously inexperienced Barrack Obama , and failed candidate John Edwards .
Neither of these men would be a credible candidate if the left was n’t in such a hysterical Bush hating tizzy .
Campaign ’08 is a little different , though .
It ’s not driven by success .
Edwards has n’t been successful , and Obama has n’t been around enough to be either a success or failure .
Hillary ’s candidacy is based on someone else ’s checkered past .
Amongst the front - runners , there is nary a success in site .
However , they do have something in common .
The commonality is an inflated sense of political accomplishment , and a willingness to be deceitful about it .
Hillary was elected to hold office somewhere that she had never lived .
She was elected based on her husband ’s name .
John Edwards ?
Well , he lost a presidential nomination , then went on to lose as a Vice Presidential candidate .
That ’s a record of accomplishment that I like to see for Democratic Party candidates , but I doubt it ’s one that party leaders are excited about .
Obama ?
He has spent most of his months in the Senate running for President .
A presidential campaign does n’t leave a whole lot of time to actually accomplish anything .
The deceit I mention comes in packages both small and large .
Lack of accomplishment is the large deceit that ties our unholy troika together .
The smaller deceptions are starting to pile up as the campaign season continues .
John Edwards has always been deceitful in that he “ exaggerates ” about his poor upbringing .
His middle class youth is well documented , elsewhere .
He talks of “ Two Americas ” , even as he is moving in to one of the largest homes ever built in North Carolina .
Obama ’s deceit is in the fact that he believes he is qualified to be President .
Well educated and smart , yes .
Experience in running a large government ?
None .
He is an illusion of a candidate .
He offers liberals a false hope of November success , all the while his candidacy hides his dirty little secret - that there is no there , there .
If he were a city , he would be Houston .
If he were an actress he’d be Paris Hilton .
If he were an author he would be , well he would be Barrack Obama .
He has no substance , and he will prove to be a political lightweight by the end of the campaign .
Hillary is the more interesting , at least .
Whether she is lying about investments , or failing the bar exam , at least she thinks big .
What is her latest controversy ?
Her campaign is feeding answers to “ random ” audience members at her speeches .
And , of course there is “ waitressgate ” .
The waitress is still sticking by her story , while Hillary ’s campaign staff insists that they paid the restaurant and tipped the server .
The list goes on for Hillary .
There is her Flip - flopping on the war .
Her failed Investments at Whitewater and in cattle are legendary .
Her insistence on hiring of Craig Livingstone to head Whitehouse security is , frankly , confusing .
All of these bore Hillary ’s fingerprints , and resulted in scandals .
All resulted in multiple deceptions against the American people .
Deception is old news in politics , though never has one party ever been so adapt at it .
The Democrats have raised deception to a new art form .
As , it spreads from candidate to candidate like a malevolent virus , it is this deception that will destroy their hopes in the ’08 election cycle .
The Democrats will continue running their family business as normal .
Deception is the name of the game , and it is a game that they play better than anyone .
They will continue to lie about who shoulders the burden of taxation , and who benefited from tax cuts .
They will lie about the war .
They will smear our candidates .
Today , I covered deceit in the Democratic Party .
I ’m not blind , I saw what deceit did to the Republican Party .
Tomorrow , I ’ll write about how deception brought down the Republicans in ’ 06 , and how honesty will lead to the rebirth of the conservative movement in ‘ 08 .
It will be a rebirth that may well reside within the spirit of an unlikely candidate ...
[ There are a number of different approaches to communities and building that serve to support sustainability ( and often other aims at the same time ; sustainable strategies are almost invariably diverse and multi-faceted in the benefits they offer ) .
Over the next few weeks , I intend to take a look at a number of th
ese types of communities and the ways each of them contribute to improving overall sustainability . ]
New Urbanism ( sometimes referred to as Traditional Neighborhood Design ) is a movement spearheaded by the The Congress for the New Urbanism ( CNU ) .
Its goals are “ promoting walkable , neighborhood - based development as an alternative to sprawl .
CNU takes a proactive , multi- disciplinary approach to restoring our communities . ”
Improving sustainability is one of the Principles of New Urbanism ( see below ) , additionally , New Urbanism advocates a number of benefits .
Although there are broad overlaps between using historical , traditional housing forms ( or , unfortunately more often , faux - historical looking buildings ) and New Urbanist principles , there is nothing magical about gabled roofs and wood siding , and New Urbanism does not require retro-styled throwbacks ( although many examples of it do combine visual historical revivalism with the good community principles it supports ) .
Much of the attention we pay to green building deals with the parts and pieces and how our buildings work .
Greener buildings use less energy for thermal comfort ( heating and cooling ) and less energy for lighting and draw on fewer resources ( and less impact from the materials that are used ) in their construction .
All of these are good and useful steps to take .
However , all of this just takes into account the building itself , and perhaps the site it rests upon .
With this kind of focus ( or lack thereof ) one could envision a community of dispersed “ green ” buildings all individually well designed and well made , but , in the aggregate , contributing hugely to the destruction of habitat , the depletion of resources , and the net degradation of the environment .
The best - intentioned and highest - rated building could , in fact , be less green in its overall effect if its location is responsible for adverse effects .
A building that is located close to an urban center does not need new roads built , unlike a greenfield development .
New utility connections require less materials and labor when the building is close to existing services .
A new condominium development could be designed with stringent water use and reclamation standards , for example , but the adverse impact of the extra roads needed to reach it could more than outweigh all the positive steps undertaken for the project .
A building may significantly reduce the amount of energy it requires to operate , but if it takes more energy to get to and from that building , how much of a benefit does that improvement really represent ?
Looking at the forest , rather than concentrating on the individual trees ( to mangle a metaphor ) means considering sustainability from a number of scales .
In addition to looking at the sustainability of the building as a self - contained unit , it also needs to be considered in terms of how it interrelates with the other buildings and the broader community it belongs to .
Just as trying to sell more soap ( or T - shirts , or whatever ) simply because they are organic and sustainably produced overlooks the more basic question of whether or not that product is even needed in the first place .
Similarly , building green buildings out in the exurbs encourages sprawl and contributes as much ( or more ) to environmental degradation .
A modest building built on a vacant lot in the city will be more sustainable in a number of important ways , though it wo n’t get the acclaim that a LEED Protactinium Level building might get , though it may be the more environmentally responsible of the the two .
New Urbanist neighborhoods are in place across the country .
People who live in these communities find the vitality and liveability afforded by having their neighborhoods designed with people in mind , rather than cars , to be a great benefit .
At Bradburn Village in Westminster , Colorado , neighbors are holding weekly group gatherings because the configuration and proximity of their homes makes such things possible .
Every home in Bradburn includes a large front porch , not just a token two - foot , concrete stoop .
Garages are all in the back , and homes here also have very small setbacks ( the distance between the house and the sidewalk or front yard ) , meaning the porches sit right above the sidewalks .
This means that people sitting on their front porches easily see neighbors walking by and they stop to talk , creating a community bond that is so elusive in most traditional suburban neighborhoods .
Other community features that encourage social interaction among neighbors include public spaces such as the many pocket parks — every home in the development is a 5 minute walk from one of these green spaces — wide sidewalks , and an interconnected street grid ( no cul - de - sacs ) that makes the community very pedestrian - friendly .
As a result of these design features , Bradburn ’s residents all know each other , and many have become close , meaning that if you want to socialize with your friends over a few drinks , you just wander on down to the park or walk 5 minutes to your buddy ’s home .

When the Audubon society built its new headquarters in the early 1990s it chose to renovate an existing 19th century office building in downtown New York City , rather than building a new building in a bucolic setting .
Although that might reflect some people ’s expectations , it would carry with it a number of adverse impacts .
Choosing a walkable , transit - networked , well - supported site was more in line with the organization ’s goals than the simple image of a new building set in a sylvan glade .
New Urbanist guidelines help steer the wider community toward more livable and sustainable goals , and can compound and amplify the benefits of good sustainable building design , rather than letting those effects be diluted but impacts caused outside the immediate bounds of the property line .
Principles of New Urbanism
1. Walkability - Most things within a 10 - minute walk of home and work .
Pedestrian friendly street design
2. Connectivity - Interconnected street grid network disperses traffic & eases walking
3. Mixed - Use & Diversity - A mix of shops , offices , apartments , and homes on site .
Mixed - use within neighborhoods , within blocks , and within buildings .
Diversity of people – of ages , income levels , cultures , and races
4. Mixed Housing – A range of types , sizes and prices in closer proximity
5. Quality Architecture & Urban Design – Emphasis on beauty , aesthetics , human comfort , and creating a sense of place
6. Traditional Neighborhood Structure - Transect planning : Highest densities at town center ; progressively less dense towards the edge .
7. Increased Density - More buildings , residences , shops , and services closer together for ease of walking , to enable a more efficient use of services and resources , and to create a more convenient , enjoyable place to live .
8. Smart Transportation - Pedestrian - friendly design that encourages a greater use of bicycles , rollerblades , scooters , and walking as daily transportation
9. Sustainability - Minimal environmental impact of development and its operations .
More local production .
More walking , less driving
10 . Quality of Life – Taken together these add up to a high quality of life well worth living , and create places that enrich , uplift , and inspire the human spirit .

One of the really bad ideas that drive some of the worst government actions is the notion that wealth is somehow fixed , and that by implication all wealth is acquired at someone else 's expense .
I am working on my annual tax - day post on the zero sum fallacy , but in the mean time here is a brief quiz .
The quiz consists of matching a description to the owners of these two houses :
One house has hot and cold running water , central air conditioning , electricity and flush toilets .
The other does not .
One owner has a a computer , a high speed connection to the Internet , a DVD player with a movie collection , and several television sets .
The other has none of these things .
One owner has a refrigerator , a vacuum cleaner , a toaster oven , an iPod , an alarm clock that plays music in the morning , a coffee maker , and a decent car .
The other has none of these .
One owner has ice cubes for his lemonade , while the other has to drink his warm in the summer time .
One owner can pick up the telephone and do business with anyone in the world , while the other had to travel by train and ship for days ( or weeks ) to conduct business in real time .
I think most of you have guessed by now that the homeowner with all the wonderful products of wealth , from cars to stereo systems , lives on the right ( the former home of a friend of mine in the Seattle area ) .
The home on the left was owned by Mark Hopkins , railroad millionaire and one of the most powerful men of his age in California .
Hopkins had a mansion with zillions of rooms and servants to cook and clean for him , but he never saw a movie , never listened to music except when it was live , never crossed the country in less than a week .
And while he could afford numerous servants around the house , Hopkins ( like his business associates ) tended to work 6 and 7 day weeks of 70 hours or more , in part due to the total lack of business productivity tools ( telephone , computer , air travel , etc. ) we take for granted .
Hopkins likely never read after dark by any light other than a flame .
If Mark Hopkins or any of his family contracted cancer , TB , polio , heart disease , or even appendicitis , they would probably die .
All the rage today is to moan about people 's access to health care , but Hopkins had less access to health care than the poorest resident of East St. Louis .
Hopkins died at 64 , an old man in an era where the average life span was in the early forties .
He saw at least one of his children die young , as most others of his age did .
In fact , Stanford University owes its founding to the early death ( at 15 ) of the son of Leland Stanford , Hopkin 's business partner and neighbor .
The richest men of his age had more than a ten times greater chance of seeing at least one of their kids die young than the poorest person in the US does today .
Hopkin 's mansion pictured above was eventually consumed in the fires of 1906 , in large part because San Francisco 's infrastructure and emergency services were more backwards than those of many third world nations today .
Here is a man , Mark Hopkins , who was one of the richest and most envied men of his day .
He owned a mansion that would dwarf many hotels I have stayed in .
He had servants at his beck and call .
And I would not even consider trading lives or houses with him .
What we sometimes forget is that we are all infinitely more wealthy than even the richest of the " robber barons " of the 19th century .
We have longer lives , more leisure time , and more stuff to do in that time .
Not only is the sum of wealth not static , but it is expanding so fast that we can't even measure it .
Charts like those here measure the explosion of income , but still fall short in measuring things like leisure , life expectancy , and the explosion of possibilities we are all able to comprehend and grasp .
More , coming soon ...
Update :
An example of why this topic is always timely :
Paul Krugman foresees an increasing left - leaning electorate .
The cause ?
The main force driving this shift to the left is probably rising income inequality .
According to Pew , there has recently been a sharp increase in the percentage of Americans who agree with the statement that " the rich get richer while the poor get poorer . " 
Russel Roberts goes on to tear into this red meat .

Chatting with Adrian Holovaty 2008 January 01 , 02:01 h
So , as my very first post of the year ( published at 0:01hs ! ) , I would like to celebrate the great minds of our ‘ development ’ community , wishing that the good developers use their time creating great technology instead of wasting it in useless flame wars .
For me this is an important piece because I always say that technology does n’t have to be about divorce .
Technology is about integration .
I am a full - time Ruby on Rails developer and evangelist , but above all , I try to be a ‘ good ’ programmer .
And good programmers acknowledge good technology and their creators achievements .
And Adrian ’s Django is such a remarkable achievement that deserves the attention and success .
As I promised after the Avi Bryant interview , here ’s a great conversation with Adrian Holovaty , well known creator of the Django web framework written in Python .
AkitaOnRails :
As I always do , let ’s start by talking a little bit about yourself .
How long have you been a programmer ?
Adrian Holovaty : Let ’s see —
I ’ve been tinkering with computers since I was a little boy playing with the Commodore 64 in the mid ’ 80s .
One early program I wrote was for the TI - 85 calculator in my high - school math class .
By the time I graduated , a whole bunch of students were using it , because it had all the formulas and stuff .
I did n’t take any of this stuff seriously until college , when I minored in computer science .
But I did n’t end up finishing the minor , which is something I ’ve always been bummed about .
My college major was journalism , as I originally wanted to be a newspaper reporter , but after I took a job with the Web site of the campus newspaper ( The Maneater – best name for a newspaper ever ! ) , I realized I would have a lot more fun working online than with a dead - tree product .
So I ended up finding a way to combine journalism / news and computer programming , and I ’ve had a number of jobs doing exactly that !
AkitaOnRails :
And what led you to the computer world ?
Adrian : I guess it was in my upbringing , as my dad has been a computer programmer since the ’ 70s , back in the punchcard days .
I remember seeing all sorts of those punchcards in our house when I was growing up .
AkitaOnRails :
And , of course , how did you met and fell in love with Python ?
Adrian : My Web development path was ( I think ) pretty typical , at least based on the experiences of my friends and colleagues .
I originally learned how to write Perl CGI scripts in a college Web development course .
Then I taught myself PHP because somebody recommended it to me .
After doing Web development with PHP for a few years , I got kind of tired of it .
At that time , I was working with Simon Willison at a newspaper Web site in Lawrence , Kansas .
Simon and I were both getting tired of PHP and decided to “ dive into Python ” ( pun intended ) by reading Mark Pilgrim ‘s excellent book of the same name , which was released around that time .
This must ’ve been late 2002 .
We immediately fell in love with Python .
And when I say “ immediately , ” I really do mean it .
It was like a revelation , some sort of divine moment .
It was the programming equivalent of love at first sight .
So Simon and I decided that , from then on , we were going to code everything in Python .
That ’s one of the perks of working for a small Web development shop — we could make those kinds of snap decisions ! ï¿¼
AkitaOnRails : I was first introduced to Python around 2000 as well .
But it was through web development using Zope .
I think it got a lot of attention at the time .
Did you ever tried it ?
Adrian :
No , I never tried Zope .
Still , to this day , I ’ve never tried it .
And I ’ve been told that ’s a good thing , because evidently it turned some people off of Python back then , for whatever reason .
( Their newest version is supposed to be a ton better , but I have n’t tinkered with it , either . )
AkitaOnRails :
You ’re right , and it is kind of amusing because a lot of pythonists from Brazil still use Plone ( I think it evolved from Zope but I did n’t try it as well ) .
So ,
We all know that Django was born out of necessity when you were developing websites for World Online .
Please describe how did you begin there and how is the everyday work there .
Maybe what led you to Django during your work day ?
Adrian : Sure !
Well , generally when people think of newspapers , they think of crotchety , old - fashioned editors and reporters scribbling in paper notebooks with pencils .
This Kansas newspaper that I worked at was the completely opposite of that .
It ’s beyond the scope of this interview , but for a number of reasons that newspaper Web site attracted ( and still attracts , to this day ) a really great development team – one that I would stack up against any team 10 times its size .
We were doing “ Web 2.0 ” stuff back in 2002 and 2003 , and we were building Web apps in days , not weeks or months .
This was mostly due to the journalism environment – newspaper people like deadlines .
ï¿¼
So we were in this culture of “ Web development on journalism deadlines , ” and we needed some tools that let us create Web applications quickly .
We looked around at some existing Python libraries at the time ( 2003 ) , and we ended up deciding to write our own stuff .
We did n’t set about to make a framework – it was a very classic , clichÃ©d path , actually !
What happened was , we built a site with Python .
Then we built another one , and we realized the sites had a fair amount of code in common , so we did the right thing and extracted the common bits into a library .
We kept doing this – extracting and extracting , based on each new Web application that we created – and eventually we had a framework .
AkitaOnRails :
As a side - note , actually this is kind of interesting !
I would love to hear what do you think World Online has that attracts good developers like yourself there !
Just a summary would be ok .
That ’s the kind of insight brazilian companies have to learn better .
Letting you do Python is probably one of them ï¿ ¼
Adrian : Yeah , it kind of comes down to empowering the employees .
My boss , who led the Web team , delegated all the technology decisions to me and Simon .
That kind of culture really encourages quality work , because it makes everybody on the team more invested .
ï¿¼
AkitaOnRails :
You ’re right .
Traditional companies would rather have a more hierarchical ( and bureaucratic ) approach , with a dumb manager holding the whip .
But I digress .
So , I particularly dislike language x VS language y or framework a vs framework b kind of comparisons .
Instead I ’d like to hear what do you think is great about Python – the language and the platform – and Django .
What are the features in Django that you hold dear to yourself , I mean , those bits of functionality that you actually think for yourself as ‘ the’ greatest ideas ?
Adrian :
Well , I love abstractions – like , I suspect , any programmer .
At its core , Django is just a set of abstractions of common Web development tasks .
It gives me joy to create high - level abstractions , to encapsulate a large problem in such a way that is made simple .
What I really like about Django is the depth and breadth of abstractions that it provides .
And in most cases ( I hope ! ) , they ’re clean , easy to use and understandable .
Let me give you an example of an abstraction : creating an RSS feed .
When you create an RSS feed , you do n’t want to have to deal with remembering angle brackets , and the exact formatting of the feed — you just care about the items in the feed .
So Django provides a very simple library that lets you give it a bunch of items and creates a feed from them .
So that ’s an obvious example , but what really excite me are the higher - level abstractions , like the concept of an “ admin site . ”
Django comes with a completely dynamic application that makes a beautiful , production - ready CRUD site for your database .
There ’s no code to write – it ’s only a small bit of optional configuration .
There ’s also something called Databrowse , which is an abstraction of the concept “ Show me my data , as intelligent hypertext . ”
So whenever I ’m explaining Django to someone , I always end up saying , “ It ’s just a bunch of abstractions of common Web development tasks ” – from low - level HTTP wrapping to higher – and higher - level concepts .
The higher you get , the more productive you can be .
I apologize if this is too conceptual !
As for Python — what can I say ?
It ’s gorgeous .
It ’s like poetry .
It ’s so clean , so logical , so regular , so obvious .
And the import system is to - die - for .
A lot of people say Python code is easy to read / understand because of the consistent whitespace and simplicity of the language .
I agree with that , but I think it ’s also due to the elegant import system .
Why ?
Because if you want to know how any Python module works , just look at the code , and look at the modules it imports .
As the Zen of Python says , “ Namespaces are one honking great idea – let ’s do more of those ! ”
AkitaOnRails :
Tech communities are great because they are so energetic and passionate .
On one hand you have those that contribute and make the technology grow faster .
On the other hand you have the pundits and trolls that like flame wars .
Do you burn yourself sometimes , or do you tend to avoid this kind of discussion ?
Specifically , some time ago you and DHH were together at the Snakes and Rubies presentation .
I think it was great because it did n’t end in yet another flame war .
What ’s your opinion on this kind of open ( not flamed ) discussion ?
Adrian :
The answer to this one is obvious – clearly constructive discussion is more productive .
At times , I ’ve had my passion for Python / Django get the best of me , but I ’ve gotten a lot better over the years .
I ’ve realized something :
At the end of the day , what really matters is the sites people create with these tools , not the tools themselves .
If youâ€™re going to judge someone , judge the sites that person makes , instead of the tools that person uses .
These days , if I am involved in any sort of discussion like that , it ’s usually to try to calm people down .
ï¿¼
AkitaOnRails :
Well said .
Going back to features , you mentioned ‘ Databrowse ’ before , I would like to know more about it .
I think Django did n’t have it by the time I first tried it .
Is it a new feature ( or am I the one lagging behind ?
ï¿¼
Can you elaborate more on this construct ?
Adrian : Databrowse is still quite under the radar !
Here ’s the use case .
Say you have a lot of data in your database , and all you want to do is look at it .
Here are your current options :
You can drop into the psql or mysql prompts and run a bunch of SELECT queries , but that gets tiresome .
You could run something like PHPMy Admin , but that ’s more of an administration tool than a tool for browsing .
You could use some sort of external application that lets you browse your database tables , MS Access - style , but that ’s in the realm of the desktop app .
Databrowse automatically creates a Web site that displays your data , so you can click around to your heart ’s content .
The other thing it does is pointing out interesting , non-obvious queries .
For example , if you have a table that has a DATE column in it , it will automatically create a calendar view of that table .
The point is n’t for people to use this to make public - facing sites – the point is for people to use this to explore their own data , with no effort required .
Another use case comes from the journalism world .
I used to work with a guy named Derek Willis at the Washington Post newspaper .
His job at the time was to acquire huge datasets and place them on the newspaper ’s intranet , so that reporters could search and browse the data in their research .
Derek did n’t want to have to hand - roll a Web app each time he got a new dataset , so he used Databrowse to make intranet sites that displayed his databases — with little - to - no effort .
This comes back to what I was saying earlier about high - level abstractions .
Databrowse is a particular type of abstraction , and it ’s really cool that we include something like that for people to use , if they need it .
AkitaOnRails : Sounds great , I am looking forward to use it .
In a degree it feels like Dabble Db – albeit inside your own app .
I think you already met Avi Bryant ?
I just interviewed him and it was a very insightful conversation .
Have you ever tried Seaside ?
( out of curiosity I have a photo of you and Avi looking at his macbook sitting down in the grass , what was that ? )
Adrian :
Yes , it was inspired by DabbleDB – it ’s essentially a very toned - down DabbleDB-ish thing for your own data .
But I should n’t even say that , because DabbleDB is a whole universe more sophisticated than Databrowse .
DabbleDB is awesome . ï¿¼
Yes , I ’ve met Avi a number of times and always enjoy his company .
We even played some music together – he is a fantastic harmonica player !
The photo you ’re referring to was taken at Foo Camp in 2007 .
I have n’t tried Seaside , but it ’s on my to - do list .
If I were ever developing an application like DabbleDB that needed to maintain a ton of state , I would turn to Seaside first .
AkitaOnRails : I see , I feel that good musicians tend to be good programmers as well .
So , my first congratulations for you is about your new book on Django that was just released .
I think it is a very big milestone for the Django community .
More than that you were able to make it available online under a Creative Commons license .
How did you get involved in this book ?
Was it difficult to convince the publisher to have the book readily available online ?
I ask this because at least in Brazil this is one idea that is VERY hard to push over to publishers .
Tell us more about your writing experience , challenges and quirks along the way .
Adrian :
Thanks very much .
There ’s not much to the story here – co-conspirator Jacob and I got contacted by the Apress folks , who were interested in publishing a Django book , and we did it .
Well , I should amend that :
It took us a long time , but we did it .
ï¿¼
It was n’t difficult to convince Apress to let us make the book available online .
They had previous experience doing so with Mark Pilgrim ’s Dive Into Python book , and they ’re generally cool people .
In retrospect , publishing the book online was a fantastic decision .
Not only is the final book available online , but we made chapters available online as we wrote them , with a really nice per-paragraph commenting feature that let readers submit typos , corrections and suggestions on a very granular basis .
We got a ton of fantastic feedback for which we ’re immensely grateful .
Having experienced this , I would n’t want to publish a technology book any other way .
AkitaOnRails : Now , my second congratulations is because of that Batten Award for outstanding achievement in online journalism .
ChicagoCrime.org looks great and is a very good example of a mashup done right .
Unfortunately our local government and public institutions have very little to almost no data available online for us to use .
Where did the idea come from ?
How was its development ?
Adrian :
Thanks – and do n’t let that site scare you away from visiting the beautiful city of Chicago .
ï¿¼
AkitaOnRails : haha , I live in SÃ£o Paulo .
Ca n’t be worse ;-)
Adrian :
The idea for chicagocrime.org came when I was bumming around the official Chicago Police Department Web site and found that they publish crime data – although in an interface that ’s more suited for searching than for browsing .
I thought , “ Wow , this is some great data ! ” and was writing a screen scraper within about 10 minutes .
Around that same time , I was tinkering with the Google Maps site , which had just launched , to see if I could embed Google map tiles into my own Web pages .
I figured the crime data would make for a great mapping application , so I put the two together , and one of the original Google Maps mashups was born .
While I was developing the site , HousingMaps.com ( Craigslist + Google Maps ) came out , so it beat me to the punch of being the first real Google Maps mashup – but chicagocrime.org came soon afterward .
The thing I ’m most proud of is the fact that chicagocrime.org was one of the sites that influenced Google to open its mapping API .
Back when HousingMaps , chicagocrime.org and the original crop of mashups came out , we were all reverse - engineering Google ’s JavaScript !
AkitaOnRails : I know that you probably have 2 great passions in your career : one is Python - based development , or course , and the other is journalism ( dunno the correct order here ï¿¼ )
You ’ve made yourself quite a reputation on the online media .
You ’re working at the Washington Post right now , is that correct ?
I read an article at the OJR where you explained about technology being used to empower the journalist .
Do you intend to be a reporter someday or you ’re more into the back - end of journalism ?
I think you have a strong opinion about the future of journalism in the Internet Era , do n’t you ?
Adrian :
Well , I would say my main passion is music , but it ’s hard to make a living doing that .
( Django is named after the famous jazz idol Django Reinhardt )
ï¿¼
I ’m no longer working at the Washington Post .
In mid 2007 , I was awarded a two - year grant from the Knight Foundation to create a local - news site .
So I founded EveryBlock in July .
We ’re a team of four people and are working hard to make a really cool application .
But , yes , going back to your question , I certainly have some strong opinions about how journalism is practiced on the Internet .
This is probably out of the scope of this interview , but you can read my essay / rant awkwardly titled A fundamental way newspaper sites need to change for a taste .
AkitaOnRails : Now , that ’s news to me ï¿ ¼
Did n’t know you started your own company ( sorry , I still have to catch up with the Python community ) .
Can you tell us about your new endeavor ?
Adrian :
Hey , I ca n’t blame ya – we ’re staying under the radar .
There ’s not much to say about EveryBlock at this point other than it ’s chicagocrime.org on steroids .
It ’s like chicagocrime , but for more cities than just Chicago and more information than just crime .
ï¿¼
AkitaOnRails :
You should try it for Brazil :-)
Adrian :
Thanks to Django ’s internationalization framework , that is entirely possible .
ï¿¼
AkitaOnRails : Yeah , and by the way , ( digressing a little ) I would recommend the brazilian movie Elite Squad now that I know you ’re interested in crime related data ;-)
Adrian : Noted !
I ’ve added “ Elite Squad ” to my MOVIES_TO_WATCH .TXT :-)
AkitaOnRails : Going on .
Many great websites are already deployed over Django .
Your own works at World Online , Washington Post being some of them .
Another big name is Kevin Rose ’s Pownce ( the creator of Digg ) .
You , Kevin and other influential people usually meet during conferences , do n’t you ?
What do you think influenced him to try Django ?
Another great thing about Pownce has to be Leah Culver .
A programmer like her is simply unheard of here in Brazil , which is a pity .
You should make her the official Django cheerleader !
Adrian : I ’ve never met Kevin Rose , but from what I ’ve read , I believe Leah chose to use Django because either it had been recommended to her , or she liked Python , or something .
I do n’t know the backstory .
I have n’t met Leah , either , but she was cool enough to travel to Lawrence , Kansas , for our last Django sprint a few weeks ago ( which I could n’t attend in person , unfortunately ) .
AkitaOnRails :
It is not a rule written in stone , but in Rails community we ‘ tend ’ to praise Mac related tech .
Of course , it is not a requirement for any language and Linux is as good .
But what can I say ?
I am an Apple fanboy ï¿¼ I would like to know what ’s your development environment .
What tools do you use to develop your Django - based websites ?
Adrian : I recently switched to a Mac after several years of using Linux on the desktop , but do n’t read anything into that —
I ’m not a fanboy by any means , of either Linux or Mac .
I miss Linux , to be honest , and in a number of ways I ’ve been unimpressed by OS X’s Unix features .
( Basic stuff such as readline support in the default Python is broken , etc. )
The nice things about the Mac make it worth the switch , though .
Even after having used the Mac as my primary machine for 6 months , I ’m still impressed that I can just close the laptop and it ’ll go to sleep automatically .
That never worked with Linux !
AkitaOnRails : I ask this because many people looking at Rails and Django are Java and C# programmers that are used to have a full blown IDE .
I usually say that any common text editor does the job , and if you really want power vim and emacs are a perfect fit .
What do you say ?
Adrian : I ’ve never used an IDE to program , so I ’m the wrong person to ask .
Actually , I misspoke – I used an IDE - ish thing in college to program assembly .
It showed the contents of the accumulators and that stuff .
AkitaOnRails :
Oh , I almost forgot to ask : did you and Guido van Rossum ever met ?
I would like to know your opinion about the Python 3000 development .
Is there anything that ’s in the new version that you really anticipate ?
ï¿¼
Adrian :
Yes , I ’ve met Guido a number of times and was even lucky enough to have dinner with him once !
It ’s almost silly and unnecessary to say this , but he is incredibly smart .
I really like the new concepts and features in Python 3000 , and I had the opportunity to participate in a sprint at Google Chicago a couple of months ago .
My favorite feature is the migration to Unicode strings by default , because it forces the encoding issue front and center .
AkitaOnRails : Finally , what was all the fuss about Django being versioned 1.0 or jumping straight to 2.0 ?
I did n’t follow the discussions , just read some headlines a while back .
And what can people expect for the next release of Django ?
I understand that you do n’t go big bang releases that changes the game , but what do you see getting released in the next few months in terms of new features ?
Adrian :
Ha – this is an amusing story .
I ’ve gotten worn out by people constantly asking “ When is 1.0 coming out ?
When is 1.0 coming out ? ”
My response always is , “ Why do you need an arbitrary number assigned to the product ?
Many people are using the current version , so do n’t hold back .
Version numbers are pretty meaningless . ”
So I suggested on the django - developers mailing list that we assign the version number “ 2.0 , ” as if to reinforce the fact that version numbers are indeed arbitrary .
But , having given it some more thought , I ’ve changed my mind on that .
The amount of confusion it would cause would not be justified by the amount of rebellious pleasure I would get out of it .
As far as upcoming features , there are a number of ongoing branches of the Django codebase that will all eventually be folded into the main trunk .
One is a branch called newforms - admin , which dramatically improves the amount of customization developers can make to the Django admin site .
Another is queryset - refactor , which is a refactoring of our database layer , again , to make it more extensible .
Other than that , there are a few small features that we need to wrap up , and it ’ll be time for 1.0 .
AkitaOnRails : Haha , I think you ’re right , I do n’t like this ‘ cult of the dot - oh ’ as well , it ’s pretty meaningless for an open source project that ’s constantly evolving .
But some people do have some concerns specially in a more enterprisey - like environment .
Anyway , and for those that want to see Django in action , what are the websites that you recommend people visit ?
Some of the Washington Post , maybe ?
Of course , some of the great features – as the admin site – are only for admins ( duh ) ï¿ ¼
But people like to see ‘ living ’ things instead of a bunch of tutorials .
Adrian :
As an aside , I see that Rails David just wrote a rant about the same topic .
Good Django - powered sites ?
Let ’s see – there ’s Tabblo , a photo - sharing and editing site that has some really nice interactive features .
There ’s Curse.com , the massive online - gaming site .
There ’s lawrence.com , a site I helped build , which is one of the best local - entertainment sites in the world ( if I may say ! ) .
And there ’s a site ( I forget its name ) that will print a paper book from a series of Wikipedia articles that you specify – that blew my mind , the first time I saw it .
AkitaOnRails :
So , I think we are done ï¿¼ :-)
That was a very pleasant conversation .
I wish you have a great New Year .
Adrian :
Thanks for the great questions and conversation , and happy new year !
Scientists at a British biotech company said they have evidence that their genetically modified mosquitoes , which are programmed for sudden , early death , can control the spread of dengue fever .
Dengue is carried by mosquitoes and is the scourge of urban areas in the developing world , much as malaria is in rural regions .
The company , Oxitec , said it can decimate mosquito populations by breeding genetically modified male mosquitoes , then releasing them to mate with wild females .
Their offspring contain lethal genes that kill them young , before they can reproduce .
Company officials told Wired News that their latest test results show that the genetically modified bugs can breed just as well as wild ones .
" We will be able to control dengue through controlling the mosquitoes that transmit it , especially in large urban areas , " said the company 's chief scientist Luke Alphey .
" Thereby protecting many , many millions of people from this disease . "
Mosquitoes pass dengue fever to up to 100 million people each year , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Up to 5 million die .
If the scientists can replicate their results in real field conditions , their technology could kill half of the next generation of dengue mosquitoes , which scientists say would significantly reduce the spread of the disease .
If all goes well the company envisions releasing the insects in Malaysia on a large scale in three years .
Oxitec 's latest research , which company scientists will present in February at the IX International Symposium on Vectors and Vector - borne Diseases in Puri , India , included an independent evaluation by Malaysia 's Institute for Medical Research , part of the country 's Ministry of Health , said S.S. Vasan , Oxitec 's head of public health , in an e-mail .
The results showed that up to 50 percent of wild female mosquitoes mated with Oxitec 's genetically modified male mosquitoes .
The company 's work has attracted the interest of some of the world 's economic honchos .
At the Davos Economic Forum this week , Alphey will receive one of 39 Technology Pioneer Awards .
The Gates Foundation 's Global Challenges in Global Health initiative is giving Oxitec $ 5 million over the next five years .
The company has also received several million dollars in venture capital from East Hill Management Company and Oxford Capital Partners .
Oxitec 's technology is a variation of a proven process called " sterile insect technique , " which scientists have already used to eliminate the screwworm and the Mediterranean fruit fly from North America .
It involves irradiating male insects , causing mutations that make them sterile .
When released into the wild , they mate with females who then fail to reproduce .
But the amount of radiation used in that technique kills mosquitoes .
So in a twist on the sterile insect technique , Alphey discovered a way to genetically program the bugs to die unless they 're fed the common antibiotic tetracycline .
By postponing death with tetracycline , the scientists can keep the altered bugs alive long enough to breed them in large numbers .
When released into the wild , they no longer receive tetracycline so the previously silenced gene springs into action .
The bugs stay alive long enough to breed with wild females , but their offspring die young .
In other words , the mosquitoes are genetically poisoned , but Alphey 's team provides the antidote until they are released in the wild .
" It occurred to me that this could be used to give death , sterility or whatever you want in insects , " Alphey said .
Alphey 's approach to genetic modification is different from other research on so - called population replacement efforts , which aim to " inoculate " the mosquito population against dengue , which would , in turn , prevent them from passing it to humans .
Oxitec 's technique is considered less controversial by some scientists because the genetically modified insects are programmed to die , not take over the existing mosquito population .
But as with genetically modified crop companies like Monsanto , Oxitec could face a backlash from a wary public .
Greenpeace , among others , oppose genetic engineering of organisms that could be released into the wild .
" Releasing millions of genetically modified terminator mosquitoes into wild ecosystems amounts to a reckless and uncontrolled experiment with a risky technology , " said Jim Thomas , of the ETC Group , a technology watchdog .
" Oxitec 's ( project ) abandons all pretense of containment or possible recall .
I wonder what sort of liability they are willing to assume if something goes wrong ? "
Thomas also questioned Oxitec 's core technology – a regulatory switch that uses tetracycline .
" The assumption is that the insects will not encounter tetracycline in the wild and yet tetracycline , naturally derived from a soil bacteria , is widely used in agriculture , " Thomas said .
" Genetically engineered insects for pest control are a literal disaster waiting to happen , " said Ronnie Cummins , director of the Organic Consumers Association , in an e-mail .
Alphey , however , believes the benefits – potentially combating dengue as well as cutting down on pesticide use – will stave off public protests .
" Clearly , there will be people who are completely closed to the idea , no matter what the benefit , " Alphey said .
" But … people know about malaria and dengue and these sorts of things .
They know they do n't want them .
They really see the point in what people ( like us ) are trying to do . "
Thomas Miller , an entomologist at the University of California at Riverside who has worked with Alphey on a cotton - crop pest , said the current mosquito population control options are not good .
They generally involve using insecticides or destroying their standing - water larval hatching grounds .
In urban areas where dengue fever mosquitoes grow , however , it has proven difficult to eliminate small sources of water in empty coke cans , spare tires and gutters .
On the other hand , low - tech options like bed nets have helped reduce rates of mosquito - borne infection , without reducing mosquito populations .
Oxitec is also working on genetically modified versions of fruit flies , pink bollworms and coding moths .
Blackwater , the private security company recently accused of killing people , is in big trouble .
I mean big , big trouble .
Now , they 're accused of killing a dog .
And not just any dog , but a dog belonging to the New York Times !
So much for the PR blitz .
Reuters reports on this latest bizarre twist of the Blackwater saga :
Staff at the newspaper 's Baghdad bureau said Blackwater bodyguards shot Hentish dead last week before a visit by a U.S. diplomat to the Times compound .
Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said the dog had attacked one of Blackwater 's bomb - sniffer dogs while a security team was sweeping the compound for explosives .
" The K - 9 handler made several unsuccessful attempts to get the dog to retreat , including placing himself between the dogs .
When those efforts failed , the K - 9 handler unfortunately was forced to use a pistol to protect the company 's K - 9 and himself , " she said in an e-mail to Reuters .
Frankly , I 'm more of a cat person myself , but shooting an unarmed mut seems a tad extreme .
I mean , ever heard of pepper spray ?
Anyhow , does n't matter whose fault it is : Blackwater has no idea what they 're in for .
Animal lovers can get nutty .
Do n't believe me ?
Note that Reuters gives the name of the lovable pup , " Hentish . "

Thanks to all of you who participated in our recent survey .
We wanted to know what issues you were most interested in working on .
More than 10,000 of you responded .
And the results are now in .
RAWSTORY — Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) says he ’s hatched a plan that will secure health care for children , help to restore America ’s reputation around the world , and empower the the Democratic party to rediscover the courage of its convictions .
He calls it “ impeachment hearings . ”
Appearing in his home state for a meeting of the Palm Beach County Democratic Executive Committee last week , Wexler told the crowd that if Congress were to hold hearings on the impeachment of Vice President Dick Cheney , the move would advance a wide array of Democratic legislative priorities and even help a more “ popular ” United States head off foreign policy crises .
The remarks were first reported by the Palm Beach Post ’s George Bennett .
“ The way we pass stem - cell research , the way we get implemented a children ’s health care plan , the way we get higher CAFE [ corporate average fuel economy ] standards to bring our energy debacle into a better condition for generations to come is to have impeachment hearings , ” Wexler said , appearing to nearly run out breath at one point during his speech .
“ Because that ’ll get the president ’s eye .
That ’ll get the vice president ’s eye .
That for the first time will show that the Democratic majority is here , and that in fact we have the courage of our convictions , and that we ’re not bound to be tied by conventional wisdom . ”
Wexler said that impeachment hearings were n’t just an option available to Congress , but a requirement .
“ This administration has abused its power in office … and it is the obligation — not discretionary — but it is the obligation of this Congress to investigate , ” he said .
“ And that ’s what I and some of my colleagues are beginning to call for . ”
Later , Wexler suggested the US was sorely in need of popularity boost in the world community .

Meet Barack Obama , the next president of the United States of America .
Unstoppable momentum is now a gale force wind propelling Barack Obama towards the Democratic nomination .
That same wind is blowing stiffly in the face of Hillary Clinton and even more so ( when it comes to the presidential election ) John McCain .
Grass roots will carry the banner for the first time since McGovern in 1972 .
Barack Obama will win the Democratic nomination and go on to beat McCain in the presidential election of 2008 .
The reason , believe it or not , is an attitude change about " walking away " .
This might sound strange so let 's start with a recap of what I said in Moral Obligations Of Walking Away .
National Referendum On Walking Away
Most do n't realize it but there is currently a national referendum on walking away that is page one news every single day .
I am talking about decision 2008 , the presidential election .
Will we walk away from Iraq or not ?
A vote for John McCain is a vote for the status quo of wasting trillions more dollars and countless more lives in Iraq .
A Vote for Obama is a vote for exiting that hellhole and having discussions with Iran .
A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for wishy washiness , political expediency , and the same stubborn unwillingness to admit mistakes that we see in Bush .
For the record , I voted for none of the above in the primary .
I voted for Ron Paul .
But like it or not , barring some sort of miracle one of the above is going to win the presidency .
The moral obligations of walking away from Iraq
Do we have a moral obligation to spend money in Iraq after we blew it to smithereens ?
Do we have a moral obligation to admit mistakes and stop wasting lives of soldiers ?
Do we have a moral obligation to repair the decaying infrastructure of the US instead of attempting to be the world 's policeman ?
Do we have a moral obligation to the Citizens of the US to get out of the region , given that being in the region dramatically escalates the risk of terrorism against the US ?
Do we have a moral obligation to stop wasting billions of dollars in jet fuel flying needless missions all over the world when crude oil prices are so high ?
Is there a moral obligation to let Europe and Japan defend themselves rather than depending on US overseas bases and US taxpayer dollars to defend them ?
Is there a moral obligation for the US to walks away from Europe and Japan with so many suffering here ?
Where people " draw the line " on walking away is going to play a major role in determining the next president of the United States .
Poll : Leaving Iraq will help economy
AP Poll : Stimulus Checks Welcome , but to Really Help the Economy US Should Leave Iraq .
The heck with Congress ' big stimulus bill .
The way to get the country out of recession — and most people think we 're in one — is to get the country out of Iraq , according to an Associated Press - Ipsos poll .
Pulling out of the war ranked first among proposed remedies in the survey , followed by spending more on domestic programs , cutting taxes and , at the bottom end , giving rebates to poor people in hopes they 'll spend the economy into recovery .
The $ 168 billion economic rescue package Congress rushed to approval this week includes rebates of $ 600 to $ 1,200 for most taxpayers , the hope being that they will spend the money and help revive ailing businesses .
President Bush is expected to sign the measure next week .
Poor wage - earners , as well as seniors and veterans who live almost entirely off Social Security and disability benefits , would get $ 300 checks .
However , just 19 percent of the people surveyed said they planned to go out and spend the money ; 45 percent said they 'd use it to pay bills .
And nearly half said what the government really should do is get out of Iraq .
Forty - eight percent said a pullout would help fix the country 's economic problems " a great deal , " and an additional 20 percent said it would help at least somewhat .
Some 43 percent said increasing government spending on health care , education and housing programs would help a great deal ; 36 percent said cutting taxes .
" Let 's stop paying for this war , " said Hilda Sanchez , 44 , of Waterford , Calif .
" There are a lot of people who are struggling .
We can use the money to pay for medical care and help people who were put out of their homes . "
People Sick Of War For Economic Reasons
President Bush submitted a federal budget of $ 3.1 trillion on Monday , declaring that the spending plan would keep the United States safe and prosperous and , despite its record size , would adhere to his principle of letting Americans keep as much of their own money as possible .
“ Thanks to the hard work of the American people and spending discipline in Washington , we are now on a path to balance the budget by 2012 , ” the president said in an introductory message .
We Can No Longer Afford To Be The World 's Policeman

What Hath War Bought ?
The Great Divider
Why Hillary Will Fail To Win The Nomination
Hillary will fail because she is as stubborn as Bush .
Hillary will fail because she is as arrogant as Bush .
Hillary will fail because she cannot admit a mistake .
Hillary will fail because she supported the war .
Hillary will fail because she continues to lie about why she supported the war .
Hillary will fail because people do not trust here to exit Iraq .
Hillary will fail because she is an insider representing the status quo .
Hillary will fail because she too is a divider .
Why Obama Will Be The Next President
Obama is a uniter who will exit Iraq and talk with our enemies instead of attempting to bomb them into an attitude change .
Can Super Delegates Save The Day For Hillary ?
It ’s called the Democratic Party , but one aspect of the party ’s nominating process is at odds with grass - roots democracy .
Voters do n’t choose the 842 unpledged “ super - delegates ” who comprise nearly 40 percent of the number of delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination .
The category includes Democratic governors and members of Congress , former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter , former vice president Al Gore , retired congressional leaders such as Dick Gephardt , and all Democratic National Committee members , some of whom are appointed by party chairman Howard Dean .
In early 1970 ’s , the party ’s rules were reformed to open the process to grass - roots activists , women , and ethnic minorities .
Sen. George McGovern , the leading anti-Vietnam war liberal , won the 1972 nomination .
McGovern turned out to be a disaster as a presidential candidate , winning only one state and the District of Columbia .
So without reverting to the days of party bosses like Buckley , the Democrats decided to guarantee that elected officials would have a bigger voice in the nomination .
There were , Mayer says , two motives in giving elected officials a big voice in the nomination .
" One was not to get ( ideologically ) extreme candidates ; the other was to avoid the Jimmy Carter phenomenon — where you had a guy who was not very experienced and not very well regarded by most of his fellow governors , but nevertheless managed to win the party ’s nomination , " Mayer said .
But “ it is very difficult to argue ” that the super - delegate system “ has consequences , unintended or intended , ” said Mayer .
The only year when they may have an impact was in 1984 , he said .
The loyalty of Democratic elected officials probably helped Walter Mondale survive an unexpectedly strong challenge from Sen. Gary Hart who had beaten Mondale in New Hampshire and other primaries .
“ The super - delegates clearly gave him his majority and helped him wrap up the nomination earlier , ” Mayer said .
“ Do the super - delegates have the capacity to resist the choice of the overwhelming majority of primary voters and caucus participants ?
The answer , I think , is a clear ‘ No , ’ ” said Mayer .
Nevertheless , there ’s a romantic streak in some political junkies who fantasize about a scenario in which the nomination could still be in doubt at the end of the primary season .
That has n't happened in either party in 30 years .
Political Hacks and Warmongers Support Hillary
Yes We Can
This election is shaping up to be the first where technology will be both a medium and a message for the election .
The last four years have seen technology and the web weave themselves into politics and allow regular people to produce and distribute content that would have been unimaginable just an election ago .
The Black Eyed Peas and Jesse Dylan ( son of Bob ) may not count as ordinary voters , but their new music video " Yes We Can " is a model for the types of things that people can do today in this first campaign of the information age that never would have been possible before .
The new video overlays Barack Obama 's " Yes We Can " speech after the New Hampshire primary with music and accompaniment from stars like John Legend , Herbie Hancock , Common , Kareem Abdul Jabbar , Scarlett Johansson , Tatyana Ali and Nick Cannon .
It 's a perfect example of the types of content that never would have seen the light of day just four years ago - where could you have bought enough TV airtime to air a 4:30 television ad ?
How could you possibly have gotten enough nationwide exposure to make it possible ?

" I 'm blown away by how many people wanted to come and be a part of it in a short amount of time .
It was all out of love and hope for change and really representing America and looking at the world , " will .i.am told ABCNews on Friday .
The video , which just hit the web this weekend , has already begun to go viral in a big way .
I 've had friends send it to me on both Twitter and Facebook already and video views on YouTube are rising by the hour .
Plus , who knows how many times the original video has been viewed on YesWeCanSong.com ?
This video also speaks to another unique facet of " the First Campaign " : Creativity moves people and thus votes .
For decades , media consultants could be assured that their ads would be viewed on television because there were n't other options .
Now with the rise of TiVos and DVRs , commercials are a button press away from disappearing and the traditional advertising roadblock does n't work .
On the web , unless something makes you stop and say " That 's fascinating " you wo n't pass it along to someone else .
Going viral means creating great content and it should be instructive to all candidates that we 're seeing the voters go the extra mile to help boost their candidate of choice -- as Howard Dean said four years ago , " You have the power to change this country , " both through voting and creating viral content .
And it's in that final sentiment that one can see why the new " Yes We Can " song is so powerful .
That simple theme of " We Can " perfectly sums up the hope of an insurgent campaign -- it 's not a front - runner 's slogan .
Politics should be all about doing the impossible .
As Joe Trippi used to tell us on the Dean campaign , " You gotta believe ! "

1. Abstract
This article reports the results of an investigation into near - death and out - of - body experiences in 31 blind respondents .
The study sought to address three main questions :
(1 ) whether blind individuals have near - death experiences ( NDEs ) and , if so , whether they are the same as or different from those of sighted persons ; ( 2 ) whether blind persons ever claim to see during NDEs and out - of - body experiences ( OBEs ) ; and ( 3 ) if such claims are made , whether they can ever be corroborated by reference to in dependent evidence .
Our findings revealed that blind persons , including those blind from birth , do report classic NDEs of the kind common to sighted persons ; that the great preponderance of blind persons claim to see during NDEs and OBEs ; and that occasionally claims of visually - based knowledge that could not have been obtained by normal means can be independently corroborated .
We present and evaluate various explanations of these findings before arriving at an interpretation based on the concept of transcendental awareness .
2. Introduction
This life 's dim windows of the soul
Distorts the heavens from pole to pole
And leads you to believe a lie
When you see with , not thro ' , the eye .
William Blake , " The Everlasting Gospel " ( circa 1818 )
The question of whether blind individuals can actually see during out - of - body experiences ( OBEs ) while close to death has long in trigued researchers in the field of near - death studies .
In part , the idea that this seemingly impossible event could really occur has been fueled by occasional anecdotal reports by prominent researchers ( e.g. , Kubler - Ross , 1983 ; Moody and Perry , 1988 ) that they have come across such cases in the course of their investigations .
Lesser known physicians interested in near - death experiences ( NDEs ) , such as Fred Schoonmaker of Denver 's St. Luke 's Hospital , have also mentioned that they have heard such claims from their blind patients ( Schoonmaker , personal communication , 1981 ) .
Similarly , another physician , Larry Dossey , opened his book Recovering the Soul ( 1989 ) with the dramatic case of a woman named Sarah , blind from birth , who had detailed visual perception during surgery when her heart had stopped .
As a result of these accounts in the literature , other researchers and writers who have taken an interest in NDEs have used such cases to make a powerful argument on behalf of the authenticity of near - death phenomena ( Anderson , 1980 ; Habermas and Moreland , 1992 ; Iverson , 1992 ; Wilson , 1987 ; Woodward , 1976 ) .
Representative of this view is a passage in a recent book by a leading figure in transpersonal psychology , the psychiatrist Stanislav Grof :
There are ... reported cases where individuals who were blind be cause of a medically confirmed organic damage to their optical system could at the time of clinical death see the environment .
...
Occurrences of this kind , unlike most of the other aspects of near - death phenomena , can be subjected to objective verification .
They thus represent the most convincing proof that what happens in near - death experiences is more than the hallucinatory phantasmagoria of physiologically impaired brains .
( 1994 , p. 31 )
Yet there is reason , we think , not to leap too quickly to the conclusion that the evidence supporting visual perception in the blind is as solid as Grof 's statement would imply .
In fact , when one begins to look into the basis for these claims , they appear to dissolve into the mists of hearsay , unsubstantiated anecdote and other dead ends - and even , in one case , outright fabrication .
For example , Kubler - Ross and Schoonmaker have never documented the cases they have mentioned or published any details concerning them .
Similarly , when one of us ( K. R. ) pressed Raymond Moody for further particulars about the blind person he described in one of his books , he could only remember that he had heard that account on an audio cassette provided to him by an elderly physician , but he no longer had the tape and could not recall the physician 's name ( R. Moody , personal communication , 1992 ) .
And the compelling case of Sarah , so vividly portrayed by Dossey , turned out , as he confessed in a letter to K. R. , to be a complete fiction , though Dossey justified it on the grounds that such cases seemed to be implied by the literature on NDEs ( L. Dossey , personal communication , 1990 ) .
Indeed , Susan Blackmore ( 1993 ) has recently reviewed all this evidence and concluded that none of it holds up to scrutiny .
In short , according to her , there is no convincing evidence of visual perception in the blind during NDEs , much less documented support for veridical perception ( Blackmore , 1993 ) .
Nevertheless , while there may be reason to concur with Blackmore 's assessment , there was at least one study that did attempt to inquire whether any evidence for this proposition could be gathered by systematically interviewing a sample of blind respondents .
In that investigation , Harvey Irwin ( 1987 ) had field workers survey a sample of 21 blind persons in Australia .
The focus of Irwin 's project was to see whether any such persons had had an OBE and , if so , to get an account of it .
Among his 21 respondents , three persons did indeed report having had an OBE .
Unfortunately , as Irwin ruefully had to admit , all of these persons had either some residual or peripheral vision , so they did not in the end constitute anything like a stringent cohort in terms of which to evaluate the hypothesis that the blind can see .
Irwin's own conclusion at the time was that neither his own survey nor the work of anyone else had demonstrated that persons blind from birth even have OBEs , and therefore no evidence existed that such individuals could see under such circumstances .
" It now remains , " he wrote , " for further surveys to locate an OBE in a congenitally totally blind person " ( Irwin , 1987 , p. 57 ) .
This is precisely what we have attempted to do in this study .
In what follows we describe the results of a research project in which an effort was made to locate and interview blind persons , including those blind from birth , who believed they had undergone either an NDE or an OBE not related to any near - death incident .
The principal underlying aim of this study , however , will already be apparent : we were concerned to determine whether in fact any reliable evidence could be educed from such a sample that the blind really do see under such conditions .
The significance of such findings , should they be established , has largely been implicit in our discussion thus far , but obviously the validation of such claims , or alternatively , the confirmation of all these rumors over the years , would have far - reaching and possibly baleful consequences for a conventional materialist view of science .
By the same reasoning , empirical support for sight in the blind would be consistent with various " New Paradigm " visions of science that are rooted in nonlocal , nondual or holonomic perspectives in which consciousness is the primary reality .
Furthermore , such findings would raise profound questions , from any scientific perspective , about mind / body relationships , the role of the brain in vision , and indeed the very mechanisms of sight .
Even within the more limited confines of parapsychological thought , such data would have a critical bearing on hypotheses having to do with the nature of OBEs and NDEs themselves .
For example , V. Krishnan ( 1983 ) has argued that the perceptions reported during OBEs may have a physical basis .
As a test of this hypothesis , Krishnan has proposed that the OBEs of congenitally blind persons should be distinct from those with sight .
Irwin , in his discussion of this issue , framed the implications neatly :
Specifically , because people who surgically regain their sight take some time to learn visual identification of objects , the initial OBEs in the congenitally blind should exhibit the same property if the experience depends upon the visual pathways of the nervous system .
The content of a congenitally blind subject 's OBE therefore may speak to Krishnan 's notion of the physical basis of out - of - body visual impressions .
( Irwin , 1987 , p. 54 )
Our data will thus provide a crucial test of Krishnan 's hypothesis , as well as speak to the long - standing controversy in parapsychology over whether the OBE represents some kind of true extrasomatic state or only a retrospective reconstruction based on sensory cues and imaginal processes .
In any case , the possible epistemological and metaphysical implications of our findings potentially touch on deep conundrums and perennial concerns in the history of both normal and anti-establishment science .
Insofar as the specific and limited objectives of this study are concerned , however , there were three that formed the basis of this inquiry .
Each can be phrased as a question .
First , because we were chiefly interested in NDEs in this research , there is a necessary preliminary question we need to answer to which no previous systematic investigation has even been addressed : do blind persons in fact have NDEs and , if they do , are they the same as or different from those of sighted persons ?
Second , do blind persons , if they do report either NDEs or OBEs , claim to have visual perceptions during these experiences ?
And , finally , if such claims are made , is it ever possible to corroborate them through independent evidence or the testimony of other witnesses ?
In other words , can one establish that these claims are something other than mere fantasies or hallucinations ?
These were the issues , then , this study was designed to probe .
3. Method
A. Procedure
In order to recruit qualified participants for this study , that is , blind persons who believed they had had either an NDE or an OBE , we first made contact with 11 national , regional , and state organizations for the blind , to solicit their help in locating potential respondents among their membership .
Toward this end , we provided a notice to these organizations about our research that was then in cluded in their respective publications , most of which were distributed in Braille or in the form of an audio cassette , providing our phone number and address and inviting interested individuals who believed they qualified to take part in this study to call or write us .
A similar announcement was also published in Vital Signs , the newsletter of the International Association for Near - Death Studies .
Finally , we alerted a few of our colleagues in the field of near - death studies about our project and asked them to refer any potentially eligible candidates to us .
After an individual made contact with us , we conducted a screening interview over the telephone to make sure that he or she had the appropriate qualifications for our study .
Specifically , we determined the sight status of the person and made sure that he or she had undergone either an NDE or one or more OBEs , not necessarily as sociated with a near - death crisis .
Once the person 's eligibility for the study was established , we either then continued with the formal in terview or scheduled a second call for that purpose .
In a few cases , one or more follow - up calls were necessary to clarify some aspects of the respondent 's account .
In the interview , we took a detailed sight history from the individual and then conducted an in - depth probe about his or her relevant experiences .
This portion of the interview was modeled on the format originally devised by Kenneth Ring ( 1980 ) , but was tailored to the specific interests of this study and the special characteristics of our respondents .
In the course of this interview , particular attention was given to obtaining information about events or perceptions that in principle could be corroborated by external witnesses or medical records .
Where those witnesses could be specifically identified or relevant records secured , we made efforts to gain access to them and , when possible , to interview the witnesses about their own recollections of the events or perceptions
described by the respondent .
All conversations were tape recorded with the permission of the respondent , and transcripts based on these conversations were later prepared , to permit detailed analysis of our findings .
Finally , each participant who expressed an interest to receive information about the findings of this study was sent a summary at its conclusion .
4. Subjects
Of the 46 persons who were screened for this study , 31 qualified for inclusion and were interviewed .
All but three of this final sample had heard about our study through the notices we had distributed .
The exceptions were two persons referred to us by professional colleagues and one individual who came fortuitously to the attention of one of us as a result of meeting her husband while traveling to a professional conference .
Demographically , our sample consisted of 20 females and 11 males whose ages ranged from 22 to 70 years .
They were all Caucasian , overwhelmingly Christian with respect to their original religious tradition , but varied greatly regarding their educational attainment and occupation .
A. Experiential Status
Sixteen of our respondents had survived an NDE , while an additional five persons had undergone both an NDE and one or more OBEs on other occasions not associated with their near - death incident .
Thus , the total number of near - death experiencers ( NDErs ) in this sample was 21 .
The remaining 10 were per sons who had one or more OBEs only .
Of our NDErs , 13 had their experience in connection with an illness or a surgical procedure ; six as a result of an accident , usually involving an automobile ; two were mugged ; one was nearly killed by being raped ; one almost perished in combat ; and one survived a suicide attempt .
( The totals here are 24 experiences since three persons had two separate NDEs each and were therefore counted twice in these tabulations . )
Most of the OBEs reported occurred during states of bodily quiescence or relaxation , though some were occasioned by traumas , such as falls or rapes .
The great majority of these episodes were not deliberately induced , though a few persons in our sample did try on occasion to bring them about through an act of will .
B. Sight Status
Not quite half of our total sample , 14 , was comprised of persons blind from birth .
A few of our respondents classified as blind from birth either had some limited light perception as children or have retained some as adults , but a distinct majority of persons in this category were without even any light perception at the time of their NDE or OBE .
An additional 11 persons fell into the category of adventitiously blind , which means they lost their sight sometime after 5 years of age .
The remaining six persons in our study were individuals who were severely visually impaired , most of them having at best only minimal non-delineated vision .
With respect to our two main experiential categories , NDEs and OBEs , the breakdown on sight status is as follows : among the 21 NDErs , 10 were blind from birth , nine adventitiously blind , and two severely visually impaired ; among the remaining 10 out - of - body experiencers ( OBErs ) , four were blind from birth , two adventitiously blind , and four severely visually impaired .
Of the 14 respondents blind from birth , two were congenitally blind and one had both his eyes removed by the time he was 41/2 years old .
The remaining 11 were born prematurely between 1946 and 1958 and all were placed in incubators where they received excessive concentrations of oxygen resulting in blindness .
These individuals developed retrolental fibroplasia ( RLF ) , now commonly referred to as retinopathy of prematurity ( ROP ) .
Of our 11 adventitiously blind respondents , seven lost their vision between the ages of 16 and 41 as a result of illness or accident .
In some cases , it was their near - death event itself that caused their blindness .
The other four lost their vision between the ages of 13 and 52 due to slow degenerative eye diseases including retinitis pigmentosa ( RP ) , glaucoma , and aging .
Three of our six visually impaired respondents developed RLF ; two had RP , both of whom had limited peripheral vison ( 14 and 20 degree field , respectively ) ; and one was born with cataracts and developed glaucoma as a teenager .
All six have been legally blind from birth and only three of these individuals have been able to read any print at all .
5. Results
A. NDEs in the Blind
To examine the nature of NDEs in the blind , we must of course restrict ourselves to the 21 respondents in our sample , 12 women and nine men , who reported NDEs .
Our findings with respect to this issue are unequivocal : blind persons , even those blind from birth , recount experiences that clearly conform to the familiar prototype of the beatific NDE first popularized in Moody 's book , Life After Life ( 1975 ) .
Their narratives , in fact , tend to be indistinguishable from those of sighted persons with respect to the elements that serve to define the classic NDE pattern , such as the feelings of great peace and well - being that attend the experience , the sense of separation from the physical body , the experience of traveling through a tunnel or dark space , the encounter with the light , the life review , and so forth .
Before we turn to a statistical summary of our findings , however , it will be helpful to present a couple of illustrative cases in order to provide a sense of the actual narrative texture of these experiences .
In doing so , we will unavoidably discover some unmistakable evidence pertaining to our second , but primary , question , having to do with whether the blind see during their NDEs .
Nevertheless , we must defer a detailed consideration of this issue for the time being since our purpose here is chiefly to report what some of our respondents told us they remembered when they found themselves hovering between life and death .
Because of space limitations , we will be able to present only one case in depth , but we will follow it up with a synopsis of a second comparable instance .
Cases that we recount below with complete names are used with the respondent 's permission ; if only a first name is given to identify a case for purposes of reference , it is a pseudonym .
B. Vicki Umipeg
Vicki Umipeg is a married 43 - year - old woman who has had two near - death experiences .
The first , when she was 12 years old , occurred as a result of appendicitis and peritonitis .
Her second NDE took place almost exactly a decade later , when she was seriously injured in an automobile accident .
Vicki was born very prematurely , having been in the womb only 22 weeks at delivery , and weighed just three pounds at birth .
Afterward , her weight dropped precariously to one pound , 14 ounces .
As was common for premature babies in the 1950s , she was placed in an airlock incubator through which oxygen was administered .
Unfortunately , because of a failure to regulate the concentration of oxygen properly , Vicki was given too much and , along with about 50,000 other premature babies born in the United States about the same time , suffered such optic nerve damage as to leave her completely blind .
As she made clear in an initial interview with another researcher , Greg Wilson , who kindly provided his tapes and transcripts to us , she has never had any visual experience whatever , nor does she even understand the nature of light :
INTERVIEWER : Could you see anything ?
VICKI : Nothing , never .
No light , no shadows , no nothing , ever .
INTERVIEWER :
So the optic nerve was destroyed to both eyes ?
VICKI : Yes , and so I 've never been able to understand even the concept of light .
Interestingly , the overall form of Vicki's two experiences , which were separated by a period of 10 years , was extremely similar , almost as though they were replays of one another , albeit with some variations owing to the particularities of Vicki 's life circumstances on each occasion .
To minimize redundancy , we will present a fairly full exposition here only of Vicki 's second NDE , since according to her own testimony , it was the more detailed and vivid of the two .
In early 1973 , Vicki , then 22 , was working as an occasional singer in a nightclub in Seattle .
One night , at closing time , she was unable to call for a taxi to drive her home and circumstances forced her to take the only other option : a ride with a couple of inebriated patrons .
Not surprisingly , a serious accident ensued during which Vicki was thrown out of their van .
Her injuries were extensive and life - threat ening , and included a skull fracture and concussion , and damage to her neck , back , and one leg .
In fact , it took her a full year after being released from the hospital before she could stand upright with out the risk of fainting .
Vicki clearly remembers the frightening prelude to the crash itself , but she has only a hazy recall of finding herself alternately out of her body and then back inside of it at the accident scene .
Her only definite recollection of anything external to herself while out - of - body is a very brief glimpse of the crumpled vehicle .
Although this aspect of her experience was confusing , she does claim that while in her out - of - body state she was aware of being in a nonphysical body that had a distinct form and that was , as she put it , " like it was made of light . "
She has no memory of the her trip to Harborview Hospital in the ambulance , but after she arrived at the emergency room , she came again to awareness when she found herself up on the ceiling watching a male doctor and a woman - she is not sure whether the woman was another physician or a nurse - working on her body .
She could overhear their conversation , too , which had to do with their fear that because of possible damage to Vicki 's eardrum , she could become deaf as well as blind .
Vicki tried desperately to communicate to them that she was fine , but naturally drew no response .
She was also aware of seeing her body below her , which she recognized by certain identifying features , such as a distinctive wedding ring she was wearing .
According to her testimony , Vicki first had a very fleeting image of herself lying on the metal table and she was sure , she said , that " it was me , " although it took her a moment to register that fact with certainty .
As she later told us :
I knew it was me .
... was pretty thin then .
I was quite tall and thin at that point .
And I recognized at first that it was a body , but I did n't even know that it was mine initially .
Then I perceived that I was up on the ceiling , and I thought , " Well , that 's kind of weird .
What am I doing up here ? "
I thought , " Well , this must be me .
Am I dead ?... " I just briefly saw this body , and ... I knew that it was mine because I was n't in mine .
Then I was just away from it .
It was that quick .
Almost immediately after that , as she recalls , she found herself going up through the ceilings of the hospital until she was above the roof of the building itself , during which time she had a brief panoramic view of her surroundings .
She felt very exhilarated during this ascension and enjoyed tremendously the freedom of movement she was experiencing .
She also began to hear sublimely beautiful and exquisitely harmonious music akin to the sound of wind chimes .
With scarcely a noticeable transition , she then discovered she had been sucked head - first into a tube and felt that she was being pulled up into it .
The enclosure itself was dark , Vicki said , yet she was aware that she was moving toward light .
As she reached the opening of the tube , the music that she had heard earlier seemed to be transformed into hymns , similar to those she heard during her previous NDE , and she then " rolled out " to find herself lying on grass .
She was surrounded by trees and flowers and a vast number of people .
She was in a place of tremendous light , and the light , Vicki said , was something you could feel as well as see .
What the light conveyed was love .
Even the people she saw were bright and reflected the light of this love .
" Everybody there was made of light .
And I was made of light .
There was love everywhere .
It was like love came from the grass , love came from the birds , love came from the trees . "
Vicki then became aware of five specific persons she knew in life who were welcoming her to this place .
Debby and Diane were Vicki's blind schoolmates , who had died years before , at ages 11 and 6 , respectively .
In life , they had both been profoundly retarded as well as blind , but here they appeared bright and beautiful , healthy and vitally alive , and no longer children , but , as Vicki phrased it , " in their prime . "
In addition , Vicki reports seeing two of her childhood care takers , a couple named Mr. and Mrs. Zilk , both of whom had also previously died .
Finally , there was Vicki 's grandmother , who had essentially raised Vicki and who had died just two years before this incident .
Her grandmother , who was further back than the others , was reaching out to hug Vicki .
In these encounters , no actual words were exchanged , Vicki says , but only feelings of love and welcome .
In the midst of this rapture , Vicki was suddenly overcome with a sense of total knowledge
I had a feeling like I knew everything ... and like everything made sense .
I just knew that this was where ... this place was where I would find the answers to all the questions about life , and about the planets , and about God , and about everything .
...
It 's like the place was the knowing .
And then she was indeed flooded with information of a religious nature as well as scientific and mathematical knowledge .
She came to understand languages she did n't know .
All this overwhelmed and astonished her :
I do n't know beans about math and science .
... all of a sudden understood intuitively almost things about calculus , and about the way planets were made .
And I do n't know anything about that .
... I felt there was nothing I did n't know .
As these revelations were unfolding , Vicki noticed that now next to her was a figure whose radiance was far greater than the illumination of any of the persons she had so far encountered .
Immediately , she recognized this being to be Jesus , for she had seen him once before , during her previous NDE .
He greeted her tenderly , while she conveyed her excitement to him about her newfound omniscience and her joy at being there and with him again .
Telepathically , he communicated to her : " Is n't it wonderful ?
Everything is beautiful here , and it fits together .
And you 'll find that .
But you can't stay here now .
It 's not your time to be here yet and you have to go back . "
Vicki reacted , understandably enough , with extreme disappointment and protested vehemently , " No , I want to stay with you . "
But the being reassured her that she would come back , but for now , she had to " go back and learn and teach more about loving and forgiving . "
Still resistant , however , Vicki then learned that she also needed to go back to have her children .
With that , Vicki , who was then childless but who " desperately wanted " to have children - a nd who has since given birth to three - became almost eager to return and finally consented .
However , before Vicki could leave , the being said to her , in these exact words , " But first , watch this . "
And what Vicki then saw was " everything from my birth " in a complete panoramic review of her life , and as she watched , the being gently commented to help her understand the significance of her actions and their repercussions .
The last thing Vicki remembers , once the life review had been completed , are the words , " You have to leave now . "
She then experienced " a sickening thud " like a roller - coaster going backwards , and found herself back in her body , feeling heavy and full of pain .
C. Brad Barrows
A second case is that of Brad Barrows , a 33 - year - old man living in Connecticut , who had a near - death experience in the winter of 1968 when he was only 8 years old .
At the time , he was a student at the Boston Center for Blind Children , and had contracted a severe case of pneumonia and eventually had severe breathing difficulties .
Afterward , he was told by nurses that his heart had stopped , apparently for at least four minutes , and that cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) had been necessary to bring him back .
Brad remembers that when he could n't breathe any longer , he felt himself lifting up from the bed and floating through the room toward the ceiling .
He saw his apparently lifeless body on the bed .
He also saw his blind roommate get up from his bed and leave the room to get help .
( His roommate later confirmed this . )
Brad then found himself rapidly going upward through the ceilings of the building until he was above the roof .
At this point , he found that he could see clearly .
He estimates that it was between 6:30 and 7:00 in the morning when this happened .
He noticed that the sky was cloudy and dark .
There had been a snowstorm the day before , and Brad could see snow everywhere except for the streets , which had been plowed , though they were still slushy .
He was able to give us a very detailed description of the way the snow looked .
Brad could also see the snow banks that the plows had created .
He saw a street car go by .
Finally , he recognized a playground used by the children of his school and a particular hill he used to climb nearby .
When asked if he " knew " or " saw " these things , he said : " I clearly visualized them .
I could suddenly notice them and see them .
... I remember ... being able to see quite clearly . "
After this segment of this experience , which happened very fast , was over , he found himself in a tunnel and emerged from it to find himself in an immense field illuminated by a tremendous , all - encompassing light .
Everything was perfect .
Brad could clearly see in this domain , too , though he commented that he was puzzled by the sensation of sight .
He found himself walking on a path surrounded by tall grass , and also reported seeing tall trees with immense leaves .
No shadows were visible , however .
While in this field , Brad became aware of beautiful music , like nothing he had ever heard on earth .
Walking toward the sound , he came to and climbed a hill , eventually encountering a glittering stone structure so brilliant that he thought it might be burning hot .
But it was n't , and he entered it .
The music continued here as well and , to Brad , seemed to be praising God .
In this structure , Brad encountered a man whom he did n't recognize but from whom emanated an overwhelming love .
The man , without a word , gently nudged Brad backward , initiating a reversal of his experience , ending with his finding himself in bed gasping for air , attended by two nurses .
Brad , like Vicki , has been blind from birth .
These two cases , which took place a continent apart and before the advent of modern near - death studies , show an obvious structural similarity and clearly exemplify the familiar Moody - type pattern of NDEs .
To be sure , not all of the NDEs described by our blind respondents are as rich in their narrative line as those of Vicki and Brad , but there is no question that the great preponderance of these experiences conform to the classic form of the NDE .
To examine this point from a statistical perspective and help to provide something of an overview of our findings here , we can list a number of the common features of NDEs and state how often they are mentioned in the interviews of our 21 respondents in the NDEr category .
Feelings of peace , well - being , or being loved were reported in 20 interviews ; a sense of separation from the physical body , or an actual out - of - body experience ( OBE ) , in 14 ; seeing one 's own physical body , in 10 ; going through a tunnel or dark space , in eight ; meeting others , such as spirits , angels , or religious personages , in 12 ; seeing a radiant light , in eight ; hearing noise or music , in seven ; a life review , in four ; encountering a border or limit , in six ; and a choice or being told to return to life , in 10 .
In general , although the numbers in the various sight categories ( that is , blind from birth , adventitiously blind , and severely visually impaired ) were too small to permit statistical tests , inspection reveals no obvious differences among sight subgroups with respect to the frequency of NDE elements .
Thus , whether one is blind from birth , loses one 's sight in later life , or suffers from severe visual impair ment , the type of NDE reported appears to be much the same and is not structurally different from those described by sighted persons .
With these facts established , we can now turn our attention to our principal interest in this study , namely , whether and to what extent blind persons claim to be able to see during their NDEs and OBEs .
6. Visual Aspects of NDEs and OBEs in the Blind
We have already had evidence from the summaries of Vicki's and Brad 's narratives that there appear to be clear visual representations , both of things of this world and of an otherworldly nature , during the NDEs of blind persons .
The question we face here , how ever , is how common such testimony is among our respondents as a whole .
First , let us look at how many of our respondents report being able to see during their NDEs or OBEs .
Of our 21 NDErs , 15 claimed to have had some kind of sight , three were not sure whether they saw or not , and the remaining three did not appear to see at all .
All but one of those who either denied or were unsure about being able to see came from those who were blind from birth , which means that only half of the NDErs in that category stated unequivocally that they had distinct visual impressions during their experience .
Nevertheless , it is not clear by any means whether those respondents blind from birth who claimed not to have seen were in fact unable to , or simply failed to recognize what seeing was .
For instance , one man whom we classified as a nonvisualizer told us that he could not explain how he had the perceptions he did because " I do n't know what you mean by ' seeing . ' "
He was not the only such person to admit such perplexity , so that even among those cases we felt obliged to classify as not involving sight , the possibility is not entirely foreclosed .
As a whole , however , our data here are quite consistent in indicating that the preponderance of our blind NDErs do indeed report vision during their near - death encounters , while only a minority are unsure about the matter or , in some cases , have no clear sense of sight .
Evidence of vision is even stronger among the OBErs in our sample .
Nine of our 10 OBErs claimed sight , and if we include the five persons who had both an NDE and one or more OBEs on other occasions , the figures are 13 out of 15 .
In this connection , one of the NDErs whom we classified as a nonvisualizer during her NDE did report vision during her OBEs .
Overall , the number of persons who indicated they had some kind of vision , either during an NDE or OBE , was 25 , which was 80 per cent of our entire sample .
Even for those blind from birth , 9 of 14 , or 64 percent , likewise reported sight .
Given that some kind of vision is the rule for the blind , we can go on to ask , just what do they see ?
In general , they report the same kinds of visual impressions as sighted persons do in describing NDEs and OBEs .
For example , 10 of our 21 NDErs said they had some kind of vision of their physical body , and seven of our 10 OB Ers said likewise .
Occasionally , there are other this - worldly perceptions as well , such as seeing a medical team at work on one 's body or various features of the room or surroundings where one 's physical body was .
Otherworldly perceptions abound , too , and for NDErs , as we have already seen , they seem to take the form characteristic for transcendental NDEs of sighted persons : radiant light , otherworldly landscapes , angels or religious figures , deceased relatives , and so forth .
Somewhat similar otherworldly perceptions are sometimes found for OBErs as well , though these , when they occur , are usually limited to seeing light , beautiful colors , and meeting others .
None of our OBErs recounted a life review .
How well do our respondents find they can see during these episodes ?
We have already noted that the visual perceptions of Vicki and Brad appeared extremely clear and detailed , especially when they found themselves in the otherworldly portions of their near - death journeys .
While not all of our blind NDErs had clear , articulated visual impressions , nevertheless enough of them did so that we can conclude that the NDE cases like Vicki's and Brad 's are fairly typical in this regard .
For instance , one of our interviewees whose sight perished completely as a result of a stroke at age 22 , and was near - sighted before that , told us in connection with seeing her body , her doctor , and the operating room during her NDE : " I know I could see and I was supposed to be blind .
...
And I know I could see everything .
...
It was very clear when I was out .
I could see details and everything . "
Another man , who lost his vision in a car accident at the age of 19 , had a comforting vision of his deceased grandmother across a valley during his NDE .
In commenting on his clarity , he said : " Of course I had no sight because I had total destruction of my eyes in the accident , but [ my vision ] was very clear and distinct .
... I had perfect vision in that experience . "
Still another man , this one blind from birth , found himself in an enormous library during the transcendental phase of his NDE and saw " thousands and millions and billions of books , as far as you could see . "
Asked if he saw them visually he said , " Oh , yes ! "
Did he see them clearly ?
" No problem . "
Was he surprised at being able to see thus ?
" Not in the least .
I said , ' Hey , you can't see , ' and I said , ' Well , of course I can see .
Look at those books .
That 's ample proof that I can see . ' "
Typically , vision is reported as clear , even acutely so , by our respondents in the otherworldly domain , where seeing is often described as " perfectly natural " or " the way it 's supposed to be . "
However , sometimes the initial onset of visual perception of the physical world is disorienting and even disturbing to the blind .
This was true for Vicki , for example , who said :
I had a hard time relating to it [ i.e. , seeing ] .
I had a real difficult time relating to it because I 've never experienced it .
And it was something very foreign to me .
...
Let 's see , how can I put it into words ?
It was like hearing words and not being able to understand them , but knowing that they were words .
And before you 'd never heard anything .
But it was something new , something you'd not been able to previously attach any meaning to
Later , in commenting on the shock of these initial visual impressions , she even used the word " frightening " to characterize them .
She also told us that she was never able to discriminate colors as such , but only " different shades of brightness , " about which impressions she could only wonder afterward whether they represented what sighted people meant by color .
However , after this brief and confusing period of adjustment , the experiencer 's perception quickly seems to become self - organizing and coherent ; then it is as if the individual has been seeing his or her whole life .
As Brad commented on the naturalness of his own perception in the otherworldly domain :
It was like it was always there .
...
It was so natural it was almost as if I should have always been able to see like that .
... I could never understand why I never could do that back in my own body , yet it was so unbelievably natural .
... I thought to myself I should be able to carry this right back with me .
It 's just something I 've always had .
... I was very comfortable with it .
To conclude this section , we would like to bring all of these visual threads together in one specific illustrative case of still another of our blind respondents , a woman we 'll call Marsha .
Marsha is a 40 year - old married woman living in Connecticut who had an NDE on January 16 , 1986 , when she was 32 , as a result of complications in her pregnancy .
Like Vicki , Marsha was a premature baby , having been born after only a six month pregnancy , and , as a result , had developed a condition of retinopathy of prematurity .
Unlike Vicki , however , she has always had some limited vision .
In this respect , Marsha told us : " I have some vision in my left eye , not a whole lot .
I do n't have any reading vision - I can't read print at all , but I can see , like , people and stuff , but they look .
... blurry . "
We classified Marsha in the severely visually impaired category , as her actual vision was extremely poor and she uses a guide dog .
Marsha 's case is mainly of interest here in showing how the visual perception of a severely visually impaired individual during an NDE is not only enhanced , but can become virtually perfect .
In her interview with us , she made it plain that her heightened acuity pertained both to her out - of - body perception as well as to that which she experienced in the otherworldly portion of her experience .
As to the former , Marsha told us that when she was coming back , she was aware of seeing her body :
INTERVIEWER : Could you describe it ?
Could you see it in detail ?
MARSHA : Yeah , it just looked like me .
I was , like , asleep .
INTERVIEWER :
And how was your vision , if I could put it that way , when you were looking down on yourself ?
MARSHA : It was fine ....
It was normal .
INTERVIEWER :
When you say normal , you mean clear ?
MARSHA : Yeah , everything .
There was no problem with it .
Concerning the quality of her otherworldly perception , she commented :
INTERVIEWER :
Were you able to see better than you could in the physical world ?
MARSHA : Oh , yeah .
INTERVIEWER :
What was your visual perception like in this room [ in the otherworldly portion of her NDE ] ?
MARSHA : Everything , I could see everything .
...
All the people , all the way back .
Everything .
INTERVIEWER : In what way ?
Could you be a little more specific ?
MARSHA : It was perfect .
It would not be like that here .
There was no problem .
It was , like , you know - everything , you could see everything .
It was not like your eyes .
I do n't know what normal vision would feel like .
It was not like your eyes see .
It could n't be my eyes because my eyes were back over here .
I could see gold in the room .
Gold on the walls .
There [ were ] white birds and angels and all these people .
INTERVIEWER :
When you saw birds and the people and the room , were you seeing it in detail or just like you see now ?
MARSHA : No , no .
It was detail .
It was white light .
Everything was white light in there .
And there was gold on the walls .
Later on , in elaborating on her perception of colors during this part of her experience , Marsha was similarly definite about what she was aware of :
INTERVIEWER : And could you see it [ color ] clearly in the experience ?
MARSHA : Yes .
Everything was the way it was supposed to be .
Finally , when the interviewer probed to get Marsha 's further thoughts on her visual experience during her NDE , this exchange occurred :
INTERVIEWER :
If you had to say how much sight you actually had at the time of your experience , is there a way for you to describe it ?
MARSHA : It was , like , perfect .
I do n't see how it could not be perfect .
I can't say I could see like I see now .
... I could see everything [ then ] .
INTERVIEWER :
Do you have any thoughts on the fact that you had vision during this experience ?
MARSHA : Well , see , it was vision , but I do n't think it was my eyes .
I do n't know how it works because my eyes were back here , and since they are not right and I could see everything right , there had to be more special vision somehow .
Although Marsha still has some residual physical vision , it is clear that her comments echo both those of Vicki and Brad concerning the quality of her visual perception , especially in the otherworldly realm .
There , she saw perfectly and in detail that was astonishing to her and for which she had no explanation .
And like Vicki and Brad , who had also noted the naturalness of their otherworldly vision , Marsha used a phrase we have encountered before , namely , " everything was the way it was supposed to be . "
Likewise , her visual impression of her physical body seemed clear and distinct , in contrast to her everyday vision .
Overall , her testimony was as striking as it was consistent and showed that severely visually impaired persons , too , may find that coming close to death appears to restore their sight to nor mal , and perhaps even superior , acuity .
In summary , as a whole our interviews with both NDErs and OBErs offered abundant testimony that reports of visual perception among the blind are common , that their impressions concern both things of this world and otherworldly domains , and that they are often clear and detailed , even in narratives furnished by those who have been blind from birth .
7. Corroborative Evidence for OBE and NDE Visions
Obviously , in order to demonstrate that the perceptions described by our blind experiencers are something other than mere fantasies or even complex hallucinations , it will be necessary to provide some kind of confirming evidence for them , preferably from other independent witnesses or from reliable documentation .
But just here , not surprisingly , is where it proves difficult to gather the type of indispensable corroboration that would help to cinch the argument that what they report seeing is indeed authentic .
In many cases , such as those of Vicki and Brad , the reported NDEs or OBEs took place so long ago that it is no longer possible to know precisely who the witnesses were or where to locate them .
In other instances , potential informants have died or were not accessible to us for interviews .
As a result , much of the testimony of our respondents is dependent on their own truthfulness and the reliability of their memories .
As a rule , we did not have cause to question the sincerity of our respondents , but sincerity is not evidence and one 's own word is hardly the last word when it comes to evaluating the validity of these accounts .
Nevertheless , in at least some instances , we are able to offer some evidence , and in one case some very strong evidence , that these claims are in fact rooted in a direct and accurate , if baffling , perception of the situation .
In this section , we will present two of our cases in which we could document some measure of evidentiality for the visual perceptions of the blind .
A. Frank
Our first example is one of apparently veridical perception during an OBE in which a respondent claimed to have seen himself .
What makes this case of special interest , however , is that he also saw something he could n't have known about by normal means .
Furthermore , he told us that a friend of his was in a position to confirm his testimony .
Frank is 66 years old , but lost his sight completely in 1982 .
He can not see anything now , including light or shadows .
He has had several OBEs , however , since becoming totally blind .
What follows is his recall of one of them .
Around 1992 , a friend of Frank 's was going to be driving him to the wake of a mutual friend .
As Frank remembered the incident :
And so I said to her that morning , I said : " Gee , I have n't got a good tie to wear .
Why do n't you pick me up one ? "
She said , " Yeah , I 'll pick you up one when I get down to Mel 's [ a clothing store ] . "
So she picked it up and dropped it off and said , " I ca n't stay .
I 've got to get home and get ready to pick you up to go to the wake . "
So I got dressed and put the tie on .
She did n't tell me the color of the tie or anything else .
I was laying down on the couch and I could see myself coming out of my body .
And I could see my tie .
The tie that was on .
And it had a circle on it - it was a red - and it had a gray circle , two gray circles on it .
And I remember that .
The interviewer then probes for further details and clarification :
INTERVIEWER : Now just for the chronology of it , you were lying down with this tie on , you saw yourself going out of the body , and then you saw the tie ?
FRANK : I saw the tie ' cause I told her the color .
INTERVIEWER :
You told your friend who was driving you ?
FRANK : Yeah , when she came back to pick me up .
...
And when she came down to pick me up , I said to her , " Are the circles gray in this tie ? "
And she says , " Yes . "
INTERVIEWER : Was she surprised that you knew ?
FRANK : Yes .
She said , " How did you know ? "
She said , " Did anyone come here ? "
I said , " No , nobody came here . "
You know , you can't tell 'em [ laughs ] , ' cause they just do n't accept , they do n't believe in it .
INTERVIEWER :
And do you remember what the tie looked like even now ?
FRANK : Yeah .
It 's a rose - colored tie with circles on it and dots in the middle of the circle .
Whitish / grayish circle around there .
And it 's a beautiful tie , ' cause every place I go they remark on it .
So she said to me , " Who told you ? "
And I said , " Nobody . "
I said , " I just guessed . "
I did n't want to tell because , like I said before ... you can't say things to certain people .
Naturally , after hearing this story , we were eager to see if we could track down the woman involved in this incident .
That proved difficult , since Frank had lost contact with her , but eventually he was able to locate her and , without telling her exactly why we were interested to talk with her , put us in touch with her .
One of us ( S.C. ) did conduct an open - ended interview with this woman shortly afterward and summarized it as follows in her notes :
I independently called his friend who said she did purchase a tie for Frank that day and did pick him up for the wake .
However , she did n't have a clear recollection of the sequence of events that day to confirm the accuracy of Frank 's story and did n't remember the exact design and colors of the tie .
She added that Frank is a down - to - earth guy who in her experience does not embellish stories .
And even though she could n't independently corroborate his account , she tended to think he was probably accurate in recounting the details .
So here , although we lack the crucial confirming facts we need from the witness involved , we nevertheless have a highly suggestive instance that this man 's recall of his experience is essentially accurate .
However , the obvious weaknesses in and ultimate inconclusiveness of this case were overcome in our second example , in which a direct and independent corroboration of the respondent 's own testimony was obtained .
B. Nancy
The next respondent was a 41 - year - old woman we will call Nancy who underwent a biopsy in 1991 in connection with a possible cancerous chest tumor .
During the procedure , the surgeon inadvertently cut her superior vena cava , then compounded his error by sewing it closed , causing a variety of medical catastrophes including blindness , a condition that was discovered only shortly after surgery when Nancy was examined in the recovery room .
She remembers waking up at that time and screaming , " I 'm blind , I 'm blind ! "
Shortly afterward , she was rushed on a gurney down the corridor in order to have an angiogram .
However , the attendants , in their haste , slammed her gurney into a closed elevator door , at which point the woman had an out - of - body experience .
Nancy told us she floated above the gurney and could see her body below .
However , she also said she could see down the hall where two men , the father of her son and her current lover , were both standing , looking shocked .
She remembers being puzzled by the fact that they simply stood there agape and made no movement to approach her .
Her memory of the scene stopped at that point .
In trying to corroborate her claims , we interviewed the two men .
The father of her son could not recall the precise details of that particular incident , though his general account corroborated Nancy's , but her lover , Leon , did recall it and independently confirmed all the essential facts of this event .
Here is an excerpt from our interview with him , which bears on this crucial episode .
LEON : I was in the hallway by the surgery and she was coming out and I could tell it was her .
They were kind of rushing her out .
INTERVIEWER : Rushing her out of where ?
LEON : Of the surgery suite where she had been in the recovery area , I think .
And I saw these people coming out .
I saw people wheeling a gurney .
I saw about four or five people with her , and I looked and I said , " God , it looks like Nancy , " but her face and her upper torso were really swollen about twice the size it should have been .
At that point I looked and I said , " Nancy , Nancy , " and they just - she did n't know , I mean .
She was out of it .
And they told me they were taking her down for an angiogram .
INTERVIEWER : Who told you that ?
LEON : I believe a nurse did .
I 'm not quite sure .
I think I was still in a state of shock .
I mean , it had been a long day for me .
You 're expecting an hour procedure and here it is , approximately 10 hours later and you do n't have very many answers .
I believe a nurse did .
I know I asked .
And I think Dick [ the father of Nancy 's child ] was there at the same time .
I think he and I were talking in the hallway .
INTERVIEWER :
Do you know how far you were from Nancy ?
LEON : When I first saw her she was probably , maybe about 100 feet and then she went right by us .
I was probably no more than 3 to 5 feet away from her .
And I believe Dick was right next to me as well .
INTERVIEWER :
And do you know how they took her out ?
She was on the gurney ?
LEON : She was on the gurney .
There were IVs .
... I 'm not sure - I think she had some sort of a breathing apparatus .
I 'm not sure if it was an Ambu bag or what it was .
INTERVIEWER :
And then where did they take her ?
LEON : They took her downstairs to do an angiogram .
INTERVIEWER : How ?
LEON : They took her down in the gurney in the service elevator .
They did n't take her in a regular elevator .
They took her around the corner to the service elevator .
INTERVIEWER :
And did you see that whole process ?
LEON : Yes , I did .
INTERVIEWER : Did you see her go into the elevator ?
LEON : Yes , I did because I walked around to watch her enter the elevator .
INTERVIEWER : Was there any disturbance that you remember in getting her into the elevator ?
LEON : I think there was a real sense of urgency on the staff .
I 've worked in hospital emergency rooms as well and I can really relate to that .
I think somebody was , like , trying to get into the elevator at the same time and there was some sort of a " Oh , I ca n't get in , let 's move this over a little bit , " kind of adjusting before they could get her into the elevator .
But it was very swift .
INTERVIEWER : Did you have a good look at her face ?
LEON : Yeah , it really kind of shocked me .
She was just really swollen .
She was totally unrecognizable .
I mean , I knew it was her but - you know , I was a medic in Vietnam and it was just like seeing a body after a day after they get bloated .
It was the same kind of look .
Leon 's account accorded with Nancy 's in virtually every significant respect , despite the fact that he was very worried about her condition , and could scarcely recognize her because of her edema when he did see her .
Yet , despite his evident state of shock at the time , his interview appeared to corroborate her story , as much as any external witness could be expected to .
It should be noted that this witness has been separated from our participant for several years and they had not even communicated for at least a year before we interviewed him .
Furthermore , even if Nancy had not been totally blind at the time , the respirator on her face during this accident would have partially occluded her visual field and certainly would have prevented the kind of lateral vision necessary for her to view these men down the hall .
But the fact is , according to indications in her medical records and other evidence we have garnered , she appeared already to have been completely blind when this event occurred .
After a detailed investigation of this case and a review of all pertinent documentation , we have concluded that in all probability there was no possibility for Nancy to see what she did with her physical eyes which , in any event , were almost surely sightless at that time .
Yet the evidence suggests that she did see , and , as the corroborative testimony we have quoted shows , she apparently saw truly .
The question , of course , is how she was able to do that , and not only how Nancy saw , but how any of the blind persons in our study saw what they certainly could not possibly have seen physically .
Our findings in this section only establish a putative case that these visions are factually accurate , and not just some kind of fabrication , reconstruction , lucky guess , or fantasy ; but they leave unexplained the paradox of our discovery that the rumors some of us have been hearing all these years , that the blind can actually see during their NDEs , appear to be true .
Whether and how this can be so is the mystery we must next be prepared to probe .
8. Discussion
A. An Overview of Our Findings
Before tackling the perplexing and difficult questions we have just posed , it will be helpful to summarize our principal findings .
To do so , we will return to the three issues this study was designed to address .
The first of these was whether blind persons do report NDEs and , if they do , whether those NDEs are the same or different from those of sighted persons .
Our findings here were unequivocal in the affirmative .
There is no question that NDEs in the blind do occur and , furthermore , that they take the same general form and are comprised of the very same elements that define the NDEs of sighted individuals .
Moreover , this generalization appears to hold across all three categories of blindness that were represented in this study : those blind from birth , those adventitiously blind , and those severely visually impaired .
The second issue , and the one that was the driving force of this study , was whether the blind claim to have visual impressions during their NDEs or OBEs .
On this point , too , our data were conclusive .
Overall , 80 percent of our respondents reported these claims , most of them in the language of unhesitating declaration , even when they had been surprised , or even stunned , by the unexpected discovery that they could in fact see .
Like sighted experiencers , our blind respondents described to us both perceptions of this world and other worldly scenes , often in fulsome , fine - grained detail , and sometimes with a sense of extremely sharp , even subjectively perfect , acuity .
The last issue hinged on the second , and that had to do with at tempting to corroborate these claims of sight in an effort to show that they represented something other than fantasies or hallucinations .
This was the weakest part of our study since , for a variety of methodological reasons , it was often not possible to locate relevant witnesses or gain access to potentially helpful documentation .
Nevertheless , we did offer two illustrative and highly suggestive cases that seemed to indicate these claims are indeed authentic and not explicable by conventional means .
B. Some Possible Explanations for Apparent Sight in the Blind
With this summary of our findings we are now ready to explore the questions of central interest to us .
The simplest way to frame the issue might be to ask : " How is it that the blind can see during these experiences ? "
But , however natural it might be to put the question in this form , doing so implies that we have already concluded that we can reasonably infer from our data that the blind do in fact see .
That is certainly possible , perhaps even plausible , but not all readers would be prepared to concede the point .
Indeed , we have already implied that from an epistemological point of view , it might be better to rephrase our basic question as : " If it can legitimately be said that the blind in some sense do see , in precisely what sense would that be ? "
Putting the question in this way , then , leaves open the issue of the nature of apparent sight in the blind .
However , even before we can properly address this question , there is plainly still another one that must exert a prior claim on our attention , and that is : " Might there be some non-retinal - based mechanisms that could in principle account for the results of this study and thus demonstrate that vision in the blind is indeed only apparent and not actual ? "
Thus , by a series of interrogative declensions , we find ourselves facing first the possibility of various alternative explanations that would avoid having to posit some kind of eyeless vision to subsume our findings .
Before resorting to possible unconventional theories such as those rooted in New Paradigm science or even esoteric thought to interpret our findings , we must first make sure that no already recognized natural or prosaic mechanism cannot provide a superior or more parsimonious explanation .
C. The Dream Hypothesis
One fairly obvious possibility that has often been advanced in connection with the NDEs and OBEs of sighted persons is that this experience is some kind of a dream , perhaps a lucid or exceptionally vivid dream , which has such realistic properties that it is easily misinterpreted and thus given an ontological status it does not deserve .
To evaluate this hypothesis , we first need to inquire into what is known about normal oneiric processes in the blind .
Fortunately , there has been a great deal of research devoted to the dreams of the blind , some of it going back more than a hundred years .
As a result of these investigations , certain generalizations about the presence of visual imagery in dreams appear to stand up quite well .
Among these " empirical cornerstones " ( Kirtley , 1975 ) are that ( 1 ) there are no visual images in the dreams of the congenitally blind ; ( 2 ) individuals blinded before the age of 5 also tend not to have visual imagery ; ( 3 ) those who become sightless between the age of 5 to 7 may or may not retain visual imagery ; and ( 4 ) most persons who lose their sight after age 7 do retain visual imagery , although its clarity tends to fade with time .
In addition , various researchers have found that audition tends to be the primary sense involved in dreams of the blind , with tactile and kinesthetic elements next ( Kirtley , 1975 ) .
In our interviews , we routinely asked our respondents about the nature of their dreams , and what we found in our sample accords with the generalizations just described .
In addition , however , and particularly pertinent to the hypothesis under consideration , our respondents usually went on to say that not only were their NDEs unlike their usual dreams , but in the case of those blind from birth , they stood out as radically different precisely because they contained visual imagery , whereas their dreams had always lacked this element .
Vicki , one of our NDErs blind from birth , provides a good case in point :
INTERVIEWER : How would you compare your dreams to your NDEs ?
VICKI : No similarity , no similarity at all .
INTERVIEWER :
Do you have any kind of visual perception in your dreams ?
VICKI : Nothing .
No color , no sight of any sort , no shadows , no light , no nothing .
INTERVIEWER :
What kinds of perceptions are you aware of in your typical dreams ?
VICKI : Taste -
I have a lot of eating dreams [ laughs ] .
And I have dreams when I 'm playing the piano and singing , which I do for a living , anyway .
I have dreams in which I touch things .
... I taste things , touch things , hear things , and smell things - that 's it .
INTERVIEWER : And no visual perceptions ?
VICKI : No .
INTERVIEWER :
So that what you experienced during your NDE was quite different from your dreams ?
VICKI : Yeah , because there 's no visual impression at all in any dream that I have .
These remarks , along with similar asseverations from other participants in our study , make it abundantly clear that from our respondents ' point of view , the NDE , especially its visual aspect , has nothing in common with their usual dreams .
It is instead something in a class by itself and not to be conflated with dreams .
Since there is no support whatever from our interviews for the dream hypothesis of NDEs , we may confidently reject it as a potential explanation for our findings .
D. Retrospective Reconstruction
Another possibility , at least for the kind of visual perceptions respondents report during the out - of - body phase of NDEs , is that in dividuals are not really seeing at that time , but talking afterward as if they did .
Instead , according to this hypothesis , they have actually reconstructed a plausible account after the fact of what might be expected to have happened while they were close to death , although they may sincerely but erroneously believe that they witnessed it at the time .
From a combination of prior expectations , familiarity with hospital routines , overheard conversations or other sensory cues at the time , information gleaned afterward , or even simply by lucky guesses , it might be possible for an NDEr to construct imaginatively a pictorial representation of events during an NDE .
Thus , this hypothesis would contend that what appears to be vision is in reality a product of the mind 's inventiveness .
The chief proponent of this hypothesis is Susan Blackmore ( 1993 ) , who used it chiefly to discount some of the pioneering work by Michael Sabom ( 1982 ) , in his study of apparently veridical , though seemingly impossible , visual perception in a sample of NDErs .
In discussing , for example , how a patient could unconsciously use auditory information available during an operation , Blackmore indicated how naturally such a false representation could be generated :
It does not take much information from such sounds for a person to piece together a very convincing and realistic visual impression of what is going on .
This will provide the best model they have and seem perfectly real .
They may have no idea that the model was constructed primarily from things that they have heard .
...
It is very hard to assess just how much information any patient would have available .
We can only remember the general point that people who appear unconscious may still be aware of some of the things going on around them and they can easily build these up into a good visual picture of what was happening ( 1993 , pp. 124-125 ) .
Blackmore 's reasoning is logical and her hypothesis has a certain plausibility , but we have not been able to find any significant support for it among our interviewees .
In fact only one of our 31 respondents even alluded to it , and at that merely as one theoretical possibility among several .
Furthermore , a review of our transcripts affords no basis for arguing that retrospective reconstruction was likely to have played a role in most or even some of our cases .
This same conclusion was reached by Sabom and independently by Scott Rogo ( 1989 ) , in an evaluation of the former 's work in regard to the possible relevance of this hypothesis .
And there are additional reasons for finding it inadequate here .
For one , when one considers that it is an after - the - fact hypothesis that virtually cannot be disproved , the almost complete lack of direct evidence from our study in its behalf is particularly telling .
Second , this hypothesis clearly founders when it comes to accounting for instances where unusual objects , ones that could not easily have been predicted or otherwise anticipated , such as the design and color of Frank 's tie , are described by the blind .
Third , it is completely impotent when it comes to accounting for the otherworldly segments of NDEs , which is especially clear in visual form for many of our respondents .
On the basis of these considerations , we find scant evidence in favor of this hypothesis , and a number of cogent reasons not only to reject it , but to be tempted to regard it almost as a kind of all - purpose refuge for the skeptically - minded , rather like the " super - ESP " hypothesis in parapsychology , which , in principle , is always capable of explaining away in a pseudoscientific fashion findings that threaten to disturb prevailing ideas of the possible .
E. Blindsight
In the early 1970s , Lawrence Weiskrantz began to study a curious phenomenon he was later to call " blindsight " ( Weiskrantz , 1986 ) , in which patients suffering from extensive cortical blindness appeared to be able to " see . "
In his experiments , for example , Weiskrantz was able to show that in the absence of any visual sensation , patients , if asked to reach for a nearby object about whose exact location they were ignorant , tended to move in the right direction .
Furthermore , when asked to grasp objects the nature of which was not disclosed to them beforehand , their hands tended spontaneously to assume the appropriate form necessary to hold the object .
Weiskrantz 's work has since been replicated by others ( Humphrey , 1993 ) and the phenomenon has even been found in monkeys after extirpation of the visual cortex .
Is it possible , then , that what our respondents report is actually a form of blindsight ?
Further scrutiny of the results of research into blindsight shows very quickly that although it seems to be a legitimate form of perception , it can by no means account for our findings .
First of all , patients manifesting the effect typically cannot verbally describe the object they are alleged to see , unlike our respondents who , as we have noted , were usually certain about what they saw and could describe it often without hesitation .
In fact , a cortically blind patient , even when his or her object identification exceeds chance levels , believes that it is largely the result of pure guesswork .
Such uncertainties were not characteristic of our respondents .
Second , even when performance is better than chance would allow , even the best of these patients still make many errors ( Humphrey , 1993 ) .
While we cannot of course provide an overall figure of accuracy of object identification in our study , it is not obvious from our findings that errors were made in regard to reports of visual perception in those portions of the environmental visual field where attention was focused .
Finally , and perhaps most crucially of all , blindsight patients , unlike our respondents , do not claim that they can " see " in any sense .
As Humphrey wrote : " Certainly the patient says he does not have visual sensation .
...
Rather he says , ' I do n't know anything at all but if you tell me I 'm getting it right I have to take your word for it ' " ( 1993 , p. 90 ) .
This kind of statement is simply not found in the testimony of our respondents who , on the contrary , are often convinced that they have somehow seen what they report .
Thus , the blindsight phenomenon , however fascinating it may be in its own right , cannot explain our findings .
Indeed , the term itself seems to be a bit of an unintentional misnomer , since in such patients there does not seem to be any conscious sense of visual perception at all .
F. Skin-Based Vision
The idea that we may have a kind of eyeless visual back - up system based on dermal sensitivity is an old one , although at first blush the notion may seem preposterous .
Yet the retina itself is just a specialized piece of skin , which through evolution has come to be the " vision specialist " for the body .
Therefore , it is certainly conceivable that in our skin itself there might be a residual basis for visual detection , which has simply atrophied and become nonfunctional through disuse , like a vestigial organ .
In fact , when one begins to explore the empirical basis for this hypothesis , one finds considerable evidence for it .
The earliest work along these lines seems to have been done three - quarters of a century ago by Jules Romains .
In 1920 , he published a now nearly forgotten book called La Vision Extra - Retinienne et la Sens Paroptique , which described his experiments in skin - based perception and became available in 1924 in an American translation under the title of Eyeless Sight : A Study of Extra-Retinal Vision and the Paroptic Sense .
Romains ' general purpose was to determine if individuals could " see " without the use of their eyes .
To investigate this possibility , he first blindfolded his subjects in such a way as to ensure that no light could penetrate their eyes .
He then ran them through a series of experiments to assess their visual capabilities under these conditions .
In some , he would present them with a newspaper and ask them to read the headlines .
In others , he would ask his subjects to " read " a set of numbers .
In still others , as in modern blindsight experiments , he would invite them to describe an object he placed in front of or behind them , or ask his subjects to identify the colors of objects or to distinguish the colors of papers under glass .
In general , and quite astonishingly , Romains reported that his subjects performed remarkably well , far exceeding what would have been possible by chance .
Furthermore , these experiments were witnessed by many observers , some of them quite eminent , and therefore do not depend solely on his own word .
Romains found , however , that several conditions affected the probability of correct identification .
First , even though the subjects were blindfolded , light had to be present in the room for them to be able to " see . "
Second , his subjects could not perceive the object or " read " the number or letters on a paper when an opaque screen or door was placed between them and the object .
Finally , the greater the area of the skin actually exposed , the more accurate subjects tended to be in their descriptions .
Romains developed some elaborate theories to explain his findings , but however intriguing his discoveries were , for several distinct reasons they do not seem to have much bearing on what we found in our study .
To begin with , in Romains ' experiments , shielding the object from view prevented it from being " seen . "
Yet , in our study , even the presence of walls or ceilings proved to be no impediment to our respondents ' apparent vision , as cases such as Vicki 's and Brad's , among others , attest .
In addition , whereas Romains found that the degree of skin exposure was directly related to accuracy of perception , there was no evidence of that in our study , and in fact some evidence that would contravene it .
Remember , for instance , that in some of our cases the respondent 's body was covered with bedsheets or was clothed at the time of an NDE or OBE , yet vision seemed to occur without difficulty .
Most telling of all , however , is that Romains ' subjects generally took a long time to achieve whatever degree of visual accuracy they did demonstrate .
Indeed throughout his book , Romains frequently commented that the kind of eyeless vision he obtained from his subjects was piecemeal , gradual , with the elements of perception coming together slowly , as a result of laborious effort , at least at the beginning .
Eyeless vision , he wrote , is successive , a matter of trial - and - error , and tends at first to discern only objects near at hand .
In our study , visual perception seemed to be immediate , unlearned , and was not restricted to objects close to the individual .
Therefore we conclude , as we did with the later experiments in blindsight , that Romains ' findings , even if valid , have no relevance for ours and must depend on entirely different mechanisms .
Incidentally , the insight underlying Romains ' work , that there may be non-retinal mechanisms that afford a kind of vision , has been followed up by a succession of modern researchers ( Bach-y - Rita , 1972 ; Duplessis , 1975 ; Grinberg - Zylberbaum , 1983 ) , but their findings , although generally consistent with Romains ' , fail to explain ours .
In general , this more modern research parallels Romains ' observation that it takes a considerable amount of time and training for subjects to show even a modest proficiency of object recognition .
That fact alone disqualifies the hypothesis of skin - based vision as a possible explanatory vehicle for our results .
The rejection of this hypothesis also implies that similar views , such as V. Krishnan 's ( 1983 ) , which contend that the vision reported in NDEs and OBEs may be a function of some kind of obscure physical mechanism are without support .
For instance , Krishnan 's position requires that congenitally blind persons , on seeing for the first time , have inchoate perception , as do those whose sight is restored through an operation ( Gregory , 1966 ; Sacks , 1993 ; Valvo , 1970 ; von Senden , 1960 ) .
But , clearly , that is not the case .
The brief surprise or disorientation a blind NDEr may experience when confronted with visual impressions before adjusting to them does not begin to compare with the hours of training that a newly sighted individual needs to undergo in order to transform visual information into meaningful patterns .
Relatively speaking , then , sight is virtually immediate in our blind NDErs , and although there may be some confusion over the fact of sight and uncertainty about color , object perception seems stable from the outset .
Moreover , when never - before - seeing NDErs find themselves in the transcendental portions of their experience , some of them remark that seeing was perfectly natural in that state ; it was if they could always see .
Any mechanism that could explain that baffling fact is , to us , truly obscure .
In any event , the hypothesis that it might be rooted in some kind of skin - based vision , as Krishnan has also suggested , is without a shred of evidence .
G. An Assessment of the Evidence for Alternative Explanations
Our search for a non-retinal - based mechanism that could in principle account for the results of this study and thus demonstrate that vision in the blind is indeed only apparent and not actual has considered theories and data relating to dreams , retrospective reconstruction , blindsight , and skin - based vision , and has come up empty .
Of course , it would be absurd to claim that we have exhausted the list of naturalistic or conventional possibilities or eliminated all conceivable artifacts , but we believe we have ruled out some of the most obvious candidates for explanatory honors .
At the very least , we have perhaps managed to cast some doubt on the tenability of this type of explanation for our findings , and consequently increased the like lihood that however they might be accounted for , we would do best to seek elsewhere for our answers .
In any case , having addressed this basic issue , we can now revert to the question we posed earlier about whether or in what sense it can be said that the blind do see .
Clearly , before any explanation for vision in the blind can be accepted , it must first be established that their reports reflect the operation of something that can legitimately be called " true sight . "
That assumption has of course been implicit throughout this article and may perhaps appear to some to be self - evident by now .
But it is not , and our next task is to demonstrate just why it is not .
H. Apparent Vision in the Blind : Is It Really Seeing ?
We as researchers can never have access to the NDE or OBE in itself .
Rather , every such experience is coded in a certain way as it occurs and afterward , and comes to us only later as a report in a linguistic form .
Therefore , by the time we interview our respondents , the original experience has already been processed through several distinct filters and necessarily undergone a series of virtually unconscious transformations until it reaches us as a distinct and coherent narrative .
Therefore , it will prove helpful to discern how this narrative comes to be shaped , and how the experience may be coded in the first place .
Doing so will in turn shed light on the pivotal question of this section , namely : is what we discovered in our blind respondents truly a form of seeing ?
That is , is it in any sense something that might be conceived of as analogous to physical sight ?
To answer these questions , we reviewed our transcripts as sedulously as possible for insights into the formative processes that ultimately gave rise to the verbal report of the NDE or OBE .
And what we discovered in a finer reading of these documents were a brace of factors that together sounded a tocsin against an overly literal interpretation of these reports as indicative of " seeing " as such .
For one thing , our scrutiny of these transcripts frequently revealed a multifaceted synesthetic aspect to the experiencer 's perception that seemed to transcend simple sight .
A number of our interviewees , for example , were hesitant to assert that what they were able to describe was incontestably visual , either because they were blind from birth and did not know what vision was like or because they knew they could not possibly be seeing with their physical eyes .
The following comments were typical of this vein :
It was n't visual .
It 's really hard to describe because it was n't visual .
It was almost like a tactile thing , except that there was no way I could have touched from up there .
But it really was n't visual because I just do n't have vision any more .
... It [ was ] sort of a tactile memory or something .
It 's not really like vision is .
Vision is more clear , but it 's also more tied down .
I think what it was that was happening here was a bunch of synesthesia , where all these perceptions were being blended into some image in my mind , you know , the visual , the tactile , all the input that I had .
I can't literally say I really saw anything , but yet I was aware of what was going on , and perceiving all that in my .
mind .
...
But I do n't remember detail .
That 's why I say I 'm loath to describe it as a visual .
What I 'm saying is I was more aware .
I do n't know if it 's through sight that I was aware .
... I 'm not sure .
All I know is ... somehow I was aware of information or things that were going on that I would n't normally be able to pick up through seeing .
...
That 's why I 'm being very careful how I 'm wording it , ' cause I 'm not sure where it came from .
I would say to you I have a feeling it did n't come from seeing , and yet I 'm not sure .
Even Brad , whose initial testimony seemed so clear on this point , in a subsequent interview eventually qualified and clarified his earlier remarks about his memory of seeing snow on the streets outside his school :
I was quite aware of all the things that were physically mentioned in there [ i.e. , his earlier description ] .
However , whether it was seen visually through the eyes , I could not say .
... I mean , you have to remember , being born blind , I had no idea whether those images were visual .
...
It was something like a tactual sense , like I could literally feel with the fingers of my mind .
But I did not remember actually touching the snow .
...
The only thing I can really state about those images was that they came to me in an awareness and that I was aware of those images in a way I did not really understand .
I could not really say that they were visual per se because I had never known anything like that before .
But I could say that all my senses seemed to be very active and very much aware .
I was aware .
Brad , too , seemed to be telling us now that he could not be certain his representation of the snow was in any definitive sense " visual " as such , especially since he had no real understanding of what a visual image was .
Instead , as with others in our study , a complex multisensory awareness seems to have been involved , and , in a remarkable similarity with one of the respondents quoted above , Brad made an almost identical statement to hers about the tactile quality of his impression , again suggesting that this modality may be a key feature in the coding of these experiences by the blind , as it certainly is in their daily life .
Vicki as well , in recent exchanges with us , eventually clarified her previous statements concerning whether her experiences could be properly thought of as examples of pure seeing .
In our interview with her on May 27 , 1994 , she allowed , " It was scary at first .
... I had trouble relating things to one another , what I was seeing and perceiving versus what I had touched and known the way I had known things all my life . "
And in a telephone conversation the following year , on July 18 , 1995 , when one of us ( K. R. ) asked her whether in her opinion it was a matter of seeing or knowing in her experience , she unhesitatingly replied , " It 's both , Ken , it 's both seeing and knowing . "
As this kind of testimony builds , it seems more and more difficult to claim that the blind simply see what they report .
Rather , it is beginning to appear it is more a matter of their knowing , through a still poorly understood mode of generalized awareness based on a variety of sensory impressions , especially tactile ones , what is happening around them .
The question that immediately confronts us now , however , is as unavoidable as it is crucial :
Why is it that these reports , when casually perused , nevertheless often seem to imply that the blind do see in a way akin to physical sight ?
As we have already observed , however these experiences may have been coded originally , by the time we encounter them they have long come to be expressed in a particular linguistic form .
And that form is a language of vision , since our ordinary language is rooted in the experiences of sighted persons and is therefore biased in favor of visual imagery .
Because the blind are members of the same linguistic community as sighted persons , we can certainly expect that they will tend , and indeed will be virtually compelled , to phrase their experiences in a language of vision , regardless of its appropriateness to the qualities of their own personal experience .
And there is another clue from our transcripts that mitigates against an overly literal interpretation of our data on apparent vision in the blind .
Examination of language usage by our respondents reveals that they tend to use vision verbs far more casually and loosely than do sighted persons , a finding that other researchers who have studied language in the blind ( Cook , 1970 ; Rathna , 1962 ) have confirmed .
Vicki , for example , said that she loves to " watch " television and uses phrases , such as " look at this , " that clearly can not be taken literally .
Although this observation does not necessarily invalidate the testimony in our reports , it does send up another amber flag of caution when it comes to the interpretation of the narratives of our blind respondents .
In summary , what we have learned from our respondents is that although their experiences may sometimes be expressed in a language of vision , a close reading of their transcripts suggests some thing closer to a multifaceted synesthetic perception that seems to involve much more than an analog of physical sight .
This is not to say that as part of this awareness there cannot be some sort of pictorial imagery as well ; it is only to assert that this must not be taken in any simplistic way as constituting vision as we normally under stand it .
I. Eyeless Vision and Transcendental Awareness
Even if we cannot assert that the blind see in these experiences in any straightforward way , we still have to reckon with the fact that they nevertheless have access to a kind of expanded supersensory awareness that may in itself not be explicable by normal means .
Furthermore , notwithstanding the cases of indistinct and nebulous " sight " we have just reviewed , we must not overlook the ineluctable and very unequivocal claims on the part of most of our respondents that they did seem to possess a type of vision that was very keen , detailed , and even " crystal clear " at times .
Even if these reports may not be analogous to retinal vision as such , they clearly represent something that must be directly addressed .
Thus , it remains for us to grapple with the question of what these reports represent , if not vision .
To pursue this line of inquiry , the first point we must note is that the blind simply represent a kind of limit case in research dealing with alleged perceptions while in a near - death or out - of - body state .
If blind persons report what they cannot possibly see , since they have no physically - mediated sight , or what they cannot know by other nor mal means , as seems to be so in at least some instances in our study , then we have clearly identified a phenomenon that threatens to cast a dark shadow on the house of conventional science .
But it is equally plain that whenever we can show that such perceptions are physically impossible , whether with blind persons or not , the same kind of shadow appears , as indeed it already has , many times , in other research dealing with NDEs and OBEs .
So to begin to focus more clearly on precisely what it is we need to explain here , let us look for a moment at a few illustrative cases one step removed from those we have considered in this report where " impossible perceptions " of great acuity are described by the poorly sighted .
One type of case that has long intrigued us is when such individuals are seemingly able to report such fine and improbably noticed features as , for example , " dust on the light fixtures " in an operating room when , from the location of their physical body at the time as well as their eyesight , such perceptions would manifestly be impossible .
Here , then , are a couple of such instances from our previous research .
One of them came from a woman interviewed in the early 1980s who was 48 years old at the time ( Ring , 1984 ) .
She had had her NDE in connection with a surgical procedure in 1974 .
What was especially noteworthy about her account at the outset , however , was her mention of her unusually garbed anesthesiologist .
As she explained , he was a physician who often worked with children .
And because he had found that his young patients often were confused by a team of similarly clad green - garmented doctors , he had taken to wearing a yellow surgical hat with magenta butterflies on it so he , at least , could easily be recognized .
All this will , of course , be highly relevant to this woman 's account of her experience which will now be described in her own words .
She had gone into shock when she heard her physician exclaim , " This woman 's dying ! "
At that point :
Bang , I left !
The next thing I was aware of was floating on the ceiling .
And seeing down there , with his hat on his head , I knew who he was because of the hat on his head [ i.e. , the anesthesiologist with the magenta butterfly cap ] .. . it was so vivid .
I 'm very near - sighted , too , by the way , which was another one of the startling things that happened to me when I left my body .
I see at fifteen feet what most people see at four hundred .
...
They were hooking me up to a machine that was behind my head .
And my very first thought was , " Jesus , I can see !
I can't believe it , I can see ! "
I could read the numbers on the machine behind my head and I was just so thrilled .
And I thought , " They gave me back my glasses . . . " ( Ring , 1984 , p. 42 )
She went on to describe further details of her operation , including how her body looked , the shaving of her belly , and various medical procedures that her surgical team were performing upon her , and then found herself looking at another object from a position high above her physical body :
From where I was looking , I could look down on this enormous fluorescent light .
... and it was so dirty on top of the light .
[ Could you see the top of the light fixture ? ]
Yes , and it was filthy .
And I remember thinking , " Got to tell the nurses about that . "
( Ring , 1984 , p. 43 )
One of the striking features of this case is this woman 's observation that she was able to see so clearly during her NDE despite the fact that , as she averred , she was very nearsighted .
In this respect , too , this woman 's testimony is far from unique in our records .
Another very similar story was told , for example , in a letter from an audiologist who likewise reported seeing dust on the light fixtures of the operating room where his NDE took place .
This incident occurred in a Japanese hospital during the Korean war .
In addition , this same man , who became interested in NDEs as a result of his own experience , also learned of another case , involving a nurse at the same hospital , which had a remarkable correspondence to his .
On this point , as he wrote in his letter :
The odd thing about both of our experiences is that we are both extremely myopic , i.e. , thick glasses and blind as bats 6 " from our noses .
And yet we were both able to describe accurately events , dials , details , expressions in our OBEs , without our glasses .
Such highly acute visual perceptions on the part of the poorly sighted are hardly limited to those who are apparently hovering above their bodies during NDEs .
Other nonordinary states of consciousness , such as meditation , can also sometimes evoke them .
Here is a particularly compelling example from a book by an optometrist whose uncorrected eyesight was 20/200 :
[ At this time ] I was meditating every day .
...
During one of these deep meditative states , I had a very profound and startling experience .
Although my eyes were closed , I could suddenly see everything - the whole room and myself in it - and I could n't tell where I saw seeing from !
I was n't seeing from my eyes or from any single point of view .
I seemed to be seeing everything from everywhere .
There seemed to be eyes in every cell of my body and in every particle surrounding me .
I could simultaneously see from straight on , from above , from below , from behind , and so on .
...
There seemed to be no observer separate from what was seen .
There was simply awareness .
( Liberman , 1995 , p. 47 )
Here we have an important clue about the nature of this kind of " seeing . "
It may not be limited to the kind of concentrated focus we sometimes encounter in cases of NDEs , where one 's perceptual attention sometimes seems restricted to the physical body .
Instead , as this account shows , one 's awareness can be omnidirectional .
In fact , this type of perception is sometimes reported by those having NDEs or OBEs , and it is precisely this feature that suggests that " awareness " is a more appropriate term for this experience than is " seeing , " as the writer just quoted also implied .
In this new context , then , consider this account from an NDEr whose experience occurred as a result of pneumonia during her second pregnancy .
During this crisis , the woman was rushed to the hospital by her husband and , upon arrival , lost consciousness .
Still , she was able to hear the nurses talking about her , saying that she was " dead meat . "
Nevertheless , she herself was elsewhere at the time .
As she related her experience :
I was hovering over a stretcher in one of the emergency rooms at the hospital .
I glanced down at the stretcher , knew the body wrapped in blankets was mine , and really did n't care .
The room was much more interesting than my body .
And what a neat perspective .
I could see everything .
And I do mean everything !
I could see the top of the light on the ceiling , and the underside of the stretcher .
I could see the tiles on the ceiling and the tiles on the floor , simultaneously .
Three hundred sixty degree spherical vision .
And not just spherical .
Detailed !
I could see every single hair and the follicle out of which it grew on the head of the nurse standing beside the stretcher .
At the time I knew exactly how many hairs there were to look at .
But I shifted focus .
She was wearing glittery white nylons .
Every single shimmer and sheen stood out in glowing detail , and once again I knew exactly how many sparkles there were .
In this narrative , we notice again not only this astonishing feature of omnidirectional awareness , but also a type of knowledge that stretches our concept of ordinary " vision " beyond the breaking point .
Clearly , this is not simple " vision " at all as we are wont to understand it , but almost a kind of seeming omniscience that completely transcends what mere seeing could ever afford .
Indeed , what we appear to have here is a distinctive state of consciousness , which we would like to call transcendental awareness .
In this type of awareness , it is not of course that the eyes see anything ; it is rather that the mind itself sees , but more in the sense of " understanding " or " taking in " than of visual perception as such .
Or alternatively , we might say that it is not the eye that sees , but the " I . "
Celia Green , in an important survey of OBEs ( Green , 1968 ) , found evidence for much the same concept as we are calling transcendental awareness among her respondents , too .
To cite one brief relevant instance , she quoted one of her subjects as saying , " having no eyes , I ' saw ' with whole consciousness " ( Green , 1968 , p. 70 ) .
Indeed , her survey is full of cases showing many of the features we have found in our study of the blind , including instances of keenly detailed perceptions , which some of her subjects , like ours , characterized as " crystal clear , " saying things like , " I could see the room in great detail , even the specks of dust " ( Green , 1968 , p. 72 ) .
Green also reported examples of apparent sight through physical obstacles and multisensory or synesthetic experiences .
Therefore , what students of OBEs tend to call extrasomatic vision seems to be identical to what we have labeled here transcendental awareness .
Still another domain of research that appears to involve this type of awareness is that of pre- and perinatal psychology .
In some investigations of early childhood memories , for example , there are reports by adults of events they appeared to have witnessed prior to birth ( Chamberlain , 1977 ; Cheek , 1986 ) .
In a popular book David Chamberlain ( 1988 ) wrote on apparent birth - related memories , he recounted a story that came from a 3 1/2 - year - old boy named Jason .
Riding home one night , Jason spontaneously said that he remembered being born .
He told his mother that he had heard her crying and was doing everything he could to get out .
He said that it was " tight , " he felt " wet , " and he felt something around his neck and throat .
In addition , something hurt his head and he remembered his face had been " scratched up . "
Jason 's mother said she had " never talked to him about the birth , never , " but the facts were correct .
The umbilical cord had been wrapped around his neck , he had been monitored by an electrode in his scalp , and he had been pulled out by forceps .
The photograph taken by the hospital showed scratches on his face ( Chamberlain , 1988 ) .
Another girl , not quite 4 , in speaking of her own birth , knew a " family secret " that had never been divulged to her .
In this case , a friend of the mother and later an occasional babysitter named Cathy had been present at the birth , assisting the midwife .
After the birth , the midwife had been busy and the mother had by then been helped into a bath , leaving Cathy temporarily alone with the baby .
As the baby began to whimper , Cathy reflexively let the baby suck from her own breast .
By the time the mother had returned , the baby was already asleep , and Cathy , feeling somewhat guilty about being the first person to nurse the child , elected to say nothing to the mother about it .
Nearly four years later , Cathy was babysitting this same child , and , just out of curiosity , happened to ask the child if she remembered being born .
As Chamberlain related what Cathy later told him ,
She answered , " Yes ! , " and proceeded to give an accurate account of who was present and their roles during labor and delivery .
She described the dim light of the womb and the pressures felt during birth .
Then the child leaned up close and whispered in a confidential tone , " You held me and gave me titty when I cried and Mommy was n't there . "
At that , she hopped up and went off to play .
Says
Cathy , " Nobody can tell me babies do n't remember their birth ! " ( Chamberlain , 1988 , pp. 103-104 )
Hearing such suggestive anecdotes as these , Chamberlain felt obliged to see whether he could confirm such reports through systematic research into the question .
For this purpose , he eventually studied a paired set of 10 mothers and children and independently hypnotized them , asking them for details about

6 Reasons to Avoid “ The Pump ” During Your Workouts
Pin 378 382 Shares
Training for the pump has been the holy grail of bodybuilding ever since Arnold Schwarzenegger spoke about it in the documentary “ Pumping Iron ” .
Achieving the pump while working out is a great indicator that your body is in the right condition for muscular growth .
" Visual Impact Kettlebells " - Home Workout Course
A kettlebell course we filmed on the beach in Costa Rica , aimed at helping you get slim and lean without adding bulk .
The big reason that bodybuilders can display much more mass than someone who lifts exclusively for strength is because bodybuilders train for the pump .
Okay … Back to “ The Pump ”
The simplest explanation of the pump is that more blood is forced into the working muscles causing the muscles to swell a bit .
The reason this helps for muscle growth is that the muscles are surrounded by a tissue called the fascial layer .
The pump helps stretch this layer out a bit allowing more room for muscle growth to occur .
The pump also helps the body create more capillaries which in turn allows the body to create large and larger pumps and more growth .
What Causes A Large Pump in the Muscles ?
The biggest factor in creating a large pump is the level of muscle glycogen in your body .
Simply put , when you eat an adequate number of carbs this becomes an energy source that is stored in the muscles .
When your muscles are full of glycogen , your body is “ carbed up ” .
You will achieve the pump easily in this state .
The way you lift has a lot to do with the pump as well .
Typically higher reps ( 6 - 12 ) and less rest between sets will maximize the pump .
Why Do I Recommend Avoiding the Pump ?
I will list several reasons I do n’t recommend training for the pump .
Remember , this is n’t a bodybuilding site .
I focus solely on tips to help people get the “ Hollywood Look ” .
Nobody in Hollywood has that bloated pumped up look .
That excessive muscle look is completely out of style , is n’t attractive to the general population , and really is n’t very healthy .
1 ) The Pump Creates Temporary Muscle Tone
When the muscles are pumped up , they grow in size and the skin tightens up a bit around the muscles .
When the muscles are in this state they look a bit better than normal .
They look quite a bit more defined .
The problem is that once this temporary state is gone , the muscles look a bit soft .
Later in this post , I ’ll discuss a better strategy to ensure that your muscles look defined all day long .
2) The Pump Makes You Look Leaner Than You Actually Are
When your chest and back is pumped up , it tends to hide that bit of fat around your waist .
In proportion to these larger , pumped up muscles you look like you have less body fat .
Even worse than that , a lot of guys will focus on how good their arms or chest look and forget about that lagging midsection .
The pump creates an illusion of being in better shape than you are .
The problem is that once you hit the beach in the summer , you will realize that you do n’t look quite as good as you thought you did .
You should have worked harder on cardio .
3 ) It Will Cause Growth in Muscles That You Want to Slim Down
Women please , please , please read this !
If you want to slim down your legs , hips , and butt avoid exercises that create a pump in these muscle groups .
Remember , the pump will stretch the fascia to allow the muscles to grow .
Here is a tip from my sister who is in incredible shape … if the exercise bike is pumping up your legs , stick to running instead .
4 ) The Pump Gives a “ Bloated Sausage ” Look to Your Muscles
It is had to describe in words , but guys and girls who train for the pump have a strange unnatural look to their muscles .
The muscles are too rounded in my opinion .
An attractive body has a more lean , angular look to it .
The excessively large rounded muscles create kind of a “ cheesy ” look .
When people look at you , you do n’t want them to think “ gym person ” .
You want them to think … “ that is an attractive looking guy or girl with a hot body ” .
This is a subtle but important difference .
5 ) The Pump Creates Excessive Muscle Mass
I am not against muscle mass .
I just think “ excessive ” muscle mass creates a very unattractive look .
See each person has a natural amount of muscle mass that they look great with .
A person with a small frame like Brad Pitt , would naturally carry less muscle mass than The Rock .
They both look great although their amount of mass varies greatly .
If people focus on functional strength , cardio fitness , and muscular efficiency without forcing the issue to gain mass , they will look much better .
Unfortunately , most personal trainers teach their clients to build muscle mass at all costs .
This is why working out for “ the pump ” is so popular .
The most efficient bodies have a high strength at a lower body weight .
So training for strength without an increase in size is how to get a more efficient body .
This is the polar opposite of what bodybuilders do .
6 ) The Pump is An Indicator For Muscle Growth But NOT Fat Loss !
Whenever my muscles get really pumped in my workout , I know that I am in a poor position to burn excess body fat .
you see , to create the best conditions for the pump to occur , your body has to be “ carbed up ” a bit ( as I mentioned earlier ) .
This means that your muscles are full of glycogen , which is how your muscles store fuel .
The other major fuel that your body uses is body fat .
The problem is that your body will use all of this stored glycogen before it accesses your stored body fat .
If your body is carbed up , your muscles will look great in the gym .
You will look more toned because as mentioned earlier the enlarged muscles will reduce the appearance of some of that body fat .
Keep the Reps Low , Build Strength Without an Increase in Mass
When you get stronger without getting bigger , your muscles will begin to display permanent muscle tone .
You will gain muscle density and get a firm body that looks great 24 hours a day .
A body built on the pump looks good while in the pumped state ( in the gym ) , but poor the rest of the time .
An example of athletes who train for strength without increasing mass is Gymnasts .
Their bodies look defined at all times .
As long as you train for strength without aiming for the pump and you keep your calories under control , you will not need to worry about excessive muscle mass .
I also recommend following up your brief strength training workout with intense cardio .
How Your Mind Plays Tricks on You in the Gym
Everyone looks much more muscular and defined in a pumped up state .
A normal looking guy or girl can transform their body with a few reps of bench presses and look really ripped if his body is carbed up .
This is psychologically rewarding , especially to guys and girls who like the bodybuilder look .
When you go into the gym in a carb depleted state and train for low reps , your body wo n’t transform a few sets into your workout .
What you see in the mirror is how your body will look 24 hours a day .
It will be a weird transition for you if you are used to seeing bulging muscles after 4 - 5 sets of curls .
The great thing is that you will know exactly where you stand , and will know exactly how much fat you need to drop to look defined .
If anything , you will look worse in the gym than you do the rest of the time .
" Visual Impact Kettlebells " - Home Workout Course
A kettlebell course we filmed on the beach in Costa Rica , aimed at helping you get slim and lean without adding bulk .
The decision is yours , look impressive in the gym or impressive the rest of the time .
So says Rick Fisk over at LewRockwell.com :
Let ’s face it : Ron Paul does n’t have a lot of new ideas .
His foreign policy harkens back to the very first President , George Washington .
George Washington , who gave up a dictatorship , given to him by the continental Congress to prosecute the revolutionary war , was crazy .
Washington was the original “ decider ” and gave up all of that power so that a bunch of politicians could meet and draft the Constitution .
That same tired old document to which Ron Paul keeps referring in speech after speech .
Now , if Washington would have just kept his dictatorship , he could have written the Constitution himself .
(…)
Ron Paul may sound different then the current crop of Republican candidates , and the current President , but really he ’s not very original .
In fact , he sounds like Bob Taft who most of us would n’t know about but for Ron Paul ’s incessant referrals to historical figures .
Ron Paul would turn back the clock on many original ideas put forth by past Presidents .
Wilson ’s income tax ?
Gone .
The Iraq war and pre-emptive war , the two Bush additions to original Presidential thought gone as well .
The department of Education ?
Homeland Security ?
Welfare ?
All Gone .
No original idea would be spared from the boring veto pen of a Paul presidency .

BREAKING 9/11 NEWS : FBI Says Barbara Olsen Did Not Call Ted Olsen . Bush Solicitor General LIED !!
by Bill Douglas
Nationally syndicated talk show host Charles Goyette uncovered blockbuster information in his drive - time interview with author David Ray Griffin .
A center piece of the increasingly apparent BULLSH*T story our government and corporate media have fed us for six long years was a complete fabrication !
We were fed a lie by Ted Olsen who served as Solictor General for the Bush Administration , when on 9/11 he held a press conference to tell America and the world that his dead wife had called him before her demise from the jet she was on that had just been hijacked .

The transition from computer technician to software developer can be pretty rough .
Not only does one have to give up the chic company car ( and , of course , all the hot dates it guarantees ) , but he has to land that rare technician job that has just enough programming work to stretch his job title on a résumé to “ programmer . ”
Garret was lucky enough to find that job at a small computer repair shop we ’ll called “ AAAA Computers ”
Garret ’s official title AAAA Computers was “ Technical Office Manager , ” which came with a job description of “ ya know , just do whatever it takes to run the shop ‘n stuff . ”
Being that Garret was the only employee at that location , this involved everything from fielding phone calls to sweeping the floors at night .
The salary – a whopping $ 22,000 per year – was a bit less than Garret had hoped for , but the owner assured him that once annual revenue increased past the $ 20,000 mark , he ’d definitely get a raise .
The technician Technical Office Manager that Garret was replacing was not much of a multi- tasker and would often “ get confused ” if he had to work on more than one computer at a time , which lead to slow turnaround , which lead to dragging sales .
For this reason , Garret was confident he ’d be able to boost sales .
By utilizing all four spots on the technician bench , a few KVM switches , and some simple install scripts , Garret found himself with a lot of free time .
The first thing he wanted to tackle was the custom work - order system they were using .
Built by a contractor for a whopping $ 1,500 , it had all sorts of “ quirks ” like crashing if a date text field was not entered correctly ( and , of course , taking any unsaved work with it ) .
Having worked with PHP in his free time , Garret convinced the owner to let him replace the work order system with something he ’d write from scratch .
In about two months , Garret had built it and was very happy with how it turned out .
Customers had Computers , Computers had Work Orders , Work Orders had Notes , and the Service Provided Type determined what Service Check List would print on the Work Order .
The owner was definitely impressed .
Shortly after rolling out the work - order management system , the owner asked Garret if he could develop a new software application that he could sell to customers .
The specs where , “ ya know , the registry cleaner , privacy watcher , anti-spyware sort of thing . ”
Garret explained that this was a bit of a leap from a simple PHP / MySQL application , but the boss was convinced that Garret could do it .
And he knew exactly how , too : by stealing other software vendor ’s databases and programs .
Garret was n’t very comfortable blatantly ripping off or trying to reverse engineer other software , but the owner told him that “ it ’s how everyone builds it . ”
While Garret was n’t fully convinced , he knew this presented a good opportunity for more software development experience .
So he figured out a way to take other program ’s data in the least unscrupulous way possible : through the log files .
Whenever a computer came in to the shop for spyware removal , Garret ran a script that installed and executed SpyBot and AdAware .
He simply modified his script to upload the programs ’ log files to a PHP page , which would then parse the logs and add the removed items to the database .
It was pure genius in Garret ’s estimation , and within a few weeks , the database grew quickly .
The first version of the “ AAAA Computer Cleaner ” program was developed in MS Access .
It took a few months to hack together and actually managed to work somewhat .
The biggest problem , however , was distribution : users would need Access .
While the owner had no qualms installing a “ not fully licensed ” copy of Access on customer computers , many already had different versions of Access already installed , and replacing it seemed like it might cause trouble .
So Garret decided to upgrade to Visual Basic 6 .
Going from Access to VB6 was pretty easy as most of the code was in VBA .
However , the biggest hurdle that Garret faced with VB6 was installation : without InstallSheild or some other program , he just could n’t figure out a way to build an installer that would take care of his program and the VB6 runtime .
Having heard about a thing called “ MSI , ” he decided to investigate and learned that he ’d have to use VB.NET instead .
So he decided to cut his teeth on that , too .
After the owner provided Garret with a “ not fully licensed copy ” of VisualBasic .
NET , he also added a small requirement : the program had to be finished within the next two months in order to be pressed to CD , packaged , and ready for the Christmas season .
Garret worked day and night for the next several weeks to figure out how to do registry , hard drive , spyware cleaning , and – per the owner ’s request – silently search for any AdAware or SpyBot logs and upload those , too .
It was rough , but Garret managed to hack something together that worked well enough to be sold to customers .
Which , as you might imagine , was a pretty low bar to reach .
Shortly thereafter , the owner delivered a bit of good news .
AAAA Computers was now able to offer an entirely new service : custom software development services .
Garret was a bit wary of this venture , too , and expressed his concerns to the owner .
After all , he really struggled building the first two applications and did n’t feel quite ready to develop other people ’s software .
Not that it mattered of course : the owner was already awarded a contract to build another company ’s medical billing software .
As you might imagine , the project did n’t go so well .
With no rules , no specs , no design documentation , no direction , and unreasonable deadlines , Garret and his newly - hired fellow technician / programmer delivered some horribly developed software that he ’s ashamed of to this day .
But the important part is that it brought in a boatload of cash : more than ten times Garret ’s annual salary , all in two months .
Not too eager to start up another software project , Garret implored his boss to hire a senior developer , provide them with some classes , get them some books , or at least purchase a “ fully licensed ” version of VB.
NET .
The owner scoffed , telling Garret not to “ ya know , not complicate things too much . ”
A week later , when it came time for his one - year review , Garret asked for a little more than the average 3 % raise .
He was hoping that , because he was able to increase revenue almost twenty - fold with customer service and software development , he could get $ 30,000 salary the next year , and , if things continued to work well , $ 45,000 the year after that .
His boss did not look too thrilled at that idea .
So , one year and a day after joining the company , Garret was let go .
“ Ya know , ” as the owner put it , “ you ’re objecting to everything , you ’re just overcomplicating everything , and now yer asking for all sorts of money .
I can hire a whole team of complacent programmers for that kinda cash . ”
While Garret is n’t too thrilled about the fact that he helped build a horrible anti-spyware program and helped launch a second - rate software outfit , at least he could now put “ programmer ” on his résumé .
Low - Energy Water Desalination From Seawater Greenhouse
February 16th , 2008 by Joe Mohr
Three –hundred twenty - six million trillion !
It sounds like a number I would come up with as a kid , say , in reference to the number of things I find disgusting about my sister , or the number of reasons I need a new bike , or the number of mosquito bites I got on a weekend camping trip .
But , it turns out , 326 million trillion is a real number .
It happens to be ( approximately — because who could count them all ? ) the number of gallons of water on our wonderful planet ( Earth ) .
That ’s an overwhelming , impressive and — when you learn that 98 % of that water is ocean water , and therefore too salty to consume , or use for irrigation — frustrating figure !
In these times where climate chaos has caused more frequent severe droughts , and our population continues to grow ( read : consume water ) at an awesome rate , people are becoming more and more concerned with water conservation .
Humanity finds itself increasingly at a loss for freshwater while roughly 315 million trillion gallons of unusable seawater taunts us from our shores .
Sure , desalination plants are becoming more common .
They are very expensive , however , and so energy intensive that they only further contribute to the climate change they are attempting remedy ( thereby , joining corn - based ethanol as the two largest non-solutions to our climate problems ) .
Fear not my fellow water - loving earthlings !
There is an even better way to remove the salt from salt water : a Seawater Greenhouse !
This UK - based company explains the process as one that :
uses seawater to cool and humidify the air that ventilates the greenhouse and sunlight to distill fresh water from seawater .
This enables the year round cultivation of high value crops that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to grow in hot , arid ( conditions ) .
The overall process produces water at the energy cost of less than 3kWh / m3 .
I can think of 326 million trillion reasons to get excited about this solution !

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President George W. Bush on Thursday sharply criticized foreign policies advocated by Democratic front - runner Barack Obama , saying it would be a mistake to meet the leaders of Iran and Cuba without preconditions or swiftly change course in Iraq .
“ I ’m not suggesting there ’s never a time to talk , but I ’m suggesting now is not the time ... to talk with Raul Castro , ” Bush told a White House news conference after being asked about Obama ’s willingness to meet with the new Cuban president , Raul Castro .
“ It will send the wrong message .
...
It will give great status to those who have suppressed human rights and human dignity , ” Bush added , saying there was no difference between Raul Castro and his brother , Fidel , who recently stepped aside as president because of ill health .
It was the first major instance of Bush injecting himself into the presidential race to choose who will succeed him in the November election , with his unpopular Iraq war a major debating point on the campaign trail .
Asked about Obama ’s remark during a recent debate with rival Hillary Clinton that he advocated withdrawing from Iraq but might send troops back to avoid al Qaeda forming a base there , Bush said U.S. forces had been fighting in Iraq for four years to prevent that from happening .
“ I believe Senator Obama better stay focused on his campaign with Senator Clinton , neither of whom has secured their party ’s ... nomination yet , ” Bush added .
Obama quickly fired back , saying : “ The American people are n’t looking for more of a do - nothing Cuba policy that has failed to secure the release of dissidents , failed to bring democracy to the island and failed to advance freedom for 50 years . ”
Obama repeatedly has advocated meeting without preconditions with leaders of such hostile nations as Cuba and Iran , saying current U.S. policy is not working and it is time for a fresh look at ways to improve relations .
“ The next president has a job to do to repair our image and to send a signal ... that a new era is being ushered in and that we are not afraid to talk to anybody , including those who we have grave problems with , ” Obama said .
MCCAIN , OBAMA TRADE BARBS
Bush ’s comments on Obama ’s policies reflected how closely he is watching the campaign and how eager he is to guard his legacy .
He has yet to formally endorse the Republican front - runner , Arizona Sen .
John McCain , but is expected to do so .
McCain , a strong Iraq war supporter and former prisoner of war in Vietnam , continued his attacks on Obama on Thursday , criticizing the Illinois senator for pledging to withdraw from Iraq .
“ The decision to unilaterally withdraw from Iraq and set a date for withdrawal would lead to chaos , ” McCain told reporters at a Houston airport .
“ Al Qaeda will announce to the world that they have defeated the United States of America . ”

Obama fended off the criticism .
“ The American people are n’t looking for tough talk about fighting for 100 years in Iraq , because they know we need to end this war , finish the job in Afghanistan , and take the fight to al Qaeda , ” he said .
Obama ’s rejection of what he calls conventional thinking in Washington has put him in the driver ’s seat to seize the Democratic nomination from Clinton , long considered the inevitable nominee .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
The exchange came as a new Pew Research Center poll showed Obama with a broad - based advantage over Clinton before critical March 4 contests in Texas and Ohio to select a Democratic presidential candidate for the November election .
The poll found Obama leading Clinton 49 percent to 40 percent among Democratic primary voters .
But 70 percent of Democratic voters now see Obama as the likely nominee , including more than half of Clinton supporters , the poll found .
Clinton , who has strong support among low - income voters , toured the economically struggling Appalachian foothills of southern Ohio on Thursday to tout her proposals to help lower - income and middle - income families .
The former first lady and New York senator announced she had raised $ 35 million in the past month , but Obama reportedly was poised to surpass her in fundraising again .
Obama has consistently led Clinton in fundraising , an advantage that showed in advertising figures for Texas and Ohio .
Media research firm Nielsen reported on Thursday that Obama aired 80 percent more ads in Ohio than Clinton between February 1 and February 24 , and nearly 50 percent more in Texas .

Six years ago , Eli Beller was your typical 7 - year - old , soccer - playing , fun- loving kid until the headaches began .
His parents suspected he had a temporary sinus problem , but it never got better .
Eventually it progressed to what resembled severe flu - like symptoms , and one day the little boy staggered like a drunk .
His famous grandmother , Eva Marie Saint , says the news from the doctor was not good .
“ That night , ” says the actress , “ they operated on a brain tumor . ”
Advertisement
In the next two weeks , Eli endured four operations .
“ It was very dramatic , ” says his mother , Laurette Hayden , “ and touch - and - go . ”
Fortunately , the tumor was benign and Eli pulled through .
But the following year , he developed another problem that is with him to this day .
“ He ’d have strange abdominal pains , turn pale and not be entirely conscious , ” says Hayden .
“ No one could quite figure it out .
Amazingly enough , the school nurse called and said she thought it might be seizures . ”
Advertisement
Hayden had her doubts , but the nurse turned out to be a good doctor .
Eli had epilepsy , which might have been caused by the brain tumor or surgery .
His family -- including grandparents Saint and Jeffrey Hayden , a TV director and producer -- was about to discover how little they knew about the disease .
Laurette Hayden and her husband , Miles Beller , knew about the familiar grand mal convulsion .
To them , that was epilepsy .
But they soon learned epileptics can have more than 20 types of seizures , that 180,000 new cases are reported in the United States each year , that a four - county area in Southern California has at least 150,000 epileptics , and that nearly 50 million people in the world are afflicted .
As Saint said in a letter she sent to friends , “ More people have epilepsy than Parkinson ’s , cerebral palsy , muscular dystrophy , and multiple sclerosis combined . ”

You do n’t hear about fundraisers for epilepsy research and education , though , because there are n’t many .
“ It ’s not a ‘ sexy ’ disease , ” says Laurette Hayden , a senior VP with the USA Network .
That ’s partly because of an aggressive campaign , years ago , to de-stigmatize epilepsy .
So says Susan Pietsch Escueta , director of the Epilepsy Foundation of Los Angeles , Orange , Ventura and San Bernardino counties .
The public got the idea that it was easily treatable , Escueta says .
But medication does n’t always stop the seizures , and victims live with all sorts of medical and social problems big and small .

Eli had the advantage of a family that did everything they could to educate themselves and help him .
Eva Marie Saint and Jeff Hayden attended support group meetings run by daughter Laurette , who last year asked them if they could think of a way to raise a few dollars for the thousands of Southern California families dealing with epilepsy .
Yes , as a matter of fact .
Saint , who won an Academy Award for “ On the Waterfront , ” and Jeff Hayden , who directed the likes of “ Leave It to Beaver , ” “ That Girl ” and “ The Andy Griffith Show , ” have been staging the two - character A.R. Gurney play “ Love Letters ” a few times a year .
It ’s the story of a long love affair , and Saint and Hayden -- married for more than 50 years -- decided to stage the play this Valentine ’s Day weekend .
The show will be at the Beverly Hills Hotel at 2 p.m. Sunday .
“ As you may know , ” Saint wrote last November in an invitation to friends , “ epilepsy has affected the life of our 13 - year - old grandson , Eli ....
Like many who live with epilepsy , his seizures are still not completely under control but he ’s determined not to let them control his life .

“ He approaches each day with a positive outlook and courage , is an ‘ A ’ student who loves music , the arts , and sports .
He ’s an inspiration to our family . ”
At the bottom of her letter was a P.S .
“ By the way , St. Valentine is the patron saint of epilepsy . ”
A limited number of tickets can still be had by calling the Epilepsy Foundation at ( 310 ) 670-2870 .
The proceeds will help fund a camp for teens with epilepsy and another camp for kids and their families .

Eli , as it turns out , is among the roughly 25 % of epileptics for whom medication does not prevent seizures .
He has had the same relatively mild seizures every two weeks for several years , and at 13 , worries about things like whether he ’ll get a doctor ’s clearance to drive when he turns 16 .
But things are looking up for him lately .
He switched to a new medicine , and has now gone nearly a month without a seizure .
Eli , who lives in Brentwood , was sitting down to a cheese pizza the other night when I called and asked about the speech he intends to make Sunday after his grandparents perform .
“ I ’m going to say , ‘ I hope you enjoyed the show , ’ ” Eli said .

Sixty percent of the Arab World 's population is under 30 years old
In a report , bank officials said Arab states had to make improving education their top priority , because it went hand - in - hand with economic development .
The region had not seen the increasing literacy and school enrolment witnessed in Asia and Latin America , they said .
Djibouti , Yemen , Iraq and Morocco were ranked the worst educational reformers .
' Youthful region '
In its report , the World Bank issued a stark warning about the need for better education in the Arab world .
If we are to create such jobs , then we have to start with education
Marwan Muasher
World Bank
Send us your comments
It said that although education was becoming more accessible and the gender gap was being reduced , the region had not witnessed the positive changes seen in Asia and Latin America , particularly in literacy rates and enrolments in secondary schools and universities .
A senior World Bank official , Marwan Muasher , told the BBC that educational reform had to take top priority if the region 's youth were to be better equipped in a fast - changing world and high unemployment combated .
" The time has come for countries to focus their energies on the quality of education and making sure that students are equipped with what they need for the labour market needs now - the ability to solve problems , critical thinking , innovation , and teacher retraining , " he said .
The report said unemployment in the Arab world averaged 14 % , which is higher than other areas in the world , except Sub - Saharan Africa , with the Palestinian territories coming highest with nearly 26 % percent .
Mr Muasher said educational reform went hand in hand with economic development , especially given the region 's extremely high youth population .
" It 's a very youthful region - 60 % of the region 's population is under 30 years of age , close to 100 m new jobs will need to be created over the next 10 to 15 years in the Arab world , " he explained .
" If we are to create such jobs , then we have to start with education . "
The report concluded that Jordan and Kuwait were the top educational reformers in the region , while Djibouti , Yemen , Iraq and Morocco ranked lowest in terms of access , efficiency and quality of education .
Another study carried out in January by the Tunis - based Arab League Educational Cultural and Scientific Organisation found that 30 % of the approximately 300 million people in the Arab World were illiterate .
Why not be self - sufficient ?
Do you make your own shoes ?
If you invested some time learning shoemaking , you could save the money you regularly spend on new shoes .
What about butter – why not churn your milk ?
If , like cavemen , everyone was entirely self - sufficient , our monthly spending would be zero .
That would be fortunate , because our income would be zero as well , since no one would buy anything from us either .
Everyone outsources
We do n’t make everything ourselves because we do n’t have the time to produce everything we want .
Humans learned long ago that it is beneficial to trade our specialized labor in one field for the labor of others in another , with money as the means of exchange .
The difference between the short hardscrabble lives of a hunter - gatherer society and our relatively luxurious existence is due to the gains in efficiency made possible by voluntary exchange .
Everything is outsourced
In “ I , Pencil ” , Leonard Read writes that there is n’t a single person on earth who knows how to make a pencil .
The process of acquiring and assembling the cedar , lacquer , graphite , ferrule , factice , pumice , wax , and glue that compose a pencil are performed by thousands of people all over the world .
No one individual is capable of understanding all the processes involved or arranging all the transactions that deliver the necessary supplies to the right step .
Voluntary exchange between individuals who know only their immediate trading partners makes possible a process that no central planner could design .
None of the participants engage in it because they need a pencil , but because they want the goods and services others produce in order to buy a pencil .
A policy of free trade is beneficial even when it is unilateral
Some isolationists argue that foreigners have “ unfair ” advantages due to lax labor or environmental regulations , industry subsidies , or restrictions on imports abroad .
But such arguments miss the whole point of trade .
Capitalism is not a zero-sum game where profits are redistributed from one producer to another .
Consumers who buy cheap foreign goods make their money available to buy other products , increasing everyone ’s living standards .
Domestic producers who lose sales to cheaper foreign goods benefit from increased consumer spending at home , and foreigners with dollars clamoring to spend them on domestic industries .
Governments that subsidize export industries only rob their taxpayers to pay foreign buyers .
When France subsidizes steel exports , American steel foundries lose money , but Americans get cheaper consumer goods , and “ free ” Euros to buy goods that would have belonged to French taxpayers .
Ultimately , restrictions on trade based on international borders are arbitrary and just as destructive as internal barriers .
Trade deficits and surpluses are natural states of economic development
The U.S. has a trade deficit when foreigners accept more U.S. dollars for their products than vice versa .
If a deficit were to continue indefinitely , Americans would have a permanent supply of “ free ” foreign goods , since dollars are worthless if they are never spent .
Foreigners trade at a deficit with America because they are confident that the we will have products they want sometime in the future .
Likewise , we accumulate foreign currency in the belief that foreign goods will be valuable .
Surpluses and deficits are natural states that every nation experiences as it varies between being a net recipient of investments or a net investor .

Much to my surprise , Kinetic was linked to from the Programming sub -Reddit today .
In the past couple of days , Kinetic has suddenly drawn some attention .
The feedback has been encouraging , but a few themes have come up in the questions people have asked .
So here ’s a few comments that might clear things up a bit :
I had n’t really intended for Kinetic to get much review ; I had created the website merely so my friends could see what I was up to .
In other words , the statements are n’t meant to be taken too seriously : this is n’t an academic journal , it ’s a personal website .
Kinetic uses the Foreign Function Interface to interact with C++ and Assembler .
In general , the FFI enables pointer arithmetic , and is therefore able to subvert type safety .
I have n’t yet come up with a better way for addressing a graphics adapter ’s linear frame buffer .
I ’m sincerely interested in suggestions for how to deal with that .
Nope , I have n’t posted any code yet .
I ’m not opposed to the idea of releasing snapshots in the future , when things are a bit more mature .
There has been speculation as to how much of the operating system is written in Haskell .
Here ’s a rough breakdown .
C++ : Stuff for initializing the IDT and GDT , some bitmap routines ( for performance ) , the FreeType library , as well as basic functions for supporting the GHC runtime .
Haskell : PCI driver , mouse and keyboard driver , VMWare graphics adapter driver , most of the GUI .
Hope that helps to clarify a few things .
Remember when the promise of being able to ditch the office to work from home in your pajamas sounded like the best invention since Pop - Tarts ?
Alas , far from making our lives more tranquil , it seems that all too often advances in mobile technology have actually tethered us to the office .

Price : Free for 5GB of storage ; $ 9.95 per month for 50GB
Best For : Managing projects remotely
What it is : A Web - based collaboration tool that works like a souped - up , secure version of MySpace
What 's cool : With Basecamp , team members on a project log on to a shared space on the Internet , where they can post files for the team 's review , chat in a secure environment , and chalk off project milestones .
Traveling employees can easily stay in the loop , review project files , and offer feedback to the rest of the team at headquarters .
Drawbacks : Besides letting you change a few colors , Basecamp wo n't handle much customization .
It also requires an administrator to keep careful tabs on which projects certain employees are allowed to view , so the wrong people wo n't stumble onto a confidential project .

Security services thereafter run about $ 830 per year for up to several hundred users .
Best For : Do-it - yourselfers
What it is :
Free open - source software that lets you control another computer over the Internet
What 's cool :
This Unix - based software was created to help IT departments troubleshoot co-workers ' computers without leaving their desks .
But other employees could use it to control their office desktops from home .
The only costs are additional servers , if necessary , and your investment in time .
There are no pesky subscription fees .
Drawbacks :
You get what you pay for .
It 's not a very secure system , and there is no technical support .
Unless you have a wonklike appetite for keeping up with the latest security patches , you 're bound to have headaches .
If you experience problems , your only hope is to go online and ask for advice from fellow users .

KANSAS CITY , Mo. 
Whatever their ideological differences this election year , Americans seem able to agree on one thing : the political landscape being crisscrossed by the 2008 candidates is barely recognizable as the one traveled by George W. Bush and Al Gore a mere eight years ago .
Obviously , Sept. 11 and its aftermath have changed the country in countless and irretrievable ways .
But even beyond the emergence of war and national security as pre-eminent concerns , there has been a profound reordering of domestic priorities , a darkening of the country ’s mood and , in the eyes of many , a fraying of America ’s very sense of itself .
While not universal , that tone pervaded dozens of interviews conducted over the last week with Americans of all political stripes in 8 of the 24 states that hold primaries or caucuses on Feb.
5 , as well as with historians , elected officials , political strategists and poll takers .
As the candidates fan out to New York and California and here to the heartland , they are confronting an electorate that is deeply unsettled about the United States ’ place in the world and its ability to control its own destiny .
Since World War II , the assumption of American hegemony has never been much in doubt .
That it now is , at least for some people , has given this campaign a sense of urgency that was not always felt in 2000 , despite the dramatic outcome of that race .
[ UPDATE : I ’ve been lucky enough to have some commenters who know much more about functional programming than I do .
There ’s some good reading in the comments , and you especially should read them before using this stuff in production . ]
I ’ve been playing with functional JavaScript tonight .
It ’s not the greatest of OO - functional hybrid languages , but it ’s good to supplant my fledgling functional skills with something besides Ruby .
Plus , I ’m not the only one doing it , so I can compare notes .
And who does n’t love JavaScript , right ?
… right ?
Before I get much farther , I should thank Adam Turoff for his post What ’s Wrong with the For Loop .
It gets at the root of the why we ’d use a functional programming language instead of an OO or procedural one , and ( bonus ! ) it helped me grok Ruby ’s inject method ( it ’s the same as my new friend fold ) .
Go read his post , it ’s good for you .
And if you like it , we recommend the 1981 SICP lectures .
Robusto !
Here we go !
Introductions to functional programming usually discuss three methods : map , find , and fold .
The names are n’t always the same , but those are the three amigos of functional programming .
They all do something different to arrays ( or lists , or collections , or whatever you want to call them ) :
find does what it says .
You give it some criteria , it returns all the matching elements .
The criteria is expressed as a function , a little bit of code that says “ yes , I want this one , ” or “ no , skip it . ”
If we ’re picking out the red gumballs , you could say ( in Ruby ) gumballs .
find_all { |ball| ball .isRed ?
} find is also known as filter .
[ Ruby only calls it find_all because it uses find for returning just the first match . ]
Po -tay - to , po-tah - to .

Po -tay - to , po -tah - to .
fold takes each element , and “ folds ” it into a running total .
Think of summation — you ’re folding each new number into a running tally .
In Haskell ( and , it seems , many functional languages ) , it comes in two varietes , fold_left and fold_right , which just mean “ start from the left ” and “ start from the right ” .
Ruby calls it inject , which confuses some people ( like me ) .

map is the mathiest of them ( do n’t be scared , it ’s easy ! ) .
In English , we ’d say “ change each item like this , and give me the new results . ”
Let ’s down - case a list of words .
“ Change each word to lowercase , and give me the downcased words . ” words.map { | word| word .
downcase } .
The name “ map ” comes from functions in math ( surprise ) , where you map each input to one output .
The whole y = f( x ) thing … f is for “ function ” .
Ruby also calls this collect .
Now , none of these comes predefined in JavaScript .
How can this be ?
Well , all the JavaScript engines out there are in browsers , and we know that “ when browser elephants battle , it is the JavaScript grass that suffers . ”
The browser developers are busy with other things .
But this oversight means we have some easy examples to write .
It ’s boring to re-implement existing stuff , just for the exercise .
So here we go — I ’ll compare examples in JavaScript and Ruby .
A quick word about JavaScript ’s open classes
JavaScript has open classes , just like Ruby .
In other words , you can re-open a class definition , give it a method , and then start using that method on instances of that class .
JavaScript ’s OO is prototype - based , not class - based , so it looks a little weird :
Array.prototype.first = function ( ) { return this [ 0 ] ; } [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . first ( ) ; // 1 Array.prototype.rest = function ( ) { return this.slice ( 1 ) ; } [ 1 , 2 , 3].rest ( ) ; // [ 2 , 3 ] Array.prototype.isEmpty = function ( ) { return this .
length == 0 ; } [ ].isEmpty ( ) ; // true [ 1 ].isEmpty ( ) ; // false
“ For the prototypical Array , the Array from which all other Arrays spring forth , create a property called ‘ first ’ , which shall be this function , which returns the first element of the Array … ” Just a Biblical way of defining a method for a class .
Open classes is good news , because it ’ll make our job of adding map , find , and fold possible , since they ’ll be going into the Array class .
Find
find is the easiest , so we ’ll start there .
Let ’s take a look :
Array.prototype.find = function ( isAMatch ) { var matches = [ ] ; for ( i = 0 ; i < this .
length ; i++) { if ( isAMatch ( this [ i ] ) ) { matches.push ( this [ i ] ) ; } } return matches ; }
find is a function , and it takes the function isAMatch as a parameter .
One of the hallmarks of the functional programming style is that functions are first - class citizens in the language : they can be treated like any other variable , so they can be passed around as parameters , and returned from other functions .
[ Closures and anonymous functions are also major features . ]
is AMatch is a function that tells you whether we should include any given element of the Array .
Use find like this :
var evens = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] . find ( function ( i ) { return i % 2 == 0 ; } ) ; function is Odd( i ) { return i % 2 != 0 ; } var odds = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ].find( isOdd ) ;
The first example uses an in - line , anonymous function ; the second uses a named function .
Both work fine , but here is where we start to see JavaScript ’s awkward syntax get in the way .
Consider the Ruby version :
# find_all comes pre-defined in Array , via the Enumerable module , # but this is what it would look like ... class Array def find_all matches = [ ] self . each do |item| # Ruby says ' self ' , not ' this '. if yield ( item ) # yield says " Call the block we were given " matches.push ( item ) #
Stuff item into matches end end return matches end end evens = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] . find_all { |i| i % 2 == 0 } def is Odd( i ) i % 2 != 0 end odds = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] . find_all { |i| is Odd(i ) }
In Ruby , every expression returns a value , so return disappears .
And Ruby ’s blocks mean we do n’t need to wrap our match condition inside function ( i ) { ... } .
But Ruby ’s find_all wo n’t take a reference to a method as a parameter :
def is Odd(i ) i % 2 != 0 end odds = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ].find_all( isOdd ) # gives error : `isOdd ' : wrong number of arguments ( 0 for 1 ) ( ArgumentError )
Once you ’ve defined a function in JavaScript , you can pass it around by name , like any other variable , but you need that function ( i ) { ... } syntax around your test .
In Ruby , find_all takes a block instead of parameters , so you ca n’t pass a reference .
Given how nice blocks are in Ruby , I guess this can be forgiven , but it ’s a little weird .
Fold
Now we ’ll get into the recursive guys .
find is a pain to implement recursively in JavaScript , so I did it iteratively , but recursion works well for fold and map .
Since recursion seems to be more idiomatic in functional languages , we ’ll use it here .
I took two shots at fold in JavaScript ( I ’m learning ) .
Here they are :
Array.prototype.fold_recursive = function ( combineFunc , base ) { if ( this.isEmpty ( ) ) { //
I added isEmpty , first , and rest , as above return base ; } else { return combineFunc ( this .
first ( ) , this.rest().fold_recursive(combineFunc , base ) ) ; } } Array.prototype.fold_iterative = function ( combineFunc , tally ) { if ( this.isEmpty ( ) ) { return tally ; } else { return this.rest ().fold_iterative ( combineFunc , combineFunc( this.first( ) , tally ) ) ; } }
The first is straightforward recursion .
If the list is empty , we ’re done , so return the base value ( zero , if we ’re adding ) .
Otherwise , combine the first value with whatever the rest of the items fold up to .
[ If you have trouble writing recursively , this is the canonical pattern you should probably follow : if done , do base case ; else , do this element , then the rest of them . ]
The second is a little different .
You ’ve got a starting base , the tally so far , and a combineFunc that folds each value into the tally .
If the list is empty , we ’re done , so return the tally .
Otherwise , fold the first item into the tally for the rest of the list .
It the first , you hang around , waiting for the answer to the rest of the problem , before you add in your part of the sum .
In the second , you push your part of the sum down into the next round of processing , so you do n’t have to remember anything .
When the answer comes back from the recursive call , it ’ll already have your part of the sum in it .
[ The first one is a “ linear recursive process ” , the second is “ linear iterative process ” , even though both are recursive procedures .
If your interest is piqued , check out this SICP page , but it ’s not needed for this article .
For the rest of this post , I ’ll be using the linear recursive version , because it ’s conceptually clearer .
Thanks to mfp for keeping me honest . ]
Here ’s how fold is used :
// A handy adding function function add ( a , b ) { return a + b ; } Array.prototype.sum_recursive = function ( ) { return this.fold_recursive(add , 0 ) ; } [ 1 , 2 , 3].sum_recursive ( ) ; // 6
To sum the elements of an array , we want to fold the numbers together by add - ing them , starting at 0 .
Easy , is n’t it ?
Here are two Ruby versions , based on fold_recursive … one that takes a function ( called a “ procedure object ” in Ruby ) as a parameter , one that takes a block :
class Array def rest #
We 'll define rest , to keep the examples similar self [ 1.. - 1 ] end def fold_w_proc( combineFunc , base ) if self .empty ?
base else # " func.call ( args ) " instead of JavaScript's " func ( args ) " combineFunc.call ( self.
first , self.rest.fold_w_proc( combineFunc , base ) ) end end def fold_w_block ( base , & combineFunc ) if self.empty ?
base else combineFunc.call ( self.first , self.rest.fold_w_block ( base , & combineFunc ) ) end end def sum_w_proc fold_w_proc( lambda { |a , b| a + b } , 0 ) end def sum_w_block fold_w_block (0 ) { |a , b| a + b } end end [ 1 , 2 , 3].sum_w_proc # 6 [ 1 , 2 , 3].sum_w_block # 6
Notice how similar fold_w_block and fold_w_proc are to the JavaScript fold_recursive .
The thing that differentiates fold_w_block and fold_w_proc is how they ’re used .
The definitions themselves are nearly identical , except for the order of the parameters .
Look at sum_w_proc and sum_w_block … sum_w_block is a bit clearer , is n’t it ?
But if you use blocks , you lose the ability to pass a function reference as a parameter .
Map
map looks a lot like fold .
Array.prototype.map = function ( mapFunc ) { if ( this.isEmpty ( ) ) { return this ; } else { return [ mapFunc( this.first ( ) ) ].concat ( this.rest ( ).map( mapFunc ) ) ; } } function cube ( i ) { return i * i * i ; } [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] .map( function ( i ) { return i * i ; } ) ; // [ 1 , 4 , 9 ] [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] .map( cube ) ; // [ 1 , 8 , 18 ]
Again , it ’s basic recursion … if we ’re out of items , return the empty list ( ie , this ) .
Otherwise , make an array of the first mapped item , and concatenate it with the rest of the mapped items .
Again , with JavaScript , you can pass your function in - line , or by reference .
Here ’s a recursive definition of map in Ruby :
class Array def map ( &mapFunc ) if self.empty ?
self else [ mapFunc.call(self.first ) ] + self.rest.map( &mapFunc ) end end end [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] .map { |i| i * i } # [ 1 , 4 , 9 ]
As before , calling map with a block certainly looks nicer than by passing in functions , but you lose the ability to define a function somewhere , and pass it in by name , like we did with cube in JavaScript .
Wrap-up
If you want to explore functional programming , both JavaScript and Ruby are good candidates .
They both have their goods and bads .
Up to now , I ’ve only used Ruby , but JavaScript certainly has its benefits , and exposure to both balances out my understanding .
I hope that , if you were curious about functional programming before , this was a helpful read .
If you ’re a functional programmer , and I got something wrong , please let me know …I ’m still learning .
For instance , I now better understand how recursive processes differ from linear recursive processes .
But there are some people whose tender feelings receive a lot more consideration from the News Ltd empire .
On the same day that News 's website carried a link to The Australian 's piece about Carey 's childhood , it carried another story right next door .
Global Scientology protests begin in Australia .
— News.com.au website , Global Scientology protests begin in Australia
But what 's this ?
A pixelated poster ?
What can it have said ?
Well luckily , Today Tonight covered the same anti-Scientology protest - by a cyber - group that calls itself Anonymous and Channel Seven was n't so cautious .
More than two hundred people turned out in central Sydney yesterday .
The first wave in a global protest against Scientology .
The Church of Scientology has ramped up the offensive against Anonymous , accusing them of religious bigotry and claiming they are sick , twisted ... — Channel 7 , Today Tonight , 11th February , 2008
Hold it right there !
Same woman in a silly hat .
Must be the same poster .
So why is the mighty News Corporation censoring a protest banner that calls Scientology a cult ?
Legal advice , it seems .
" What legal advice ? " we asked .
The News website 's editor , David Higgins , cunningly replied :
My legal advice is not to discuss my legal advice .
— Email from David Higgins ( Editor , News.com.au ) to Media Watch
Over at the Adelaide Advertiser , they were more considerate still of Scientology 's feelings .
Protesters with a voice but no face — Adelaide Advertiser , Protesters with a voice but no face , 11th February , 2008
And with placards but no names .
Look at this one , for example .
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha POW ! — Adelaide Advertiser , Protesters with a voice but no face , 11th February , 2008
What 's that about ?
Go to the ' Tiser 's website , and all is made clear ...
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha POW !
Tom Cruise — Adelaide Now , Protesters picket Scientology centre
Aha !
That 's what they 're on about !
A famous interview given by Tom Cruise for the edification of his fellow Scientologists , which found its way onto You Tube .
Tom Cruise : I do what I can .
And I do it the way I do everything .
Ha ha ha ha ha .
There 's nothing part of the way for me .
Ha ha ha ha ha ha .
It 's just POW .
Ha ha ha . — YouTube video
A bit nutty , perhaps , but hardly defamatory .
Of course the Church of Scientology - and Tom Cruise - are notoriously litigious .
But did the ' Tiser really have to erase his name from a protest placard ?
Without telling its readers ?
The Advertiser 's Editor , Melvin Mansell , told us :
The decision to alter the photograph was made on legal advice which was given to a person on the news desk ... The decision ... is not one that I agree with ... It 's something that slipped by in the process .
— Statement from Melvin Mansell ( Editor , The Advertiser ) to Media Watch
And he adds ...
As matter of course we do n't publish doctored photographs .

So that 's all right then .
For a while , I thought News Ltd might be losing its nerve .
The documentation for a design pattern describes the context in which the pattern is used , the forces within the context that the pattern seeks to resolve , and the suggested solution .
[ For example : ]
The visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure .
A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures .
Fools ignore complexity .
Pragmatists suffer it .
Some can avoid it .
Geniuses remove it .
A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant .
include Singleton
I always felt the beauty of Java was that there is only one ‘ standard ’ way of handling most problems .
I know it might not be ‘ fun ’ , ‘ smart ’ or ‘ elegant ’ in most people ’s views , but most software factories do n’t want people to write elegant code .
They want standardized maintainable stuff that people can understand ten years from now because it ’s written in the same fashion [ as ] everything else out there …
I really think that great code is easy to understand and follows patterns that people are used to and comfortable with …
I read someone ’s code I just want to be able to understand it as quickly as possible , find the spot where the changes go and be able to figure out how said changes should fit in the general design .
A Pattern Language : Towns , Buildings , Construction is one of the most loved books on my shelf .
Anyone who has an interest in making their house or apartment a deeply satisfying , functional home needs to read this book once in their lives .
If you do n’t have the budget to buy it today , I urge you to borrow it from a friend or from your library .
And of course , you can learn a great deal about software design from it .
In many ways , you can learn much more about how to think about design than from software patterns books .
One thing that stands out is that this is a Timeless Way of Building .
When you see how these patterns transcend specific construction materials and methods , you the common forces in software design that transcend tools .
Iterator
Idiomatic Traversal
Get into a rut early :
Do the same process the same way .
Accumulate idioms .
Standardize .
The only difference (! ) between Shakespeare and you was the size of his idiom list — not the size of his vocabulary .
This line of thinking is grounded in the idea that the valuable part of the patterns is the suggested solution at a detailed level .
I have read the view that design patterns represent deficiencies in a programming language .
This argument stems from the observation that the specific code examples for half or more of the patterns in the GoF Book are " superfluous " in languages that provide abstractions above and beyond basic OO .
The Visitor pattern can be said ( depending on which Golden Hammer you are holding ) to represent a way to brew your own multiple dispatch , open classes , or pattern matching .
Does this mean that given a sufficiently expressive language there will be no design patterns ?
Certainly not .
Each design pattern organizes a problem and one suggested solution in a structured way , giving the solution a name so that programmers may enjoy a common vocabulary .
The pattern would only go away if the problem goes away .
But why would a more expressive language have this better feature , if not to solve the problem ?
Clearly the problem does n’t go away , it is just that instead of writing our own incomplete and buggy mechanisms for multiple dispatch we can now use the language ’s complete , tested , and “ free ” multiple dispatch feature to solve the problem .
If you consider the problem to be “ How do I implement my own multiple dispatch , ” then the Visitor pattern is obsolete if you are using a language like Common Lisp .
However , if you consider the problem to be “ How do I separate algorithms from data structures , ” then the only thing obsolete in the originally publicized pattern are the language - specific details .
The high - level approach can still be relevant .
Some programming languages accomplish the same task with a declaration or a singe line of code .
From this , some draw the conclusion that design patterns exist because popular programming languages lack certain abstractions or they lack the meta - abstractions permitting you to build your own abstractions cleanly .
The underlying assumption here is that the purpose of the pattern is to explain specifically how to write the code .
This is clearly not the case .
The Ruby language implements the Singleton pattern with a single abstraction , the Singleton module .is all you need to implement the pattern .
Yet , would we say that in Ruby there are no Singletons ?
No , we would say that Ruby makes them easy .
One argument is that implementing code a certain way is what makes it easy to read , what makes it familiar .
This line of thinking is grounded in the idea that the valuable part of the patterns is the suggested solution at a detailed level , because that is what will enable people to read the code and say to themselves , “ I know what that does .
” The counter - argument is that designing architecture a certain way with familiar names is what makes it easy to understand .
This line of thinking is grounded in the idea that the valuable part of the patterns is the identification of the context , forces , and resolution , because that is what will enable people to read the code and say to themselves , “ I know what that means .
” Even if the exact implementation of a pattern is abbreviated or even trivial in another language , patterns still provide the identification of the context , forces , and resolution with a common name everyone can understand .
A programming language can make some patterns go away .
But not by providing features and abstractions that eliminate the repetitive boilerplate .
Such languages make the patterns succinct , elegant , and remarkably easy to read … but not superfluous .
Instead , a language can make the patterns go away by introducing entirely different contexts for designing programs .
To stretch the building metaphor , patterns of home design go away if you are designing a commune instead of separate family dwellings .
It is not a question of how one builds homes , we do away with homes altogether .
Radically different paradigms for programming can eliminate the patterns we know .
For example , if you are building a Common Lisp program with objects and use multiple dispatch , you are still thinking in objects and thus you wrestle with the same forces upon them .
But if you build a Common Lisp program in a functional way , you may be able to get by without any objects at all , not even objects you have faked using closures .
In that case , you do n’t need the OO patterns because you are n’t in an OO context .
But that being said , there are other patterns you need that suit a functional programming context likeand .
It is not a case of Common Lisp being so powerful that no patterns are needed , it is a case of Common Lisp providing the power to make certain patterns elegant and simple should you choose to program in a manner that can make use of them .
So languages can make patterns go away by introducing entirely new paradigms .
And those paradigms will have their own patterns appropriate for resolving their forces .
In summary , I dispute that design patterns represent language flaws .
I claim that while the specific suggested implementations may work around language flaws , the context , forces , and resolution are relevant and valuable as long as you are working within the same paradigm .
All quotes from Wikipedia or from Alan J. Perlis ’ Epigrams in Programming unless otherwise attributed .
post scriptum : I notice that the first couple of comments that appeared on a popular link aggregation site disagreed with my perspective that design patterns are much more than the language - specific implementation .
To them , a Singleton in Ruby is a library call , not a pattern .
Patterns have four elements .
The argument seems to be that three of the four elements — name , context , forces to be resolved — belong to a “ Concept , ” and only the fourth — the one we do n’t like — is a pattern .
Upon reflection , what I find most interesting about this perspective is how much it has in common with the pattern abuse that I have criticized in the past : an obsession with the surface form .
I wrote about that above :
This criticism of patterns is rooted in exactly the same view of patterns : that he most important thing is the exact suggested solution , not the name , not the approach , not the context , not the forces to resolve .
One person holds that up as a pattern ’s value , another criticizes it , but they are much more similar than different in their views .
Medium Roberta Gordon presented the petition
Helen Duncan spent nine months in Holloway prison after being found guilty at a trial in 1944 .
She had told a séance a warship had sunk before the news had been officially announced .
A second petition calls for all those convicted under witchcraft legislation in Scotland to be pardoned .
Family stigma
Both petitions have been organised by a paranormal group , Full Moon Investigations .
A petition to the Westminster Government last year failed to secure a pardon for Mrs Duncan .
This new document calls on the Scottish Government to urge the Home Secretary to reconsider the case .
Mrs Duncan , born in Callander , Perthshire , held a séance at which the spirit of a dead sailor was said to have revealed the loss of the battleship HMS Barham with most of her crew .
The sinking had been kept secret by the authorities to maintain wartime morale .
Helen Duncan spent nine months in prison
Although not convicted for being a witch , Mrs Duncan was jailed for pretending to use witchcraft .
The crime of being a witch was abolished by the 1735 Witchcraft Act .
Roberta Gordon presented the signatures to Frank McAveety , convener of the public petitions committee , at Holyrood .
Mrs Gordon , who has been a medium for more than 28 years , said : " I feel that at the time the country was paranoid about security with D - Day coming up and the evidence used against her was n't accurate .
" It would take away the stigma of the family that is still living , the granddaughters , the great - grandsons and she has got a great granddaughter .
" For them to know that Helen Duncan is not classed as a witch would be the icing on the cake . "
The campaigners claim about 4,000 people were convicted under the witchcraft legislation in force between 1563 and 1736 , 85 % of them women .
The petition states that torture was used to extract confessions as late as 1704 and those convicted were almost always strangled before their body was burnt .
The petition states : " Many of today 's professions have their roots in tradition and what could be seen as mystical wisdom .
" Professions such as mediumship , herbalists , midwifery , reiki and many alternative therapies , to name just a few . "

Over the past decade , an average of 340 " significant " looting incidents have been reported annually at the 391 national parks , monuments , historic sites and battlefields — probably less than 25 % of the actual number of thefts , says park service staff ranger Greg Lawler .
" The trends are up , " he says .
HARD TO STOP : Relic thefts rise as rangers spread thin It's " a chronic problem that we simply have not even been able to get a grasp on , " says Mark Gorman , chief ranger at South Dakota 's Badlands National Park .
Park service investigators search websites and the FBI helps track looted items , some of which are sold to collectors in Europe and Asia .
Prices are rising for some items , including Native American pottery and garments , says Bonnie Magness - Gardiner , manager of the FBI art theft program .
The most coveted items can cost " in the tens of thousands , sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars , " she says .
Thieves caught last year at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park sold a Confederate belt buckle for $ 3,300 and buttons for $ 200 each .
The park service has 1,500 law enforcement rangers and 400 seasonal law enforcement rangers — one for about every 56,000 acres .
" We really do n't have enough manpower , " Lawler says .
That can make it difficult to catch criminals such as the three men who dug 460 holes at the Fredericksburg - Spotsylvania military park in search of artifacts and the man who pleaded guilty to taking 252 relics last year from Colorado 's Mesa Verde National Park .
Under the 1979 Archaeological Resources Protection
Act , first - time felony offenders can be fined up to $ 20,000 and imprisoned for a year .
Todd Swain , a National Park Service special agent , says the problem is far worse than statistics show .
In a report he wrote for the 2007 Yearbook of Cultural Property Law he concluded , " The true scope of the looting problem is staggering .
…
Our shared cultural heritage is disappearing before our eyes . "

WASHINGTON  Just hours before President Bush began his trip to the Middle East , he sharply criticized Iran on Tuesday for fomenting “ a dangerous situation ” in an incident over the weekend in the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf .
Asked whether he thought the Iranians were trying to provoke a fight with the United States by having several of their vessels confront American craft , the president said the Iranians had engaged in “ a provocative act . ”
“ It is a dangerous situation , and they should not have done it , pure and simple , ” Mr. Bush said in a brief question - and - answer session in the Rose Garden .
“ I do n’t know what their thinking was , but I ’m telling you what I think it was . ”
Although Iranian officials have played down the encounter , Bush administration officials see the timing as no coincidence .
They have said that Iran was trying to provoke the United States just before the president ’s weeklong trip to the Middle East .
The president said pointedly on Tuesday that he would use the journey to remind America ’s friends and allies in the region that Iran poses a danger .

Timesonline :
The Attorney - General was urged yesterday to call in Scotland Yard to investigate allegations that British troops tortured and killed a number of Iraqi civilians seized after an ambush at a checkpoint in southern Iraq in May 2004 .
Two British lawyers , Phil Shiner and Martyn Day , said there was evidence from Iraqi doctors ’ certificates , following examination of 20 bodies , that bodies had been mutilated and that there were signs of torture having taken place .
They cited two cases where Iraqis had an eye “ gouged out ” or “ pulled out ” , and another where a penis had been severed ... read on
War is hell , but Bush would do it all over again and McCain is right there with him .
One of the nation 's largest telecommunications companies is using a controversial technique to cripple certain kinds of Internet traffic traveling across its networks , says a new report from the digital rigthts group the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco .
" Comcast is essentially deploying against their own customers techniques more typically used by malicious hackers ( this is doubtless how Comcast would characterize other parties that forged traffic to make it appear that it came from Comcast or its subscribers , ) " write the authors of the new report .
" In other words , Comcast is essentially behaving like a telephone operator that interrupts a phone conversation , impersonating the voice of one party to tell the other that this call is over , I 'm hanging up . "
The nine - page investigation was conducted by EFF staff technologists Peter Eckersley , Seth Schoen and senior intellectual property attorney Fred von Lohmann .
The investigators say that their tests confirmed an earlier one conducted by the Associated Press that showed that Comcast is interfering with BitTorrent traffic .
BitTorrent is a protocol used to efficiently distribute the online transmission of large files , and some entertainment companies have partnered with its creators to distribute its content online .
Comcast has said that it does n't block BitTorrent , or any kind of content .
When asked about the new report , spokesman Charlie Douglas said that the company had no comment .
And he directed Wired News to a past statement issued by the company that said that the company merely delays certain kinds of peer - to - peer traffic at peak congested times , rather than blocking it .
But the investigators ' report says that it is Comcast 's approach to managing the traffic that is most problematic .
The authors say that Comcast is forging Internet traffic and injecting it into its customers ' file - sharing applications ' stream of traffic to choke their transmissions .
The effect for the end user is that they may end up thinking that it is the software that they 're using that 's failing , note the report 's authors .
Comcast does tell customers that it retains the right to manage the traffic to make sure that everything runs smoothly .
But the EFF 's investigators note that Comcast 's approach is discriminatory because it targets only certain kinds of applications – in this case , file - sharing applications .
This kind of targeting undermines a fundamental ethos that has so far driven the success of innovators on the Internet – an open system that requires no permission from anyone to experiment online , they say .
" Comcast 's recent moves threaten to create a situation in which innovators may need to obtain permission and assistance from an ISP in order to guarantee that their protocols will operate correctly , " write the authors .
" By arbitrarily using RST packets in a manner at odds with TCP / IP standards , Comcast threatens to Balkanize the open standards that are the foundation of the Internet . "
The report may have far - reaching consequences since it presents detailed evidence of an ISP actively interfering with its customers ' traffic in an apparently arbitrary fashion .
The report says , for example , that its tests showed " no evidence that Comcast was targeting their jamming efforts at customers based on their individual consumption of bandwidth , " and that there are more above - board ways of managing their traffic .
Various parties may use the report to boost their cases both against Comcast , and to push forward new rules to ensure that telecommunications companies do not discriminate online .
Both the Bush administration and telecom companies have argued that there is n't any evidence of discriminatory actions to justify such rules .
Lawmakers have re-introduced legislation on the subject this year in the Senate , and a House bill sponsored by Massachusetts Democrat Ed Markey is expected to be dropped before the end of the year .
In addition , a complaint against Comcast over the issue has been lodged at the FCC , and a California consumer has launched a lawsuit against the cable company in the wake of the AP story .
" Certainly the FCC ought to thoroughly investigate this , and based on that investigation take the appropriate steps , " said Markham Erickson , executive director of the Open Internet Coalition .
" It also argues for ex ante rules that prevents this from happening in the first place . "
" In some ways , the EFF 's paper raises an additional set of questions – they only looked at Comcast
\— what about the other ISPs , ... what other communications are being blocked and dropped ? " he asked .
Comcast has 12.4 million high - speed Internet subscribers .
Addendum :
The EFF has released an accompanying white paper that provides instructions on how to detect spoofing by your ISP .
I 'd be interested in chatting with anyone who tries this out with some friends .

LOS ANGELES , Nov. 11 — As Hollywood digs in for a second week of a strike , the screenwriters might want to send a few angry picketers over to Will Smith ’s place .
Or Steven Spielberg’s .
And maybe the studio executives should think about joining them on the line .
As it turns out , the pot of money that the producers and writers are fighting over may have already been pocketed by the entertainment industry ’s biggest talent .
That is the conclusion of a surprisingly bleak new assessment of financial dynamics in the movie industry titled “ Do Movies Make Money ? ”
The researchers ’ answer : not any more .
The report , prepared by the research company Global Media Intelligence in association with its partner Merrill Lynch , concludes that much of the income — past and future — that studios and writers have been fighting about has already gone to the biggest stars , directors and producers in the form of ballooning participation deals .
A participation is a share in the gross revenue , not the profit , of a movie .
Post columnist accuses O'Reilly of casual racism David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday February 21 , 2008

Print This Email This Bill O'Reilly 's recent musings about joining a " lynching party " against prospective First Lady Michelle Obama demonstrate the Fox News host 's low - grade racism regardless of what defenders will try to say , an African American columnist said Wednesday .
" By tomorrow morning , some defender will come out and say , ' I know Bill O'Reilly and he's no racist , ' " Eugene Robinson told MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann Tuesday .
" My response is , ' I do n't care . ' ...
All you can go by is his words and his actions .
He keeps saying these things that sound pretty darn racist to me . "
Olbermann and Robinson , who writes for the Washington Post , recalled O'Reilly 's earlier shock that people acted civilized in a Harlem restaurant .
His latest comments further show the host 's casually racist attitudes , they said .
On his radio show this week , O'Reilly and a caller were discussing Michelle Obama 's recent comments to Newsweek and on the campaign trail , and the caller accused Obama of being a " militant woman . "
O'Reilly stopped the caller there and tried to defend the candidate 's wife .
He said :
You know , I have a lot of sympathy for Michelle Obama , for Bill Clinton , for all of these people .
Bill Clinton , I have sympathy for him , because they 're thrown into a hopper where everybody is waiting for them to make a mistake , so that they can just go and bludgeon them .
And , you know , Bill Clinton and I do n't agree on a lot of things , and I think I 've made that clear over the years , but he 's trying to stick up for his wife , and every time the guy turns around , there 's another demagogue or another ideologue in his face trying to humiliate him because they 're rooting for Obama .
That 's wrong .
And I do n't want to go on a lynching party against Michelle Obama unless there 's evidence , hard facts , that say this is how the woman really feels .
If that 's how she really feels -- that America is a bad country or a flawed nation , whatever -- then that 's legit .
We 'll track it down .
Olbermann seemed to encourage viewers to contact Fox News and Westwood One , which syndicates O'Reilly 's radio show to get him booted from the airwaves .
" He 's not going to apologize , he 's not going to stop , because the moment he'd do that then he has to admit he was wrong ; there was a reason for him to stop , " Olbermann said .
" Do people have to then ... talk to people who are keeping him on the air ?
Call Westwood One ... or the advertisers and say , ' Get rid of the guy .
Suspend him , or give up being accepted in 21st century America , where this is not tolerated anymore ' ? "
The MSNBC host noted that a Golf Channel anchor was suspended and apologized for saying young players who hoped to top Tiger Woods should " lynch him in a back alley . "
However , it seems unlikely that O'Reilly will face a similar fate , and his bosses are taking a hard line against criticism .
Executive producer David Tabacoff told Portfolio's Jeff Bercovici that O'Reilly should n't have to apologize for defending Obama .
" What Bill said was an obvious repudiation of anyone attacking Michelle Obama , " [ Tabacoff ] said , via email .
" As he has said more than ten times , he is giving her the benefit of the doubt . "
Critics say lynching analogies are inappropriate because of the practice 's history as a tool of racial intimidation .
Other political figures who drew condemnation include former Sen. Zell Miller , who before switching parties , invoked the term to protest against fellow Democrats blocking a conservative judge 's nomination and Karl Rove accusing the Senate of " judicial lynching " in its blocking another nominee .
Author Linda Monk criticized Rove 's comments at the time , and provided a reminder of lynching 's violent past .
Heres how my hometown paper , the Vicksburg Evening Post , described a 1904 lynching of Luther Holbert and his wife , accused of killing Holberts employer :  When the two Negroes were captured , they were tied to trees and while the funeral pyres were being prepared , they were forced to suffer the most fiendish tortures .
The blacks were forced to hold out their hands while one finger at a time was chopped off .
The fingers were distributed as souvenirs .
The ears of the murderers were cut off .
Holbert was beaten severely , his skull was fractured and one of his eyes , knocked out with a stick , hung by a shred from the socket  The most excruciating form of punishment consisted in the use of a large corkscrew in the hands of some of the mob .
This instrument was bored into the flesh of the man and woman , in the arms , legs and body , and then pulled out , the spirals tearing out big pieces of raw , quivering flesh every time it was withdrawn .  [...]
[ Conservative judicial nominee Charles ]
Pickering should be the first to admit that he was in no way lynched .
It s important to remember what a real lynching is .

Microsoft reported bumper quarterly sales of its Windows Vista operating system and Office software and said anti-piracy efforts were improving results at an above - average rate .
" It 's clear that this new product cycle is paying off , " said Andy Miedler , technology analyst at Edward Jones .
" We 're impressed that they had enough confidence to follow thorough and raised guidance .
They continue seeing the business being healthy for the remainder of the fiscal year . "
But Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell told Reuters in an interview the company was " a little cautious " about second - half sales in North America .
" We 're probably a little cautious in the back half of the year , but that 's made up for in the other parts of the ( global ) economy , " he said .
" Even if we shave a few percentage points off , we think the overall level of growth is still very healthy . "
Net profit in Microsoft 's fiscal second quarter rose to $ US4.7 billion , or 50 US cents per diluted share , from $ US2.6 billion , or 26 US cents per diluted share , in the year - ago period .
Revenue rose 30 per cent to $ US16.37 billion .
Analysts , on average , had forecast 46 US cents per share on revenue of $ US15.94 billion , according to Reuters Estimates .
The second - quarter revenue and profit growth rates are exaggerated by results a year before , when Microsoft deferred more than $ US1 billion in net income due to delays in releasing Vista and Office 2007 , which hit stores in early 2007 .
For the fiscal year ending in June , Microsoft lifted its outlook .
It now expects earnings per share to range between $ US1.85 and $ US1.88 per share , up from its previous estimate of $ US1.78 to $ US1.81 .
Wall Street , on average , had projected $ US1.81 .
It boosted its revenue outlook to between $ US59.9 billion and $ US60.5 billion , up from $ US58.8 billion to $ US59.7 billion before .
" I think ( the forecast ) is pretty strong .
Microsoft often sets the bar low for itself ... they are extremely conservative with regard to promising results ( but ) these numbers tell me that Microsoft is seeing strength in the pipeline , " said Kim Caughey , senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group .
Microsoft has long argued its products are less sensitive to swings in technology spending because they account for a small , but essential , portion of overall spending by corporate customers .
Caughey said Microsoft 's business revenues may be less affected because their biggest business customers are buying site licenses , which are not dependent on how many people are in the building .
" The roll - out of Vista has included another tier of pricing aimed at business so they are going to get more revenue there .
It may be for a lower number of seats but it's a higher dollar amount , " he said .
While Microsoft and other tech companies are sensitive to the economy , Miedler said Microsoft and software in general can be a bit more defensive , in part because the products they sell are designed to improve productivity and help cut costs .
Microsoft posted strong Vista sales , helped by double - digit percentage growth rates in computer sales in the quarter .
A strong performance for Windows drove Microsoft 's first - quarter results , which far exceeded Wall Street 's expectations .
For the current quarter , Microsoft said earnings per share would range between 43 US cents and 45 US cents per share on revenue ranging from $ US14.3 billion to $ US14.6 billion .
Analysts , on average , had predicted 44 US cents a share on revenue of $ US14.4 billion , according to Reuters Estimates .
Shares of Microsoft surged to their highest levels since 2001 after the September - quarter results .
As of Wednesday 's close , the stock had fallen more than 10 per cent since then , partly due to economic concerns and broader market declines .
But in after - hours trade , Microsoft shares rose to $ US34.75 , after closing up four per cent in regular Nasdaq trade at $ US33.25 .

YEKATERINBURG , Russia —
On the outskirts of this burly industrial center , off a road like any other , on a nowhere scrap of land — here unfolded the final act of one of the last century ’s most momentous events .
A short way through a clearing , toward a cluster of birch trees , the killers deposited their victims ’ bodies , which had been mutilated , burned and doused with acid to mask their origins .
It would be 73 more years , in 1991 , before the remains would be reclaimed and the announcement would ring out : the grave of the last Russian czar , Nicholas II , and his family had been found .
But the story does not end there .
Eleven people were said to have been killed that day in July 1918 on Lenin ’s orders .
Just nine sets of remains were dug up here and then authenticated using DNA .
The remains of the czar ’s son , Aleksei , and one daughter , whose identity is still not absolutely clear , were missing .
Did their bones lie elsewhere , or could it actually be that they had escaped execution , as rumor had it for so long ?
Only in the past few months have these questions dating from the Russian revolution apparently been resolved here , and only by a group of amateur sleuths who spent their weekends plumbing the case .
In fact , it appears that the clues to what happened to the two children were always there , waiting to be found .
All that was needed was to listen closely to the boastful voices of the killers .
Yes , Dallas the RPG is real .
August 24 , 2020
I ’ve had a few people ask me about this and , yes , there was a roleplaying game released in 1980 from Simulations Publications , Inc .
If you ’ve never heard of that company , it ’s likely because the failure of Dallas the RPG contributed to SPI ’s demise .
Dallas , by the way , was the very first licensed RPG .
And , yes , I own a copy .
But if you want to learn more about it , I found a great YouTube review of it by Z Gosck .
If you enjoy the review , check out his website and an RPG he jus released , Punktopia .

Hey , all !
Randy here !
Just a few things .
First off , there ’s some glitches in the site and , yes , I ’m aware of them .
I ’m slowly plodding through and trying to figure out what all needs to be fixed .
Basically , Blind Ferret changed how the site runs and now everything is automated .
That means , for the first time since the comic started in 2001 , I ’m not creating every page of the site in Text Pad .
I ’m literally just uploading files .
I ’m not going to pretend I ’m not excited about this .
I absolutely am .
But there ’s some errors here and there and I ’m trying to fix stuff .
Also , you may notice the file names of comic entries are different now , so I ’m sad to say anything you have bookmarked previously likely is n’t there anymore .
The good news is this is a step to future updates and getting S*P ’s site running better with other features .
That ’s all I wanna say about that right now .
Also , you may have noticed Comics Kingdom has been running comics by me in their Popeye Cartoon Club area .
Last year , Cartoon Club started as a celebration of Popeye ’s 90th birthday with various cartoonists offering their take on the sailor and his cast , one of those cartoonists being me .
Well , what ’s going on now is a bit different .
These are all Popeye comics by me – Monday through Friday are traditional four panel style comics while Saturday and Sunday are larger comics I made for the original event but did n’t use ( some were posted on my Twitter account ) .
This will go on for , I believe , just under two more weeks .
If you like the Popeye strips , please let Comics Kingdom know by rating and commenting on their site or dropping Comics Kingdom a line .
Doing so increases the likelihood of me doing more Popeye comics and maybe one day getting to do full storylines .
If you do n’t like ’em … well , uh … go watch this video of sand cats .
I have nothing to do with sand cats , but they ’re cute and maybe you need some cuteness in your life .
Oh , man !
Even doing blog posts is easier now !
Who knows !
You might get more this year .
I might even write … FOUR blog posts .

First off , a few plugs .
First , if you use miniatures in your gaming , there ’s some really cool 3D facades on Kickstarter right now .
Greg , the guy behind it , is a great person who makes great terrain .
Definitely give it a look and , if you ’re so moved , give Greg some support .
Second , I ’m a guest at LosCon in Los Angeles this month ( November 23 - 25 ) .
They ’re bringing me out to talk to you , draw for you , judge you with silent disdain – all the important stuff !
It ’s been ten years since my last LA Reader Gathering and it would be great to see anyone who can drop by , especially since the 25th is my birthday .
Also , the ever amazing Seanan McGuire will be there talking about her amazing stories and even more amazing cats ( fun fact , Seanan is only one of two people my cat Odine trusted immediately the first time she met her ) .
Also in attendance will be Taliesen Jaffe , who ’ve I ’ve been fortunate enough to know for many years now .
He ’s a wonderful person and , of course , super popular now with everyone thanks to his amazing work on everyone ’ favorite , “ She ’s the Sheriff . ”
Oh , and there ’s this thing called Critical Role he ’s working on .
Give it a shot .
So , stuff has been … off kitler for a while now .
I wish I could say that it ’s clearing up but , well , it ’s not .
I ’ve been having health stuff and , no , it ’s not related to what the baby ’s going through .
Different stuff , but it does really impede my ability to work , and sleep , and … a lot of stuff , honestly .
The last four or five days were mostly spent immmobile .
Yes , I ’m being vague because I do n’t like getting a lot of medical advice .
But it ’s been going on for a while now .
I ’m sorry that it ’s slowing things here down .
I ’ve gone to the doctor ’s and here ’s hoping .
Thanks for sticking it out , and especially thanks to Michael , who does my convention stuff , and the LosCon staff who ’ve had to deal with me dropping out a lot .
And various other folks I owe stuff to .
Honestly , I just wanted to check in .
I ’m alive .
I could be better .
Baby ’s sick but she ’ll recover .
I still love the comic but kinda hate my body .
I ’ll keep doing S*P . I hope you ’ll keep reading it .

Recent days have seen eerie parallels to the late Summer of 1987 , when one Alan Greenspan – viewed then with suspicion as a political placeman – took the helm of the Federal Reserve at a time when international tensions were high , the U.S. was in the grip of a speculative orgy of stock buying and takeover activity , and when the Greenback was falling sharply , driven down by a loss of confidence on the part of those foreign investors who had fuelled the go - go ethos of the booming Reagan years .
Recent years have seen eerie parallels with the Japanese bubble of the same era when innovations in financial engineering allowed companies access to seemingly costless capital , giving rise in turn to prodigies of investment and promoting aggressive expansion overseas .
Then , equity derivatives were harnessed to raise cheap funds directly for the firm via the attachment of warrants to debt issues : today , equity derivatives are harnessed indirectly by their widespread use in keeping employee contributions out of the bottom line ( and , incidentally , out of aggregate measures of unit labour costs ) .
Recent years have seen eerie parallels with the 1920's when world overcapacity forced down the prices of traded goods made ever more abundant by the applications of striking and exciting advances in technology and communications and the Strong - Norman duumvirate at the pinnacle of the world monetary order kept credit easy to offset the tensions generated thereby .
The disruptions to international lending which followed , the pattern of over - consumption , heavily reliant on aggressive marketing of the new installment credit techniques , the fascination , turning to obsession , with the value of the stock market are all well known and all have their counterparts today .
For all the acres of newsprint expended on glowing talk of the New Paradigm and all the post - hoc musings of the gerontocrat technophile , Greenspan , on the potentialities of the laser beam ( sic ) and the silicon wafer , economists of the Austrian School cast a more sceptical eye on proceedings .
Devotees of von Mises , Hayek and Rothbard would recognise events of the last four years as nothing more than a classic , interventionist , credit expansion and would warn of the inevitable consequences when the process stutters to a halt .
Over the long history of the U.S. stock market , price / earnings ratios have averaged somewhere in the mid-teens .
Today the broad market is twice that , while the NASDAQ enjoys a mind - boggling multiple 10 times the norm .
The derived steady earnings growth factor on even the first , given expanding corporate spreads and generally rising bond yields of late , is some 3.6 % in perpetuity .
Given that the economy has shown few signs of being able to grow at greater than around 5.0 - 5.5 % in nominal terms in the last several years -- the world economy , indeed , growing at an even more sedate pace -- this allows a mere 1.5 - 2.0 % economic risk premium , probably less than a third of the typical safety margin historically demanded .
Moreover , with dividend yields a paltry 1.2 % on the broad market , stock returns are now more dependent than at any time on capital returns , not the income stream derived therefrom .
Given that one can currently lock in a compounded , risk - free return of 6.8 % semi-annually for 20 years by buying a US Treasury strip , or zero coupon bond , it is evident that there is little room for any accidents on either earnings growth or the end multiple the baby boomers will have to command from their demographically - fewer working age grandchildren when they come to cash in .
Stock returns of late have been such as to banish all rational calculations from the mind of the public .
Indeed , earnings have risen in the period such that the return on book value has moved from 17 % in late 1994 to range between 20 - 23 % since .
Granted , corporate profits after tax have risen as a percentage of GDP from around 4 % to nearer 6 % , though some ( including both those at the SEC and the likes of Warren Buffet who recently compared company reports to dubious golf scores ) would wonder how much of this is simply due to an ever more aggressive exploitation of FASB loopholes .
The real crux here though is that profit growth has slowed , if not stagnated , since the middle of 1997 and returns on equity have been maintained largely through leveraging the balance sheet , issuing relatively cheap debt to retire equity .
This has been effected not so much to secure long term capital at favourable rates , but to make the quarterly numbers and thus maintain favourable stock price momentum .
Nothing to do with CEO stock option packages , you understand .
The scale of this trend can be seen from the flow - of - funds accounts ; non-financial businesses retired $ 305 billion of equity and issued $ 418 billion in debt , effectively raising gearing $ 723 billion , or a twelfth of GDP , in the last four quarters , a total which has hit over $ 2 trio in the bubble years .
So whence other have the phenomenal stock returns originated ?
Multiple expansion , or , in plain English , a heady combination of the inflation of the present price attached to the future value of earnings and the estimated trajectory of those earnings .
It is all a long way from the cautionary words of Graham and Dodd who asserted in their investment bible , Security Analysis , " Value based on a satisfactory trend must be wholly arbitrary and hence speculative , and hence inevitably subject to exaggeration and later collapse . "
Yet here is the paradox : the unprecedented rise in the multiples , both of earnings and book value , suggests , in isolation at least , a decline in time preference , ie a greater willingness to forego consumption today for the command over resources which will allow consumption at some later date .
How then are we to reconcile this with an economy which has seen the personal savings rate decline from 6 % of income when Greenspan assumed the chair to a negative 1.4 % today ?
This suggests an extreme degree of time preference – or in less anodyne language - a voracious demand for the satisfaction of immediate wants such that the ‘ originary ' rate of interest ( the intrinsic discount rate applied to future satiety ) is in fact infinite !
Less academically , America is a nation which has so outstripped its own productive capacity that it has seen the current account balance deteriorate from a deficit of around 1.5 % of national product just four short years ago to 3.7 % today .
It is a nation where household debt has risen from two thirds of income in 1987 to over 82 % today , where the level of mortgage debt as a proportion of income has been raised to a new height of 62 % from 38 % , where consumer credit is well over a trillion dollars , where over a third of " savers " borrow against their 401 ( k ) retirement nest - egg .
Americans are consuming capital on a vast scale .
They have become a nation of Tomorrow Eaters .
So how do we square the circle ?
In part the strong dollar policy of the Rubin years sucked in capital from abroad .
The four quarters to June alone have seen $ 573 billion flood into the States on the capital account , with less than half that being recycled , such that the net inflow of $ 322 billion has more than covered the $ 208 billion deficit on goods and services racked up in the period .
So far , so good .
If Americans collectively wish to rearrange their balance sheets in the pursuit of the greatest degree of the satisfaction of their wants , that is their privilege .
The darker side is the debt explosion and here we can blame none other than the Monetary Messiah himself , Alan Greenspan .
Like his predecessor in the Twenties , Ben Strong , Greenspan has not noticed that his much - vaunted supply - side revolution should have depressed prices throughout the period .
The fact that the rate of increase has merely slowed shows that the supply of money , broadly defined , has been too rapid and thus masked this .
Furthermore , he has been so pre-occupied with international events since his own salutary encounter with the mild debt deflation of the early 90s domestic " credit crunch " that -- staggering from Mexico to Thailand to Korea to Russia and back to Brazil , pouring in liquidity at every juncture -- he has since foresworn the hard decisions necessary to restore monetary order at home .
In the last four years , commercial paper outstanding in the U.S. has doubled while commercial bank assets as a percentage of GDP have burgeoned from roughly 55 % to over 60 % .
Repurchase agreements ( a subtle way to monetize government debt if there ever was one - cf the German Reichsbank in the Great War ) have increased 50 % in two years .
While supposedly tightening these last few months , the Fed has in fact been involved in the generous provision of high powered money , taking its own holdings of treasuries to new records weekly at a 10.8 % annual rate .
At the apotheosis of this process in the past year as the sluices were opened to offset the LTCM debacle , domestic financial debt increased a mind - boggling $ 1.1 trillion , or fully 20 % of the total existing debt stock .
When Greenspan took up the reins , financial debt was 95 % of non-financial corporate debt : today , the ratio is 174 % .
Then , it represented some 39 % of national income : today , the figure is 80 % .
Concomitant with this credit inflation has been the inexorable rise of the stock market 's Q-ratio – its own proportion of GDP – from an unexceptional 54 % to today 's towering 155 % , or its expansion from under 30 % of the world market capitalization to a shade under a half now .
Monetary pumping on this order , as the Austrians will tell you , leads to serious distortions in the price structure of an economy which cannot be captured in crude , aggregate , index numbers .
These distortions between the value of goods , present and future , lead to mal - investments and a clustering of false decisions .
Factories built and productive processes put in train based on a market rate of interest artificially lowered by the effulgence of fiduciary media are not backed up by real savings and thus become misaligned with a propensity for consumption which has , if anything , intensified .
A raft of ‘ entrepreneurial errors ' lies ahead .
This means not only the prospect of half - finished malls , hotels and offices ( factories are deliberately omitted since we have also witnessed a secular shift in the amount of construction dollars spent on premises devoted to redistributing wealth , rather than generating it in the first instance ) , but also completed , but now distinctly sub - par undertakings : businesses and plant which cannot possibly earn the returns projected at inception .
Less visible , though more widespread , such an overhang will depress returns on capital where they do not wipe it out completely .
The credit expansion , once it draws to its inevitable end , will impoverish everyone , everywhere .
Recently , this realization has begun to dawn on the world 's fiat money kings .
BOJ Governor Hayami said in a speech a few months ago that credit was not capital and that while he could provide the first , economic recovery required the second .
The holy of holies , the BIS itself stated bluntly in its annual report that much of the malaise in the world financial and economic system could be put down to the fact that the cost of capital in at least one major centre had been artificially low for too long this decade .
Step up to the winners ' rostrum , Mr Greenspan , 3 % , Mr Hayami , 0.2 % , and Mr. Duisenberg , 2.5 % .
Savings ratios are declining sharply in the Anglo - Saxon world and are likely to follow elsewhere as consumers stir anew : term premia in interest rates are rising accordingly .
Inflation premia , measured by the yield differential between straight and index - linked government bonds , have gone up by over 1 % in the last six months in the UK , the US and Europe as the world begins to fret on another bout of central bank inflationism .
Credit spreads have exploded as entrepreneurial risk ( and debt and derivative worries about the financial sector ) have come to the fore once more .
All these are driving yields up sharply and inflicting punishing capital losses , not to mention making equities look ever more anomalous .
An over - leveraged system with high concentrations of assets in over - priced stocks is a recipe for disaster .
Since the BIS report , there has been a certain sentiment shift towards long - overdue restraint .
Most notable was the Bank of England , for all the ill - considered outrage among wrong - footed analysts which greeted its recent rate rise .
Others too , the RBA , the RBNZ , the SNB and the Riksbank among them , have talked of possible rate rises ahead .
The ECB , disappointingly is moving here at a self - confessed ‘ snail 's pace ' .
The Fed has started , but half - heartedly and amid a flurry of conflicting comment , some of it too sanguine , some downright irresponsible and uncomprehending , such as remarks by NY Fed boss McDonough that stocks were not overvalued and the dollar was of no concern .
The problem now is that the flood of capital into Japan , partly a defensive retreat on the part of domestics smarting from another currency debacle , partly an aggressive foray on the part of foreigners hoping finally to catch the Nikkei 's lows , is threatening to short - circuit hopes of making this an orderly process .
When the Almighty Dollar , de facto totem of the world monetary order , can fall 18 % in two months against the unit of a country which gives its currency away essentially for free , has severe demographic problems , no natural resources , a grid - locked and speculative political structure and a near - bankrupt fiscal position , we know that the end is near .
These are worrying times indeed and , given the self - reinforcing nature of capital markets , another sharp dislocation may be imminent .
Credit - led business expansion has always ended in one of two ways ; depression – which used to be a sharp , cathartic affair before the Keynesians and New Dealers and their successors at the MOF contrived to institutionalize it by preventing market adjustment -- or hyper- inflation and a collapse of the existing monetary order .
As Roger Garrison has put it , paraphrasing von Mises , " the Central Bank can print itself into trouble , it can not print itself out . "
Ask not for whom the bell tolls , Alan .
It tolls for thee .
Not much will keep the tech giant from entering wealth management .
But advisors still have a few potent weapons at their disposal .
They just need to use them .

Over 30 anti-war protestors at Morton West High School in Berwyn face expulsion for a demonstration at the school on Thursday .
Scores of Students Face Expulsion Due to Sit- inBerwyn , ILOver 70 students participated in a sit - in against the Iraq War on All Saint 's Day , Thursday , November 1st .
It began third hour when dozens of student gathered quietly in the lunchroom at Morton West High School and refused to leave .
Administrators and police became involved immediately and locked down the school for a half hour after class ended .
Students report that they were promised that there would be no consequences besides cutting classes if they took their protest outside so as not to disturb the school day .
The students agreed and were led to a corner outside the cafeteria where they sang songs and held signs while classes resumed .
" At first they tried to make us like leave the school , " said Jerry Petrack , who was with the protest from the beginning .
Petracek referred to the massive walk - out for immigrant rights in 2006 that guided their decisions that morning .
( chicago.indymedia.org/newswire/display/71540/index.php )
" They were like , ' march the streets ' or whatever and we were like ' no , we do n't wanna leave the school because last time there was a protest outside the school and kids got arrested , ' and we remembered that .
" Despite the caution tape and a police line set up between the protesters and the student body , many other students joined the demonstration .
Organizers say they chose November first because it is the Christian All Saints holy day and a national day of peace .
They wrote a letter and delivered it to Superintendent , Dr. Ben Nowakowski who was present at the time , stating the reason for their protest .
John Acevedo , a junior says he has been thinking about the world since he was a freshman . " I 've noticed that there are many students that do not really notice anything that is going on in the world .
They focus on themselves or their music and I really wanted to show and lead them on to these ideas that what really is happening in the world .
" Adam Swarek says that a lot of people thought they just wanted to cut classes .
" It was a lot more spiritual than that . "
" Basically , you know the school has people in military uniforms that you know stand out there and they give away prizes for doing pull - ups and doing this and that and what they 're basically representing and trying to put out there is murder and killing .
That 's all that basically represents when it comes down to war , you know .
Like , what else is there ?
So we were just trying to do something opposite , like peaceful and they took it as insubordinate .
" Deans , counselors and even the Superintendent tried to change the minds of a few , mainly those students with higher GPA scores to abandon the protest .
The school called the homes of many of the protesters .
Those whose parents arrived before the end of school and took their students home , or left before the protest ended at the final bell , received 3 - 5 days suspension .
All others , an estimated 37 received 10 days suspension and expulsion papers .
Parents report that Nowakowski stated those who are seventeen will also face police charges .
Parents who are frantically trying to spare their child 's expulsion flooded the school yesterday to file appeals on the matter .
So far , Superintendent Nowakowski has held firm on the punishments .
They are expected to find out the results of the appeals on the 10 day suspensions on Tuesday .
However , the expulsion orders still stand .
Parents and students report and the school 's videotape shown to some of the parents confirms that the students were non-violent in their action and there was no damage to property .
The protest came on the heels of a recent incident on October 15th , when a student reported hearing that another student had a gun on campus .
The story of the eyewitness was deemed unreliable and the school was not locked down .
Later that week ( October 19 ) , the Berwyn police , acting on a tip arrested one of the youths originally questioned about gun possession and he allegedly confessed to carrying an unloaded semi-automatic handgun that day .
All these issues , plus the expected announcement of whether uniforms will be established in the school should make the next Board of Education meeting on Wednesday at 7:00 pm at the Morton East campus very well - attended .
See the link below for the Superintendent 's statement on the matter :

“ I spent most of the day minimizing when my dad walked by . ”
McCain ’s other controversy of the week
Maybe you consider the Vicki Iseman controversy to be a big deal , or maybe you ’re underwhelmed by it and think the NYT should n’t have pulled the trigger on it .
I guess we ’ll be able to say more about it once some of the follow - up reporting adds some details and nails down some of the loose ends .
But either way , let ’s not lose sight of John McCain ’s other controversy of the week — the senator ’s efforts to game the public financing system .
To review briefly : in December , McCain , who ’d earlier opted in to the public financing system , needed cash .
The FEC had already certified that he was owed $ 5.8 million in public matching funds — but he would n’t be getting that money until March .
And he did n’t want to absolutely commit yet to using that system , because it would limit his campaign to spending only $ 54 million through the end of August .
And FEC rules say that using public matching funds as collateral locks a candidate into the system .
So McCain struck a deal with the bank : he promised to only commit to using the system if he lost the primary .
If he won , he would opt out of the program , and he’d be more than able to pay the bank back , because the funds would come flowing .
McCain ’s lawyers were evidently very pleased with the canniness of this arrangement .
Federal Election Commission Chairman David Mason is n’t nearly as impressed , and is sharp enough to know a candidate trying to pull a con when he sees one .
This story is a little harder to get than , say , whether McCain had an affair with a lobbyist for whom he was doing favors .
But it ’s still pretty important .
Hilzoy had a great item on this .
Campaign finance laws ask candidates to make a choice : either you take federal money , in which case you are subject to a number of restrictions , or else you do n’t take it , in which case you are not .
Getting a loan by using the matching funds you have not yet received as collateral is a way of trying to have it both ways : essentially , you get to spend your matching funds now , but because the money did not literally come from the government , you can delay a decision about whether or not to accept the restrictions that go with them until later .
If you can leverage the money into enough wins to generate contributions , you can pay back the loan and duck the restrictions ; if not , you ’ve lost anyways , so you might as well abide by them .
That ’s exactly what campaign finance laws do not want candidates to be able to do .
McCain tried to be tricky about this : he did n’t use the matching funds he had qualified for as collateral , but he did use the fact that he could qualify for them at any time .
That ’s why he had to give away his legal right to withdraw from the campaign if he lost : to satisfy his lenders , he had to promise to stay in long enough to actually get the matching funds he qualified for , and to give them first dibs on those funds .
Whether or not this violates the law — a law McCain authored — I have no idea , but it is certainly an attempt to wriggle out of its requirements , and it ought to put paid , once and for all , to the idea of McCain as a straight - talking man of principle .
Josh Marshall also summarized what happened quite nicely .
Back in August McCain opted into the public financing system for the primaries .
Then in December he needed to come up with some cash quickly .
Well , no problem .
He was already guaranteed over $ 5 million from the feds .
So all he needed to do was put that guarantee down as collateral for the loan .
Only McCain did n’t want to do that because once he formally made the federally - guaranteed money collateral then he gave up his right to later opt back out of the system .
But , he really , really needed the money .
So McCain , along with his campaign finance lawyer Trevor Potter ( whom I ’ve met and is a very sharp guy ) came up with a workaround .
It went like this .
McCain would n’t make the guarantee collateral .
But he promised that if his campaign tanked he would opt out of the system and then opt back in .
This would mean remaining a candidate even after he knew he was n’t really in the race in order to a ) get back the public money to pay his creditors and b ) assure he could sign the original loan note with the de facto collateral while nonetheless maintaining his ability to once again opt out of the public financing system at any one of many possible future junctures at which his campaign might pop back from life support and it would be in his interest to go back to raising money from donors .
Of course , McCain ’s campaign did come off the mat .
And since he now wants to raise and spend as much as possible before the end of the summer , earlier this month he did actually opt back out .
The FEC , the outfit that enforces the campaign finance laws , says McCain ’s not allowed to opt out .
But whatever , he opted out anyway .
Why McCain feels justified going after Obama over his commitment to the public financing system is a mystery .
What happens next in this story ?
The FEC ’s Mason — who ’s a Republican , by the way — has told McCain he can’t drop out of the primary election ’s public financing system .
McCain ’s lawyers have effectively told Mason , “ Watch us . ”
And because of a dispute between Bush and Congress , the FEC only has two members right now , two fewer than is necessary to take any actions at all .
There are a number of petitions floating around that you can sign to express your support for webcasters in the face of the disastrous royalty rates decided on and recently upheld by the Copyright Royalty Board .
Those in support of internet radio should sign the official petition at savenetradio.org .
The site also offers directions for musicians and music fans to contact their Congressional representative .
This is important ; Congress could act before May 15th , when the rates are scheduled to go into effect , to reject the CRB 's decision , which would require webcasters such as Pandora and Live365 to pay retroactive licensing fees that would put most of them out of business or force them to switch to a paid subscription model .
Aside from Congressional intervention , the other way net radio could be saved is by DiMA and other webcasters appealing the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia .
I 've emailed DiMA to ask them about their appeal plans , and will post an update if / when I hear back on that .
For now , head over to savenetradio.org to sign the petition , contact your Congressperson , and spread the word .
Despite more than 30 years of widespread use of lithium to control psychiatric disorders , such as bipolar disorder , scientists have been uncertain about how this drug actually works on a molecular level .
However , in a paper published in the January 11th issue of Cell , a Duke Medical Center team has found that lithium may alleviate manic and depressive - like behaviors by interrupting the signaling of a dopamine receptor in the brain .
The team was led by Marc G. Caron , Ph.D. , James B. Duke Professor in the Department of Cell Biology , Medicine and Neurobiology , and Martin Beaulieu , Ph.D. , now at Université Laval .
Over the years , lithium has been shown to act principally on two targets in the brain .
It is known to inhibit enzymes that maintain a signaling pathway from the cell membrane .
And it inhibits an enzyme called glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK - 3 ) , which is important in the cell 's response to many signaling molecules .
But , whether these targets are important for the therapeutic effects of lithium has been unclear .
Caron and Beaulieu previously showed that one of the dopamine receptors in the brain , the D2 receptor , transmits its signal by engaging a pathway involving GSK - 3 .
The D2 receptor regulates this pathway with a signaling complex made up of the receptor and enzymes held together by a protein called beta-arrestin 2 .
When placed in a new environment , mice genetically engineered to have an overactive dopamine system typically run around frantically .
Similar hyperactivity and mania - like state can be seen in mice treated with amphetamines .
Previous research by Caron and Beaulieu had shown that treatment with lithium calms these mice by interfering with the D2 receptor / GSK3 pathway .
Caron and his colleagues set out to investigate how lithium produced these effects .
" In humans , lithium alleviates the mood swings and excitability characteristic of bipolar disorder .
However , the concentrations at which lithium is clinically effective are usually lower that those necessary to affect the presumed targets like GSK3 in preclinical studies .
So there had to be another mechanism , " said Caron .
The team focused on whether lithium was acting on the beta - arrestin signaling complex after finding that in another line of genetically engineered mice lacking the gene for the beta - arrestin 2 protein , many of the actions of the D2 receptor were absent .
" We found that lithium destabilizes the signaling complex necessary for the D2 receptor to engage the GSK3 signaling pathway , " said Beaulieu , the lead author of the study .
In the mice that lack beta -arrestin 2 , the researchers found that lithium had no effects on a number of mouse behaviors thought to correlate with symptoms of depression and mania in humans .
" We found that the destabilizing effects of lithium on this signaling complex are observed at concentrations of lithium that are in the range of the clinically effective doses used in the treatment of humans , " said Caron , the senior author of the study .
Over the past several years , studies by another contributor to this study , Robert J. Lefkowitz , James B. Duke Professor and HHMI Investigator at Duke , have shown that many other receptorss , similar to D2 receptors , can signal through the formation of complexes organized by the protein beta-arrestin 2 .
The researchers propose that targeting these beta- arrestin signaling complexes might be an effective target to control cell signaling .
" We feel that this mechanism is a new principle of pharmacology and could lead to drugs for a host of disorders , " said Caron .

Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article Despite growing pressure on Norway to participate in NATO operations in southern Afghanistan , Defense Minister Anne- Grete Strom - Erichsen said she prefers to concentrate Norwegian contingent 's efforts in the north of the war - torn country , said reports reaching Stockholm on Wednesday .
" A dispersion is extremely demanding for a small nation , " Strom - Erichsen told Norwegian news agency NTB .
She believes NATO gets the most out of the Norwegian effort by having it concentrated in the Norwegian - led stabilization force in Maimana .
" We will strengthen the effort where we have a responsibility .
We see that there is a growing security challenge there and how important it is to hinder the Taliban from expanding their activity northwards , " Strom - Erichsen said .
Norway currently has about 100 soldiers stationed in Maimana , a number that may be doubled , though the minister said that was also dependent on what other NATO members did .
Norwegian helicopters will almost certainly be moved in .
" We have depended on German helicopter capacity in the north , but we are now assessing our own capacity in Maimana , at least two helicopters , " she said .
On Thursday Strom - Erichsen will travel to Noordwijk in the Netherlands for an informal two - day meeting of NATO defense ministers , where Afghanistan is one of the central topics for discussion .
U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has warned he will press NATO allies for more support in Afghanistan .
Strom - Erichsen said it was hardly an option for Norway to increase its current force of around 500 soldiers in the NATO - led ISAF force in Afghanistan .
" I fully understand that the Netherlands and Canada ask for assistance but there is a difference between Norway and countries like Germany , Italy and Spain .
We are where we are , and we will discuss the overall picture , " the defense minister said .

The Bush administration 's plan to improve food safety would actually do the opposite , by making it harder for regulators to mandate measures to prevent food contamination , critics told a Senate panel .
The plan requests that Congress give the Food and Drug Administration authority to impose preventive controls on " high - risk " products .
Specifically , these are foods " that have been associated with repeated instances of serious health problems or death to humans or animals from unintentional contamination . "

German nudists will be able to start their holidays early by stripping off on the plane if they take up a new offer from an eastern German travel firm .
REUTERS / File
FRANKFURT ( Reuters ) - German nudists will be able to start their holidays early by stripping off on the plane if they take up a new offer from an eastern German travel firm .
Travel agency OssiUrlaub.de said it would start taking bookings from Friday for a trial nudist day trip from the eastern German town of Erfurt to the popular Baltic Sea resort of Usedom , planned for July 5 and costing 499 euros ( $ 735 ) .
“ It ’s expensive , I know , ” managing director Enrico Hess told Reuters by phone .
“ It ’s because the plane ’s very small .
There ’s no real reason why a flight in which one flies naked should be more expensive than any other . ”
The 55 passengers will have to remain clothed until they board , and dress before disembarking , said Hess .
The crew will remain clothed throughout the flight for safety reasons .
“ I wish I could say we thought of it ourselves but the idea came from a customer , ” Hess told Reuters by phone .
“ It ’s an unusual gap in the market . ”
Naturism , or “ free body culture ” ( FKK ) as it is known in Germany , was banned by the Nazis but blossomed again after the Second World War , particularly in eastern Germany .
“ There are FKK hotels where you can go into the restaurants and shops naked , for example , ” Hess said .
“ For FKK fans -- not that I ’m one of them -- it ’s nothing unusual . ”
“ I do n’t want people to get the wrong idea .
It ’s not that we ’re starting a swinger club in mid-air or something like that , ” he added .
“ We ’re a perfectly normal holiday company . ”

How far does Israel have to go to prove to the world that they are conducting a holocaust against the people of Gaza ?
How many deaths , and by what method are required to fit that particular definition ?
No , there are no gas chambers in Gaza .
No , there are no crematorium in Gaza .
But YES , there have been mass murders , targeted assassinations , starvation , deprivation of every essential needed to survive … including food , the lack of water , electricity , medical supplies , medical facilities , heating oil for homes , and diesel for transportation .
The worst possible is happening NOW …
Do n’t wait to speak out against this holocaust ….
do n’t wait till the numbers of dead reach the millions …
ONE DEATH BY MURDER IS ONE DEATH TOO MANY ….
There are things you can do NOW to help the people of Gaza … .
here is just a partial list of what / where to start …..
ACTION ALERT : END THE CLOSURE OF GAZA NOW !
Call ( 202-895-5400 ) or email ( Embassy@egyptembdc.org ) the Egyptian Embassy and demand that Egypt open the Rafah crossing Call ( 202-895-5400 ) or email ( Embassy@egyptembdc.org ) the Egyptian Embassy and demand that Egypt open the Rafah crossing ( 1/22/08 ) Since Friday , the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has escalated to previously unimaginable levels .
Over the past five days , Gaza has been completely shut off from the rest of the world due to an Israeli – and Egyptian - enforced – closure of all border crossings .
By Sunday , approximately 800,000 Gazans were left without electricity as Gaza ’s only power plant ran out of fuel .
Many of the hospitals and medical clinics were also left with dwindling medical supplies and little to no fuel to power generators .
As a result , approximately 75 Palestinians have already died from the closure , and a number of patients in intensive care units have died as their emergency life support equipment cannot function without electricity .
Many hospitals are forced to choose which equipment to keep running : dialysis machines , neonatal units , or heart and oxygen machines .
Furthermore , with no fuel or electricity for the water pumps and sewage treatment plants , most Gazans have now lost their running water , with several neighborhoods , including the large Zatoun neighborhood east of Gaza City , flooded with sewage .
The closure has resulted in a deliberate and collective punishment of the entire civilian population of Gaza ( nearly 1.5 million Palestinians ) .
Such collective punishment directly contravenes explicit provisions of the 4 th Geneva Convention , to which Israel is a signing party .
John Ging , director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) in Gaza said the civilian population was living in “ abject misery ” and had been stripped of their human dignity .
“ People here in Gaza have been living in abject misery and hardship now for a long time , ” Ging told Al - Jazeera .
“ On top of that they are living in darkness …
You have to see how miserable the situation is .
The civilian population is under occupation .
It is collective punishment – they are victims . ”
For its part , Egypt has willingly assisted Israel in the closure , preventing any Palestinian from leaving Gaza through the Rafah crossing .
In particular , several ambulances carrying critically ill patients have been refused entry by Egyptian authorities .
Faced with starvation and death , a group of Palestinian female protesters attempted to leave Gaza , only to be turned away by water cannons , gunfire , and baton - wielding Egyptian soldiers .
At least 25 Palestinians have been injured by Egyptian soldiers enforcing Israel ’s closure .
Though the media has reported that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to express opposition to the humanitarian crisis , Mubarak has followed these empty words with affirmative acts to enforce the closure .
Egypt does have the power to alleviate Palestinian suffering by at least allowing entry of fuel , emergency medicine and medical supplies , and supplies needed by aid agencies to distribute food .
Call the Egyptian Embassy in Washington D.C. and demand that Egypt open the Rafah crossing , and cease enforcing the closure of Gaza now !

Some smart Redditer did a Google search for all the Reddit stories containing the words " It 's Official " in the title .
The idea , of course , is to show that the Redditers use this phrase way too much , be it for fun , or to make a story that is n't actually official in any way more plausible .
Immediately , I remembered all those " BREAKING " stories on Digg .
The first time someone thought of using the word to make a news item seem more important , it was over .
Soon , your story had no chance of making the front page if it did n't have " BREAKING " in it , and thus we have stories like " Breaking : Washington Governor Chris Gregoire endorses Obama , " which is just as breaking as news about a new mobile phone being launched .
Nothing unexpected here : since everyone is trying to push his / her story to the top / front page , competition tough , and one has to adapt and use more and more tricks to succeed .
The question is : will bad journalism and sensationalist titles win , or can the community somehow fix it and raise its own standards ?
Unfortunately , it seems to me that the more users a social news site has , the lower the standards .
My tablemate dipped her doughnut into the cup of hot chocolate and purred while she chewed .
" Is this the best thing you ever ate , or what ? " she said .
We were splitting an order of churros and hot chocolate , which the waiter recommended as the best dessert on the menu at Hugo's , the popular upscale Mexican restaurant on Westheimer .
A churro is a Mexican doughnut made by extruding dough through a nozzle into a deep fryer .
The nozzle gives the long stick - shaped doughnut pronounced ridges , which trap the cinnamon and sugar topping .
At Hugo 's the kitchen does n't fry the churros until they 're ordered , so they 're served piping hot .
Hugo's also cuts them in three pieces , fills the inside with the caramel syrup called dulce de leche and serves them on a plate with a dainty scoop of mocha ice cream .
There are hundreds of Tex - Mex cantinas , authentic Mexican restaurants , taquerías , carnicerías , panaderías and taco trucks in Houston .
But ever since it opened in 2002 , Hugo's has been the best Mexican restaurant in the city .
In the 2003 " Best of Houston " issue , the Houston Press named Hugo 's Houston 's " Best Restaurant , " period .
Info Hugo Ortega
The restaurant roasts its own cocoa beans and grinds them by hand in an old - fashioned stone mill imported from Oaxaca .
The fresh - ground cocoa powder is used to make its signature mole poblano , as well as the cup of hot chocolate that comes with the doughnuts .
The churros and hot chocolate at Hugo 's are sensational .
Churros are a common street food snack in Mexico City , which is fitting since Hugo Ortega , the owner and head chef , grew up in one of Mexico City 's worst slums .
Ortega entered the United States illegally , and like an enormous number of Mexican immigrants , he found work in the restaurant industry .
The restaurant industry is the nation 's largest employer of immigrants , according to the National Restaurant Association , which estimates that 1.4 million restaurant workers in the United States are foreign - born immigrants .
Seventy percent of them work in the lowest - paying jobs , as dishwashers , busboys , prep cooks and cleaning help .
The National Restaurant Association lobbies on behalf of restaurant owners , and predictably , it 's one of the loudest proponents of immigration reform .
" While the government claims stepped - up enforcement ... will discourage future illegal immigration across our nation 's borders , " the NRA Web site says , " in reality , all they are doing is eliminating a sizeable portion of the workforce without providing any legal avenue to hire foreign - born workers to do jobs that Americans are no longer taking . "
Meanwhile , anti-immigration groups such as U.S. Border Watch , which intimidates day laborers as they wait for employers to pick them up , remain active .
" It makes me sad , " Ortega says about a recent confrontation in northwest Harris County .
" If immigrants are selling drugs or committing crimes , then put them in jail or send them back to Mexico .
But please judge immigrants as individuals and for their contributions to society . "
" You only hear one side of the immigration debate , because the people who really know what 's going on can't say anything , " one Houston restaurant owner told me .
" If you own a restaurant and you speak out about immigration , you make your business a target . "
There 's a weird disconnect between perception and reality for those who work in the business .
Thanks to media demagogues like Lou Dobbs , much of the American public is ready to " send 'em back to Mexico . "
Meanwhile , Spanish is what you 're most likely to hear in a restaurant kitchen .
Author and TV star Anthony Bourdain is one of the few chefs who 's been willing to speak frankly on the issue .
He says the American restaurant industry would be in big trouble if all the illegal immigrants in this country were rounded up and deported .
" The bald fact is that the entire restaurant industry in America would close down overnight , would never recover , if current immigration laws were enforced quickly and thoroughly across the board , " Bourdain told me .
" Everyone in the industry knows this .
It is undeniable ... I know very few chefs who 've even heard of a U.S. - born citizen coming in the door to ask for a dishwasher , night clean - up or kitchen prep job .
Until that happens , let 's at least try to be honest when discussing this issue . "

The two roasted poblanos were stuffed with shredded pork shoulder that had been slowly braised with pears , peaches and raisins , and spices .
I ate some of the filling with the spiciest part of the chile , the thick flesh around the stem .
There was so much going on — the sweetness of the pork , the kick of the fiery green chile and the creaminess of the thick walnut sauce , sparked with the intense tartness of pomegranate seeds that burst as I chewed — it was a baroque fugue of flavors .
" I learned the secret of the walnut sauce from a lady in Puebla , " Hugo says .
The secret is to buy walnuts in September when they 're still white inside and then soak them in milk until the bitter skins slip off easily .
Hugo 's serves chiles en nogada through the fall or as long they can get fresh pomegranates .
In the summer , the menu switches over to dishes made with squash blossoms .
The restaurant also serves such exotica as huitlacoche ( corn fungus ) and sautéed chapulines ( grasshoppers ) when they 're available .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The dollar fell to record lows against the euro and a basket of currencies for a fourth straight day on Friday as yet another set of dour U.S. economic data left traders betting on an aggressive Federal Reserve rate cut next month .

A sharp decline in global and U.S. stocks knocked the dollar to an all - time low against the Swiss franc and pushed it to a three - year trough against the Japanese yen .
However , short - covering into the weekend halted the dollar ’s slide against the euro .
Data showed U.S. consumer sentiment dropped to a 16 - year low in February , while business activity in the country ’s Midwest contracted sharply , raising red flags for investors wary of a recession in the world ’s largest economy .
“ The data was just dismal .
The only good thing was that inflation did n’t jump and that means there is room for the Fed to continue cutting interest rates , ” said Adam Fazio , senior currency strategist at CIBC World Markets in New York .
“ When the PCE data did n’t show an above - forecast tick in inflation , the market started to aggressively price in a 75 - basis - point cut from the Fed on March 18 . ”
The core personal consumption expenditures ( PCE ) price index is the Fed ’s favored inflation gauge .
It rose 0.3 percent in January , in line with market expectations .
Short - term interest rate futures were showing a 70 percent chance of the Fed lowering its benchmark overnight lending rate by three - fourths of a percentage point at the March 18 monetary policy meeting .
The federal funds rate target is currently at 3 percent after being cut by 2.25 percentage points since mid-September .
The euro set a record high of $ 1.5238 , according to Reuters data , before surrendering gains to trade down 0.3 percent at $ 1.5181 .
The dollar index .
DXY , which tracks the greenback 's performance against a basket of currencies , hit a lifetime low of 73.560 before trimming losses to around 73.737 , down 0.1 percent on the day .
The index was poised for its biggest weekly loss in more than two years of 2.4 percent .
“ The break of 1.50 was an extremely important market event ; there is a scope to go further .
Our target for euro / dollar is 1.58/59 over the next two months , ” said Fazio .
Economic woes coupled with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke ’s warning about the health of some small U.S. banks on Thursday weighed on risk appetite to the benefit of low - yielding currencies like the yen and Swiss franc .
Low - yielding currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc tend to attract flows during periods of uncertainty as the low interest rates reflect the capital surplus of their respective countries .
The dollar fell to a historic low of 1.0408 Swiss francs , posting its biggest weekly decline since December 2000 .
The greenback touched a three - year low against the yen at 103.80 yen .
The dollar faces a major test next week , with the release of February ’s nonfarm payrolls and manufacturing reports , which could determine the size of next month ’s rate cut .
A half - percentage - point rate cut has been fully priced in .
“ We expect U.S. economic data to continue to signal a U.S. economic recession .
Having broken the key 1.50 level , we expect EUR / USD to trade in a 1.50 - 1.55 range in the near term , ” foreign exchange strategists at UBS said in a research note .
When most people think of Intel , they think of the company 's desktop , workstation , and server products .
These are all important areas , to be sure , but Intel is quite active in another business segment that does n't receive as much attention from the press .
Embedded processing may operate largely under the radar ( much like embedded products themselves ) , but it's an important and profitable part of the company 's business .
Intel made some significant updates to its embedded product line today ; the company launched a total of five new 45nm Xeon parts , announcing that it would support the parts through a seven - year life - cycle frequency ( versus five previously ) .
Intel also unveiled a new chipset , the 5100 MCH .
The new Xeon parts are n't restricted only to embedded products , but Intel chose to focus on their capabilities in that space .
Both the new Xeons and the new chipset offer a significant reduction in power draw .
The new Xeon 5200 and 5400 processors are all built on 45nm as opposed to older , 65nm process technology , and are based on the Penryn core .
Power consumption on Intel 's 65nm Xeons was actually fairly good , but the company believes its 45 nm secret sauce will allow customers to design and deploy blade servers with significantly tighter thermal limits .
The 5200 series are dual - core parts with 6MB of L2 cache , with frequency ranges from 1.86GHz ( E5205 , 65W ) to 3.4GHz ( X5272 , 80W ) .
The 5400 series are quad - core parts , as the name implies , and offer a total of 12 MB of L2 cache .
Speeds range from 2GHz ( E5405 , 80W ) to 3.16GHz ( X5460 , 120W ) .
There are two other Xeons in the 5400 series , but it 's not clear where they fit into Intel 's product line .
Both the X5472 ( 3GHz , covered here in our review of the new Mac Pro ) and X5482 ( 3.2GHz ) run on a 1600MHz FSB that the 5000X and 5100 MCH do n't officially support .
The X5472 stays within the same 120W thermal envelope as the 3.16GHz X5460 , but the X5482 has a thermal design specification of 150W .
This does n't sound like the type of chip one regularly drops into a blade server ; it 's doubtful any of the highest - end processors will be deployed in such settings .
The company 's new 5100 MCH is also designed for lower thermals , though it sacrifices a few of the features found on the earlier 5000X in order to do so .
The 5100 supports 32 GB of RAM now ( up to 48 GB later this year ) , across six DDR - 2 DIMM slots , while the 5000X supports up to eight DIMMs and 64GB of memory .
The type of memory used by each platform is also different ; the 5000X requires DDR2 FB - DIMMs , while the 5100 MCH uses ECC buffered DD2 .
This is undoubtedly part of the reason for the 5100 MCH 's lower thermals — FB -DIMMs are notoriously power hungry .
The two chipset designs also use different southbridges .
The 5000X is paired with the 6321ESB , while the 5100 MCH uses the familiar ICH9 - R .
The differences between the two are explained by their respective foci — the 6321ESB is a server / workstation part , while the ICH - 9R is aimed more at high - performance desktops .
Both chipsets offer the same number of SATA ports ( 6 ) , but the 5100 MCH offers 12 USB2 ports while the 6321ESB has just six .
Similarly , the 5000 offers an integrated 10/100/1000 Ethernet MAC , while the 6321ESB does not .
Both support PCI - Express in varying configurations , but again , the configuration is slightly different ; the 6321ESB offers two independent 64 - bit / 133MHz PCI - X ( remember it ) controllers , while the 5100 MCH does not .
Intel 's decision to segment the two products makes sense .
The 5100 MCH is aimed specifically at customers who need low - power / low - thermal solutions , possibly for blade servers , and who may find the integrated LAN and additional USB2 ports useful .
The 5000X will still be available for customers who need the 6321ESB 's additional server capabilities or greater RAM capacity .
New York police who killed an unarmed black man with 50 shots on his wedding day were careless and desperate to make an arrest because their vice unit was about to be disbanded , a prosecutor said on Monday .
Two officers went on trial for manslaughter and a third for reckless endangerment in the death of Sean Bell , 23 , who was killed in 2006 following a bachelor party at a strip club in a case generating outrage in much of New York 's black community .
Civil rights activist Al Sharpton sat next to the fiance , Nicole Paultre , in a gallery packed with friends and relatives of the victim and police sympathetic to the defendants .
Protesters outside , many of whom wanted murder charges against the officers , held up signs numbered 1 to 50 , chanting each number .
WASHINGTON , Dec. 11  The United States Sentencing Commission voted unanimously today to lighten punishments retroactively for crimes related to crack cocaine , a decision that could affect some 19,500 federal inmates .
The decision , which was made over the objections of the Bush administration , takes effect on March 3 , 2008 , and it will not mean automatic release for those serving time .
But it does open the door for them to apply for sentence adjustments and possible earlier release .
The commission previously had voted to recommend shorter prison sentences for crack cocaine offenders .
Those guidelines went into effect on Nov. 1 , but the commission postponed a vote on whether to make them retroactive .
The commission ’s vote addressed what many analysts have come to see as a deeply unfair consequence of the decades - long war on drugs and the drug - sentencing laws adopted in the mid-1980s , when the fear of drug - induced street violence had a profound effect on public policy and personal behavior .
A 2002 commission report noted that 85 percent of defendants convicted of crack offenses were black , a fact the commission warned was leading to a loss of confidence in the fairness of the justice system .

BBC News , Bamenda , Cameroon
Short people in Bamenda , north - western Cameroon are joining together to campaign for an end to what they say is discrimination by their taller compatriots .
Jonathan Fru ( l ) says billboards are too high for short people
They say they are treated like second - class citizens .
To spearhead their fight for equality , they have set up the Association of Short People in Cameroon ( ASPC ) , which has been officially registered .
To belong to the association , prospective members have to be no taller than 1.60 m ( 5 '2 " ) .
This height limitation was increased from the original 1.56 m , following protests from those who were taller than the intended limit but still considered themselves to be short people .
Height restrictions
Bamenda - based jurist and founding ASPC president , Jonathan Fru , 61 , says the reasons for creating the association are simple .
Joining this association has given me some self - esteem
Stephen Ngang , 1.20 m ( 3'9 " )
" Carpenters make chairs that are too high for us and so we are not comfortable sitting with others , " he says .
" We have difficulties reaching high counters in shops and in banks , then to add insult to injury , all billboards are high up in the air and we have to strain to read them . "
The associations ' president adds that they have begun a vigorous campaign to right these wrongs and have so far met the provincial governor to table their grievances .
As if to prove that good things can come in small packages , the association has the shortest constitution I have ever come across - just two pages long .
They also have an anthem which is just two sentences long -" If you want to join the Short Peoples ' Association , you just come , for we are peaceful , you just come " .
' Abuse '
Stephen Ngang is the shortest registered member of the association and says he is living proof of the problems short people face daily .
Standing only 1.20 m ( 3'9 " ) and now 49 years old , he has no job and is still unmarried .
Do short people know we also have problems ?
John , 2 m ( 6'6 " )
He is unsure how he will feed his wife and children ( if he has any ) , considering that he is jobless .
Mr Fru says he did not meet his wife , who is taller than him , until he was 30 years old - seen as late in Cameroon .
He blames his late social development squarely on the shoulders of his 1.53 m ( 5 ' ) frame and the low self - esteem that this caused .
" I do n't want other short people to suffer as I did , which is why I created this association , " he says firmly .
Some tall people I met were , however , dismissive of the grouping of short people .
" Being short is not a problem - I wish I was shorter , " said John , standing tall at 2 m ( 6 '6 " ) .
" Do short people know we also have problems ? " he asked .
" Being too tall sometimes affects my balance and I need to bend down sometimes to listen to my short wife " he said jokingly .
A secondary school teacher blamed administrative officials for giving legal recognition to the association in the first place .
" It is an abuse and ridicules the laws regulating the creation of associations in Cameroon , " he said .
Respect
Jaqueline Sirri , 25 and 1.56 m ( 5 ' 1 " ) , is happily married but is still upset that she was disqualified from sitting for the army exams last year because of her height .
She says she is much happier since she joined the ASPC and wants the rights of all short men and women nationwide to be respected .
" We are normal human beings , our height notwithstanding , " she says .
The short people deny discriminating against their taller brethren through their height restriction and insist that they do not see tall people as enemies .
They say they just want to be treated with the same respect as the rest of the population .
Is it harder for short people to succeed in life ?
Or do you think this campaign is a waste of time ?
Your comments :
It is not hard for short people to succeed in life if he / she is determine .
But here in Cameroon it is very difficult for a short person to have a job like joining the police force and the arm force .
Recognising the ASPC it means things will change for the short people .
Let the ASPC members go ahead with the struggle .
Kum Ignatius , Buea , Cameroon
As a tall person I regularly have to go down on my knees to retrieve snacks from vending machines , hotel showers are generally at shoulder height despite there being ample space for the shower head to be fitted higher , I have to squat to read the displays on ticket machines and some cash machines are below my waist height !
It 's lead to a life of backache !
Oh to be ' average ' !
Daniel , Guildford , UK
I am a Cameroonian and lived in Bamenda for about 20 years .
The truth is nothing is built with accessibility access in Cameroon .
The idea of an association for short people sounds like a joke .
I must agree short people as disabled people face social discriminations in Cameroon which need to be addressed .
However , we CANNOT have short people in the military .
There are some jobs where height cannot be overlooked .
On the positive side , as the Cameroonian military is the most inactive in the world , short and disabled people can realistically survive .
Muma Kaba , Newcastle - England
In my country short people are sometimes looked upon as being crooked and there are some who are referred to as ' Chiluba ' - the former president owing to his plunder cases .
I would n't know if it 's harder but generally Zambians are short and it's not an issue really .
Taller people are seen as being rather dull so ... the campaign is worth it I guess .
Jethro , Lusaka , Zambia
I am just under five feet tall .
When I lived in the US I was made to feel like a child sometimes , even when I was in my early 30s !
It is hard for a woman to be taken seriously in some professional situations , and you have to augment your presence in other ways .
Now that I have moved to South India where many adults are naturally short , height is simply not an issue for me any more .
It depends solely on the culture of where you are living .
J MacKenzie Murthy , Bangalore , India
I think forming the " Association for Short people in Cameroon " is trying to duplicate associations , which by the end of the day serve the same purpose .
To be born too short or too tall is a genetic problem , and it is quite difficult for one to run away from it .
In other terms this is a disability , because it disables one to operate the same with other people , as they have narrated .
I believe that they ( Cameroonians ) have an association or a ministry that takes care for the disabled , which this group of people should fall within .
Why not affiliating themselves to this group .
I am afraid , because people with too small or too large heads , etcetera , may start thinking of forming their associations as well .
Harris Manyozo , Lilongwe , Malawi
I think they are on the right track since there are a lot of discrimination based on beauty , height and other physical characteristics in daily social life .
I think the next one should be the association of ugly peoples who are highly stigmatised form economic and social life .
Nukong , Kampala , Uganda
My height is only 1.43 m. I think it is harder to succeed in life as most of the time , people will not take me seriously .
They think that I was still in high school where in fact my age is around 30 .
How could I nurture a networking ( which is partly expected within my job ) when people think I am too " young " ( shorter people usually have baby face ) to be seen as an important person ?
Tia , Loughborough
What is important about a human being is his / her decency but not his / her height .
Any decent person deserves to be treated with the same respect irrespective of his / her height .
It goes without saying !
My height is 1.74 m .
If a person is a decent and clever one then height of a person does not matter to the person .
Yuri Sevastyanov , Kharkov , Ukraine
I think its true that some facilities were not designed with such short people in mind , I therefore think that its time now for designers to think of this category as they think of disabled .
Again , it is also true that they are discriminated from some jobs , but for the army I think there is a reason for doing that and I think its for their benefit and for the nation as well , in other jobs there is no point why they should not be taken .
The campaign should go on !
Heri , Coventry , UK
I disagree , short people are far from being physically disabled , and yet people with disabilities are fighting and managing to succeed in this African Life .
They just have to fight and excel in life , that 's the best model for their counterparts .
If a few succeed and excel , others will know it is possible and will do likewise .
Philippe Masengo , Lusaka
Here in the Sudan , people are treated according to their economic success .
A rich short man is respected more than a poor tall man .
And a well educated short man earns more respect and special treatment than uneducated tall man .
So short people in Cameroun should learn to fit in the changes of the present world .
Idra Kimu , Juba , Sudan
The story of my life .
Being from Venezuela but from Bolivian stock .
My Mother raised my brother and I in Trinidad where people are tall , and it seemed that apart from being way out ethnically our short height , always seemed to matter .
At high school a guy always bullied me just because I was short .
Later in life and back in Venezuela a sad marriage flopped head over heels because my girl shunned my stature .
Hence all my life I became keenly aware of the subject and questioned parents who were short and whose sons were tall , and then set to test a theory with exit on my first child who is now 11 .
Inspired on Wattusi's up thrust dance , I had him ever soaring up and everyone says now he is quite tall for his age and had it not been for his face one would have second thoughts that he was my son .
Nutrition - wise I also followed some good counsel and it did the trick .
In our values distorted society yes height plays a role but you just have to be from Lilliput ( a fictional kingdom where people were small ) to understand .
Antonio Cardenas , Caracas , Venezuela
I think this campaign is a complete waste of time since there is no discrimination existing ... what matters most to anyone is the sound faculty that one possesses .
There are more things in life that one should worry about than just indulging oneself in self - pettiness .
Mahmoud A Ali , Benghazi , Libya
Success in life does not depend on height , I have seen quite a number of short but successful men and women in East Africa .
Well they are entitled to their opinions .
Juma Delu , Juba , South Sudan
Congratulations to those people who have come out to share their views and the problems that they face in regards to their height .
Well I am a Papua New Guinean , female student attending one of the finest university in my country and I am 159 cm tall aged 20 .
There is nothing wrong with either being tall or short .
Everyone is created by God according to His own likeness and image and we should not discriminate anyone according to their physical appearance .
If in the case of applying for a job , our qualifications should be the far most important point to look at then simple measures such as height difference and so forth .
No matter the height difference life has so many things to offer , you can succeed in whatever you want to do in life , and not bow down to any criticism or barriers in life .
We are all controllers of our own life and in order to succeed you have to keep your head up high and go forward to achieve your dreams .
This campaign is a very good way to inform everyone that height does n't matter but it is what 's inside you that counts in the end .
Joanne Map Kilip , Papua New Guinea
I think it is harder for short people to succeed in life .
In general , people always tend to say looks do n't matter , but when someone sees you , the first impression they form of you is on your appearance and the above dilemma in this story applies to fat people as well .
Seriously , the first time a person meets a fat person , the first thing that comes to their mind is 'oh , this guy is faaat ! '
The same goes for short people .
It 's hard to have a high self esteem when people tend to form this negative mindset barrier the moment they see you just because of the way you look , without taking into consideration your personality .
And I speak from experience , people always make fun of short people or fat people and I know again from a personal experience that such people indeed tend to suffer socially and have a low self esteem .
I do n't think it 's fair for them .
Basira Ali Ahmed , Dubai , UAE
Defining success in short people and tall people , I think only depends on the choice of one person 's career to pursue .
That 's why I would say that the height of a person is not a basis of succeeding in life 's journey it is in his / her will and goals in life .
I can't say your successful because your a billionaire and neither unsuccessful of being in the middle class of society .
Finally , I will say that a person 's success in life can only be measure by himself alone whether he / she is content in the life he / she stands in society and not because of his height or any physical differences .

It 's true that we usually despise the people who are shorter than the average high .
I myself find that people in Taiwan also prefer higher to shorter .
This association reminds us that there still have a lot of different kinds of abuse of human rights , and therefore , we have to instil the concept of human rights in our next generation .

It 's not your height that matters , it 's your heart .

It 's a good thing to have such an organization .
Even here in Kenya it is very hard for a short person to join the military .
I wish we had such an organization in Kenya .

What excellent idea to mix bleach ( like Clorox ) and ammonia ( like Windex ) !
Let 's just look into your future before you mix your first batch :
At first you will smile to yourself thinking " I wonder why no one has done this before !
I must be the smartest person who ever cleaned anything ! "
Then you will marvel at how well your solution is working .
It is so wonderful you are seeing white spots in your peripheral vision !
After a bit of scrubbing you might think to yourself " I think I 'll take a little break until this light - headed feeling wears off . "
You will immediately wake up on a rolling bed on the way into an ambulance with a ( hopefully ) handsome EMT saying " It 's a good thing you taught your children how to dial 911 - we arrived just in time . "
You will lose consciousness again .
At the Emergency Room ( ER ) they will stick a tube down your throat and tell you how dumb you are .
When your husband gets there he will tell you how everyone knows you 're not supposed to mix bleach and ammonia and you are dumb .
Who could have known ( without a basic chemistry class ) that bleach and ammonia combined give off toxic deadly fumes ?
but next time you will know to wear a gas mask .
And it continues .
More findings just popping up , even without the hard shovel of impeachment hearings .
The washington post reports , in an article titled , White House Says It Routinely Overwrote E-Mail Tapes From 2001 - 2003 :
E-mail messages sent and received by White House personnel during the first three years of the Bush administration were routinely recorded on tapes that were " recycled , " the White House 's chief information officer said in a court filing this week .
During the period in question , the Bush presidency faced some of its biggest controversies , including the Iraq war , the leak of former CIA officer Valerie Plame Wilson 's name and the CIA 's destruction of interrogation videotapes .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said he has no reason to believe any e-mails were deliberately destroyed .
From 2001 to October 2003 , the White House 's practice was to use the same backup tape each day to copy new as well as old e-mails , he said , making it possible that some of those e-mails could still be recovered even from a tape that was repeatedly overwritten .
" We are continuing to analyze our systems , " Fratto said last night .
The court filing said tapes were recycled before October 2003 , and at that point , the White House " began preserving and storing all backup tapes . "
Any data / information technology expert knows that this is not acceptable .
Now , the history of the Bush admin is to ignore the counsel of experts and to use the opinion of neocons or partisans .
I can just imagine some right wingnut washtington insider say something like , " that computer geek does n't know sh*t about politics .
We can keep erasing these damning emails on a daily basis and use the " economy " excuse as plausible deniability . "
Sorry , but this is totally not plausible nor deniable .
It 's so screaming freaking obvious .
Any tech administration who set it up knew the rules , knew the laws and went ahead and did it anyway .
This is a great example of how a lower level member of the Bush admin could be leaned upon to testify against higher level Bush admin leaders .
It 's the kind of testimony that may only come when impeachment hearings are held and Bush and Cheney lose the right of executive privilege to block testimony .
The Wapo article reported ,
Two federal statutes require presidential communications , including e-mails involving senior White House aides , to be preserved for the nation 's historical record , and some historians responded to the court disclosure yesterday by urging that the White House 's actions be thoroughly probed .
" There certainly could have been hugely important materials there . . . and of course they 're not owned by President Bush or anybody in the administration , they 're owned by the public , " said presidential historian and author Robert Dallek .
" Given how secretive this administration has been , it of course fans the flames and suspicions about what has been destroyed here .
I hope we 'll get an investigation . "
The White House 's electronic record - keeping system has been under scrutiny for months by congressional Democrats and is the subject of several lawsuits , one of which prompted the latest disclosures .
The administration has previously acknowledged problems with the White House archiving system , but until Tuesday had not disclosed its practice of recycling backup tapes before 2003 .
Although the White House said in the filing that its practice of recording over the tapes ceased after October 2003 , it added that even some e-mails transmitted through the end of 2005 might not have been fully preserved .
They 're laying up an excuse to explain later missing evidence .
People say it is too late for impeachment .
That 's ignorance talking .
It 's not too late for Bush to stage more Gulf on Tonkin incidents , like he flubbed in the Strait of Hormuz .
It 's not too late for Bush to start a war .
It 's not too late for him to replace another supreme court justice , if one dies or retires .
The nightmare scenarios go on and on .
But the bottom line is Nancy Pelosi is failing to pursue her constitutional duty to INVESTIGATE crimes by Cheney and Bush .
This latest example is just one to be added to dozens of offenses .
Pelosi says impeachment will take up too much time .
That is an outright lie .

The median price of an American single - family home fell in 2007 for the first time in at least four decades , according to the National Association of Realtors , a trade group .
“ It ’s the first price decline in many , many years , ” the group ’s chief economist , Lawrence Yun , said Thursday .
“ And possibly going back to the Great Depression . ”
The median price of a single - family home fell 1.8 percent , to $ 217,800 , the first annual decline since reliable records began in 1968 .
And even as prices plummeted , buyers vanished .
Over all , sales of previously owned single - family homes dropped 13 percent in 2007 , the biggest decline in a quarter - century .
( The group ’s survey excludes newly constructed homes . )
Why do this ?
Because we can !
No other reason needed for making something so audacious .

Take a look at this guy sitting in the car .
Imagine if he was your father .
How cool would he be ?
A lot of us geeky dads worry that our kids are not as geeky as we are .
We unpack nifty kits which are never built .
We want our children to finish up that science fair project on - their - own .
Or come out with us to the garage when we open the hood of the car .
But they shrug .
Even a rocket launch may not get them away from the computer .
Science fiction author Neal Stephenson once told me something memorable as we were hanging out in his back yard .
He pointed to an unfinished kayak under a tarp .
He said he was slowly working on it , in part to mentor his kids , even though they did no work on the boat , nor express the least bit of interest in this project .
None - the - less he continued puttering on the undertaking while they were home .
Stephenson said when he was a kid , his dad was constantly tinkering on some garage project or another , and despite Neal 's complete indifference for any of his dad 's enthusiasms at the time , he was influenced by this embedded tinkering .
It was part of the family scene , part of his household , like mealtime style , or the pattern of interactions between siblings .
Later on when Neal did attempt to make stuff on his own , the pattern was right at hand .
It felt comfortable , easy .
Without having to try very hard , he knew how to be a nerd .
So he continued the tradition in the faith that while his kids showed no outward enthusiasm for his weekend projects , and did n't pick up a tool to help , they were being trained and coached in a subterranean way .
I noticed a similar subterranean influence at work during our travel with kids .
Despite some fairly exotic travel every year , our young kids seem wholly unimpressed by these trips .
Bali ?
It was about chicken poo .
When our girls were 8 and 10 , they accompanied me for 4 weeks in the very rugged hill country of the Kam region in Tibet , the mountain kingdoms near Lijiang , Yunnan , and in the fantastic karst formations near Guilin , China .
For them the highlight of their month - long trip was the 2 - story McDonalds in Chengdu we visited on the last day ( which I have to admit was an experience ) .
But it was all they would talk about for years afterward .
Yet when they reached their teenage years and beyond , that particular trip kept surfacing as an immense influence on their lives .
The things they had witnessed first - hand years ago had become touchstones as they matured .
Details I had no idea they had even noticed , were now central to their identity .
Despite their silence they had not missed much .
It just took a while to comprehend it .
You can't really " remember " something until you make sense of it .
That 's why the call for a geeky dad is to do stuff – often by ourselves – because we enjoy it .
Even if the kids do n't join in .
I may start something with my son in the hope he 'll get the bug , but I 've learned to keep going even if he does n't .
I make stuff because I love to , and because it is also subterranean tutoring .
Kids do n't miss much .
When tinkering is part of the household pattern , that pattern gets set in a unconscious level .
When tools are ever present , there 's permission to make a mess .
When parents are making , making is cool .
Mistakes are common , no big deal , you fix them .
More than you 'll ever know , kids are watching .
They do n't need to weld to get it .
Geekiness , amateur enthusiasm , do - it - yourself - ness , and a designer / engineer approach to life is a perspective that can be transmitted indirectly , invisibly , and silently .
Just have fun yourself .

Japanese astronaut to throw boomerang in space
by Staff Writers
Tokyo ( AFP ) Jan 23 , 2008
A Japanese astronaut plans to throw a boomerang inside a space station to test how it can fly in zero gravity , an official said Wednesday .
Astronaut Takao Doi , 53 , is set to travel on a US shuttle in March to the International Space Station , where he will be in charge of construction of a Japanese scientific testing room .
It is believed gravity is needed for a boomerang to fly back to the throwing spot , but no one has tried in zero gravity .
" Mr. Doi said he will personally carry a paper boomerang for the upcoming mission and we presume he will try it when he has spare time , " said an official of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency .
Doi reportedly decided on boomerang tests after he received a request from Yasuhiro Togai , a world boomerang champion from the western Japanese metropolis of Osaka .
Doi later underwent training from the world champion on how to throw it , media reports said .
Is it too expensive to be a PC gamer ?
Roy Taylor , VP of content relations for NVIDIA , says that some gaming publishers feel that way , particularly when DirectX 10 is involved .
But , he says , that perception is created by PC manufacturers who are primarily interested in pushing high - cost gaming machines rather than less expensive yet capable boxes .
Taylor 's comments came in a brief article on his corporate blog that was intended to serve as a rebuttal to the notion that DirectX 10 - capable gaming PCs are too expensive .
Taylor recounted an unnamed game publisher who told him that his company was not interested in writing games for DirectX 10 because " all DX10 machines are $ 3,000 and too expensive . "
Such a view is ridiculous , of course , because DX10 - class machines can be had for $ 1,000 and up .
Whether or not you 'd want to game on Vista using such a machine is another matter .
Yet Taylor has a theory as to why PC gaming gets a bad rap in terms of cost .
He says that big OEMs and ISVs " think of PC gaming as a lucrative means of selling overpriced PC hardware better suited to winning magazine reviews than equipping end users with what they need to play the latest games . "
Taylor even suggests that this marketing approach is actually " damaging " to PC gaming .
A corporate executive of a dedicated video graphics card company critiquing the PC manufacturing industry for promoting high - end products may strike you as somewhat strange .
After all , NVIDIA makes a good chunk of its profits on its high - end cards , and the promotional value of shipping the fastest GPU solution to eager reviewers is undeniable .
NVIDIA , like ATI , fuels the fire multiple times each year with new high - end video card releases in a never - ending quest for the top spot .
As we hinted above , Taylor and his game publishing colleagues may be barking up the wrong tree .
DirectX 10 requires Windows Vista and a DX10 - capable graphics card , and Vista is n't exactly hot in the gaming world .
A recent Valve hardware survey showed that only 1.21 percent of users — and these are gamers who enjoy titles such as Counter - Strike and Half - Life 2 — have DX10 - capable systems .
Gamers are staying away from Vista right now , citing comparatively weaker performance on Vista than on Windows XP .
Eventually , as Vista gains in popularity from being bundled with new PCs and DX10 - capable cards become the norm ( and get better drivers ) , the problem should solve itself .
Despite years of doom - and - gloom predictions from pundits , the PC gaming industry has continued to survive and has even shown modest growth .
This post is a brief summary of my views on Saudi reserves and production .
My conclusion is that Saudi Arabia likely has at least 120 Gbs of remaining reserves ( C+C+NGL ) for a URR in excess of 240 Gbs ( C+C+NGL ) .
The remaining reserves according to this analysis are almost double those reported by Ace .
In his recent post , Ace assumes ultimate recoverable reserves ( URR ) in Saudi Arabia to be 175 Gb ( billion barrels ) .
With 112 Gb already produced , that leaves only 63 Gb remaining .
Colin Campbell ( the founder of ASPO ) has estimated total reserves for Saudi Arabia of 275 Gb ( news letter 66 ) , believed to be C+C+NGL ( crude oil + condensate + natural gas liquids ) .
There is an enormous discrepancy between this and Ace 's analysis that ought to be explained .
The importance of reserves and production forecasting
The point I have reached in my analysis of peak oil and energy decline is that reserves and production forecasting are of paramount importance .
It seems increasingly likely to me that Planet Earth has ample supplies of alternative energy that may be gathered ( nuclear and renewable solar sources ) and which may replace declining fossil solar fuels when that happens .
The major challenge that confronts us is not a lack of energy or engineering solutions but one of political , institutional , corporate and personal behaviour .
The human race seems intent upon running for the edge of an energy cliff .
Persuading politicians and OECD institutions now that energy decline is a very serious threat to the future of industrial civilisation is the single most important task that confronts us .
Reliable and credible energy forecasts lie at the heart of that task .
Forecasting oil , gas , coal , uranium reserves and production is a highly complex process , not to be taken lightly .
It is therefore with some reservations that I present this view on Saudi Arabian reserves and production as I simply do not have all the information required to do this job reliably .
This seems an appropriate time to quote Colin Campbell 's 10th commandment :
ALL NUMBERS ARE WRONG – THE QUESTION IS : BY HOW MUCH ?
I will follow a combined bottom up and top down approach , drawing on the work Stuart Staniford and I have done on Ghawar , Aramco reserves estimates ( pre-nationalisation based on BP data ) , Aramco forecasts for new projects ( pdf ) and Hubbert linearisation .
Why C+C+NGL
All the figures presented here are for C+C+NGL making direct comparison with Ace who has used C+C only , problematic .
My apologies for that , but I have good reasons for doing so .
The first is laziness .
I find the BP statistical review of world energy to be a very readily accessible source of data which I use all the time - and BP quote C+C+NGL .
The second is the fact that NGL is a vital constituent of any petroleum system .
In simple terms , the kerogen rich petroleum source rocks produce progressively lighter hydrocarbons with increasing pressure and temperature during burial .
Starting with crude oil , the kerogen will then produce light oil , condensate , wet gas and once it is near completely cooked it will produce dry methane .
So NGL , which condenses out of wet gas is a vital constituent of any petroleum system and should not be ignored in my opinion .
And third , gas production in the Middle East has been relatively low to date owing to remoteness from European and North American markets that historically have been served by local sources of gas .
With increasing amounts of liquefied natural gas ( LNG - not to be confused with NGL ) now being produced , NGLs are tending to make up a significant amount of new production that is coming on stream .
Ignoring NGLs at this stage , therefore , may present an unduly pessimistic picture .
However , it must also be pointed out that the energy content of Saudi NGL is about 70 % of Saudi crude oil .
So 1 barrel of NGL is not equivalent to 1 barrel of crude oil in energy terms .
No adjustment has been made for the differing energy contents .
Saudi official reserves and their decline
The starting point for this analysis is to look at the official Saudi reserves estimates for 1980 as stated in the BP Statistical Review .
A figure of 168 Gbs is quoted .
This is the figure carried by Aramco when it was run by American companies , pre-nationalisation .
As far as we know , this was an objective assessment of recoverable reserves at that time .
Since 1980 , Saudi Arabia has produced 77 billion barrels and declining the 168 figure for this production leaves 91 billion still to be produced , an observation made by Robert Rapier in an earlier post .
However , since 1980 there have been significant improvements in production technology , in particular the advent and widespread use of horizontal wells and 3D and 4D seismic that enable more accurate targeting of by - passed oil .
This has lead to an improvement in recovery factors since 1980 , and the figure of 91 Gbs remaining may justifiably be adjusted upwards to account for this .
Using the API Facts and Figures Centennial edition ( 1959 ) production data from 1936 to 1966 and BP production data from 1966 to 2006 shows that Saudi Arabia has produced 120 Gbs to date .
Anchoring the production decline profile ( the red line ) on 1980 points to initial recoverable reserves of 211 Gbs with 91 Gbs remaining .
But as already stated , these numbers should perhaps be adjusted upwards to account for improved recovery factors .
Conceptual production forecast
Forecast numbers are production capacity .
Actual production may be lower depending upon demand .
Click all charts to enlarge
The conceptual production forecast for Saudi Arabia has the following assumptions :
Ghawar
The Ghawar forecast is based on the base case revision 1 model I presented here .
This is truly a bottom up analysis based on combining the reservoir volume determined from published maps and reservoir data combined with estimates made of the depletion state of the field estimated from published 3D models .
The step down in production in the interval between now and 2017 represents the gradual death of northern Ghawar and transferral of production to the south which is much less depleted and may sustain a reduced plateau for many years .
Between now and 2028 , 21 Gb of production is shown of an estimated 40 Gb remaining reserves .
Some time beyond 2028 , Ghawar production will go into rapid decline as the south end of the field becomes exhausted .
Abqaiq
Abqaiq is the most mature of the Saudi supergiants .
The status of Abqaiq is rather obscure .
The Linux map discussed here and subsequent posts shows oil remaining only in the crest and ridges of the structure .
Jaffe and Elass ( pdf ) show zero production for 2004 , although this may be clouded by periodic inclusion of Abqaiq production together with Ghawar .
Multi- phase pumps ( pdf ) have been deployed to help produce the remaining oil .
Abqaiq is an ageing queen that no doubt would benefit from periodic rest and I have therefore conceptually shown sporadic annual production of up to 400,000 bpd that is turned on when needs require .
A total of 657 million barrels of Abqaiq production is in the model .
Heritage super - giants
The heritage supergiants are those mature fields that together with Ghawar and Abqaiq have made up Saudi production for the last 50 years .
These include Safaniyah , Berri , Shaybah , Qatif , Marjan , Zuluf , Abu Safah and the Hawtah trend fields .
These fields are much less mature than Ghawar and it is difficult to estimate their future performance .
The oil in Safaniyah , Zuluf and Marjan is very sour ( contains high sulphur content ) which creates refining and hence marketability problems .
I consider it likely that these fields are not producing flat out but are production constrained owing to poor marketability of their oil .
The Saudis are taking steps to increase their own refining capacity to deal with this problem .
It is difficult to know what decline rate to apply to this group of fields .
Some , like Safaniyah and Shaybah may not decline at all in the foreseeable future .
Whilst others like Berri and the smaller Hawtah trend fields may experience more rapid decline in the years ahead .
Jaffe and Elass report natural decline rates of 7 to 8 % that is stemmed to 2 % by intervention .
In the interest of being conservative , I have declined the heritage assets at a rate of 5 % per annum .
This may prove to be too high .
They contribute 27.5 Gbs to 2028 .
New Fields
New Fields are based on the Saudi Aramco projects time line , posted by Ace .
Project delays have been a common feature of the recent commodities bull run and delays have therefore been built into the model .
Hawiyah ( Khuff ) , Khursaniyah , Hawiyah ( Khuff ) II , Nuayyim , Shaybah expansion and Yanbu NGL have all been delayed by one year .
Khurais and Manifa have been delayed by 2 years .
Two projects - 2007 , Khursaniyah ethane +NGL , 290,000 bpd and 2008 Yanbu ethane +
NGL , 195,000 bpd - are not included because it is not clear that these are genuine liquids projects .
Ethane is a gas .
The new projects are all included at their nameplate capacity but are declined at a rate of 2 % per annum thereafter .
Discovered undeveloped
A 500,000 bpd allowance is made for discovered undeveloped fields from 2015 that are declined at 2 % per annum thereafter .
Yet to find
A further 500,000 bpd allowance is made for fields as yet undiscovered from 2017 ( 10 years from now ) that too are declined at 2 % per annum .
All this is speculative and conceptual .
It seems unlikely in an oil rich country like Saudi Arabia that oil developments will grind to a halt after Manifa - thus it seems prudent to include some allowance for these future but as yet undetermined projects .
Putting all this together provides the conceptual production forecast model shown above .
The peak in liquids production is 2011 and the average post - peak decline is 3 % .
The modelled decline and depletion rates are shown below .
Depletion is based on a URR of 240 Gbs ( see the following section ) .
The reserves depletion rate cannot go on rising forever , and at some point in the future , the death of S Ghawar ( and other supergiants ) will lead to periods of accelerated decline that will lower the reserve depletion rate .
Decline rate = year on year change as % of production that year .
Depletion rate = annual production as % of remaining reserves based on an assumption of 240 Gbs URR ( see following section )
Asset Production allocation 2007 - 2028 Gbs Hydrocarbon Ghawar 20.9 Arab light Abqaiq 0.66 Arab light Heritage assets 27.5 mixed , biased sour Hawiyah ( Khuff ) 2 NGL Khursaniyah 3.2 Arab light Hawiyah ( Khuff ) II 1.6 NGL Nuayyim 0.61 Super light Shaybah expansion 1.5 Extra light Yanbu NGL 1.2 NGL Khurais 6.7 Arab light Manifa 4.5 Arabian heavy Discovered undeveloped 2.2
Yet to find 2.0 Total 2007 to 2028 75
Hubbert Linearisation
Regular readers of The Oil Drum will recognise this Hubbert Linearisation ( HL ) chart that I have posted many times on various threads .
When it was first posted it received cries of derision from certain posters because my favoured trend is the " stretch HL " drawn between 1991 and 2005 ( the red line ) .
How could anyone have the audacity to draw a trend between two points pointing to 240 Gbs whilst there was a well - defined linear trend pointing to around 180 Gbs ( the blue line ) ?
Saudi oil minister Ali I . Al - Naimi holds Saudi Oil production and the future of industrial civilisation in his hands
The logic is this :
We know for sure that in the period 1991 to 2002 , Saudi Arabia was not pumping at capacity .
The southern third of Ghawar ( Haradh ) was 'nt even developed and numerous discoveries were standing idle , we saw $ 10 oil in 1998 and Saudi Arabia probably had over 2 million bpd spare capacity .
The linear trend from 1991 to 2002 therefore does not see all the reserves and it seems highly likely that this will underestimate the Saudi resource .
1991 ( GW I ) and 2005 were two years that Saudi Arabia was likely pumping at or near capacity .
It is hypothesised that had they pumped at capacity for the interim period then the HL would have declined along the red line and would be pointing towards 240 Gbs .
The red symbols represent the production forecast detailed above and needless to say I was fairly satisfied to see these lining up along my stretch HL trend .
This does n't make it right , but it certainly adds a degree of internal consistency .
2006 production is the last blue symbol .
There has been much debate about HL on TOD over the past year ranging from those such as Westexas who have blind faith in the method to Robert Rapier who has expressed doubts that HL has predictive qualities .
I have always adopted a moderate view acknowledging usefulness so long as the limitations are recognised and understood .
On this basis for the time being my view on Saudi reserves of C+C+NGL is that these will be at least 240 Gbs .
Downside risk
Staurt has recently circulated an internet chart of Ghawar production that shows 4 million barrels per day ( mmbpd ) for 2007 .
This is about 1 mmbpd lower than shown in my production model .
The provenance of this data is unknown , as is its reliablity .
4 mmbpd , however , matches anecdotal evidence from other sources considered to be reliable .
The reduction in Ghawar of 1 mmbpd over 2 years as indicated on this chart matches the decline in Saudi production over the same period .
This brings us back to the question of why Ghawar production may have fallen at a rate of 10 % per annum for two years ?
One possibility is that the depletion state of Ghawar is more advanced than was concluded in my analysis and that Ghawar is now on the slide indicated in my forecast to begin in 2011 .
It is therefore within the realms of possibility that the Saudis have been caught unprepared for a collapse in N Ghawar production , and the scramble for rigs and new projects that is now underway has come too late to forestall a drop in their productive capacity .
The altenative explanation is that mature parts of N Ghawar are being rested to allow new wells to be drilled and reservoir pressure to rise etc .
Bringing N Ghawar decline forward by 4 years produces a modified forecast in the near term .
Saudi watchers will note that 2005 becomes the peak year in a 30 year undulating plateau spanning 1990 to 2020 .
5 billion barrels production are lost in the period to 2028 relative to the base case forecast presented above .

The recovery factors are based on an ussumed 700 Gbs of original oil in place .
This is the figure reported by Baqi and Saleri and by Colin Campbell .
The projected recovery factor for the official Saudi reserves is unrealistically high for the whole country .
55 % may be achieved in the N Ghawar production sweet spots but most certainly not in poorer quality reservoirs that make up much of the countries resource base .
In his analysis , Ace concluded :
it is now almost a certainty that Saudi Arabia passed peak C&C production of 9.6 mmbd in 2005
In reaching this conclusion , Ace assumed that Saudi Arabia had no market for most of its sour crude oil and allocated only 20 billion barrels to sour crude reserves whilst acknowledging that the actual figure may be much higher .
85 Gbs recoverable reserves were booked for Ghawar , whilst Stuart 's analysis suggested 96 Gbs and my base case analysis suggested 97 Gbs .
Not all new projects were included at nameplate capacity and NGL is not included in this analysis of C+C only .
It seems that worst possible case assumptions have been made at each stage which not surprisingly then leads to a low estimate of reserves and a picture of imminent production collapse .
The indicated country - wide recovery factor of 25 % is very low .
Campbell 's analysis of Saudi reserves is rather superficial .
He recognises official Saudi estimates of original oil in place to be 716 Gb but prefers a figure of 600 Gb based on anecdotal evidence from reliable sources .
A generous 45 % recovery factor is applied to the 600 Gbs to get a figure of around 270 Gbs .
This figure matches Saudi official reserves estimates and it is suggested that the Saudis report URR and not remaining reserves .
This certainly fits the practice of showing no decline in the annual reserves return .
Time to recall Colin Campbell 's 10th commandment :
ALL NUMBERS ARE WRONG – THE QUESTION IS : BY HOW MUCH ?
It is up to individual readers to decide where the truth lies .

Benjamin Franklin famously said that time is money , and the phrase is still quite popular today .
What it means is that money is a representation of time … your employer ( or client ) pays you to spend some of your time doing whatever it is that they need and you do .
Your friends and family also want you to spend time with them , and while that ’s not exactly money , it IS value .
That sounds like it makes sense , right ?
Nothing unusual there … it ’s commonly accepted wisdom .
It also happens to be wrong .
The truth of the matter is that time is worthless .
Literally … it ’s worth nothing at all .
What really has value , and what makes your time worth something , is attention .
I ’m going to break this article into two sections : work and relationships .
Why Time Is Money Is Wrong …
At Work
Think about it … if you just showed up at your job , but did nothing at all , do you think that your employer ( or clients ) would want to continue to pay you ?
Of course not … they are paying you to give your attention to the tasks they want accomplished .
There is a base amount of attention that anyone can give to any task .
Someone skilled at that task can , essentially , bring to bear attention paid to the task in the past in the current situation , thus making their time more valuable , because more attention is being given to the task … it ’s just that some of that attention came beforehand .
Skills that are complex require more attention for the average person to learn , which translates to bringing more attention to a task if you DO have that skill , resulting in people with complex skills being paid more than people with simpler skills … brain surgeons possess more complex skills than house painters , for example , so they get paid more .
So the basic measure of value is attention .
But this is n’t just in the economic sense … attention is the basic measure of value in relationships , also . , which leads us to the next section , why time is money is wrong …
In Relationships
People always claim that they need more time together , but it ’s not what they really mean .
I am guilty of this , too … I tell my wife I need more time with her when what I really mean is that I need more time with her where our attention is on each other ( three year old children use up an awful lot of attention ) .
We need , to put it in more familiar terms , quality time , not just quantity time .
Any relationship that you give attention to increases in value ( which can also be called importance , here ) to you .
The person on the other end of the relationship will definitely notice any significant change in the level of attention that you give them .
This can be good or bad … most people will generally appreciate an increase in attention , but too much attention in a relationship that the other person gives less importance to can start to seem creepy ( as in stalker - ish ) .
It ’s very important to remember the distinction between time and attention … time without attention has a net negative value , because you are causing the other person to invest some of their attention without getting anything in return .
This is immediately evident in relationships … if you go out to dinner with someone , and the whole time they are talking on their cell phone , it ’s worse than never having gone out at all .
Summary
It takes time for the value of attention to reach its maximum .
That means the the value of your attention goes up as you spend more consecutive time giving something , or even moreso someone , your undivided attention .
With regard to things , or tasks , you can think of this as “ getting in the groove ” .
With regard to people , you can think of it as warming up or breaking the ice .
Becoming consciously aware of where you are spending your attention can make you much more effective .
You can become more efficient as you learn to focus more of your attention on what you are currently doing .
This can lead to you getting more done , being more productive , and accomplishing more of your goals .
You can also improve your relationships vast amounts by understanding the power of attention … giving someone your undivided attention , especially over a longer time , is incredibly flattering , and people WILL notice and respond to the fact that you are showing that you find them important and valuable .
So … are you aware of where you are spending your attention ?
As the South Carolina primary campaign built to a climax , Sen. Barack Obama addressed a largely African - American audience in Sumter :
Obama used the friendly setting to urge voters not to be fooled by what he said were untruths coming from Hillary Clinton ’s campaign .
“ They ’re trying to bamboozle you .
It ’s the same old okey - doke , ” he said , using a slang phrase for a con .
“ Y’all know about okey - doke , right ?
It ’s the same old stuff . ”
Obama also raised emails that have been circulating falsely calling him a Muslim .
“ I ’ve been a member of the same church for almost 20 years , praying to Jesus , with my Bible , ” he said .
“ Do n’t let people turn you around . ”
It is an interesting juxtapositioning :
I see Obama using the language of Malcolm X in his speeches in South Carolina .
Before a largely African - American audience , Obama used the terms “ bamboozled ” , “ hood - winked ” , and “ okie - doke . ”
These terms were made famous by Macolm X on the stump in his days with the Nation of Islam .
Obama is attempting to conjure that connection with the South Carolina audience to clue them in to the Clintons ’ tactics .
I guarantee he wo n’t use that lingo in front of whiter audiences because it wo n’t resonate the same way .
In this particular example , I watched as a handful of individuals in the background , and two in particular , laughed and rolled their eyes as he invoked the words of Malcolm .
They knew the deal .
Actually , Obama can borrow from Malcolm X in front of whiter audiences knowing it will sail overhead ( unless there are Spike Lee fans listening ) , just as heÃ‚Â borrowed “ Yes , we can ” as a slogan from the illegal immigration activists and Cesar Chavez without whiter audiences recognizing it .
Nevertheless , it is passing strange that a candidateÃ‚Â who belongs to an Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ AfrocentricÃ¢â‚
¬
Â church that bestows awards on Louis FarrakhanÃ‚Â would borrow from Malcolm X — who was a spokesman for the Nation of Islam — right before complaining about e-mails claiming he is Muslim .
Postmodern Unitarian Universalism
By Robert M. Price
In the gradual evolution of Protestant Theology toward the left , Unitarians and Universalists have played the role of the vanguard of the revolution .
Or , tIn other words , Unitarianism and Universalism have served as the cow - catcher on the front of the theological locomotive : they were the first to clash with and dispense with all the sacred cows , one by one .
The mainline denominations would catch up with them on point after point , followed even by the evangelical churches a few generations down the line , but Unitarians and Universalists had already cleared the rails for them .
Unitarians and Universalists early took aim at the doctrines of Hell and Trinitarianism .
With Nicene and Chalcedonian encumbrances thus sloughed off , they were free next to see new obstacles that stood in the way of " a free man 's worship " ( Bertrand Russell ) and to begin to chip away at these , too .
The centrality of Christology , even that of a safely Arian or merely human Christ , was the next bovine roadblock scooped off the track .
Theism yielded to mystical Transcendentalism , then to Religious Humanism , then to Secular Humanism .
Unitarian Universalists have decided that the truth is a moving target , or that the motion of the quest for the truth is itself the target : a way , not a destination .
In this article I will venture to show how Unitarian Universalism is well on the way into its next evolutionary stage : Postmodernism .
This may be more than an abstract exercise in abstract theological taxonomy ( or taxidermy ! ) .
In his recent article in these pages ( " Strained Bedfellows : Pagans , New Agers , and ' Starchy Humanists ' in Unitarian Universalism , " Religious Humanism , Vol. XXX , #s 1 & 2 , Winter / Spring 1996 , 7 - 29 ) , Richard Wayne Lee has documented the increasing influx of New Age thought and practice into once staid and rationalist Unitarian Universalism , as well as the turbulence this development has caused .
Lee does a fine job in explaining the change sociologically .
Here I seek but to add a philosophical perspective to his his compelling account , showing how , despite the fears of some that UUism is threatened with the loss of its historic identity , in fact , the shift Lee describes can be understood as the next logical stage of UU evolution along its natural trajectory of historical evolution .
What we are witnessing is the changeover from Modernism to Postmodernism in Unitarian Universalism .
­
Logocentrism Incarnate
What was the Christology Socinians rejected ?
It was the theological scheme that made the preincarnate Christ the Son of God , the divine Word , eternal in existence and partaking of the identical substance with the Father ( and the Spirit ) .
The Father made the world through the agency of the fully divine Son , the latter obedient to his Father 's every whim .
This divine Word appeared in the flesh to reveal the true doctrine of the Father and to gather his elect to his bosom , promising to take them out of this world to a heavenly mansion .
This he will someday accomplish at the final ­Parousia­ , or appearing , of the Word of God .
On that day we will spurn prophecy and fragmentary knowledge for a face - to - face encounter with the Truth .
Then all things shall be revealed , and those unbelievers who gladly accepted a lie in place of the truth will perish ignominiously .
The righteous will retire to the Camp of the Saints , where there shall no more be any tears .
And those without , all Jews and pagans and apostates , heretics , witches , and sinners , can go to Hell where they belong .
All this is what the Unitarians and their twins the Universalists ( two sharing one hypostasis­ ? ) meant to reject and what they paid a high price for rejecting , braving rack and stake .
To be more specific , they meant to deny the division of the divine monad , the exaltation of a mere man ( albeit a surpassingly great one ) as God , the unreasoning acquiescence in ancient dogma and superstition , and the bigotry of sectarianism .
Unitarianism and Universalism progressively followed the trajectory thus set with remarkable consistency .
The God thus rescued from Trinitarian refraction was then more thoroughly purged of irrational elements as the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob was happily traded for the more abstract deity of the philosophers and Deists .
Personalism succumbed to abstraction , the merely personal to the Superpersonality of the Absolute , the Oversoul .
At length Unitarians and Universalists heeded the prophet -cry of Ludwig Feuerbach and resolved henceforth to seek for the divine attributes where they might truly be found : in human nature , not in some imaginary projection of human perfections onto the heavens .
This progressive peeling of the divine onion led to the disclosure that there was no hard center .
But this discovery coincided perfectly with the Christ - trajectory .
As Christ had been thrust from his Nicene usurpation of the glory of the Father ( cf. Philippians 2:6 - 11 ! ) , he began to drop further and further down through the heavens till he became simply one of many saints and prophets in the Unitarian Universalist pantheon , just as we are told Julia Domna had a chapel containing statues of Abraham , Orpheus , Apollonius of Tyana , and Jesus of Nazareth .
But as Christ 's stock went down , that of normal human beings went up , and it was no coincidence .
The Son of Man , a Hebrew term originally denoting Everyman , had been usurped by the figure of Jesus of Nazareth , but now Everyman had wrested it back .
Without theism , Christology had turned into Anthropology .
Christocentrism became Anthropocentrism , even a kind of Anthroposophy ( with apologies to Rudolf Steiner ! ) .
Human nature was exalted , Protagoras ' dictum prevailing as the Unitarian Universalist creed : " Man is the measure of all things : of the things that are , that they are , and of the things that are not , that they are not . "
And this meant that Humanism was an alias of Rationalism , for it was the faculty of reasoning that made Homo Sapiens the crown of evolutionary perfection : both apex and ex-ape .
Enlightenment Rationalism found its religious home in Unitarianism - Universalism as nowhere else , though the Liberal Protestant theology of the nineteenth century and up to the Great War briefly caught up , only to retreat shortly thereafter to the comfortable irrationalism of Neo-Orthodoxy .
Unitarian Universalists remained the Righteous Remnant of Rationalism .
And one of the cardinal points of Enlightenment Rationalism was the belief that the reasonable person could occupy a God 's - eye - view perspective outside the arena of the warring creeds and cultures and perceive the rational - moral essence of them all , perhaps daring even to distill a " natural religion " from all of them .
Kant 's " religion within the boundaries of reason alone " was such an attempt , though John Locke and others had attempted it , too .
Universalism seems to have set out to be such a universal Esperanto of religion , perhaps not a syncretic mix but a synthetic abstraction of the various world faiths .
All that a religious Rationalist would consider the best .
" World Bibles " were compiled from this perspective , and they tended to major in ethics and Golden Rules with little theology in evidence .
Surely the Twin Tribes had journeyed far from the house of bondage and the fleshpots of supernaturalism and Trinitarianism .
But perhaps not so far after all .
Is it possible that they had secreted away certain cherished idols , carrying them with them on the way ?
I believe so , and it is the Postmodernist critique of Enlightenment modernity , as well as Jacques Derrida 's deconstruction of Western " presence metaphysics " that make it possible to detect this .
­ Presence Metaphysics­
Derrida has traced out the fundamental , sometimes unacknowledged axioms of what he calls presence metaphysics .
He begins with Plato and his belief that the mind is by nature a clear mirror apprehending the self - evident truth .
On the highest level of contemplation the trained mind , having polished its mirror to perfect clarity , beholds the essences and forms of things .
The apprehension of the light of truth is immediate , the mind having fled the allegorical cave where one only inferred and guessed at the truth , seeing only its shadows .
No , truth was deemed immediately present to the mind .
One simply saw it with the unimpaired eye of the mind .
Derrida ( in his seminal essay " Plato 's Pharmacy " ) next focuses on Plato 's polemic against writing as a medium of communication inferior to and subversive of vocal speech .
Only the latter , Plato insisted , can maintain and convey the immediacy of the speaker 's grasp of truth with an immediacy of its own .
That is , Plato says , the speaker can almost telepathically convey what he wants to say , what he knows , to the mind of the hearer by well chosen words sped on their way by means of appropriate facial expressions , tones of voice , oratorical flourishes , hand motions , opportunities to double back and explain .
The speaker , he says , is " the father of the word " and sends his utterance on its way to do its work .
The spoken word says " Father , I go , " and indeed goes .
But the written word , the tract , the treatise , the epistle , says , " Father , I go , " but then does not go .
That is , the written word , lacking the presence of the speaker , sent on its way like the community of Israel without the ark accompanying them , may be misconstrued , misinterpreted , misread by the hearer .
The writer tries to control the reading of the text , but ultimately he or she must cut it loose .
The authorial intent would be the authoritative intent , but it gets lost .
It can only be hypothetically reconstructed by the reader , who may never be able to consult the writer for confirmation .
Again , the written word is like the Prodigal , straying into far lands of dissolute pursuits , unintended readings , while the spoken word remains in earshot , faithfully carrying out the intention of the father , the speaker .
What the spoken word , the Living Word , ostensibly has that the written word lacks is the living presence of the speaker and thus the immediate presence of the truth the speaker knows .
Every written text is plagued by a built - in ambiguity of meaning that vitiates the meaning of any message .
Meaning is always a step ahead of us in a wild goose chase .
When we read , we decode , we wait to receive a message , even if we read with fluency and rapidity .
Meaning temporizes , only to appear later , if at all .
We turn from an obscure text wishing we could question the author , because we are sure the Truth would appear with the living word of the father , the author .
The true and objective meaning of a text , that programmed into it by the father of the word , the authoritative meaning of the author , is that truth aimed at by the language of the text .
It is a truth outside or above the text .
Rational , logical explication of the text should cause it to emerge .
All this Derrida calls logocentrism or the Metaphysics of Presence .
It is that set of assumptions which has allowed philosophers to exempt their discursive texts from the slings and arrows mere literature is heir to .
Philosophers have pretended to have immediate rational access to the Truth and to be able to communicate it to their students in speech , of if need be , in written texts , which strive to mirror speech , as when Plato , Berkeley , Hume and others adopt the dialogue format in their writings .
Naive in our confidence that what seems " clear and distinct " in our minds must be the truth ( Descartes ) , we believe we can trust our speculations , following in the footsteps of Descartes , Spinoza , and Leibniz who naively assumed they could reason out reality just as they systematized mathematics , optics , and grammar .
We assume the picture we paint inside our head mirrors the reality outside it .
Logocentrism has an architectonic bias as well .
It insists that the truth always be a symmetrical system of abstract propositions or axioms , and not , say , a narrative or an experience .
And we have limited patience with those who will not or cannot look at things the way we do : the truth seems so clear and distinct , so immediately present to us , we can only imagine our opponents are intellectually lazy or perverse .
If they will not step into the neutral commons of rational objectivity as we define it , we write them off as bigots and fundamentalists of this stripe or that .
Plato , remember , dreamed of an ideal Republic ruled by Truth - seeing philosopher kings who would not hesitate to execute heretics .
Rationalism , then , is an " ism , " a dogma , like all its competitors .
Derrida points the finger at Plato as the father of the logocentric tradition in Western philosophy , but he makes Christianity the highest exaltation of logocentrism , logocentrism incarnate , as it were .
The Creator God is quite literally the Father of the Word .
And the Word is God , which is to say that the order of knowing is imagined as being identical with the order of being , the central assumption of Presence Metaphysics .
The Platonic terms have been hypostatized , have become divine persons .
What are the divine hypostases but products of the hypostatization fallacy bemoaned by logicians ?
Every crucial element of the Christian salvation epic can be understood as a hypostatization of logocentric metaphysics .
When the Son of Man goes forth as the sower sowing the word of God , we have a dramatization of the Stoic doctrine of the ­spermatikoi logoi­ , the seeds of rational order permeating all things to give them their intelligible form .
This tendency reaches its utmost extreme in Valentinian Gnosticism , where the Demiurge seizes the sparks of divine light from the Pleroma , the Fullness of Divine Presence .
When Jesus , the Incarnate Word , silences the demons of madness because they know who he is , what we have is the attempt of logocentrism to suppress the truth that reason is but the tip of the iceberg that is madness .
When Jesus the Logos is exalted as the Pantocrator from whom all authority stems in heaven and on earth , what we are really dealing with is the exaltation of rationalism over all other forms of perception , and with the centered systematizing of reality according to the dictates of an architectonic system .
When belief in the gospel truth is made the criterion of salvation , we are saying that ideas and abstractions are the ultimate truth , the Water of Life which to imbibe is to attain unto the ultimate level of reality .
To say that human beings are made in the image of God is to project anthropocentric arrogance onto the cosmos , to say " reality is just like us . "
And it is no accident that logocentric Christian faith has been androcentric as well , male - centered .
Feminist critics speak of phallocentrism , the imposition of a male point of view as the filter of all thought and the embrace of it by women as a kind of false consciousness .
Derrida sees that phallocentrism and logocentrism are one , since the exaltation of reason ( or potentially anything else ) as the single center is a male tendency , a game of " King of the Hill , " where only a single victor is left standing as the most powerful .
Originally this was an evolutionary mechanism to assure the survival of the hardiest genes : the winner in the duel of suitors became the bull ape in charge of the herd with access to all the females .
All talk of a supreme value or meaning - center is " phallogocentrism " : a reflection of the victorious ape pounding its chest .
Christianity is completely phallogocentric .
If the eternal reason according to which all things were created is male , if the Word is the Son , then the universe is ipso facto defined in male terms .
And the notion of the Word being the true son , of one nature with the father , is simply the old male paternity anxiety , the care that one 's child be truly one 's own , one 's true - bred genetic stock , homoousias­ .
Nicea was male metaphysics from start to finish .
And the eschatology of Christianity ?
When the Parousia of the Logos appears ?
Here is the hope that meaning will finally issue from texts .
And it will be a male meaning : " He shall rule the nations with a rod of iron , " and what is that sceptre but the phallus of the Logos ?
Just as Christian Christology and theism were found wanting by earlier generations of Socinians , Arians , Unitarians , and Universalists , the presence metaphysics of logocentrism has been repudiated by a number of thinkers , especially Jacques Derrida .
Derrida attacks traditional presence metaphysics at many points .
Here are a few that I find most illuminating .
­ Against Logocentrism­
He mounts a frontal assault on the key assumption of Rationalism by denying Descartes 's claim that we truly know anything that is clearly and distinctly present to the conscious mind .
He is shattering what traditional philosophy sometimes called the mind as " the mirror of nature " ( cf. Richard Rorty , ­ Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature­ ) .
There is no pure and unadulterated presence .
There is no bare , uninterpreted reality which the mind is able to confront .
We always receive the world as inscribed with some prescribed grid of meaning .
What confronts us has already been mediated .
It stands always already at one remove from us , not really " present " to us at all .
What seems obvious to us only seems so because it is force - fed through culturally - prescribed categories and expectations .
There is no pure nature , for example , since " nature " is always a projection from culture , the hypothetical extrapolation of anthropologists or philosophers , and thus the " nature " against which culture is so often unfavorably measured is actually a function of the particular theorist 's philosophy or theory .
Even the experience of " the present moment " is not real , metaphysical presence .
It is instead ­derived­ , a product with visible seams , an experience stitched together ( as Dilthey already recognized ) from the past and the future .
The present moment would be a blank slate without echoes of our recollection of the past and anticipations of the future .
The " pure " present is actually a composite , the result of a hidden process of relation .
Ironically , St. Augustine 's attempt to explicate the timeless Eternal Present in which God must live demonstrates the impossibility of presence : Augustine says it must be something like his experience as he recites a familiar Psalm that he knows by heart .
He recalls the verses of it he has spoken , as their echoes linger , and he anticipates the parts of it he knows but has not yet reached .
So this ever - present now is not present at all , but rather a melding of past and future .
This fact of derivation , of having been derived , means that realities are ever deferred , always already at some remove from us .
The case is reminiscent of the criticism Plato leveled against writing , that the meaning is precisely not present to the reader , but ever threatens to stay one step ahead of him as a will - o'- the - wisp , ever leading us onward , phrase by phrase , sentence by sentence .
And this observation is crucial : the deferring factor , the distancing factor , what Derrida calls ­differance­ , is characteristic of reality as a whole .
Derrida denies that speech is exempt from the ­differance factor any more than writing is .
The speaker cannot be sure he will communicate his intention and very often does not , as any teacher or preacher knows .
The very advantage speech possesses over writing , the opportunity to backtrack and clarify , is itself evidence of the inherently ambiguous character of all language whether written or spoken .
Else why should clarification be necessary in the first place ?
The reason all language is ambiguous and indeterminate of meaning , despite the intention of the speaker / writer or the interpretation of the hearer / reader , is the differential nature of meaning .
We assume that the meaning of words is referential , words keyed to corresponding things .
But as Ferdinand de Saussure has argued , the meaning of words is primarily differential .
They are like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle .
The shape of each is determined by nothing other than its complementary difference from the adjacent pieces .
Words mean this because they do not mean that .
The signifier " apple " refers not so much to the familiar piece of fruit as its " signified , " but rather ( by way of negation ) to the meanings of signifiers like " pear , " " tomato , " " cantaloupe , " " apall , " " appeal , " or " ape . "
Signifiers receive their meanings by way of differentiation from the other possibilities that they might mean .
I can recognize my wife because of her uniqueness , i.e. , what differentiates her from all the other women I see .
The fact of ­differance­ has far - reaching implications , and not only for linguistics .
It implies two major things for theology .
First there can be no Transcendental Signified , no Reality , no Meaning beyond language , except perhaps meaningless prime matter of some sort , or some Buddhistic Suchness about which nothing can be said .
Second , there can be no Ground of Being , no " fundamental " or foundational meaning .
This is because every theory of the meaning of things is already infected with the virus of ­differance­ , the uncontrollable free play of language , the dissemination of meaning .
Every use of language unleashes uncontrollable forces of signification that threaten to undermine every intended meaning .
Meaning is never present to us , never has a Parousia , because it is always slipping away , draining off , into these cracks between possible meanings .
Indeed , this is just where Derrida 's controversial hermeneutics of Deconstruction arises .
Deconstruction traces out the countersignature of every text whereby it may be shown to argue at cross-purposes with it 's author 's intention .
Tillich came close to seeing how the very Ground of Being he liked to talk about was actually impossible when he defined Being as the affirmation of itself over against Non-Being .
In other words , it is grounded on the abyss of ­differance­ between itself and its opposite .
The earth , as Isaiah said , is hung upon the void .
If God is dead for Deconstruction , so is " Man , " Descartes 's " thinking thing , " the Invictus - self of the Enlightenment .
Postmodernists learn from Freud that what we call the self is actually the epiphenomenon of subterranean , never - experienced processes in the subconscious .
We form our self - concept as we hear our opinions spoken .
We are at least as much audience as actor , as George Herbert Meade and Peter Berger have also argued .
As writers we are readers of what our creative genius produces .
We are language speaking itself .
The self if the ­a posteriori­ perceiver , not the ­a priori­ actor .
Even the axioms of reason are the rules of a game imposed on the ambiguous chaos of the world .
The consistency of logic is the consistency of the rules of a game , tautologous , self - referential , the rules of the order of knowing , not necessarily of the order of being .
It is the logocentric bias that makes us think otherwise .
And the privilege of the supposedly neutral " common ground " from which superior Olympian position Enlightenment Man deigned to judge and mediate all cultures and beliefs turns out to be merely one more among many competing plausibility structures .
Having no common ground with rival paradigms , such as the epistemology of militant Islam , of Flat - Earthism or National Socialism , it cannot possibly demonstrate its superiority to them .
Indeed it becomes meaningless to claim superiority over them .
­ Postmodern Unitarian Universalism­
Unitarian Universalism seems to be the very incarnation of the Enlightenment paradigm of Rationalism , Humanism , and Logocentrism .
And even more ironically , insofar as Chalcedonian Christology was simply a hypostatization of logocentric presence metaphysics , ­rationalistic Humanism remains essentially just as Chalcedonian as Orthodox Christianity­ .
To finally purify itself of Chalcedonianism , to purge itself at long last from every vestige of Athanasian Christological dogma , Unitarian Universalist theology must needs empty itself too of Rationalism , Humanism , and its bias toward a single " unitarian " synthesis point , or Ultimate Concern .
" ­Uni­versalism " must give way to multiversalism or pluriversalism .
And that , I contend , is precisely what is happening with the emergence of New Age , Christian , Pagan , Jewish , and Buddhist factions within Unitarian Universalism .
Breaking the hegemony of logocentrism means that there can be no one orthodoxy , and of course Unitarian Universalists have long upheld diversity and pluralism in doctrine .
Similarly , the " Unitarian " tag long ago lost the connotation of that monotheism its adherents once sought to free from Trinitarian confusions .
Humanism made the monotheistic meaning of " Unitarian " obsolete .
Many Unitarians decided the One God was a much a groundless figment of priestcraft as the Three had been .
And now the Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans represent an altogether different approach to breaking the monotheistic hammer lock .
They seek to restore the polytheism of ancient Israel , banished from the canon by late phallogocentrist editors .
There is a lesson for Universalists in Paul M. van Buren 's suggestion that , in the wake of the " dissolution of the Absolute , " it is only out of habit that we speak of a ' universe ' at all .
It really depends on how you approach it , we might say , for the ' universe ' of one discipline is but the background or a detail for another .
All things considered , it appears to be more appropriate to speak of a polyverse .
( ­ Theological Explorations­ , p. 39 )
Need we trouble ourselves anymore to define a synthetic harmony of all truth because there is the prefix " uni - " in our trademark ?
It might be better to follow Van Buren 's lead and treat the world as making no one single definitive sense apart from the many different viewpoints from which we and others may view it .
Today a rapidly increasing number of Unitarian Universalists feel the need to transcend ( as Schleiermacher , Emerson , and Parker did ) the sometimes dry moralism of Kant 's " religion within the bounds of reason alone , " lacking any mystical , spiritual dimension .
Many , as Kenneth Patton did , embrace what some call " ecstatic naturalism , " where it is the divine spirit , as Feuerbach said , manifest in human arts and glories that catches away the breath and catches one up to the third heaven .
The poems of Rilke and Hölderlin are good examples of ecstatic naturalism , fragments of true inspiration , where the Muse of the subconscious far transcends left - brained rationalism .
All this represents , not a repudiation of reason , far from it , but rather a dethronement of logocentrism .
When logocentrism reigns no more , one can feel free to explore spiritual experiences without having to explain them and to account for them first .
One need only approach them in the spirit of phenomenology , bracketing the ontological question , temporarily and willingly suspending disbelief as one does in a playhouse or a movie theatre .
One may navigate the experience ­as­ an experience , whatever may or may not lie " behind " it .
As Nagarjuna said , one need not despise that which one suspects to be ultimately phantasmal , so long as one does not mistake it for more than a pleasant phantom .
Reason and rational scrutiny must remain our first line of defense against the resurgent superstition of much of the New Age Movement ( and here he continues proudly to play our role as sentinels against religious hokum and priestcraft ) .
But we will heed the advice of Paul Feyerabend and embrace the methodological axiom of " counter - inductivity , " exploring hypotheses ( in this case , religious experiences ) not derivable from or even consistent with our base - line theoretical model of rationalism .
We may , for example , insist on historical criticism as applied to the miracle - legends of the biblical text , yet be open to visionary experiences ourselves .
The same open - ended , distinctly un-synthesized pluralism seems to mark the emerging UU stance toward the various historic world religions .
There is no urgency to figure out a synthesis , an abstraction of what we deem the essence of all the religions ( which no single religion would recognize or accept ) , or to form a syncretism , a new super - religion collecting parts of this and that and hybridizing them into a new system , as the New Age Movement does .
Rather , UU ministers and congregations , in their experiments with Sufism or Zen , seem to have adopted the principle of ­ bricolage­ .
This term for the unsystematic ad hoc technique of the handyman who patches and contrives a solution from whatever odd bits he may have available , has been adopted by Claude Levi-Strauss and Jacques Derrida to denote the use of leftover techniques , individual ideas or methodologies , from systems that have , as wholes , been deconstructed and dismantled , much as Newton was able to salvage parts of Kepler 's earlier paradigm .
In our case ­bricolage­ seems to mean the jury - rigging of whatever spiritual practices or ideas happen to appeal to us , with no attempt to form any kind of comprehensive system .
Without logocentric presuppositions , no synthetic system of truth is desirable or possible , so why waste time building one ?
In the wake of the wreck of all systems of knowledge , one can only pick up what glittering bits of debris as catch one 's eye , like a magpie decorating her nest .
The abandonment of Humanism is perhaps the bitterest pill to swallow , as witness the rancor documented by Richard Wayne Lee .
Perhaps we need only speak of a chastened Humanism , just as Henry Pitney van Dusen once spoke of a chastened Liberalism in the wake of Neo -Orthodoxy .
Indeed I see no retreat from our Protagorean axiom " Humanity is the measure of all things . "
In fact , in light of the Postmodernist disclosure of the self as a rhetorical construct , this maxim might take on a new meaning .
True , we can no longer flatter ourselves simply to be Descartes 's " thinking thing , " a pure mirror that sees the light of truth undimmed .
Perhaps we might rather adopt some sort of Buddhist " no- self " doctrine .
We are less like Aristotle 's " thought thinking itself " ( Descartes 's self concept was pretty much a microcosmic miniature of this God-concept ) than " language speaking itself . "
We are listeners as well as speakers in the same moment , passive in the very moment of activity .
We do not measure by use of sovereign reason ; rather we are the measuring rod , a tool both of language and of the coded text of the subconsciousness that incarnates language .
We must learn to read ourselves .
The last frontier is within , that vast ocean of text of which the human self is the epiphenomenon .
Humanism , then , is not the sovereign judgment by human selves of everything else .
Rather , " the proper study of mankind is man . "
We must advance to square one as Socrates did , to admit our unwisdom before true wisdom can be ours .
We are not blank slates , much less polished mirrors .
We are clay tablets already inscribed to the margins , palimpsests with many layers of inscription .
We must get down to business decoding that text .
And what if that were the best way to understand the continual self - examination beloved of UUs ?
Instead of denoting a failure of nerve , a loss of mission , what if it denoted an altogether proper turn inward ?
In the course of the present essay I have suggested that , thanks to the disclosures of the Postmodernist deconstruction of Presence Metaphysics , we can recognize that in their very embrace of Rationalism , Humanism , a unity of Ultimate Concern and a universal faith , Unitarian Universalism retained the essence of the Nicene - Chalcedonian Christo - theology it sought to reject .
The most illuminating way to understand the current shift to neo-Christian , pagan , New Age and other spiritualities in the UU camp is as a natural and inevitable transition to a Postmodernist stance , the next logical step in the ongoing evolution of Unitarian Universalism .
The findings have implications beyond blogging , according to Pew , because bloggers are “ much more likely to engage in other content - creating activities than nonblogging teens . ”

But even though girls surpass boys as Web content creators , the imbalance among adults in the computer industry remains .
Women hold about 27 percent of jobs in computer and mathematical occupations , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
In American high schools , girls comprised fewer than 15 percent of students who took the AP computer science exam in 2006 , and there was a 70 percent decline in the number of incoming undergraduate women choosing to major in computer science from 2000 to 2005 , according to the National Center for Women & Information Technology .
Scholars who study computer science say there are several reasons for the dearth of women : introductory courses are often uninspiring ; it is difficult to shake existing stereotypes about men excelling in the sciences ; and there are few female role models .
It is possible that the girls who produce glitters today will develop an interest in the rigorous science behind computing , but some scholars are reluctant to draw that conclusion .
“ We can hope that this translates , but so far the gap has remained , ” said Jane Margolis , an author of “ Unlocking the Clubhouse : Women in Computing ” ( MIT Press , 2002 ) .
While pleased that girls are mastering programs like Paint Shop Pro , Ms. Margolis emphasized the profound distinction between using existing software and a desire to invent new technology .
Teasing out why girls are prolific Web content creators usually leads to speculation and generalization .
Although girls have outperformed boys in reading and writing for years , according to the National Center for Education Statistics , this does not automatically translate into a collective yen to blog or sign up for a MySpace page .
Rather , some scholars argue , girls are the dominant online content creators because both sexes are influenced by cultural expectations .
Green Party holds presidential debate in San Francisco CAMPAIGN 2008 5 candidates seeking party 's nomination agree on nearly everything during debate , to raucous approval of 800 in attendance
Rep. Cynthia McKinney , D - Ga. , is shown during a news conference in Atlanta , Monday , April 3 , 2006 .
When McKinney returned to Congress in 2004 , friends and foes saw a quieter , more amiable version of the lawmaker who once suggested the Bush White House had prior knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks .
But now , as she aggressively defends herself for scuffling with a Capitol police officer , it is clear the makeover did n't last long .

Withdraw from Iraq immediately .
Eliminate the No Child Left Behind law .
Legalize marijuana .
Those were just some of the goals stated by candidates at the Green Party presidential debate Sunday in San Francisco .
About 800 people of varying ages , economic backgrounds and political parties attended the " Presidential Debate that Matters " at the Herbst Theatre , where the five Green presidential hopefuls spent more time agreeing with one another than actually debating .
" We 're not so much against each other as we are for each other , " said one of the candidates , Kent Mesplay , an environmental engineer who also ran for the Green Party nomination in 2004 .
" We have to be because by no means is ( the two - party system ) a level playing field . "
The nearly three - hour event was co-moderated by " Peace Mom " Cindy Sheehan and KPFA radio host Aimee Allison , who allowed the candidates timed answers to questions about the war in Iraq , illegal immigration , the farm bill and health care , among other subjects .
Nearly every answer was greeted with nods of agreement from the other candidates waiting their turns and by roars of applause from the audience , giving the forum a pep rally feeling .
Bay Area elected officials who are Green Party members - including Richmond Mayor Gayle McLaughlin , San Francisco Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi and San Francisco Board of Education member Mark Sanchez - also took the lecturn , urging the crowd to see the Green Party as the most progressive political option and not as a wasted vote .
" Please .
This is serious .
This is not a joke .
This is about starting a real movement in this country , " said candidate Cynthia McKinney to a standing ovation .
The former Democratic congresswoman from Georgia who converted to the Green Party last year was , at one point during the debate , acknowledged as the front - runner .
The party 's presidential nominee will be selected in July in Chicago .
The other three candidates included Jared Ball , a hip - hop scholar and assistant professor of communications at Morgan State University in Baltimore ; Kat Swift , a 34 - year - old dread - locked activist from San Antonio who said she will " be just old enough to be president by the time of the next election " ; and actor and filmmaker Jesse Johnson from West Virginia .
Getting the Green Party candidate on the ballot in every state is the priority , according to the candidates , who repeatedly urged the audience to register Green after the debate .
" Can the Green Party get beyond being blamed for Bush coming into power ? " asked Mesplay , sarcastically referring to the argument that the Green Party takes votes away from Democrats .
" We 're not the ones who spoiled the American vote .
Bush is . "
The candidates ' answers ranged from dramatic sound bites to simple solutions .
When asked about the farm bill , Swift 's answer was not that of a typical politician :
" I 'm not familiar with the details of the farm bill .
From what I 've heard from farmers is that it does n't work .
I would get farmers together and ask them for the answers . "
Ralph Nader , the 2000 Green Party presidential nominee who has yet to announce his intentions for 2008 , was scheduled to participate in Sunday 's debate , but he did not .
Nader showed up late for the event and addressed the crowd for about 10 minutes .
Former San Francisco mayoral candidate and Green Party member Matt Gonzalez was scheduled to co-moderate the event but could not make it due to illness , according to event spokesman Cress Vellucci .
Gonzalez received the loudest applause when his name was announced as one of several elected officials from the Green Party .
At least three hecklers who interrupted the forum also received a few claps of approval .
The event was organized in the past month by several Bay Area Green Party activists who spread the word through advertisements in local weekly newspapers and on Air America Radio .
About 760 paid the $ 10 to $ 20 suggested donation to attend the forum , while an additional 50 to 100 got in free , according to Vellucci .
Mini Kahlon , a 38 - year - old San Francisco resident , came to the event at the suggestion of a friend .
" I had hoped for a higher caliber of interaction on the issues , " said Kahlon .
" There was a lot more cheerleading than I had expected .
But I like the idea of a debate that does n't only include Democrats and Republicans . "
Video : Congressman makes the case for censuring George W. Bush Michael Roston
Published : Thursday July 12 , 2007 Print This Email This A Florida Democrat presented his case in a Tuesday hearing of the House Judiciary Committee on why be believed Congress should censure President George W. Bush for his commutation of the jail sentence of I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby .
" Congress must go on record against the President 's actions , " said Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) in the hearing on the President 's clemency power in the Constitution .
" Censure in my mind would be a strong statement to the President from Congress and from the American people that his decision to reward loyalty to the American people is wrong , and will not be tolerated . "
Wexler introduced H. Res. 530 , ' Censuring President Bush , ' into the House of Representatives on Monday .
The bill currently has 16 co-sponsors .
Wexler 's bill seeks to " condemn [ President Bush 's ] decision to commute the portion of Mr. Libbys sentence that required him to spend thirty months in prison , his unconscionable abuse of his authority with regard to the deceitful chain of events concerning the falsifying of intelligence on Iraqi nuclear capabilities and the exaggeration of the threat posed by Iraq , his involvement in the clear political retaliation against former Ambassador and Ms. Wilson , and his decision to reward the perjury of Mr. Libby , which effectively protected President Bush , Vice President Cheney , and other Administration officials from further scrutiny . "
Wexler 's motion is not the first censure bill introduced to Congress .
In 2006 , Senator Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) sought to censure Bush for his administration 's domestic spying program .
The full text of the motion is available at Rep.
Wexler 's website .
A clip of Wexler making the case for his censure bill , posted by his office , is presented below . #
Maybe you 've heard rumors about an explosive newspaper expose on a major political figure that would rock the political world just as the presidential voting is about to begin .
We have n't either .
But we do know that today is when this newspaper blows the top off of the Ron Paul Conspiracy , that vast unorganized protest movement that has silently become one of the more interesting political phenomena of the current election season .
A Times reporter -- we 'll call him James Rainey to protect his identity -- has managed to penetrate the Paul presidium .
In his story he recounts for the very first time the shockingly ordinary details of a movement of thousands of disparate , dissatisfied people , some of whom want an end to the Iraq war , an end to gun controls and the IRS , an end to laws banning marijuana and a return to the gold standard , whatever that means .
These Paulites believe the government has been hijacked by a bevy of big interests that threaten the freedoms of ordinary Americans .
They 're not going to take it anymore .
Locally , they 're even organizing a re-enactment of a brazenly defiant act , the BostonTea Party , except it 'll be in Santa Monica and wo n't involve tea or white people dressed as Indians .
And the protestors promise not to leave anything foreign floating in the water .
These committed partisans , bonded by their suspicion of authority and venal influences like the mainstream media that ignored them until they did something , have united behind a 72 - year - old ...

Right , but I think the point of the article was not whether they make it to your Inbox , but that only 5 % - 10 % of the email traversing the Internet is legitimate email .

I 've never sent a single email with it , and forgot about it .

The more spam Gmail users report the better Gmail gets .
I got Gmail when it first came out ( Beta ) and they said to report spam so the system will reject it in the future .
More intuitive than Yahoo .
The only " spam " I get is from Hillary Clinton even though I 've opted out numerous times .

Not really -- your plan is based on the upstream ISP actually giving a damn about zombie machines .
Ever tried to contact someone at Comcast or another large ISP 's abuse desk ?

Also , lots of spam bots do n't follow RFCs and wo n't bother retrying an address that fails for any reason , hard or soft .

More like 98 % of e-mail traffic is spam here Our small company has used Roaring Penguin 's Canit Software since December 2005 .
In the last 7 days , out of ~94,000 messages received
* ~1500 were valid e-mail
* ~ 800 were viruses pishes and spam
The balance ( the vast majority ) were rejections due to invalid recepients from dictionary attacks .
In our case , 98.5 % of the traffic our mail server sees can be considered to be spam .

It 's difficult to stop spam at the source when it originates in a country that is either too poor to concern themselves about regulating the ISPs in the area , or simply do n't care .

But yes , I have the same gripe .
Especially when you have a LOT of spam in the spam folder that you must go through just to find a legit email .
Especially when you really HAVE to find THAT particular email .
Like when you join some group or forum and need to activate an account and can only do so through that email .. and you never got it and suspect it is in your spam folder .. and you have over a few hundred to check through .. grr !!

Pittsfield , MA kd6cae Member the purpose of spam ?
For some time , I 've been trying to figure out the reasoning behind why Spammers do what they do , and I can't find a logical reason for so much spam being out there .
I 'm certainly not interested in any viagra or crap like that that 's all spam seems to be .
However , I 've accepted that spam is a necessary evil of email , and I 'd rather get spam than potentially miss important legit email caught by spam filters .
That said I 'm amazed Gmail works so well , why does n't Yahoo and other providers filter as well as Gmail ?

But even with all the expenses involved in printing and postage , that meager - looking one - or - two percent response rate makes for a profitable enterprise .
The attraction of spam is that all of the overhead associated with printing and postage is done away with .
To say nothing of a greater reach via dictionary attacks .
And , no , I 'm not saying that I endorse this .
I 'm just telling you that those Viagra and " boost your equipment " mails are n't necessarily directed at you , but at the one ( maybe two ) guy (s ) out of 100 who * do* respond to that kind of crap .
Spam is little different than Direct Mail in terms of the anticipated response .
What I mean is : people who conduct a Direct Mail ( junk snail mail ) campaign do n't expect more than a one - or - two percent response to what they send out ( i.e one or two replies for every * hundred * envelopes they mail out ) .

UK sbillis Member 95 % way too low !
Our mail scanners reject 80 % of all connections to them due to the ip issues and then of the remaining 20 % of the connections that we allow mail from , we trash more than 99 % of the mail .
We spend $ $ $ $$ on anti-spam tools and huge amounts of time .
I would love to be able to spend that money and time doing better things .
Working in Lisp would be for me a dream job .
This is what I ’ve done for the last some 6 years , but the last about 2 years were not that exciting any more , to say the least …
Could you refill my Lisp cup ?
I ’m thirsty , and your ad gives me hopes .
I live in Switzerland , but I would consider relocation for the right job .
On another hand , as I live alone , and as I am grandly supplied both with computing equipment , and with a broadband connection , one could say that my working environment at home would be ideal … working an undefined number of hours a day , any number of days a week , be it at noon or at midnight .
The appetite is there , I would say that the intelligence is also where it should be .
If you would be ready to consider that …
If all this appeals to you , then I stand ready to send you my CV , plus a list of significant projects in an ( admittedly ) long career .
Do n’t worry about my age ( 61 ) , I guarantee that it is purely biological ; it has nothing to do with my mind .

An exiled Bangladeshi author accused of insulting Islam will be allowed to stay in India , it emerged yesterday , but only if she remains in a government flat at a secret location in Delhi , unable to receive visitors or step outside .
India 's foreign ministry justified the conditions saying that as a " guest " Taslima Nasrin , 45 , should not " undertake actions that could hurt the sentiments of the many communities that make up our multi-religious and multi-ethnic nation " .
Nasrin fled her adopted home of Kolkata in November after Muslims protested against " anti-Islamic " passages in her works .
The rioting ended only when the army was deployed in the city - and she was forced to flee .
Nasrin told the Guardian she had been told her residency permit would be extended , just days before it expired , but for an unspecified time .
Her only company is a television and her laptop .
" I can not live a normal life like this .
[ Officials ] said because if I went outside 10 people would die in riots .
I do n't believe them , " said Nasrin .
" I want to stay in India but I do n't know how long they will allow me to remain . "
She said she was a " prisoner without prisoner rights " .
" I get food and medicines brought to me .
It is prison food .
I want prisoners ' rights .
Let me have visiting hours , " she said .
Lawyers yesterday questioned whether such conditions were legal .
Indira Jaisingh , a supreme court lawyer , said the government had probably used a 1946 act to restrict the writer 's movements .
" I think it is almost certainly illegal and could be challenged in the courts , " she said .
" The act is usually used for criminals wanted by the police .
Here it has been used pre-emptively but not proportionately .
The constitution guarantees freedom of life and liberty to anyone on Indian soil . "
An international group of writers have urged the government to give Nasrin permanent residency .
" There seems to be a lack of political will to do anything about her situation , " said British novelist Hari Kunzru .
" The Indian government is trying to kick this problem into the long grass rather than deal with its responsibility to uphold freedom of expression . "
Nasrin , who has lived in India since 2000 , has been targeted by Muslim groups in the past six months over her autobiography Dwikhandita in which she commented on the relationship the prophet Muhammad had with his wives and also said the Qur'an advised against friendships with non-Muslims .
The book was recalled and the passages deleted at the end of last year .
" [ Dwikhandita ] was basically defaming the prophet , " said Muhammad Anwer , spokesman for the Jamiat Ulama - i- Hind which runs Islamic religious schools in India .
" It is best she is forgotten about . "

Putin Orders Russian Military Forces To Attack US Forces During Iran Invasion
By : Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers
Russian Military Analysts are reporting today that President Putin has issued orders to the Russian Interior Ministry to ‘ immediately ’ dispatch Spetsnaz ( Special Forces ) troops to Iran to protect ‘ vital ’ Russian assets , including the Bushehr Nuclear power plant .
These reports state that this order from President Putin to the Interior Ministry includes the phrase , “ against any and all hostile forces ” , and which analysts state is a direct threat to US and Israeli Forces currently massing for their planned attack and invasion of Iran .
According to these reports , President Putin was ‘ strongly ’ lobbied by Saudi Arabia to create a ‘ buffer ’ against further US aggression in the Gulf Region , and which the Saudi King in his talks with President Putin this week stated his belief that the United States after attacking Iran would then set its sites upon his oil rich nation .
The fears of Saudi Arabia about an American takeover of their oil fields was further confirmed this week with the pronouncements of US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns to end US oil purchases from Venezuela , and which would leave only the Saudi Kingdom able to make up the difference in lost oil to the Americans .
President Putin in his speech before the Munich Security Conference this past week further warned the United States against its planned military expansion , and as we can read :
" It is world in which there is one master , one sovereign .
And at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system , but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within .
And this certainly has nothing in common with democracy .
Because , as you know , democracy is the power of the majority in light of the interests and opinions of the minority .
Incidentally , Russia – we – are constantly being taught about democracy .
But for some reason those who teach us do not want to learn themselves .
I consider that the unipolar model is not only unacceptable but also impossible in today ’s world .
And this is not only because if there was individual leadership in today ’s – and precisely in today ’s – world , then the military , political and economic resources would not suffice .
What is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilisation .
Along with this , what is happening in today ’s world – and we just started to discuss this – is a tentative to introduce precisely this concept into international affairs , the concept of a unipolar world .
And with which results ?
Unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems .
Moreover , they have caused new human tragedies and created new centres of tension .
Judge for yourselves : wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished .
Mr Teltschik mentioned this very gently .
And no less people perish in these conflicts – even more are dying than before .
Significantly more , significantly more !
Today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force – military force – in international relations , force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts .
As a result we do not have sufficient strength to find a comprehensive solution to any one of these conflicts .
Finding a political settlement also becomes impossible .
We are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law .
And independent legal norms are , as a matter of fact , coming increasingly closer to one state ’s legal system .
One state and , of course , first and foremost the United States , has overstepped its national borders in every way . "
Virtually unknown to the American peoples themselves are that their Military Leaders plans do not call for a World based upon democratic ideals , but are instead based upon the ancient Roman model of establishing American based protectorates around the Globe to insure the survival of the United States against both Russia and China , and who their Defense Secretary recently warned the US Congress :
" We need the full range of military capabilities , " including ground combat forces to battle large armies and nimble special operations troops to scout out terrorist threats , Gates told the House Armed Services Committee .
" We do n't know what 's going to develop in places like Russia and China , in North Korea , in Iran and elsewhere . "
Russia has reacted harshly to the Americans by demanding an explanation for the stance being taken by their War Leaders , and as we can read :
" Moscow has demanded Washington ’s explanation of the U.S. defense secretary ’s Wednesday statement on uncertain prospects of developments in Russia , North Korea , Iran and China , a Russian foreign ministry spokesman said Monday .
Robert Gates said Wednesday the United States needs forces to combat big armies and special units to counter terrorism as he is unaware what may develop in such countries as Russia , North Korea , Iran and China . "
Aside from the United States war zones , and where in Iraq , Afghanistan and Somalia the political control rests with powerful militias and warlords , the ‘ model ’ the Americans are building for their allies is based solely on powerful dictators and not free and fair elections , and as we can see evidenced by : Egypt , and which is ruled by President for Life Mubarak ; Pakistan , ruled by Military Dictator Mushaffaf ; Jordan , ruled by King ; Saudi Arabia , ruled by King ; Gulf States , all ruled by Kings .
Most ironic about the despotic Muslim states supported and financed by the Americans is that the only 2 Muslim nations that have held free and fair elections , Iran and Lebanon , have suffered the full rage and anger of the United States and its allies .
Fears for the American people are further raised in these reports due the United States Militaries preparing to open their vast concentration camps in the American Southwest regions , and which reports from America show the preparations being made for the American , British and Germany troops being raised to guard these camps :
" The Pentagon has awarded nearly $ 1 million to the city of El Paso to help prepare for the arrival of thousands of new troops at Fort Bliss .
Democratic Representative Silvestre Reyes , who heads the House Intelligence Committee , announced the grant Monday .
The money from the Defense Department 's Office of Economic Adjustment will help pay for housing , utilities , education , public safety , health and social services .
The award comes as Congress is fighting a Thursday deadline to pass a spending bill to keep the federal government operating .
The bill has been under debate amid Republican complaints that the legislation does n't include enough money for Base Closing and Realignment work this year .
The bill provides $ 2.5 billion for that work , but some Republicans want more .
Fort Bliss is due to receive 20,000 troops , plus family members , over several years . "
As President Putin has urged the American War Leaders ' not to pose as Lord God ' , he has also reminded the Russian people that " Russia ’s religion and nuclear weapons are equally important for the national security " .
It is with much sadness that we have to report today that the American War Leaders are not heeding the warnings of President Putin , and in not doing so are plunging our entire World towards the abyss .

Now that all those ‘ famous quotes of 2007 ’ are coming out , people are replaying the answer of Caitlin Upton , a contestant for Miss Teen USA from South Carolina to a question during her pageant .
The exchange went like this :
Question : Recent polls have shown a fifth of Americans can’t locate the United States on a world map .
Why do you think this is ?
Miss Teen South Carolina : “ I personally believe the U.S. Americans are unable to do so because , uh , some , uh …people out there in our nation do n’t have maps , and , uh , I believe that our education like such as South Africa and , uh , the Iraq everywhere like , such as and … I believe that they should , our education over here in the U.S. should help the U.S. , err , uh , should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries , so we will be able to build up our future for our …
Although the answer was painful to watch just because Ms. Upton was so obviously stricken at that moment with stage fright , I actually think her answer had some merit .
First of all , I liked her diction , “ U.S. Americans . ”
After all , everyone in North and South America could legitimately be called an “ American ” .
That we in the United States have appropriated this descriptor for ourselves is quite unfair to Canadians , Mexicans and Argentineans , e.g .
Second , her answer about why one fifth of Americans cannot find the U.S.A. on a map is almost certainly quite correct .
It is because they do n’t have maps in their homes and have not been taught to read them .
The bottom fifth of Americans in income goes to under - funded schools , and many of them are functionally illiterate .
The rich in the US do not bear their fair share of education costs , because the main unit for school taxation is the local district .
Since poor people can’t afford to live in wealthy suburbs , and congregate together in poor districts , their schools are starved of money .
Third , although she did not state it very eloquently , she was correct to point out that Americans do not only need to find the United States on the map .
They need to know where South Africa and Iraq are , as well .
In fact , that she chose those two is interesting .
One , South Africa , is an example of fairly successful movement from an authoritarian state dominated by one ethnicity to a multicultural form of democracy .
The other , Iraq , is also making a transition from authoritarianism and domination by a single ethnicity ( the Sunni Arabs of Saddam Hussein ) , but its passage to multiculturalism and parliamentary rule has been violent and turbulent .
The difference is South Africa ’s attention to national reconciliation and also that South Africa ’s movement was indigenous rather than imposed from the outside .
She is correct that the U.S. Americans should help Iraqis , especially with regard to education .
The U.S. Americans have helped create 1.5 million Iraqi refugees in Syria , whose children are not getting educated and cannot find things on the map .
So I find the underlying emphases in her answer to be very admirable and progressive in their implications .
Some of the response to her answer surely derives from simple bigotry .
She is a southerner , a blonde , and a beauty queen .
But a southern accent is not , as most northerners mistakenly believe , a sign of ignorance .
Hair color , like skin color , indicates nothing about a person except that their ancestors lived 13,000 years in a place with a particular rate of ultraviolet exposure .
And , good - looking people suffer a lot from spite in US society , which shows emotional lack of maturity on the part of those of us less fortunate in the symmetry department .
Ms. Upton ’s appearance on NBC ’s Today Show ( below ) reveals a bright and articulate person .
Ms. Upton is interested in graphic design and a career in media , and I am sure she will have the last laugh on the assemblage of clueless losers who have been making fun of her , who lack her accomplishments and decency .
And , I hope that all U.S. Americans take to heart her values , and find ways to help improve education in this country about international affairs , and ways to help ensure that a whole generation of Iraqis displaced by our war does not grow up illiterate .

Zimbardo : Abu Ghraib was under bombardment all the time .
In the prison , five soldiers and 20 Iraqi prisoners get killed .
That means automatically any soldier working there is under high fear and high stress .
Then the insurgency starts in 2003 , and they start arresting everyone in sight .
When Chip Frederick [ starts working at Abu Ghraib ] in September , there are 200 prisoners there .
Within three months there 's a thousand prisoners with a handful of guards to take care of them , so they 're overwhelmed .
Frederick and the others worked 12 - hour shifts .
How many days a week ?
Seven .
How many days without a day off ?
Forty .
That kind of stress reduces decision - making and critical thinking and rationality .
But that 's only the beginning .
Wired :
You were an expert defense witness in the court - martial of Sgt. Chip Frederick , an Abu Ghraib guard .
What were the situational influences in his case ?
Understanding the reason for someone 's behavior is not the same as excusing it .
Understanding why somebody did something — where that why has to do with situational influences — leads to a totally different way of dealing with evil .
It leads to developing prevention strategies to change those evil - generating situations , rather than the current strategy , which is to change the person .
Situations can be sufficiently powerful to undercut empathy , altruism , morality and to get ordinary people , even good people , to be seduced into doing really bad things — but only in that situation .
Philip Zimbardo : No . People are always personally accountable for their behavior .
If they kill , they are accountable .
However , what I 'm saying is that if the killing can be shown to be a product of the influence of a powerful situation within a powerful system , then it's as if they are experiencing diminished capacity and have lost their free will or their full reasoning capacity .
Wired :
Your work suggests that we all have the capacity for evil , and that it 's simply environmental influences that tip the balance from good to bad .
Does n't that absolve people from taking responsibility for their choices ?
He spoke with Wired.com about what Abu Ghraib and his prison study can teach us about evil and why heroes are , by nature , social deviants .
Zimbardo conducted a now - famous experiment at Stanford University in 1971 , involving students who posed as prisoners and guards .
Five days into the experiment , Zimbardo halted the study when the student guards began abusing the prisoners , forcing them to strip naked and simulate sex acts .
The Abu Ghraib prison made international headlines in 2004 when photographs of military personnel abusing Iraqi prisoners were published around the world .
Seven soldiers were convicted in courts martial and two , including Specialist Lynndie England , were sentenced to prison .
In March 2006 , Salon.com published 279 photos and 19 videos from Abu Ghraib , one of the most extensive documentations to date of abuse in the notorious prison .
Zimbardo claims , however , that many images in his video — which he obtained while serving as an expert witness for an Abu Ghraib defendant — have never before been published .
Zimbardo will speak Thursday afternoon at the TED conference , where he plans to illustrate his points by showing a three - minute video , obtained by Wired.com , that features many previously unseen photographs from the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq ( disturbing content ) .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
As an expert witness in the defense of an Abu Ghraib guard , Philip Zimbardo had access to many imagesof abuse taken by the guards .
His TED presentation puts together a short video of some of the unpublished photos , with sound effects added by Zimbardo .
Many of the images are explicit and gruesome , depicting nudity , degradation , simulated sex acts and guards posing with corpses .
Viewer discretion is advised .
Wired : How did what happened at Abu Ghraib compare to your Stanford prison study ?
Zimbardo :
The military intelligence , the CIA and the civilian interrogator corporation , Titan , told the MPs [ at Abu Ghraib ] , " It is your job to soften the prisoners up .
We give you permission to do something you ordinarily are not allowed to do as a military policeman — to break the prisoners , to soften them up , to prepare them for interrogation . "
That 's permission to step across the line from what is typically restricted behavior to now unrestricted behavior .
In the same way in the Stanford prison study , I was saying [ to the student guards ] , " You have to be powerful to prevent further rebellion . "
I tell them , " You 're not allowed , however , to use physical force . "
By default , I allow them to use psychological force .
In five days , five prisoners are having emotional breakdowns .
The situational forces that were going on in [ Abu Ghraib ] — the dehumanization , the lack of personal accountability , the lack of surveillance , the permission to get away with anti-social actions — it was like the Stanford prison study , but in spades .
Those sets of things are found any time you really see an evil situation occurring , whether it 's Rwanda or Nazi Germany or the Khmer Rouge .
Wired :
But not everyone at Abu Ghraib responded to the situation in the same way .
So what makes one person in a situation commit evil acts while another in the same situation becomes a whistle - blower ?
Zimbardo :
There 's no answer , based on what we know about a person , that we can predict whether they 're going to be a hero whistle - blower or the brutal guard .
We want to believe that if I was in some situation [ like that ] , I would bring with it my usual compassion and empathy .
But you know what ?
When I was the superintendent of the Stanford prison study , I was totally indifferent to the suffering of the prisoners , because my job as prison superintendent was to focus on the guards .
As principal [ scientific ] investigator [ of the experiment ] , my job was to care about what happened to everybody because they were all under my experimental control .
But once I switched to being the prison superintendent , I was a different person .
It 's hard to believe that , but I was transformed .
Wired :
Do you think it made any difference that the Abu Ghraib guards were reservists rather than active duty soldiers ?
Zimbardo :
It made an enormous difference , in two ways .
They had no mission - specific training , and they had no training to be in a combat zone .
Secondly , the Army reservists in a combat zone are the lowest form of animal life within the military hierarchy .
They 're not real soldiers , and they know this .
In Abu Ghraib the only thing lower than the army reservist MPs were the prisoners .
Wired :
So it 's a case of people who feel powerless in their lives seizing power over someone else .
Zimbardo :
Yes , victims become victimizers .
In Nazi concentration camps , the Jewish capos were worse than the Nazis , because they had to prove that they deserved being in this position .
Wired :
You 've said that the way to prevent evil actions is to teach the " banality of kindness " — that is , to get society to exemplify ordinary people who engage in extraordinary moral actions .
How do you do this ?
Zimbardo :
If you can agree on a certain number of things that are morally wrong , then one way to counteract them is by training kids .
There are some programs , starting in the fifth grade , which get kids to think about the heroic mentality , the heroic imagination .
To be a hero you have to take action on behalf of someone else or some principle and you have to be deviant in your society , because the group is always saying do n't do it ; do n't step out of line .
If you 're an accountant at Arthur Andersen , everyone who is doing the defrauding is telling you , " Hey , be one of the team . "
Heroes have to always , at the heroic decisive moment , break from the crowd and do something different .
But a heroic act involves a risk .
If you 're a whistle - blower you 're going to get fired , you 're not going to get promoted , you 're going to get ostracized .
And you have to say it does n't matter .
Most heroes are more effective when they 're social heroes rather than isolated heroes .
A single person or even two can get dismissed by the system .
But once you have three people , then it's the start of an opposition .
So what I 'm trying to promote is not only the importance of each individual thinking " I'm a hero " and waiting for the right situation to come along in which I will act on behalf of some people or some principle , but also , " I 'm going to learn the skills to influence other people to join me in that heroic action . "
Yet these precedents also encouraged governments to insist that their former leaders accused of despotism or thievery be returned for trial , and made other countries reluctant to keep rewarding these disgraced leaders with a comfortable life .
“ Slowly and unevenly , but indubitably , the region ’s judiciaries have become more professional , ” said Cynthia McClintock , a Latin America specialist at George Washington University in Washington .
The change in atmosphere is hitting Latin America with particular force , because the right of political asylum for former heads of state in the region was once viewed as sacred — a kind of institutional understanding that underlay the cycle of coups and countercoups , dictatorships and rebellions , periods of repression or totalitarianism interrupted by episodes of democracy .
In practice , it often played out like this : a caudillo , or strongman , amassed such power or abused opponents to such an extent that he was threatened with rebellion or overthrown .
At that point , he made his escape abroad by airplane or boat , or by limousine onto the grounds of a friendly embassy whose government , by law or tradition , was prone to accept its new guest automatically .
More often than not , it seemed , the United States intervened , either quietly or publicly .
Its officials would broker a deal that would deliver the ousted ruler with a minimum of upheaval to his country of exile , all in the interest of averting an even worse political crisis and of creating a semblance of economic and social stability .
Some countries , like Panama , even specialized in welcoming the autocrats into their midst .
That explains why Raoul Cedras of Haiti and Jorge Serrano Elias of Guatemala , both of whom have successfully fended off extradition requests so far , find themselves living comfortably in Panama .
So does Abdalá Bucaram of Ecuador , who has been sought at home on corruption charges .
As in the past , extradition sometimes hews closely to United States interests , even in a region where democratic government is now more prevalent than dictatorship .
Panama , for example , is now captivated by the struggle that its former president , Manuel Noriega , is waging to avoid extradition to France from the United States , an option American officials prefer to returning him to his home country .
White House e-mails missing for a week after Saddam 's capture Nick Juliano

The full picture of what happened inside the White House in the days after Saddam Hussein 's capture may be lost forever because of improper record keeping by the Bush administration that has caused millions of e-mails to be lost .
E-mails are missing from the White House Office for a one - week span in December 2003 beginning the day after US troops captured Saddam Hussein in Iraq , according to a report detailing events on some of the 473 days in which up to 10 million internal Bush administration e-mails are believed to have gone missing .
The report was released over the weekend by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , which is suing to force the White House to detail how it archives e-mails to determine if it is in line with federal law .
There are e-mails missing from White House archives beginning Dec. 15 , 2003 and continuing until Dec. 22 , according to CREW 's report .
At the time , Saddam Hussein 's capture dominated the nation 's newspapers and was sure to be subject of much internal discussion , but historians and the public may never know what was zipping between White House Blackberries that day .
President Bush was publicly warning that the road ahead in Iraq would remain " difficult and ... require further sacrifice , " and news reports then indicated continued violence following Saddam 's capture .
At the same time the United States also was trying to decide how to handle the deposed dictator 's prosecution , ultimately deciding to leave it to the fledgling Iraqi government .
The critical week in December 2003 is a drop in a fairly large pond of potentially missing data from the White House , and the Washington Post reports Tuesday that there is no comprehensive system for archiving administration e-mails .
The Bush administration apparently abandoned use of a system used by his predecessor , Bill Clinton , after complaints about improper record keeping in his White House in the late 90s .
The White House , for its part , insists that no e-mails are missing , although its current stance seems to be a departure from its previous acknowledgements that at least some e-mails were lost .
Last week , a spokesman said the White House " could not authenticate " results of an earlier internal document that showed 473 days on which e-mails were missing .
" We have no evidence and we have no way of showing that any e-mail at all are missing , " White House spokesman Tony Fratto said .
Whatever the case , the archiving system seems lacking in contrast to the Clinton system , which automatically preserved e-mails that could have historical or evidentiary value , Tom Blanton , who heads the National Security Archive , told the Post .
" But that has disappeared , " he said , " and as far as I know there 's no apparent system . "
MEXICO CITY 
When Fidel Castro promised to step down this week as Cuba ’s head of state , he left the Cuban people and the rest of the world wondering not only what role he will play in retirement , but what changes will follow in the country he has run for nearly 50 years .
“ And what now ? ” said Annia , a 30 - year - old student in Havana who declined to give her last name to a reporter from Agence France - Presse .
“ We ’ll see what happens .
We have to be ready .
I just hope whatever comes , the situation will get sorted out . ”
Most experts on Cuba , along with many Cubans , expect that Raúl Castro , the 76 - year - old younger brother of Fidel Castro , will step into his shoes .
Raúl Castro , the defense chief and first vice president , has been serving as acting president since mid-2006 .
But it remains a mystery whether the elder Mr. Castro , who is 81 , will split up the two most important jobs he holds as head of state  the president of the Council of State and president of the Council of Ministers  to give one to a younger loyalist .
It is also unclear whom he will choose to replace his brother as first vice president .

reationist models are often criticized for being too vague to have any predictive value .
A literal interpretation of the Flood story in Genesis , however , does imply certain physical consequences which can be tested against what we actually observe , and the implications of such an interpretation are investigated below .
Some creationists provided even more detailed models , and these are also addressed ( see especially sections 5 and 7 ) .
References are listed at the end of each section .
Two kinds of flood model are not addressed here .
First is the local flood .
Genesis 6 - 8 can be interpreted as a homiletic story such that the " world " that was flooded was just the area that Noah knew .
Creationists argue against the local flood model because it does n't fit their own literalist preconceptions , but I know of no physical evidence contrary to such a model .
Second , the whole story can be dismissed as a series of supernatural miracles .
There is no way to contradict such an argument .
However , one must wonder about a God who reportedly does one thing and then arranges every bit of evidence to make it look like something else happened .
It 's entirely possible that a global flood occurred 4000 years ago or even last Thursday , and that God subsequently erased all the evidence , including our memories of it .
But even if such stories are true , what 's the point ?
1. Building the Ark
Wood is not the best material for shipbuilding .
It is not enough that a ship be built to hold together ; it must also be sturdy enough that the changing stresses do n't open gaps in its hull .
Wood is simply not strong enough to prevent separation between the joints , especially in the heavy seas that the Ark would have encountered .
The longest wooden ships in modern seas are about 300 feet , and these require reinforcing with iron straps and leak so badly they must be constantly pumped .
The ark was 450 feet long [ Gen. 6:15 ] .
Could an ark that size be made seaworthy ?
2. Gathering the Animals
Bringing all kinds of animals together in the vicinity of the ark presents significant problems .
Could animals have traveled from elsewhere ?
If the animals traveled from other parts of the world , many of them would have faced extreme difficulties .
Some , like sloths and penguins , can't travel overland very well at all .
Some , like koalas and many insects , require a special diet .
How did they bring it along ?
Some cave - dwelling arthropods can't survive in less than 100 % relative humidity .
Some , like dodos , must have lived on islands .
If they did n't , they would have been easy prey for other animals .
When mainland species like rats or pigs are introduced to islands , they drive many indigenous species to extinction .
Those species would not have been able to survive such competition if they lived where mainland species could get at them before the Flood .
Could animals have all lived near Noah ?
Some creationists suggest that the animals need not have traveled far to reach the Ark ; a moderate climate could have made it possible for all of them to live nearby all along .
However , this proposal makes matters even worse .
The last point above would have applied not only to island species , but to almost all species .
Competition between species would have driven most of them to extinction .
There is a reason why Gila monsters , yaks , and quetzals do n't all live together in a temperate climate .
They can't survive there , at least not for long without special care .
Organisms have preferred environments outside of which they are at a deadly disadvantage .
Most extinctions are caused by destroying the organisms ' preferred environments .
The creationists who propose all the species living together in a uniform climate are effectively proposing the destruction of all environments but one .
Not many species could have survived that .
How was the Ark loaded ?
Getting all the animals aboard the Ark presents logistical problems which , while not impossible , are highly impractical .
Noah had only seven days to load the Ark ( Gen. 7:4-10 ) .
If only 15764 animals were aboard the Ark ( see section 3 ) , one animal must have been loaded every 38 seconds , without letup .
Since there were likely more animals to load , the time pressures would have been even worse .
3. Fitting the Animals Aboard
To determine how much space is required for animals , we must first determine what is a kind , how many kinds were aboard the ark , and how big they were .
What is a kind ?
Creationists themselves can't decide on an answer to this question ; they propose criteria ranging from species to order , and I have even seen an entire kingdom ( bacteria ) suggested as a single kind .
Woodmorappe ( p. 5 - 7 ) compromises by using genus as a kind .
However , on the ark " kind " must have meant something closer to species for three reasons :
For purposes of naming animals , the people who live among them distinguish between them ( that is , give them different names ) at roughly the species level .
[ Gould , 1980 ]
The Biblical " kind , " according to most interpretations , implies reproductive separateness .
On the ark , the purpose of gathering different kinds was to preserve them by later reproduction .
Species , by definition , is the level at which animals are reproductively distinct .
The Flood , according to models , was fairly recent .
There simply would n't have been time enough to accumulate the number of mutations necessary for the diversity of species we see within many genera today .
What kinds were aboard the ark ?
Woodmorappe and Whitcomb & Morris arbitrarily exclude all animals except mammals , birds , and reptiles .
However , many other animals , particularly land arthropods , must also have been on the ark for two reasons :
The Bible says so .
Gen. 7:8 puts on the ark all creatures that move along the ground , with no further qualifications .
Lev. 11:42 includes arthropods ( creatures that " walk on many feet " ) in such a category .
They could n't survive outside .
Gen. 7:21 - 23 says every land creature not aboard the ark perished .
And indeed , not one insect species in a thousand could survive for half a year on the vegetation mats proposed by some creationists .
Most other land arthropods , snails , slugs , earthworms , etc. would also have to be on the ark to survive .
Were dinosaurs and other extinct animals on the ark ?
According to the Bible , Noah took samples of all animals alive at the time of the Flood .
If , as creationists claim , all fossil - bearing strata were deposited by the Flood , then all the animals which became fossils were alive then .
Therefore all extinct land animals had representatives aboard the ark .
It is also worth pointing out that the number of extinct species is undoubtedly greater than the number of known extinct species .
New genera of dinosaurs have been discovered at a nearly constant rate for more than a century , and there 's no indication that the rate of discovery will fall off in the near future .
Were the animals aboard the ark mature ?
Woodmorappe gets his animals to fit only by taking juvenile pairs of everything weighing more than 22 lbs. as an adult .
However , it is more likely that Noah would have brought adults aboard :
The Bible ( Gen. 7:2 ) speaks of " the male and his mate , " indicating that the animals were at sexual maturity .
Many animals require the care of adults to teach them behaviors they need for survival .
If brought aboard as juveniles , these animals would n't have survived .
The last point does not apply to all animals .
However , the animals do n't need parental care tend to be animals that mature quickly , and thus would be close to adult size after a year of growth anyway .
How many clean animals were on the ark ?
The Bible says either seven or fourteen ( it 's ambiguous ) of each kind of clean animal was aboard .
It defines clean animals essentially as ruminants , a suborder which includes about 69 recent genera , 192 recent species [ Wilson & Reeder , 1993 ] , and probably a comparable number of extinct genera and species .
That is a small percentage of the total number of species , but ruminants are among the largest mammals , so their bulk is significant .
Woodmorappe ( p. 8 - 9 ) gets around the problem by citing Jewish tradition which gives only 13 domestic genera as clean .
He then calculates that this would increase the total animal mass by 2 - 3 % and decides that this amount is small enough that he can ignore it completely .
However , even Jewish sources admit that this contradicts the unambiguous word of the Bible .
[ Steinsaltz , 1976 , p. 187 ]
The number and size of clean birds is small enough to disregard entirely , but the Bible at one point ( Gen. 7:3 ) says seven of all kinds of birds were aboard .
So , could they all fit ?
It is important to take the size of animals into account when considering how much space they would occupy because the greatest number of species occurs in the smallest animals .
Woodmorappe performed such an analysis and came to the conclusion that the animals would take up 47 % of the ark .
In addition , he determines that about 10 % of the ark was needed for food ( compacted to take as little space as possible ) and 9.4 % for water ( assuming no evaporation or wastage ) .
At least 25 % of the space would have been needed for corridors and bracing .
Thus , increasing the quantity of animals by more than about 5 % would overload the ark .
However , Woodmorappe makes several questionable and invalid assumptions .
Here 's how the points discussed above affect his analysis .
Table 1 shows Woodmorappe 's analysis and some additional calculations .
Table 1 : Size analysis of animals aboard the Ark .
Page numbers refer to Woodmorappe , 1996 , from which the figures in the row are taken .
( Minor arithmetic errors in totals are corrected . )
Woodmorappe treats many animals as juveniles ; " yearling " masses are masses of those animals after one year of growth .
" Total mass after one year " is the maximum load which Woodmorappe allows for .
Additional clean animal figures assume they are taken aboard by sevens , not seven pairs , and also assume juvenile animals .
Log mass range ( g ) 0 - 1 1 - 2 2-3 3 - 4 4 -5 5 - 6 6 -7 7 - 8 Ave. mass ( kg ) ( p. 13 ) .005 .05 .5 5 50 316 3160 31600 # of mammals ( p. 10 ) 466 1570 1378 1410 1462 892 246 7424 # of birds ( p. 10 ) 630 2272 1172 450 70 4 4598 # of reptiles ( p. 10 ) 642 844 688 492 396 286 270 106 3724 total # of animals 1738 4686 3238 2352 1928 1182 516 106 15746 Ave. yearling mass ( kg ) ( p. 66 ) .005 .05 .5 5 10 100 300 1000 Total mass after one year 8.7 234.3 1619 11760 19280 118200 154800 106000 411902
Total mass assuming adults 8.7 234.3 1619 11760 96400 373512 1630560 3349600 5463694 Additional clean birds 1575 5680 2930 1125 175 10 11495 Additional ruminants ( 138 genera ) 260 420 10 690 Additional clean animal mass ( yearling weight , kg ) 8 284 1465 5625 4350 43000 3000 47600
Collecting each species instead of each genus would increase the number of individuals three - to fourfold .
The most speciose groups tend to be the smaller animals , though , so the total mass would be approximately doubled or tripled .
Collecting all land animals instead of just mammals , birds , and reptiles would have insignificant impact on the space required , since those animals , though plentiful , are so small .
( The problems come when you try to care for them all . )
Leaving off the long - extinct animals would free considerable space .
Woodmorappe does n't say how many of the animals in his calculations are known only from fossils , but it is apparently 50 - 70 % of them , including most of the large ones .
However , since he took only juveniles of the large animals , leaving off all the dinosaurs etc. would probably not free more than 80 % of the space .
On the other hand , collecting all extinct animals in addition to just the known ones would increase the load by an unknown but probably substantial amount .
Loading adults instead of juveniles as small as Woodmorappe uses would increase the load 13 - to 50 - fold .
Including extra clean animals would increase the load by 1.5 - 3 % if only the 13 traditional domestic ruminants are considered , but by 14 - 28 % if all ruminants are considered clean .
In conclusion , an ark of the size specified in the Bible would not be large enough to carry a cargo of animals and food sufficient to repopulate the earth , especially if animals that are now extinct were required to be aboard .

4. Caring for the Animals
Special diets .
Many animals , especially insects , require special diets .
Koalas , for example , require eucalyptus leaves , and silkworms eat nothing but mulberry leaves .
For thousands of plant species ( perhaps even most plants ) , there is at least one animal that eats only that one kind of plant .
How did Noah gather all those plants aboard , and where did he put them ?
Other animals are strict carnivores , and some of those specialize on certain kinds of foods , such as small mammals , insects , fish , or aquatic invertebrates .
How did Noah determine and provide for all those special diets ?
Fresh foods .
Many animals require their food to be fresh .
Many snakes , for example , will eat only live foods ( or at least warm and moving ) .
Parasitoid wasps only attack living prey .
Most spiders locate their prey by the vibrations it produces .
[ Foelix , 1996 ]
Most herbivorous insects require fresh food .
Aphids , in fact , are physically incapable of sucking from wilted leaves .
How did Noah keep all these food supplies fresh ?
Food preservation / Pest control .
Food spoilage is a major concern on long voyages ; it was especially thus before the inventions of canning and refrigeration .
The large quantities of food aboard would have invited infestations of any of hundreds of stored product pests ( especially since all of those pests would have been aboard ) , and the humidity one would expect aboard the Ark would have provided an ideal environment for molds .
How did Noah keep pests from consuming most of the food ?
Ventilation .
The ark would need to be well ventilated to disperse the heat , humidity , and waste products ( including methane , carbon dioxide , and ammonia ) from the many thousands of animals which were crowded aboard .
Woodmorappe ( pp. 37 - 42 ) interprets Genesis 6:16 to mean there was an 18 - inch opening all around the top , and says that this , with slight breezes , would have been enough to provide adequate ventilation .
However , the ark was divided into separate rooms and decks ( Gen. 6:14,16 ) .
How was fresh air circulated throughout the structure ?
Sanitation .
The ungulates alone would have produced tons of manure a day .
The waste on the lowest deck at least ( and possibly the middle deck ) could not simply be pushed overboard , since the deck was below the water line ; the waste would have to be carried up a deck or two .
Vermicomposting could reduce the rate of waste accumulation , but it requires maintenance of its own .
How did such a small crew dispose of so much waste ?
Exercise / Animal handling .
The animals aboard the ark would have been in very poor shape unless they got regular exercise .
( Imagine if you had to stay in an area the size of a closet for a year . )
How were several thousand diverse kinds of animals exercised regularly ?
Manpower for feeding , watering , etc .
How did a crew of eight manage a menagerie larger and more diverse than that found in zoos requiring many times that many employees ?
Woodmorappe claims that eight people could care for 16000 animals , but he makes many unrealistic and invalid assumptions .
Here are a few things he did n't take into account :
Feeding the animals would take much longer if the food was in containers to protect it from pests .
Many animals would have to be hand - fed .
Watering several animals at once via troughs would not work aboard a ship .
The water would be sloshed out by the ship 's roll .
Many animals , in such an artificial environment , would have required additional special care .
For example , all of the hoofed animals would need to have their hooves trimmed several times during the year .
[ Batten , 1976 , pp. 39 - 42 ]
Not all manure could be simply pushed overboard ; a third of it at least would have to be carried up at least one deck .
Corpses of the dead animals would have to be removed regularly .
Animals can't be expected to run laps and return to their cages without a lot of human supervision .

5 . The Flood Itself
Where did the Flood water come from , and where did it go ?
Several people have proposed answers to these questions , but none which consider all the implications of their models .
A few of the commonly cited models are addressed below .
Vapor canopy .
This model , proposed by Whitcomb & Morris and others , proposes that much of the Flood water was suspended overhead until the 40 days of rain which caused the Flood .
The following objections are covered in more detail by Brown .
How was the water suspended , and what caused it to fall all at once when it did ?
If a canopy holding the equivalent to more than 40 feet of water were part of the atmosphere , it would raise the atmospheric pressure accordingly , raising oxygen and nitrogen levels to toxic levels .
If the canopy began as vapor , any water from it would be superheated .
This scenario essentially starts with most of the Flood waters boiled off .
Noah and company would be poached .
If the water began as ice in orbit , the gravitational potential energy would likewise raise the temperature past boiling .
A canopy of any significant thickness would have blocked a great deal of light , lowering the temperature of the earth greatly before the Flood .
Any water above the ozone layer would not be shielded from ultraviolet light , and the light would break apart the water molecules .
Hydroplate .
Walt Brown 's model proposes that the Flood waters came from a layer of water about ten miles underground , which was released by a catastrophic rupture of the earth 's crust , shot above the atmosphere , and fell as rain .
How was the water contained ?
Rock , at least the rock which makes up the earth 's crust , does n't float .
The water would have been forced to the surface long before Noah 's time , or Adam 's time for that matter .
Even a mile deep , the earth is boiling hot , and thus the reservoir of water would be superheated .
Further heat would be added by the energy of the water falling from above the atmosphere .
As with the vapor canopy model , Noah would have been poached .
Where is the evidence ?
The escaping waters would have eroded the sides of the fissures , producing poorly sorted basaltic erosional deposits .
These would be concentrated mainly near the fissures , but some would be shot thousands of miles along with the water .
( Noah would have had to worry about falling rocks along with the rain . )
Such deposits would be quite noticeable but have never been seen .
Comet .
Kent Hovind proposed that the Flood water came from a comet which broke up and fell on the earth .
Again , this has the problem of the heat from the gravitational potential energy .
The water would be steam by the time it reached the surface of the earth .
Runaway subduction .
John Baumgardner created the runaway subduction model , which proposes that the pre-Flood lithosphere ( ocean floor ) , being denser than the underlying mantle , began sinking .
The heat released in the process decreased the viscosity of the mantle , so the process accelerated catastrophically .
All the original lithosphere became subducted ; the rising magma which replaced it raised the ocean floor , causing sea levels to rise and boiling off enough of the ocean to cause 150 days of rain .
When it cooled , the ocean floor lowered again , and the Flood waters receded .
Sedimentary mountains such as the Sierras and Andes rose after the Flood by isostatic rebound .
[ Baumgardner , 1990a ; Austin et al. , 1994 ]
The main difficulty of this theory is that it admittedly does n't work without miracles .
[ Baumgardner , 1990a , 1990 b ]
The thermal diffusivity of the earth , for example , would have to increase 10,000 fold to get the subduction rates proposed [ Matsumura , 1997 ] , and miracles are also necessary to cool the new ocean floor and to raise sedimentary mountains in months rather than in the millions of years it would ordinarily take .
Baumgardner estimates a release of 10 28 joules from the subduction process .
This is more than enough to boil off all the oceans .
In addition , Baumgardner postulates that the mantle was much hotter before the Flood ( giving it greater viscosity ) ; that heat would have to go somewhere , too .
joules from the subduction process .
This is more than enough to boil off all the oceans .
In addition , Baumgardner postulates that the mantle was much hotter before the Flood ( giving it greater viscosity ) ; that heat would have to go somewhere , too .
Cenozoic sediments are post - Flood according to this model .
Yet fossils from Cenozoic sediments alone show a 65 - million - year record of evolution , including a great deal of the diversification of mammals and angiosperms .
[ Carroll , 1997 , chpts . 5 , 6 , & 13 ]
Subduction on the scale Baumgardner proposes would have produced very much more vulcanism around plate boundaries than we see .
[ Matsumura , 1997 ]
New ocean basins .
Most flood models ( including those above , possibly excepting Hovind 's ) deal with the water after the flood by proposing that it became our present oceans .
The earth 's terrain , according to this model , was much , much flatter during the Flood , and through cataclysms , the mountains were pushed up and the ocean basins lowered .
( Brown proposes that the cataclysms were caused by the crust sliding around on a cushion of water ; Whitcomb & Morris do n't give a cause . )
How could such a change be effected ?
To change the density and / or temperature of at least a quarter of the earth 's crust fast enough to raise and lower the ocean floor in a matter of months would require mechanisms beyond any proposed in any of the flood models .
Why are most sediments on high ground ?
Most sediments are carried until the water slows down or stops .
If the water stopped in the oceans , we should expect more sediments there .
Baumgardner 's own modeling shows that , during the Flood , currents would be faster over continents than over ocean basins [ Baumgardner , 1994 ] , so sediments should , on the whole , be removed from continents and deposited in ocean basins .
Yet sediments on the ocean basin average 0.6 km thick , while on continents ( including continental shelves ) , they average 2.6 km thick .
[ Poldervaart , 1955 ]
Where 's the evidence ?
The water draining from the continents would have produced tremendous torrents .
There is evidence of similar flooding in the Scablands of Washington state ( from the draining of a lake after the breaking of an ice dam ) and on the far western floor of the Mediterranean Sea ( from the ocean breaking through the Straits of Gibralter ) .
Why is such evidence not found worldwide ?
How did the ark survive the process ?
Such a wholesale restructuring of the earth 's topography , compressed into just a few months , would have produced tsunamis large enough to circle the earth .
The aftershocks alone would have been devastating for years afterwards .

6. Implications of a Flood
A global flood would have produce evidence contrary to the evidence we see .
How do you explain the relative ages of mountains ?
For example , why were n't the Sierra Nevadas eroded as much as the Appalachians during the Flood ?
Why is there no evidence of a flood in ice core series ?
Ice cores from Greenland have been dated back more than 40,000 years by counting annual layers .
[ Johnsen et al , 1992 , ; Alley et al , 1993 ]
A worldwide flood would be expected to leave a layer of sediments , noticeable changes in salinity and oxygen isotope ratios , fractures from buoyancy and thermal stresses , a hiatus in trapped air bubbles , and probably other evidence .
Why does n't such evidence show up ?
How are the polar ice caps even possible ?
Such a mass of water as the Flood would have provided sufficient buoyancy to float the polar caps off their beds and break them up .
They would n't regrow quickly .
In fact , the Greenland ice cap would not regrow under modern ( last 10 ky ) climatic conditions .
Why did the Flood not leave traces on the sea floors ?
A year long flood should be recognizable in sea bottom cores by ( 1 ) an uncharacteristic amount of terrestrial detritus , ( 2 ) different grain size distributions in the sediment , ( 3 ) a shift in oxygen isotope ratios ( rain has a different isotopic composition from seawater ) , ( 4 ) a massive extinction , and ( n ) other characters .
Why do none of these show up ?
Why is there no evidence of a flood in tree ring dating ?
Tree ring records go back more than 10,000 years , with no evidence of a catastrophe during that time .

7. Producing the Geological Record
Most people who believe in a global flood also believe that the flood was responsible for creating all fossil - bearing strata .
( The alternative , that the strata were laid down slowly and thus represent a time sequence of several generations at least , would prove that some kind of evolutionary process occurred . )
However , there is a great deal of contrary evidence .
Before you argue that fossil evidence was dated and interpreted to meet evolutionary assumptions , remember that the geological column and the relative dates therein were laid out by people who believed divine creation , before Darwin even formulated his theory .
( See , for example , Moore [ 1973 ] , or the closing pages of Dawson [ 1868 ] . )
Why are geological eras consistent worldwide ?
How do you explain worldwide agreement between " apparent " geological eras and several different ( independent ) radiometric and nonradiometric dating methods ?
[ e.g. , Short et al , 1991 ]
How was the fossil record sorted in an order convenient for evolution ?
Ecological zonation , hydrodynamic sorting , and differential escape fail to explain :
the extremely good sorting observed .
Why did n't at least one dinosaur make it to the high ground with the elephants ?
the relative positions of plants and other non-motile life .
( Yun , 1989 , describes beautifully preserved algae from Late Precambrian sediments .
Why do n't any modern - looking plants appear that low in the geological column ? )
why some groups of organisms , such as mollusks , are found in many geologic strata .
why organisms ( such as brachiopods ) which are very similar hydrodynamically ( all nearly the same size , shape , and weight ) are still perfectly sorted .
why extinct animals which lived in the same niches as present animals did n't survive as well .
Why did no pterodons make it to high ground ?
how coral reefs hundreds of feet thick and miles long were preserved intact with other fossils below them .
why small organisms dominate the lower strata , whereas fluid mechanics says they would sink slower and thus end up in upper strata .
why artifacts such as footprints and burrows are also sorted .
[ Crimes & Droser , 1992 ]
why no human artifacts are found except in the very uppermost strata .
If , at the time of the Flood , the earth was overpopulated by people with technology for shipbuilding , why were none of their tools or buildings mixed with trilobite or dinosaur fossils ?
why different parts of the same organisms are sorted together .
Pollen and spores are found in association with the trunks , leaves , branches , and roots produced by the same plants [ Stewart , 1983 ] .
why ecological information is consistent within but not between layers .
Fossil pollen is one of the more important indicators of different levels of strata .
Each plant has different and distinct pollen , and , by telling which plants produced the fossil pollen , it is easy to see what the climate was like in different strata .
Was the pollen hydraulically sorted by the flood water so that the climatic evidence is different for each layer ?
How do surface features appear far from the surface ?
Deep in the geologic column there are formations which could have originated only on the surface , such as :
How could these have appeared in the midst of a catastrophic flood ?
How does a global flood explain angular unconformities ?
These are where one set of layers of sediments have been extensively modified ( e.g. , tilted ) and eroded before a second set of layers were deposited on top .
They thus seem to require at least two periods of deposition ( more , where there is more than one unconformity ) with long periods of time in between to account for the deformation , erosion , and weathering observed .
How were mountains and valleys formed ?
Many very tall mountains are composed of sedimentary rocks .
( The summit of Everest is composed of deep - marine limestone , with fossils of ocean - bottom dwelling crinoids [ Gansser , 1964 ] . )
If these were formed during the Flood , how did they reach their present height , and when were the valleys between them eroded away ?
Keep in mind that many valleys were clearly carved by glacial erosion , which is a slow process .
When did granite batholiths form ?
Some of these are intruded into older sediments and have younger sediments on their eroded top surfaces .
It takes a long time for magma to cool into granite , nor does granite erode very quickly .
[ For example , see Donohoe & Grantham , 1989 , for locations of contact between the South Mountain Batholith and the Meugma Group of sediments , as well as some angular unconformities . ]
How can a single flood be responsible for such extensively detailed layering ?
One formation in New Jersey is six kilometers thick .
If we grant 400 days for this to settle , and ignore possible compaction since the Flood , we still have 15 meters of sediment settling per day .
And yet despite this , the chemical properties of the rock are neatly layered , with great changes ( e.g. ) in percent carbonate occurring within a few centimeters in the vertical direction .
How does such a neat sorting process occur in the violent context of a universal flood dropping 15 meters of sediment per day ?
How can you explain a thin layer of high carbonate sediment being deposited over an area of ten thousand square kilometers for some thirty minutes , followed by thirty minutes of low carbonate deposition , etc . ?
[ Zimmer , 1992 ]
How do you explain the formation of varves ?
The Green River formation in Wyoming contains 20,000,000 annual layers , or varves , identical to those being laid down today in certain lakes .
The sediments are so fine that each layer would have required over a month to settle .
How could a flood deposit layered fossil forests ?
Stratigraphic sections showing a dozen or more mature forests layered atop each other -- all with upright trunks , in - place roots , and well - developed soil - - appear in many locations .
One example , the Joggins section along the Bay of Fundy , shows a continuous section 2750 meters thick ( along a 48 - km sea cliff ) with multiple in - place forests , some separated by hundreds of feet of strata , some even showing evidence of forest fires .
[ Ferguson , 1988 .
For other examples , see Dawson , 1868 ; Cristie & McMillan , 1991 ; Gastaldo , 1990 ; Yuretich , 1994 . ]
Creationists point to logs sinking in a lake below Mt. St. Helens as an example of how a flood can deposit vertical trunks , but deposition by flood fails to explain the roots , the soil , the layering , and other features found in such places .
Where did all the heat go ?
If the geologic record was deposited in a year , then the events it records must also have occurred within a year .
Some of these events release significant amounts of heat .
Magma .
The geologic record includes roughly 8 x 10 24 grams of lava flows and igneous intrusions .
Assuming ( conservatively ) a specific heat of 0.15 , this magma would release 5.4 x 10 27 joules while cooling 1100 degrees C . In addition , the heat of crystallization as the magma solidifies would release a great deal more heat .

Limestone formation .
There are roughly 5 x 10 23 grams of limestone in the earth 's sediments [ Poldervaart , 1955 ] , and the formation of calcite releases about 11,290 joules / gram [ Weast , 1974 , p. D63 ] .
If only 10 % of the limestone were formed during the Flood , the 5.6 x 10 26 joules of heat released would be enough to boil the flood waters .

If only 10 % of the limestone were formed during the Flood , the 5.6 x 10 joules of heat released would be enough to boil the flood waters .
Meteorite impacts .
Erosion and crustal movements have erased an unknown number of impact craters on earth , but Creationists Whitcomb and DeYoung suggest that cratering to the extent seen on the Moon and Mercury occurred on earth during the year of Noah 's Flood .
The heat from just one of the largest lunar impacts released an estimated 3 x 10 26 joules ; the same sized object falling to earth would release even more energy .
[ Fezer , pp. 45 - 46 ]

[ Fezer , pp. 45 - 46 ]
Other .
Other possibly significant heat sources are radioactive decay ( some Creationists claim that radioactive decay rates were much higher during the Flood to account for consistently old radiometric dates ) ; biological decay ( think of the heat released in compost piles ) ; and compression of sediments .
5.6 x 1026 joules is enough to heat the oceans to boiling .
3.7 x 1027 joules will vaporize them completely .
Since steam and air have a lower heat capacity than water , the steam released will quickly raise the temperature of the atmosphere over 1000 C .
At these temperatures , much of the atmosphere would boil off the Earth .
Aside from losing its atmosphere , Earth can only get rid of heat by radiating it to space , and it can't radiate significantly more heat than it gets from the sun unless it is a great deal hotter than it is now .
( It is very nearly at thermal equilibrium now . )
If there were n't many millions of years to radiate the heat from the above processes , the earth would still be unlivably hot .
As shown in section 5 , all the mechanisms proposed for causing the Flood already provide more than enough energy to vaporize it as well .
These additional factors only make the heat problem worse .
How were limestone deposits formed ?
Much limestone is made of the skeletons of zillions of microscopic sea animals .
Some deposits are thousands of meters thick .
Were all those animals alive when the Flood started ?
If not , how do you explain the well - ordered sequence of fossils in the deposits ?
Roughly 1.5 x 1015 grams of calcium carbonate are deposited on the ocean floor each year .
[ Poldervaart , 1955 ]
A deposition rate ten times as high for 5000 years before the Flood would still only account for less than 0.02 % of limestone deposits .
How could a flood have deposited chalk ?
Chalk is largely made up of the bodies of plankton 700 to 1000 angstroms in diameter [ Bignot , 1985 ] .
Objects this small settle at a rate of .0000154 mm/sec .
[ Twenhofel , 1961 ]
In a year of the Flood , they could have settled about half a meter .
How could the Flood deposit layers of solid salt ?
Such layers are sometimes meters in width , interbedded with sediments containing marine fossils .
This apparently occurs when a body of salt water has its fresh - water intake cut off , and then evaporates .
These layers can occur more or less at random times in the geological history , and have characteristic fossils on either side .
Therefore , if the fossils were themselves laid down during a catastrophic flood , there are , it seems , only two choices :
(1 ) the salt layers were themselves laid down at the same time , during the heavy rains that began the flooding , or
( 2 ) the salt is a later intrusion .
I suspect that both will prove insuperable difficulties for a theory of flood deposition of the geologic column and its fossils .
[ Jackson et al , 1990 ]
How were sedimentary deposits recrystallized and plastically deformed in the short time since the Flood ?
The stretched pebble conglomerate in Death Valley National Monument ( Wildrose Canyon Rd. , 15 mi. south of Hwy. 190 ) , for example , contains streambed pebbles metamorphosed to quartzite and stretched to 3 or more times their original length .
Plastically deformed stone is also common around salt diapirs [ Jackson et al , 1990 ] .
How were hematite layers laid down ?
Standard theory is that they were laid down before Earth 's atmosphere contained much oxygen .
In an oxygen - rich regime , they would almost certainly be impossible .
How do you explain fossil mineralization ?
Mineralization is the replacement of the original material with a different mineral .
Buried skeletal remains of modern fauna are negligibly mineralized , including some that biblical archaeology says are quite old - a substantial fraction of the age of the earth in this diluvian geology .
For example , remains of Egyptian commoners buried near the time of Moses are n't extensively mineralized .
Buried skeletal remains of extinct mammalian fauna show quite variable mineralization .
Dinosaur remains are often extensively mineralized .
Trilobite remains are usually mineralized - and in different sites , fossils of the same species are composed of different materials .
How are these observations explained by a sorted deposition of remains in a single episode of global flooding ?
How does a flood explain the accuracy of " coral clocks " ?
The moon is slowly sapping the earth 's rotational energy .
The earth should have rotated more quickly in the distant past , meaning that a day would have been less than 24 hours , and there would have been more days per year .
Corals can be dated by the number of " daily " growth layers per " annual " growth layer .
Devonian corals , for example , show nearly 400 days per year .
There is an exceedingly strong correlation between the " supposed age " of a wide range of fossils ( corals , stromatolites , and a few others -- collected from geologic formations throughout the column and from locations all over the world ) and the number of days per year that their growth pattern shows .
The agreement between these clocks , and radiometric dating , and the theory of superposition is a little hard to explain away as the result of a number of unlucky coincidences in a 300 - day - long flood .
[ Rosenberg & Runcorn , 1975 ; Scrutton , 1965 ; Wells , 1963 ]
Where were all the fossilized animals when they were alive ?
Schadewald [ 1982 ] writes :
" Scientific creationists interpret the fossils found in the earth 's rocks as the remains of animals that perished in the Noachian Deluge .
Ironically , they often cite the sheer number of fossils in ' fossil graveyards ' as evidence for the Flood .
In particular , creationists seem enamored by the Karroo Formation in Africa , which is estimated to contain the remains of 800 billion vertebrate animals ( see Whitcomb and Morris , p. 160 ; Gish , p. 61 ) .
As pseudoscientists , creationists dare not test this major hypothesis that all of the fossilized animals died in the Flood .
" Robert E. Sloan , a paleontologist at the University of Minnesota , has studied the Karroo Formation .
He asserts that the animals fossilized there range from the size of a small lizard to the size of a cow , with the average animal perhaps the size of a fox .
A minute 's work with a calculator shows that , if the 800 billion animals in the Karoo formation could be resurrected , there would be twenty - one of them for every acre of land on earth .
Suppose we assume ( conservatively , I think ) that the Karroo Formation contains 1 percent of the vertebrate [ land ] fossils on earth .
Then when the Flood began , there must have been at least 2100 living animals per acre , ranging from tiny shrews to immense dinosaurs .
To a noncreationist mind , that seems a bit crowded . "
A thousand kilometers ' length of arctic coastal plain , according to experts in Leningrad , contains about 500,000 tons of tusks .
Even assuming that the entire population was preserved , you seem to be saying that Russia had wall - to - wall mammoths before this " event . "
Even if there was room physically for all the large animals which now exist only as fossils , how could they have all coexisted in a stable ecology before the Flood ?
Montana alone would have had to support a diversity of herbivores orders of magnitude larger than anything now observed .
Where did all the organic material in the fossil record come from ?
There are 1.16 x 1013 metric tons of coal reserves , and at least 100 times that much unrecoverable organic matter in sediments .
A typical forest , even if it covered the entire earth , would supply only 1.9 x 1013 metric tons .
[ Ricklefs , 1993 , p. 149 ]
How do you explain the relative commonness of aquatic fossils ?
A flood would have washed over everything equally , so terrestrial organisms should be roughly as abundant as aquatic ones ( or more abundant , since Creationists hypothesize greater land area before the Flood ) in the fossil record .
Yet shallow marine environments account for by far the most fossils .

8. Species Survival and Post - Flood Ecology
" He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of the ground , " the Bible says ( Gen 7:23 ) .
If the Flood was as described , that must have been an understatement .
How did all the modern plant species survive ?
Many plants ( seeds and all ) would be killed by being submerged for a few months .
This is especially true if they were soaked in salt water .
Some mangroves , coconuts , and other coastal species have seed which could be expected to survive the Flood itself , but what of the rest ?
Most seeds would have been buried under many feet ( even miles ) of sediment .
This is deep enough to prevent spouting .
Most plants require established soils to grow - - soils which would have been stripped by the Flood .
Some plants germinate only after being exposed to fire or after being ingested by animals ; these conditions would be rare ( to put it mildly ) after the Flood .
Noah could not have gathered seeds for all plants because not all plants produce seeds , and a variety of plant seeds can't survive a year before germinating .
[ Garwood , 1989 ; Benzing , 1990 ; Densmore & Zasada , 1983 ]
Also , how did he distribute them all over the world ?
How did all the fish survive ?
Some require cool clear water , some need brackish water , some need ocean water , some need water even saltier .
A flood would have destroyed at least some of these habitats .
How did sensitive marine life such as coral survive ?
Since most coral are found in shallow water , the turbidity created by the runoff from the land would effectively cut them off from the sun .
The silt covering the reef after the rains were over would kill all the coral .
By the way , the rates at which coral deposits calcium are well known , and some highly mature reefs ( such a the great barrier ) have been around for millions of years to be deposited to their observed thickness .
How did diseases survive ?
Many diseases can't survive in hosts other than humans .
Many others can only survive in humans and in short - lived arthropod vectors .
The list includes typhus , measles , smallpox , polio , gonorrhea , syphilis .
For these diseases to have survived the Flood , they must all have infected one or more of the eight people aboard the Ark .
Other animals aboard the ark must have suffered from multiple diseases , too , since there are other diseases specific to other animals , and the nonspecific diseases must have been somewhere .
Host - specific diseases which do n't kill their host generally can't survive long , since the host 's immune system eliminates them .
( This does n't apply to diseases such as HIV and malaria which can hide from the immune system . )
For example , measles can't last for more than a few weeks in a community of less than 250,000 [ Keeling & Grenfell , 1997 ] because it needs nonresistant hosts to infect .
Since the human population aboard the ark was somewhat less than 250,000 , measles and many other infectious diseases would have gone extinct during the Flood .
Some diseases that can affect a wide range of species would have found conditions on the Ark ideal for a plague .
Avian viruses , for example , would have spread through the many birds on the ark .
Other plagues would have affected the mammals and reptiles .
Even these plague pathogens , though , would have died out after all their prospective hosts were either dead or resistant .
How did short - lived species survive ?
Adult mayflies on the ark would have died in a few days , and the larvae of many mayflies require shallow fresh running water .
Many other insects would face similar problems .
How could more than a handful of species survive in a devastated habitat ?
The Flood would have destroyed the food and shelter which most species need to survive .
How did predators survive ?
How could more than a handful of the predator species on the ark have survived , with only two individuals of their prey to eat ?
All of the predators at the top of the food pyramid require larger numbers of food animals beneath them on the pyramid , which in turn require large numbers of the animals they prey on , and so on , down to the primary producers ( plants etc. ) at the bottom .
And if the predators survived , how did the other animals survive being preyed on ?
How could more than a handful of species survive random influences that affect populations ?
Isolated populations with fewer than 20 members are usually doomed even when extraordinary measures are taken to protect them .

9. Species Distribution and Diversity
How did animals get to their present ranges ?
How did koalas get from Ararat to Australia , polar bears to the Arctic , etc. , when the kinds of environment they require to live does n't exist between the two points .
How did so many unique species get to remote islands ?
How were ecological interdependencies preserved as animals migrated from Ararat ?
Did the yucca an the yucca moth migrate together across the Atlantic ?
Were there , a few thousand years ago , unbroken giant sequoia forests between Ararat and California to allow indigenous bark and cone beetles to migrate ?
Why are so many animals found only in limited ranges ?
Why are so many marsupials limited to Australia ; why are there no wallabies in western Indonesia ?
Why are lemurs limited to Madagascar ?
The same argument applies to any number of groups of plants and animals .
Why is inbreeding depression not a problem in most species ?
Harmful recessive alleles occur in significant numbers in most species .
( Humans have , on average , 3 to 4 lethal recessive alleles each . )
When close relatives breed , the offspring are more likely to be homozygous for these harmful alleles , to the detriment of the offspring .
Such inbreeding depression still shows up in cheetahs ; they have about 1/6th the number of motile spermatozoa as domestic cats , and of those , almost 80 % show morphological abnormalities .
[ O' Brien et al , 1987 ]
How could more than a handful of species survive the inbreeding depression that comes with establishing a population from a single mating pair ?

10 . Historical Aspects
Why is there no mention of the Flood in the records of Egyptian or Mesopotamian civilizations which existed at the time ?
Biblical dates ( I Kings 6:1 , Gal 3:17 , various generation lengths given in Genesis ) place the Flood 1300 years before Solomon began the first temple .
We can construct reliable chronologies for near Eastern history , particularly for Egypt , from many kinds of records from the literate cultures in the near East .
These records are independent of , but supported by , dating methods such as dendrochronology and carbon - 14 .
The building of the first temple can be dated to 950 B.C. +/- some small delta , placing the Flood around 2250 B.C. Unfortunately , the Egyptians ( among others ) have written records dating well back before 2250 B.C. ( the Great Pyramid , for example dates to the 26th century B.C. , 300 years before the Biblical date for the Flood ) .
No sign in Egyptian inscriptions of this global flood around 2250 B.C .
How did the human population rebound so fast ?
Genealogies in Genesis put the Tower of Babel about 110 to 150 years after the Flood [ Gen 10:25 , 11:10 - 19 ] .
How did the world population regrow so fast to make its construction ( and the city around it ) possible ?
Similarly , there would have been very few people around to build Stonehenge and the Pyramids , rebuild the Sumerian and Indus Valley civilizations , populate the Americas , etc .
Why do other flood myths vary so greatly from the Genesis account ?
Flood myths are fairly common worldwide , and if they came from a common source , we should expect similarities in most of them .
Instead , the myths show great diversity .
[ Bailey , 1989 , pp. 5 - 10 ; Isaak , 1997 ]
For example , people survive on high land or trees in the myths about as often as on boats or rafts , and no other flood myth includes a covenant not to destroy all life again .
Why should we expect Genesis to be accurate ?
We know that other people 's sacred stories change over time [ Baaren , 1972 ] and that changes to the Genesis Flood story have occurred in later traditions [ Ginzberg , 1909 ; Utley , 1961 ] .
Is it not reasonable to assume that changes occurred between the story 's origin and its being written down in its present form ?

11 . Logical , Philosophical , and Theological Points
Are flood models consistent with the Bible ?
Creationists who write about the Flood often contradict the very story they 're trying to support .
For example , Whitcomb & Morris [ 1961 , p. 69n ] suggest that large numbers of kinds of land animals became extinct because of the Flood , while Genesis repeatedly says that Noah was ordered to take a representative sample of all kinds of land animals on the Ark to save them from extinction , and that Noah did as ordered .
Woodmorappe [ 1996 , p. 3 ] wants to leave invertebrates ( i.e. , just about " every creeping thing on the ground " ) off the ark .
Why should we give credence to a story whose most ardent supporters abandon when it 's inconvenient ?
Genesis 6 - 8 speaks only of rain , fountains , and a flood ; it makes no mention of other catastrophies which many Creationists associate with the Flood .
Their proposed Flood models not only contradict geology , they have no Biblical support , either .
How can a literal interpretation be appropriate if the text is self - contradictory ?
Genesis 6:20 and 7:14 - 15 say there were two of each kind of fowl and clean beasts , yet Genesis 7:2- 3,5 says they came in sevens .
How can a literal interpretation be consistent with reality ?
How could Noah have gathered male and female of each kind [ Gen. 7:15 - 16 ] when some species are asexual , others are parthenogenic and have only females , and others ( such as earthworms ) are hermaphrodites ?
And what about social animals like ants and termites which need the whole nest to survive ?
Why stop with the Flood story ?
If your style of Biblical interpretation makes you take the Flood literally , then should n't you also believe in a flat and stationary earth ?
[ Dan. 4:10 - 11 , Matt. 4:8 , 1 Chron .
16:30 , Psalms 93:1 , ...]
In fact , is there any reason at all why the Flood story should be taken literally ?
Jesus used parables ; why would n't God do so , too ?
Does a global flood make the whole Bible less credible ?
Davis Young , an Evangelical and geologist , wrote [ p. 163 ] :
" The maintenance of modern creationism and Flood geology not only is useless apologetically with unbelieving scientists , it is harmful .
Although many who have no scientific training have been swayed by creationist arguments , the unbelieving scientist will reason that a Christianity that believes in such nonsense must be a religion not worthy of his interest .
. . .
Modern creationism in this sense is apologetically and evangelistically ineffective .
It could even be a hindrance to the gospel .
" Another possible danger is that in presenting the gospel to the lost and in defending God 's truth we ourselves will seem to be false .
It is time for Christian people to recognize that the defense of this modern , young - Earth , Flood - geology creationism is simply not truthful .
It is simply not in accord with the facts that God has given .
Creationism must be abandoned by Christians before harm is done .
. . . "
Another Christian scientist said , " Creationism is an incredible pain in the neck , neither honest nor useful , and the people who advocate it have no idea how much damage they are doing to the credibility of belief . " [ quoted in Easterbrook , 1997 , p. 891 ]
Does the Flood story indicate an omnipotent God ?
If God is omnipotent , why not kill what He wanted killed directly ?
Why resort to a roundabout method that requires innumerable additional miracles ?
The whole idea was to rid the wicked people from the world .
Did it work ?
Finally , even if the flood model were n't riddled by all these problems , why should we accept it ?
What it does attempt to explain is already explained far more accurately , consistently , and thoroughly by conventional geology and biology , and the flood model leaves many other things unexplained , even unexplainable .
How is flood geology useful ?

Why Nintendo Gets It , or Why Sony Should Start Trying

And I thought they had logged out :
Know your roots
And that brings us to the present
The \ " next \ " generation
It blows my mind that Nintendo has so effectively proven that they \ " get\ " it .
How so ?
The Revolution controller .
What ?
Yeah , that magic wand thing probably is the future of gaming .
And furthermore , in the \ " next - gen\ " launch lineup it is starting to look like Nintendo is the only company that will deliver a truly next - gen gaming platform .
Compared to the Revolution , the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 are simply expensive upgrades to existing platforms .
Nintendo \ " gets \ " it .
Microsoft and Sony don\'t understand that a new generation of gaming machine does not automatically beget a new generation of gaming .
A \" next\ " generation requires a significant change in gaming itself .
Gamers care about hardware and hardware generations only insofar as those generations mark major changes in the way games are made and played .
Gamers care about framerate only insofar as framerate is connected to the limit of a player \'s reflexes .
The interaction of technology and creative expression and experience is complex terrain , which often understood in a highly intuitive array of impulses on the part of gamers .
This intuitive understanding of the relationship between tech and game leads easily into fetishization of game hardware :
Witness the hip NES controller belt buckles sold in mall shops worldwide or the Xbox 360 faceplates .
All tech - dependent art forms fetishize the mechanical aspects of their practice : photography , computers , sports , music .
In each case one can see similar devotion to the objects and implements of the practice on the part of the practitioners .
Deep down , however , gamers are ambivalent about this coming generation of gaming hardware .
A part of that ambivalence , whether conscious or subconscious , is the feeling that games are not going to be significantly different .
Gamers are often after the next , newest , more engaging , more immersive experience .
But in order to sell this new hardware cycle to many gamers , Sony , Microsoft , and Nintendo need to think big .
Graphics are already pretty .
Sound is already awesome .
Online gameplay is already fairly optimized .
What \'s next ?
But to really understand where I \'m coming from and where I \'m going with this , let \'s take a brief trip back through major generational shifts that have come before in gaming history .
Let\ 's revisit some historical generational shifts :
If we assume the Odyssey ( 1972 ) and Pong ( 1975 ) were first generation , then we can cite the Atari 2600 \'s ( 1977 ) advancement of removable game media , which allowed the whole game publishing industry to be created apart from the hardware manufacturing industry .
The Atari 5200 ( 1982 ) is viewed as an upgrade , and although systems such as Colecovision ( 1982 ) and Intellivision ( 1980 ) came out during the heyday of Atari\ 's popularity , we generally speak of all of these systems as being in the same \ " generation\ " of gaming .
The next major evolution is the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES - 1985 ) .
Nintendo revived the American games industry ( currently the largest market in the world for games ) with a fresh take on game design accompanied by a major technical upgrade that facilitated better graphics .
Insofar as technical enhancements allow new kinds of game designs , they contribute to new generations of gaming .
This generation was also populated by the Sega Master System , which was the largest competition for Nintendo and lagged far behind .
In the first formal generational shift , the NES was followed by the SNES ( 1991 ) .
We gained four new buttons on the controller , and Sega followed suit adding more buttons to the Genesis ( 1989 ) controllers .
Games became better looking and smarter , and because we had so many more options for control , games as diverse as Actraiser and Mortal Kombat are possible and become popular .
This change brought a whole new level of physical and conceptual complexity to console gaming .
Role - playing games became much more complex and early 3D experiments are born .
There were many attempts to push a generational shift to the CD - era , including most notably the SegaCD ( 1992 ) and Panasonic\'s 3D0 ( 1993 ) .
But it was n\'t until Sony launched the PlayStation ( 1995 ) that the concept of CDs took off .
This led to game design developments that have shaped much of the current gaming landscape : Cutscenes became more beautiful and cinematic , appreciated as works of art in their own right .
The ability to include a lot of dialogue and video led to the general movement of \ " games as cinematic experience \ " design .
The early addition of an analog joystick to the controller was first seen in the Nintendo 64 controller , and gamers were especially sold on it after Mario 64 demonstrated a 3D approach to platform gaming .
But it was Sony\'s Dual Shock controller that made dual analog joysticks and force - feedback a standard feature of console controllers .
Games continued to become more complex and textured , and the number of gamers continued to grow .
In this generation the Nintendo 64 ( 1996 ) stayed with their cartridge - based format , which , in the end , cost them the number one spot in the gaming industry .
Cartridges just did n\'t have as many advantages as CDs ?
the ability to store so much data had become crucial to game design and development , and gamers quickly grew to love these new qualities of games .
The current generation is marked by the release of the Microsoft Xbox ( 2001 ) , Sony\'s PlayStation 2 ( 2000 ) and Nintendo\ 's GameCube ( 2001 ) , which are all disc - based systems .
Online play was a mantra for Microsoft and Sony , both of whom managed to make that pay off to a greater extent than ever before .
However , at the same time , gamers did n\'t flock to online play the way they flocked to Final Fantasy VII ( often cited as a crucial title in the rise of gamer\ 's expectations of graphical and cinematic quality ) .
All of the platforms have benefited from another increase in technical power , allowing more enemies , more complex AI and game behaviors , and , most visibly , better graphics .
The graphical fidelity achieved in the current generation of 3D modeling and animation has eliminated much of the need for artificial game design mechanisms ( such as the ubiquitous sparkle as illustrated in games such as Resident Evil ) ?
now the game graphics are so clear we can just see the game - world objects we might be interested in .
Nintendo\ 's rejection of the online arena has just added to their image as an eccentric tinkerer who makes toys of the highest quality .
The problem is they are n\'t very fast , and sometimes they are just plain weird .
The idea of connectivity and connecting the Game Boy Advance to the GameCube never really caught on .
And the only bright spots in Nintendo\ 's last few years have been some standout first - party titles for GameCube and their handheld gaming hardware , which continues to dominate the handheld side of the industry .
The current generation of game hardware has largely been a letdown .
There have been some amazing games created , but the vast majority of games still doggedly pursue the cinematic approach to game design and confusing pervasive gaming with game - themed marketing .
Every time Microsoft wants to sell us anything it creates a game .
And it \'s painfully ironic that the genre of alt - reality games ( often lauded as a critical darling and game design breakthrough ) has mainly been used to sell us more games and game hardware .
Online gameplay has failed to really take off .
Sony\'s online games have been plagued with various cheats and hacks , and the network adapter has not sold through to as many PS2 owners as the company would have liked .
Microsoft is in a similar position , fully acknowledging that the vast majority of Xbox owners have never logged into Xbox Live , in spite of critical raves about the quality of service .
In part , game design has not really figured out the parameters of online console gaming , and in part online plans have been too focused on providing a few extra maps or skins as enticement to keep playing .
Heck , not much has happened in the way of unique online gaming ideas since Doom .
Rather than pursue an innovative game design model , game publishers have followed an expansion and enhancement model of business which has generally been a warm - up to full - fledged console - based e-commerce in the coming generation .
The problem is that online shopping has very little to do with the evolution of game design .
Combine all of this with an incredibly conservative atmosphere in the mainstream gaming industry , and we can easily understand why the industry is like it is these days .
Most games that come out are sequels to proven game design concepts .
A majority of games are based on franchises native to other media formats ?
movies , comic books , cartoons , celebrities , TV shows .
With over $ 7.3 Billion at stake , the industry is loathe to take risks .
And with a firm grip on a target demographic most industries pay through the nose to access , game publishers have little reason to try to expand their audience .
It \'s a classic example of the economics and rationale of the industry working against itself , just as we\'ve seen in the music and film industries and their struggles to deal with online distribution and marketing .
Regardless of Nintendo\ 's lagging position in the current home console race , in the next - generation of home consoles it looks more and more with every announcement like Nintendo is poised to regain a much more competitive role in the industry .
Of course , the biggest hurdle Nintendo has to get over is the ballyhoo hurdle .
In many ways games can learn from the history of other media forms , and the showmanship ( aka balyhoo ) of 1950s cinema provides an example of how gimmicks might entice audiences for a short time , but ultimately cannot become longstanding conventions of the form .
Think of 3D movies , Cinerama , or Smell - O - Vision .
A classic example is ( 1959 , dir .
William Castle ) which used buzzers inserted into the seats of theaters to add a \ " shocking \ " real - world special effect to the movie .
This , of course , did n\'t catch on to become a staple of the cinematic experience .
But sometimes innovation happens .
The whole reason behind 1950s cinema ballyhoo was a drive to make the theater experience different from TV .
Experiments like Cinerama ( an extreme multi-channel projection that gave a \ " surround - view\ " effect ) eventually evolved into what we consider \ " widescreen\ " or the theatrical aspect ratio .
It can be argued that the widescreen format is more immersive , that it better emulates our natural field of vision .
Less charitable analysis might conclude that it was simply one of the ballyhoo techniques that was easiest to accommodate in production and distribution of films ( it \ 's much easier than wiring theaters with seat buzzers ) .
And it seems clear that part of the reason widescreen format has caught on for television and videogames has a lot to do with the small screen\ 's gradual mutation into a very private large screen , and an aspiration of television and games to be as \ " good\ " as movies .
So in this case , we can see things coming full - circle into the birth of a well - defined convention : the aspect ratio of the future is 16:9 , no longer 4:3 .
But I digress .
Nintendo needs only to make their system do all the work of translating stock gaming commands from the other systems in order to make multiplatform releases painless to port to Revolution , and then they must provide developers with an easy kit to take advantage of the more complicated interactive potential offered by the Revolution .
As we\ 've seen with the NES , SNES and PlayStation One , a new controller design is definitely a viable avenue for game hardware innovation .
It is no mistake that every controller on the past five home consoles manufactured in the 10 years since Sony launched the Dual Shock controller has featured two analog joysticks and rumble features .
Microsoft has never been an innovator in the area of games .
They have been a standardizer and an optimizer , and in such a role they have helped create a clear set of conventions in the industry , mainly imitating the best qualities of all their rivals and adding to it their expertise in home computing .
The Xbox is more versatile , more powerful , and by all accounts is one of the easiest platforms to develop for .
Plus , it has the added benefit of easily porting to Windows and various Windows - derivative platforms .
Windows is THE gaming platform for PCs .
We often forget that in many ways Microsoft has already won in another games - industry war for domination .
Granted , games have been developed for Xbox that are brilliant , but even a look at the flagship franchise for Xbox , Halo , reveals the quintessential lack of innovation inherent in the vast majority of Xbox titles .
That lack of innovation stems from the hardware itself .
Halo is a game about saving Earth from impending destruction .
Who wants to destroy Earth ?
Some aliens .
At its best , Halo is a wonderful reprise of very old science fiction plots , much likeis a wonderful reprise of very old adventure plots .
At its worst , Halo is a much prettier version of Space Invaders : shoot , shoot , dodge .
What Halo offers is not any innovation in game design ;
Halo is just extremely well - made .
If it innovates , it innovates in how well it integrates with the rest of your life :
You can track games and stats online , create whole websites dedicated to clans using Bungie .
net \'s free tools , and have game stats and invites messaged directly to your cell phone or MSN - aware smart device .
Halo has loads of options for multiplayer and has received plenty of post - release attention in the form of both free and pay - for - download map packs and game expansions .
All of these are enhancements of longstanding game design models .
In all reality , this is what Microsoft promised , and this is what it has delivered : Easy for developers to make games for .
And if a developer has a good idea , it can work well on the Xbox ?
it \'s easier to make , quicker to get out , looks great .
The hard drive in the Xbox has not facilitated great advances in game design as was initially hoped ?
it \'s been used to speed up load times and offer more post - release enhancements .
As I mark it , those features fall squarely on the optimization end of the spectrum .
The Xbox 360 does not look to deviate from this :
Everything that is already on the Xbox will return in a better form , and we can look forward to at least one more new device : the Xbox 360 camera .
But not much is known about this , and the game press assumes this device will be used for Eye Toy - like game control .
Again , not an original innovation , although a welcome addition which Xbox 360 will hopefully make great use of .
Microsoft is looking strong to maintain its second - place position in the industry .
With luck , that share will grow somewhat .
Gamers can appreciate optimization and convenience , and are always very discerning about overall quality .
Xbox has always delivered on this ( for the most part ) .
No , the company that needs to be looking over its shoulder is , obviously , Sony .
It \'s lonely sitting on such a big , giant peak , and there \'s only one way to go from there .
With two big competitors coming out swinging , Sony needs something more than a boomerang controller redesign .
Thankfully , the company has recently announced that the PlayStation 3 controller will likely change before release .
Will it become a motion - sensing pointer / wand ?
That seems unlikely .
But the PS3 will need something more than online shopping integration to pull this one out .
Many gamers have stuck with PlayStation because of the wide variety of niche titles available :
The bigger selection of quirky games has helped Sony stay on top .
But if those game developers start working more with Nintendo , and if Microsoft delivers the better \ " traditional \ " gaming experience , the market could make a major shift .
The PlayStation platform does enjoy the benefit of having led to two major game controller innovations already : The Dual - Shock analog controller and the Eye Toy .
Both of these were after - market add - ons to existing systems ( the Dual - Shock for PS1 and Eye Toy for PS2 ) .
Future plans have been announced to add a \ " wand\ " to the Eye Toy control scheme in order to compensate for the issues caused by varying room quality .
And I should admit up front that I \'m stepping out somewhat to call the Eye Toy a true gaming innovation .
My reasoning goes like this : Cameras and machine vision are unavoidable future components of any computing system , so even if Eye Toy never comes out with a truly perfected version , the idea of this technology is here to stay .
It is increasingly looking like Nintendo might just be next year \'s Sony and next year \'s Sony might look a lot like this year \'s Nintendo .
Or perhaps Sony can pull out something to surprise us all .
This is definitely a two - console market at this time .
Most gaming households will own at least two gaming consoles .
There is a better chance they will upgrade to the next generation of the system they currently own , so Sony has a great advantage there .
And in the end , economics may dictate user\ 's decisions more than anything else , which would play a role in people \'s decisions about which next generation console to buy .
And a modestly priced Revolution , with retro games to appeal to parents and an approachable controller to appeal to non-gamers , could do well is such economic climates .
To further complicate predictions either Microsoft or Sony could decide to create an after - market peripheral that adds the same functionality as the Revolution controller .
We also have n\'t really seen much of Sony\'s PlayStation 3 , so we can \'t be completely confident in our analysis of its hardware .
But it \'s clear that Sony is really the only company that has anything to lose in the coming console war .
And its clear that Nintendo is not simply rolling over in submission as so many have predicted they would .
We won\'t know for sure about the Revolution or its revolutionary controller until we get it in our hands .
The tightness ?
the \ " goodness\ " ? of the control will undoubtedly be the deciding factor in the success or failure of Nintendo\ 's grand experiment .
Anything less than 100 % reliability and impeccable responsiveness will be unacceptable to gamers .
But it \'s good to see that one of the big three are finally thinking big about gaming .
It \'s high time somebody put the games ahead of the marketing tie-ins .
If your idea of gaming enhancements is supporting high - end movie discs or touting your online shopping site , then you need to get new people to think about gaming for you .
Yeah , I \'m looking at you Microsoft and Sony ?
the gauntlet is down .
What do you got for us now ?
