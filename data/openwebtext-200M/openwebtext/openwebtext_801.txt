college is n’t what it used to be
College was supposed to open doors to a bright future .
Instead , it became a debt - generating Catch - 22 for many .
A recent story on BusinessWeek.com shines a light on the fact that a lot of graduates are struggling to pay back their student loans .
They went to colleges expecting to get degrees which will land them in stable careers that pay enough to get out of debt and start a long , rewarding life .
Instead , they ’re getting low pay , few employment options in their field and a career is something they can only dream about .
If you ’re one of the younger generations you know this firsthand .
Careers are things for people in their 30s and 40s .
You ’re just out there trying to pay the bills and unsure if your degree will ever be of any real use .
Put away the world ’s smallest violin , this is n’t going to be a post about the plight of today ’s new college grads .
Instead , we ’re going to focus on the very real challenges for people who have to go to college today and tomorrow .
The simple idea of getting a degree , getting a job in the field for which you trained and building a career from part - time intern up to a cushy post in middle management does n’t work anymore .
It ’s been altered by new technology , outsourcing and the kinds of unpredictable shifts in economic focus that leave entire fields of study in limbo at best and obsolete at worst .
Simply put , four year degrees are n’t keeping up with the economy and if you pick a profession today , there ’s no guarantee that the market for it wo n’t shut closed just a few semesters from your planned graduation date and leave you pondering whether to change majors as a junior or just take your chances and hope your grades will get you hired .
So on the one hand , many jobs require a degree .
But because the economy can’t wait for a four year phase and people working longer than ever are n’t rushing to retire and make room for an army of new grads to take their place ( especially in a deep , brutal recession which took the legs from under their 401k plans and placed their target retirement date between “ maybe someday ” and “ never ” ) , there are a lot of people with degrees and very little chance of getting a job .
Even if you graduated suma cum laude , it ’s really hard to get hired for a job that does n’t exist .
Or a job that ’s slated to go overseas at half the cost .
Unless you have the ability to predict what jobs will be in demand four years from now , you ’re making an educated gamble when enrolling .
And the government is n’t going to make it easier for you to get your education , actually steering you to take on mode debt and apply for more and more student loans .
Whenever state governments need to save money , one of the budgets they can cut with almost no resistance is higher education .
Cutting deeper and deeper into the money slated for a state university or aid that goes to some private schools , they force colleges which rely on this type of funding to raise tuition as well as room and board .
This is not to say that colleges flawlessly spend the money they have already and there are n’t places where they can save , but in reality is that a deep enough cut from the state means that you ’re now paying more for your degree .
As tuition goes up and pay for jobs goes down , the debt load you have to take grows .
In the past , a student waiting tables for five years could pay off his or her education .
Today , years after years of nearly double digit tuition hikes , make this idealistic scenario very improbable .
Sure you can go out and get scholarships , but scholarships very rarely pay for more than half of your bill .
So where does that leave us ?
If you go to college and end up in worse financial shape than you started and with very few other career options , then why go to college ?
It ’s almost like to enter the corporate world , you have to go through a hazing that lasts for decades .
We can look down on the new grads and preach that they should ’ve chosen their professions better but unless we can reasonably expect college students to have powers of precognition and outdo economists in predicting the future of the global economy , all we ’d be doing is rubbing salt into the wound while acting high and mighty .
The new grads are n’t being integrated into the economy as many past generations were and that ’s a point of concern .
We have to ask ourselves if we ’re basically outsourcing and mechanizing millions of people out of the workforce and consider revamping our current approaches to globalization .
Rather than trying to compete with a low - cost foreign workforce , companies could instead cut their costs with efficiency and innovation , something that new grads would be very good at doing .
Or rather than just sending orders for electronic components overseas , they could set up their own high quality , hyper - efficient assembly plants .
We need to start thinking of how a new generation of college grads would find jobs and how to sustain our economy beyond a year to year time frame .
One key to that is realizing that globalization the way it ’s being practiced now is a one way street .
In a truly globalized economy , our grads would be able to hold jobs in other nations and help them keep up with international demands for their services .
But instead , these nations issue protectionist edicts which restrict all work to local residents and the only foreign workers they will allow are employed by multinationals .
We need to reply by paying attention to our own economy and figuring out how to make it competitive without immediately trying to ship a division or two overseas because it ’s an easy way to cut costs .
Your science fiction fantasy may be coming a reality , if IBM has anything to say about it .
The company was recently granted a patent for bionic body armor , originally filed last March , that 's intended to bestow the wearer the power to dodge bullets .
The device works by constantly emitting electromagnetic waves that bounce off any fast - moving projectiles , and it uses the data to calculate risky trajectories .
If the object in question is determined to be a threat , muscle stimulators activate and cause the wearer 's body to contort in such way to avoid being hit .
It works under the idea that a sniper typically fires from a distance , given the armor time to detect the oncoming bullet and react accordingly .
Check out an image of from IBM 's filing after the break .
Here 's hoping it can detect lasers , too .

I ’m thrilled to spread the news further that we have just made available all public metadata ( microformats , eRDF and RDFa data ) that we crawl through the BOSS API .
See the official announcement and commentaries throughout the Web .
This means essentially opening up all public data available to SearchMonkey applications , and thus making it possible for anyone to experiment with various forms of semantic search that go well beyond changing the way abstracts look .
Consider for example the microsearch prototype I blogged about a few months ago , which showed rich abstracts , plus temporal and geographic visualizations based on metadata .
You can now build something like microsearch in a matter of hours , and in a highly scalable fashion .
Last , but not least , the terms of the BOSS API allows you to monetize your search engine in any way you want .
So if you think you can build a better search engine through semantics , this is a great time to start !
All we ask is to give us feedback on what you do , minimally by tagging your experiment with the tag ‘ bossmashup ’ .
' KopBusters ' investigators bait Odessa police to illegally raid house : Video Stephen C. Webster
Published : Sunday December 7 , 2008
Print This Email This For former drug interdiction officer Barry Cooper , the media storm is just beginning .
His upcoming reality show , ' KopBusters , ' a ' To Catch A Predator ' style crusade against dirty officers , sparked an immediate response after RAW STORY covered a news brief of their first sting .
Cooper has now released footage from the initial episode of ' KopBusters , ' in which the Odessa , TX police department raids a suspected marijuana grow house , only to discover they played right into the filmmaker 's hands .
As surveillance cameras roll , the police slowly figure out they 've been had , seemingly caught red - handed of illegally overreaching in a first - of - its - kind operation .
On his Web site , KopBusters.com , Cooper describes how the sting took place .
" KopBusters rented a house in Odessa , Texas and began growing two small Christmas trees under a grow light similar to those used for growing marijuana .
When faced with a suspected marijuana grow , the police usually use illegal FLIR cameras and / or lie on the search warrant affidavit claiming they have probable cause to raid the house .
Instead of conducting a proper investigation which usually leads to no probable cause , the Kops lie on the affidavit claiming a confidential informant saw the plants and / or the police could smell marijuana coming from the suspected house .
" The trap was set and less than 24 hours later , the Odessa narcotics unit raided the house only to find KopBuster 's attorney waiting under a system of complex gadgetry and spy cameras that streamed online to the KopBuster 's secret mobile office nearby .
" The attorney was handcuffed and later released when eleven KopBuster detectives arrived with the media in tow to question the illegal raid .
The police refused to give KopBusters the search warrant affidavit which is suspected to contain the lies regarding the probable cause . "

WebKit now supports explicit animations in CSS .
As a counterpart to transitions , animations provide a way to declare repeating animated effects , with keyframes , completely in CSS .
With a recent nightly build , you can see the above animation in action .
Let ’s take a look at how to use CSS animations , starting with an example of a bouncing box .
See this example live in a recent WebKit nightly build .
Specifying animations is easy .
You first describe the animation effect using the @ - webkit - keyframes rule .
@ - webkit - keyframes bounce { from { left : 0 px ; } to { left : 200 px ; } }
A @ - webkit - keyframes block contains rule sets called keyframes .
A keyframe defines the style that will be applied for that moment within the animation .
The animation engine will smoothly interpolate style between the keyframes .
In the above example we define an animation called “ bounce ” to have two keyframes : one for the start of the animation ( the “ from ” block ) and one for the end ( the “ to ” block ) .
Once we have defined an animation , we apply it using - webkit - animation - name and related properties .
div { - webkit- animation - name : bounce ; - webkit-animation - duration : 4s ; -webkit-animation-iteration -count : 10 ; - webkit- animation - direction : alternate ; }
The above rule attaches the “ bounce ” animation , sets the duration to 4 seconds , makes it execute a total of 10 times , and has every other iteration play in reverse .
Now , suppose you want to party like it is 1995 and make your own super - blink style .
In this case we specify an animation with multiple keyframes , each with different values for opacity , background color and transform .
@ - webkit - keyframes pulse { 0 % { background - color : red ; opacity : 1.0 ; - webkit - transform : scale ( 1.0 ) rotate ( 0deg ) ; } 33 % { background - color : blue ; opacity : 0.75 ; - webkit - transform : scale ( 1.1 ) rotate ( - 5deg ) ; } 67 % { background - color : green ; opacity : 0.5 ; - webkit - transform : scale ( 1.1 ) rotate ( 5deg ) ; } 100 % { background - color : red ; opacity : 1.0 ; - webkit - transform : scale ( 1.0 ) rotate ( 0deg ) ; } } .pulsedbox { - webkit - animation - name : pulse ; - webkit-animation - duration : 4s ; - webkit- animation - direction : alternate ; - webkit - animation - timing - function : ease - in - out ; }
Again , see this example live in a recent WebKit nightly build .
Keyframes are specified using percentage values , defining the moment along the animation duration that the keyframe snapshots .
The “ from ” and “ to ” keywords are equivalent to “ 0 % ” and “ 100 % ” respectively .
CSS Animations is one of the enhancements to CSS proposed by the WebKit project that we ’ve been calling CSS Effects ( eg. gradients , masks , transitions ) .
The goal is to provide properties that allow Web developers to create graphically rich content .
In many cases animations are presentational , and therefore belong in the styling system .
This allows developers to write declarative rules for animations , replacing lots of hard - to - maintain animation code in JavaScript .
The other good news is that the WebKit on iPhone 2.0 already supports CSS Animations ( as well as CSS Transforms and CSS Transitions ) .
The iPhone implementation has been optimized for the platform so you get fantastic performance .
Combining animations , transitions and transforms allows for some really impressive content .
We ’re documenting these enhancements on webkit.org and are proposing the specifications to standards bodies .
Note that since they are currently features specific to WebKit they are implemented with a - webkit - prefix , although the specifications do not use the prefix .
You can find more examples on Apple ’s Web Applications Developer Center .

Historians : Six presidents worse than Bush Rachel Oswald
Published : Monday February 16 , 2009
Print This Email This Devoted Bush bashers will be surprised to learn that despite what they may think of No. 43s presidency , according to a survey of historians , George W. Bush is in fact , not the worst POTUS ever  hes only the 7th worst .
The honor of worst American president ever this Presidents Day goes to James Buchanan , who directly preceded Abraham Lincoln as president and who is largely blamed for not doing enough to prevent the Civil War .
To commemorate Presidents Day , C- SPAN updated its yearly survey of historians  rankings of past commanders - in - chief .
Not surprisingly Abraham Lincoln was ranked as the best president of all time , followed by George Washington .
FDR , Theodore Roosevelt , Harry Truman and JFK round out the Top 5 .
Among George W. Bushs most ardent critics he is commonly referred to as the worst president ever .
A USA Today / Gallup poll , conducted in mid-January this year , found only 34 percent of Americans approved of the job he was doing as president .
Bush has received the worst approval ratings of any president in the 70 - year history of the Gallup Poll .
In September , right when the financial markets first imploded , his approval rating sank to 19 percent , according to one poll .
The second worst president ever award , according to C - SPAN , goes to Lincolns successor , Andrew Johnson , the first president ever to be impeached .
Rounding out the bottom ranking presidents are Franklin Pierce in 40th place , William Henry Harrison in 39th place and Warren G. Harding in 38th place .
More than 60 historians and professional observers of the American presidency contributed to C - SPAN 's 2009 survey .
Ronald Reagan beat out his two immediate successors , Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush , for the No. 10 slot .
Clinton received a ranking of 15 and Bush senior a ranking of 18 .
Somewhat surprisingly , Richard Nixon was not ranked in the bottom quarter percentile .
He managed a just mediocre ranking of 27 .
Though Nixon remains best known in the American public mind for the Watergate scandal , he does receive points from historians and foreign policy experts for his work improving relations with China and the Soviet Union .
Jimmy Carter only did slightly better than Nixon this year with a ranking of 25 ( down three places from 2000 ) .
Rankings for Clinton , George H.W. Bush and Reagan have all improved over the years , though Clinton has improved his rankings the most .
From 2000 to 2009 , Clinton advanced from a ranking of No. 21 to a ranking of No. 15 .
In that same time frame George H.W. Bush improved his rankings by two slots , moving from No. 20 to No. 18 while Reagan advanced by one ranking to No. 10 from No. 11 .
George Washington received the highest ranking of any president in the category of international relations ( George W. Bush received the second - worst ranking ) .
Washington also beat out Honest Abe for the No. 1 ranking in moral authority ( in this category Clinton came in 37th place ) .
Clinton did however come in third place behind Washington and Lincoln respectively in the category of economic management ( George W. Bush came in 40th place here ) .
" Bill Clinton and Ulysses S. Grant are n't often mentioned in the same sentence - until now , " said historian Richard Norton Smith to ABC News .
" Participants in the latest C - SPAN survey of presidential historians have boosted each man significantly higher than in the original survey conducted in 2000 .
All of which goes to show two things : the fluidity with which presidential reputations are judged , and the difficulty of assessing any president who has only just recently left office . "

While a higher level of education may help lower the risk of Alzheimer 's disease , new research shows that once educated people start to become forgetful , a higher level of education does not appear to protect against how fast they will lose their memory .
The research is published in the February 3 , 2009 , print issue of NeurologyÂ® , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology .
In the study , scientists tested the thinking skills of 6,500 people with an average age of 72 from the Chicago area with different levels of education .
The education level of people in the study ranged from eight years of school or fewer to 16 or more years of schooling .
Interviews and tests about memory and thinking functions were given every three years for an average of 6.5 years .
At the beginning of the study , those with more education had better memory and thinking skills than those with less education .
However , education was not related to how rapidly these skills declined during the course of the study .
The study found that results remained the same regardless of other factors related to education such as occupation and race and the effects of practice with the tests .
" This is an interesting and important finding because scientists have long debated whether aging and memory loss tend to have a lesser affect on highly educated people .
While education is associated with the memory 's ability to function at a higher level , we found no link between higher education and how fast the memory loses that ability , " says study author Robert S. Wilson , PhD , with the Alzheimer 's Disease Center at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago .
The study was supported by the National Institute on Aging and by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences .
The American Academy of Neurology , an association of more than 21,000 neurologists and neuroscience professionals , is dedicated to promoting the highest quality patient - centered neurologic care .
A neurologist is a doctor with specialized training in diagnosing , treating and managing disorders of the brain and nervous system such as multiple sclerosis , restless legs syndrome , Alzheimer 's disease , narcolepsy , and stroke .

The IMF has already provided loans to Latvia and Hungary The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and other lenders have agreed in principle to provide Romania 20bn euros ( £ 18.4bn ; $ 27 bn ) in aid .
The IMF will lend 12.95bn euros , the European Union will provide 5bn euros and the World Bank will lend 1bn euros .
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) is to invest up to 1bn euros in Romania over two years .
Romania is the third EU nation to be given IMF aid recently , after loans were given to Latvia and Hungary .
The latest IMF economic program has been agreed by its staff mission , but needs approval from the executive board and management .
Similarly the World Bank needs to agree its part of the deal and the European Commission must approve its contribution .
' Perception '
The IMF said core measures under the plan are aimed at " strengthening fiscal policy further to reduce the government 's financing needs and improve long term sustainability , thus preparing Romania for eventual entry into the eurozone " .
BBC correspondent Oana Lungescu said : " In just a few months , Romania 's economic fate has turned .
" From a country which last year registered the EU 's highest growth rate , it is now shedding thousands of jobs mainly in the car and steel sectors , and facing the collapse of a property boom . "
Following the IMF announcement , Ionut Dumitru of Raiffeisen Bank said : " This is very good news for Romania because the sum covers entirely the financing gap . "
" I expect the first impact of it would be an improvement of foreign investors ' perception towards the country . "
The EBRD said about half of its loan would be dedicated to the financial sector , with the remainder invested across the broader economy , including in the corporate , energy and energy efficiency and national and municipal infrastructure sectors .

More Pressure for Bush Torture Probe Amid grassroots pressure to hold senior Bush administration officials accountable for torture and other crimes , an influential Democratic senator said President Barack Obama and Congress have no choice but to mount a serious investigation because to do nothing would invite a repetition of the abuses .

Printer friendly “ We need to follow this thing into those dense weeds and shine a bright light into what was done , ” Sen .
Sheldon Whitehouse , D - Rhode Island , said in a speech at Brown University on Saturday .
“ We can paper it over if we choose , but the blueprint is still lying there for others to do it all over again .
It ’s important that we not let this moment pass . ”
Whitehouse ’s remarks were made at two - day medical conference sponsored by Physicians for Human Rights ( PHR ) , which has called for an investigation into the Bush administration ’s use of interrogation techniques that have been widely regarded as torture .
At the conference , PHR officials gave Whitehouse a petition signed by attendees calling on Congress to form a committee to probe the torture of prisoners detained in the “ war on terror . ”
Last year , PHR published a report , “ Broken Laws , Broken Lives , ” that concluded that 11 former detainees held in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay were systematically tortured .
The prisoners were later released and were never charged with any crimes .
President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney both admitted publicly last year they had personally authorized the waterboarding of at least three suspected terrorists and allowed interrogators to use harsh methods against 33 other suspects .
However , Bush and Cheney denied that these actions violated anti-torture laws .
Waterboarding is a technique that makes the victim believe he is drowning and has been regarded as torture at least since the Spanish Inquisition .
The U.S. government has treated its use in battlefield interrogations as a war crime , and Whitehouse noted that the Justice Department prosecuted a Texas sheriff in the 1980s for using waterboarding to extract confessions from suspects .
Incoming Attorney General Eric
Holder said during his confirmation hearing earlier this month that “ waterboarding is torture , ” but the Obama administration has hesitated to launch new investigations of the Bush administration ’s crimes partly out of fear that would infuriate Republicans who might retaliate by obstructing Democratic economic plans during a deepening recession .
In a column published Monday on the Huffington Post , House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers said an examination of what the Bush administration has done requires a comprehensive overview of how these abusive policies evolved .
“ While disparate investigations by committees of Congress , private organizations and the press have uncovered many important facts , no single investigation has had access to the full range of information regarding the Bush administration 's interrelated programs on surveillance , detention , interrogation and rendition , ” Conyers wrote .
“ The existence of a substantially developed factual record will simplify the work to come , but can not replace it .
Furthermore , much of this information , such as the Central Intelligence Agency 's 2004 Inspector General report on interrogation , remains highly classified and hidden from the American people .
An independent review is needed to determine the maximum information that can be publicly released . ”
At the conference on Saturday , Whitehouse , a former federal prosecutor , said it ’s crucial that the Obama administration confront Bush ’s torture policies early , with an eye toward holding individuals accountable for violating federal and international laws .
“ The U.S. government took part in inhumane , brutal interrogation techniques that were torture , ” Whitehouse said .
“ The question is , what does it mean when a country as a whole heads down a road like this ?
It is an important story to tell to understand the way democracy works . ”
Whitehouse also rejected the Bush administration ’s claim that officials are innocent because they had approval from Justice Department lawyers who adopted a novel and narrow definition of torture .
Whitehouse said that simply having in - house lawyers fix the law around a policy does not make it legal .
Internal Probe A year ago , Whitehouse and Sen. Dick Durbin , D - Illinois , wrote a letter to the Justice Department ’s watchdog agency requesting an investigation into the role “ Justice Department officials [ played ] in authorizing and / or overseeing the use of waterboarding by the Central Intelligence Agency ... and whether those who authorized it violated the law . ”
The senators ’ Feb. 12 , 2008 , letter to Inspector General Glenn Fine and H. Marshall Jarrett , head of the Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) , asked them to examine whether the legal advice met professional standards and whether the lawyers were “ insulated from outside pressure to reach a particular conclusion ? ”
Whitehouse and Durbin also asked what role was played by Bush ’s White House and the CIA in possibly influencing “ deliberations about the lawfulness of waterboarding ? ”
Less than a week later , Jarrett responded by saying the senators ’ concerns were already part of a pending investigation that OPR was conducting into the genesis of the Aug.
1 , 2002 , legal opinion widely known as the “ torture memo . ”
The memo , which gave a legal stamp of approval for the Bush administration ’s torture policies , was written by Deputy Attorney General John Yoo , who worked in the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) , and was signed by his boss , Jay Bybee , who is now a federal appeals court judge .
Yoo is a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley .
The OPR inquiry is expected to be completed by early March .
An aide to Whitehouse did not respond to questions about whether the senator has received any update on the investigation .
A spokesperson for Durbin did not return calls for comment .
Whitehouse is a member of the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence committees ; Durbin is the Senate Majority Whip and close ally of President Barack Obama .
John Bradshaw , the chief policy officer for PHR , said at the Brown University conference that “ accountability ” is the paramount concern to his organization .
“ We need to re-establish the fact that no one is above the law , ” Bradshaw said .
For the medical professionals who attended the PHR conference , the Yoo - Bybee torture memo was particularly disturbing because it was derived from a legal opinion about a statute written in 2000 regarding health benefits .
“ They got that standard , from all places , from health - care reimbursement law , ” Whitehouse noted .
“ The words happened to be useful to them , but they were taken out of context . ”
The Yoo - Bybee legal opinion stated that unless the amount of pain administered to a detainee results in injury " such as death , organ failure , or serious impairment of body functions " then the interrogation technique could not be defined as torture .
Since waterboarding is not intended to cause death or organ failure – only the panicked gag reflex associated with drowning – it was deemed not to be torture .
Whitehouse said Yoo ’s opinion , and the fact that the Bush administration relied upon it , was “ beyond malpractice ” and “ raises the specter that these things were overlooked ” just to advance policy .

When making complex decisions , legitimate factors sometimes mask choices influenced by prejudice — so bias is hard to detect .
Recent research untangled some of these complex scenarios revealing that people are willing to sacrifice quite a lot to fulfill their subconscious biases .
Psychologists asked volunteers to imagine they and a partner would compete together in a trivia quiz .
Participants viewed profiles of two potential partners that described each person ’s education , IQ and previous trivia game experience .
A photograph of either a thin or an overweight person was attached to each profile .
Subjects indicated which of the two potential partners they would prefer , then judged 23 more such pairings , each with a new mix of attributes .
Teasing out which variables affected people ’s choices , the researchers found that participants were willing to sacrifice 12 IQ points in a trivia partner to have one who was thin .
In a similar experiment , the group found that when comparing successive pairs of job offers , study subjects were willing to take a 22 percent salary cut to have a male boss .
“ There ’s a price to pay for biases that we may not even be aware of , ” says lead author Eugene Caruso of the University of Chicago .
“ If you take a lower salary in order to have a male boss or you choose a partner who has a lower IQ but is thin , the person you ’re discriminating against is yourself . ”

The police 's use of wiretaps has forced some criminals on to the internet Criminals in Italy are increasingly making phone calls over the internet in order to avoid getting caught through mobile phone intercepts , police say .
Officers in Milan say organised crime , arms and drugs traffickers , and prostitution rings are turning to Skype in order to frustrate investigators .
The police say Skype 's encryption system is a secret which the company refuses to share with the authorities .
Investigators have become increasingly reliant on wiretaps in recent years .
Customs and tax police in Milan have highlighted the Skype issue .
They overheard a suspected cocaine trafficker telling an accomplice to switch to Skype in order to get details of a 2kg ( 4.4lb ) drug consignment .
Heated debate Investigators say intercepts of telephone calls have become an essential tool of the police , who spend millions of euros each year tracking down crime through wiretaps of landlines and mobile phones .
But the law may be about to change .
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's right - wing government has drawn up a bill which would restrict police wiretaps to only the most serious crimes .
Much crime reporting in the Italian media is based on leaks of wiretaps and leading politicians , including Mr Berlusconi himself , have found to their embarrassment that details of their private telephone conversations have sometimes been leaked to newspapers .
Under the new law reporting of details of criminal investigations obtained through wiretaps would become illegal until a final verdict has been delivered .
Given the extreme slowness of Italian justice , this would mean that details of cases now before the courts might be reported by the press only in 15 years time .
Not only have Italian journalists been protesting at the new draft bill , but a heated debate is also going on about it within the country 's highest body for the administration of justice - the supreme council of the magistrature , composed of the country 's top judges .

Antarctica is warming .
That is the conclusion of scientists analyzing half a century of temperatures on the continent , and the findings may help resolve a climate enigma at the bottom of the planet .
Some regions of Antarctica , particularly the peninsula that stretches toward South America , have warmed rapidly in recent years , contributing to the disintegration of ice shelves and accelerating the sliding of glaciers .
But weather stations in other locations , including the one at the South Pole , have recorded a cooling trend .
That ran counter to the forecasts of computer climate models , and global warming skeptics have pointed to Antarctica in questioning the reliability of the models .
In the new study , scientists took into account satellite measurements to interpolate temperatures in the vast areas between the sparse weather stations .
“ We now see warming is taking place on all seven of the earth ’s continents in accord with what models predict as a response to greenhouse gases , ” said Eric J. Steig , a professor of earth and space sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle , who is the lead author of a paper to be published Thursday in the journal Nature .

Gordon Brown has reiterated his call for a clean - up of the financial system to ensure what he called " banking responsibility " in the UK and abroad .
In a speech to Labour activists in Bristol , the prime minister said banks had lost sight of basic moral values .
He also repeated his promise of legal action to recover pension pay - outs negotiated by bosses of failed banks .
But the Tories said Mr Brown " was part of the problem " because the banking crisis had happened on his watch .
The British Banking Association insisted that the bulk of the industry was performing well .
' Ordinary values '
The prime minister told members of Labour 's National Policy Forum that there had been " the biggest collapse in the banking system that the world had ever seen " .
He said : " Our task must be nothing less than to rebuild a financial system where it has failed , and then to create an economy in which banks are no longer serving themselves but are serving the public of this country . "
Mr Brown said that " somehow " the financial world had lost sight of ordinary people 's values , such as fairness and hard work .
It would be wrong to condemn an entire industry because judgements made by some have been incorrect

British Bankers Association
" Some came to believe that we should sacrifice the value of being fair to that of laissez - faire , " he said .
" Some acted as though free markets could be value - free markets . "
He said that " nudging and deregulating " banks towards better behaviour had not worked .
" You need fair rules , rules that reward those that play by them and punish those who do n't . "
The prime minister also promised to help reform global banking practices , calling for banks to come under " international supervision " and pledging " no hiding place " for banks and firms who sought to evade the law .
And he repeated his condemnation of bank chiefs like Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) boss Sir Fred Goodwin , who despite being widely blamed for leading their organisations to disaster , then retired with huge taxpayer - funded pensions .
But he made no mention of Tory accusations that his City minister Lord Myners should have known about Sir Fred 's pension terms last year when RBS was being rescued .
He said : " Some of the practices now being discovered in our banks are not only unacceptable , they are indefensible and they have got to be cleaned up now .
" We are exploring all the legal action necessary to recover pension payments from people who received too much . "
But shadow chancellor George Osborne said no - one would believe what he termed Mr Brown 's " synthetic outrage . "
He said : " This all happened on Gordon Brown 's watch as a result of his polices .
That makes him part of the problem , not the solution . "
More mortgages
With a large proportion of Britain 's banks now under the control of the government , Mr Brown outlined his vision for the UK 's reformed banking system .
He said to create the investment and jobs Britain needed " highly valued " mortgage banks , industry banks , small business banks and industrial banks .
Sir Fred Goodwin is the target of mounting government fury
He said Northern Rock would be a bank for home buyers and home owners and would this year and next year offer £ 14 bn - worth of additional mortgages .
RBS - Natwest was to focus on small business banking and he said the government was looking at creating an industrial bank , to fund inventions and innovations .
He also confirmed that the government was thinking about creating a publicly - owned savings bank , using the post office network and funds from National Savings .
Angela Knight , chief executive of the British Bankers Association , said that while some banks had run into trouble , the " overwhelming majority " were performing well in " a very difficult environment " .
" There have been some judgements that have been made which have proven to be wrong , " she said .
" But it would also be wrong to condemn an entire industry because judgements made by some have been incorrect . "
Mrs Knight said Mr Brown appeared to want struggling banks to " play to their strengths " and return to what they were once good at .
But she added : " There is obviously a difficult and a different relationship that the government is going to have with some of those banks for whom there is a large stakeholding from the taxpayer . "

In 2005 , Patrick Byrne , the CEO of Overstock.com and future Deep Capture investigative reporter , began a public crusade against illegal naked short selling ( hedge funds and brokers creating phantom stock to manipulate stock prices down ) .
He said , over and over , that the crime was destroying public companies and had the potential to trigger a systemic meltdown of our financial markets .
Soon after , I began to investigate a network of short sellers , journalists , and miscreants .
I concluded that many of the people in this network were connected to two famous criminals – “ junk bond king ” Michael Milken and his associate , Ivan Boesky .
I also began taking a close look at the Mafia ’s involvement in naked short selling .
In my last installment ( click here to read ) , I described some of the strange occurrences that attended this investigation .
Where the story left off , I ’d recently been threatened in a bookstore , and then ambushed by three thugs who told me to stay away from this story .
My unwitting employer had been bribed by short sellers , Patrick had been told by a U.S. Senator that his life was in danger , and a Russian matryoshka doll had appeared on the desk of an offshore businessman .
Inside this matryoshka doll was a slip of paper marked with the letter “ F ” …
* * * * * * * *
Soon after receiving the matryoshka doll , the offshore businessman invited Patrick Byrne to a greasy spoon diner in Long Island .
Over the previous year , the businessman had provided Patrick with some information about the naked short selling scam , and the hope was that he might have something more to say .
But that day at the diner , all he had was a message .
“ I ’ll make this quick , ” the businessman said , with two other witnesses present .
“ I have a message for you from Russia .
The message is , ‘ We are about to kill you .
We are about to kill you . ’
Patrick , they are going to kill you .
If you do not stop this crusade [ against naked short selling ] , they will kill you .
Normally they ’d have already hurt someone close to you as a warning , but you ’re so weird , they do n’t know how you ’d react . ”
In a later conversation with a colleague of Patrick ’s the businessman said [ verbatim ] : “ These things do n’t happen to me anymore .
I mean , I ’ve been out of that world [ the world of Mafia stock manipulation ] for a dozen years or more .
These … there are defined signals here that lead me to believe that they [ the Mafia ] have been disturbed .
The only way they coulda been disturbed is if they own Rocker or if he is using them for leverage . ”
Rocker .
That ’s David Rocker .
At the time , David Rocker was a “ prominent ” hedge fund manager specialized in short selling ( betting that stock prices will fall ) .
It was also the case that Rocker had spent the last couple decades insinuating to people on Wall Street that he was somehow tied to the Mob .
But Rocker was probably full of it .
He did n’t have ties to the Mob .
Perhaps he merely believed that his insinuations lent him a certain cachet .
* * * * * * * *
From 1973 to 1981 , Rocker was a general partner in a short selling hedge fund managed by Michael Steinhardt , who is one of Wall Street ’s most “ prominent ” investors , regularly hailed by The Wall Street Journal and CNBC as a genius and a font of wisdom .
Some years ago , Steinhardt belatedly acknowledged that he is the son of Sol “ Red ” Steinhardt , who was once a major player in the Genovese Mafia organization .
Steinhardt , Sr. spent several years in Sing - Sing prison after a New York City prosecutor described him as the “ biggest Mafia fence in America . ”
Incidentally , experts concur that the Genovese Mafia family brought the Russian Mob to America .
* * * * * * * *
The largest investors in Steinhardt Jr. ’s first hedge fund were associates of the Genovese Mafia ( whose investments came in large sacks of cash ) , Marty Peretz ( future founder , with Jim Cramer , of TheStreet.com ) , Marc Rich ( future fugitive charged with tax evasion and illegal trading with Iran and Libya ) , and Ivan Boesky ( later imprisoned on multiple counts , most of them involving stock manipulation schemes orchestrated with “ junk bond king ” Michael Milken ) .
By 1991 , Steinhardt owned another hedge fund — JGM Management – with a “ prominent investor ” named James Marquez .
The star employee at JGM was “ prominent investor ” Samuel Israel III .
A few years later , Israel and Marquez founded the Bayou Group , one of the biggest hedge fund frauds in history .
A significant part of the Bayou fraud involved Israel “ feeding ” his investors ’ money into a Ponzi scheme run by Robert Booth Nichols , who has been targeted by authorities as a business associate of the Genovese Mafia family .
When Israel was sentenced to prison last year , he briefly disappeared .
His car was found on a bridge .
Scrawled in the dust on the hood was a note : “ Suicide is Painless . ”
Authorities arrested Israel ’s girlfriend , whom they suspected of harboring a fugitive .
Shortly after , Israel rode a red motor scooter to a Boston police station and turned himself in .
Apparently , he was not dead .
He had tried to fool us .
Meanwhile , Israel had filed a lawsuit against Nichols , alleging that Nichols had ripped him off .
Apparently , Israel ( who could not be reached for this article ) would like us to believe that he is not tied to Nichols or the Genovese Mafia .
Nonetheless , Israel has a certain cachet .
So do Steinhardt and James Marquez .
* * * * * * * *
In the 1990s , Steinhardt founded another hedge fund , Steinhardt Partners .
The co-founder and head trader of Steinhardt Partners was a “ prominent investor ” named John Lattanzio .
The limited public information about Lattanzio concerns a Russian prostitute .
Apparently , Lattanzio proposed marriage to the prostitute and gave her a diamond ring .
Alas , the couple separated , and Lattanzio asked for his ring back .
After all , it had cost him $ 289,275.00 .
But the prostitute seemed to believe that the ring was payment for services rendered .
The dispute ended up in court , where the prostitute testified that Lattanzio had told her that he had ties to the Mafia .
Yes , said the prostitute , Lattanzio ( Steinhardt Partners ’ co-founder and head trader ) had big - time Mafia connections , and he “ would not hesitate to use them to harm me . ”
From what I know of Russian strumpets , there is at least one area where they cannot be trusted – and that is where it concerns their love life .
So perhaps Lattanzio had his heart broken .
Perhaps , in the heat of passion , he said some crazy stuff about the Mafia to make himself seem dangerous .
If that is the case , I send Mr. Lattanzio my condolences .
Indeed , I would enjoy meeting him .
He has a certain cachet .
* * * * * * * *
Rocker left Steinhardt ’s hedge fund in 1981 and went to work for an investment management firm called Century Capital Associates .
Information on this firm is limited , but it seems to have been largely owned in the 1980s by the Belzberg brothers — William , Sam and Hymie .
The Belzbergs were among Michael Milken ’s closest cronies ( family member Mark Belzberg was in fact implicated by the SEC in Milken ’s stock manipulation schemes ) .
They were at the inner core of the Milken machine – buying and selling the junk bonds of other Milken cronies .
Often , the Belzbergs collaborated with Milken to blackmail , seize , or destroy public companies . .
In the late 1980s , the Belzbergs announced that they were going to take over Crazy Eddie , which was then a famous home electronics retail chain .
The Belzbergs joined forces with Crazy Eddie ’s founder , Eddie Antar , and the company ’s chief financial officer , Sam Antar , in a supposed effort to take the company private .
This is a story for another time , but for now it suffices to say that Crazy Eddie was a massive fraud , the Belzbergs ( and Milken ) likely knew this already , and when the company was raided by the FBI a few months later , it emerged that Sam Antar had been feeding information to both the FBI and a lawyer , Howard Sirota , who was preparing to sue the company .
The Belzberg ’s did not buy Crazy Eddie .
Instead , just before the FBI arrived , the company was sold to another investor , Victor Palmieri .
Robert A. Marmon , who was hired by Palmieri to run Crazy Eddie , told me that he arrived to find that the company ’s top employees – the only people who had had direct access to the Antars – were all burly , armed thugs who claimed to be former employees of the Mossad , Israel ’s secret intelligence agency .
It was Marmon ’s job to fire the Antars ’ corporate goons .
“ I ’ve never been so scared in my life , ” he said .
“ There were n’t any explicit death threats .
They just stared you down , so you got the message . ”
* * * * * * * *
Sam Antar is a convicted felon , but he never went to prison because he testified against his cousin , Eddie Antar , in return for house arrest .
Now he is paid by short sellers with ties to David Rocker and associates of Michael Milken .
The assignment to which he devotes the majority of his time is to use the Internet to harass and smear the reputations of Deep Capture founder Patrick Byrne and his colleagues .
At one point , Antar threatened the young children of Deep Capture reporter Judd Bagley , posting their names , ages , and address on the Internet .
As I described in my last installment , Antar has made what I can only interpret to be veiled references to two seminal events in my life – the time I was ambushed and punched in the eye by three thugs , and the day that a goon in a bookstore threatened my close relative .
When he is not harassing us , Antar helps Howard Sirota ( the attorney who sued Crazy Eddie ) file bogus class action lawsuits against companies targeted by short sellers .
A recent court case also describes Antar delivering $ 250,000 in cash to a man named Barry Minkow
In the 1980s , Minkow built a carpet cleaning and insurance restoration company called ZZZZ Best , with the bulk of his finance coming from Michael Milken , and other funds coming from associates of the Genovese organized crime family .
ZZZZ
Best was a massive fraud that manufactured false restoration claims – some of them on Las Vegas casinos that had been financed by Michael Milken and investors tied to the Genovese organized crime family .
Minkow spent some time in prison .
Now he runs an outfit called the Fraud Discovery Institute out of the Community Bible Church in San Diego , where he is a preacher .
The Fraud Discovery Unit is in the business of publishing negative information about public companies targeted by Howard Sirota and short sellers tied to David Rocker , Michael Steinhardt , and associates of Michael Milken .
In one of Sam Antar ’s famous Internet messages ( he signs them , “ Sam Antar , Convicted Felon ” ) , he warned that we at Deep Capture were taking chances by writing about the Mafia connections of Barry Minkow , whom Antar described as his “ friend . ”
“ You have awakened a sleeping giant , ” Antar wrote .
* * * * * * * *
In addition to their involvement with Crazy Eddie and David Rocker ’s operation , the Belzberg brothers – William , Sam , and Hymie – also tried in the 1980s to take over a investment services concern called the Bache Group .
But executives of the Bache Group did not want the Belzbergs to seize their company .
According to the executives , the Belzbergs had ties to the Mafia .
The executives went public with their allegations , citing , among other things , a U.S. Customs report that described the Belzbergs cavorting with some Genovese mafiosi in Acapulco .
Fortune magazine reported that these allegations were “ unsubstantiated . ”
But the Belzbergs have a certain cachet
* * * * * * * *
The Belzbergs were also the largest providers of capital to John Mulheren , a “ prominent investor ” who was famous in the 1980s for the arbitrage operation that he ran out of Spear Leeds & Kellogg , a broker - dealer and notorious naked short seller that was later merged into Goldman Sachs Execution and Clearing ( which currently employs Elliot Faivinov , a Russian man who in 2006 was , for reasons of his own , receiving copies of the phone records of a woman who was then Deep Capture reporter Patrick Byrne ’s girlfriend ) .
The Department of Justice alleged that Mulheren routinely engaged in stock manipulation schemes with Ivan Boesky , targeting companies financed by Milken .
In 1987 , when Boesky was indicted , and the government began to investigate Milken , Mulheren announced that he was going to murder Boesky .
Depending on the story , Mulheren either forgot to take his psychiatric medication , or he was worried that Boesky was going to squeal .
Either way , he was arrested on the way to Boesky ’s house .
In Mulheren ’s car , police found a 9 - millimeter pistol , a .357 Magnum , a 12 - gauge pistol - grip shotgun , a .233 - caliber Israeli Galil assault rifle , and 300 rounds of ammunition .
It is a common misperception that Boesky ’s testimony led to the 98 - count indictment of Michael Milken .
Considering the scope of business the two criminals did together , Boesky actually provided very little information to the government .
He told prosecutors that he was afraid that he might be killed .
On several occasions he told prosecutors that he might be killed by Milken ’s “ friends in Vegas . ”
* * * * * * * *
Far more important to the government ’s case against Milken was evidence that it obtained when 50 armed troopers stormed the offices of a hedge fund called Princeton - Newport .
The founder of this hedge fund , Edward Thorp , once partnered with the Genovese organized crime family to develop a system for cheating Las Vegas casinos .
He wrote a seminal book on counting cards in black jack , and soon after , he was a critical – perhaps the most critical – figure in the Milken operation .
The base of Milken ’s operation was the high - yield debt department of Drexel Burnham Lambert in Beverly Hills .
From there , he underwrote and sold billions upon billions of dollars worth of junk bonds .
Hence the moniker , “ the junk bond king . ”
But most observers believe that Milken derived a greater part of his fortune from a web of private partnerships and personal brokerages that traded , and often manipulated , not just the debt , but also the stock of public companies .
Most profitable of all Milken ’s businesses were two Chicago - based brokerages – Belvedere Securities and EGM partners – that he co-owned with the Genovese Mafia card - counter Edward Thorp .
In 2006 , Thorp ’s son , Jeffrey , was charged by the SEC with destroying more than 20 companies in a scheme that involved unbridled naked short selling ( millions upon millions of phantom shares sold into the market ) .
Jeffrey Thorp also collaborated closely in short selling schemes with Anthony Elgindy , a notorious phantom stock peddler who is now serving an 11 year prison sentence for stock manipulation , extortion , and bribing FBI agents .
Elgindy , like Thorp ’s father , is tied to the Genovese organized crime family .
When Elgindy appeared in court for sentencing , the judge noticed that Elgindy was missing the tip of one finger .
Elgindy could not provide a straight answer as to what had happened , but a source close to the Elgindy investigation claims that Elgindy was forced by Russian mobsters to saw off his own finger as a warning not to squeal on his partners in crime .
* * * * * * * *
When delivering the death threat to Patrick Byrne , the offshore businessman mentioned David Rocker , and as we now know , Rocker was a general partner in Michael Steinhardt ’s first hedge fund — largely capitalized by the Genovese Mafia and Ivan Boesky .
We also know that Rocker later worked for Century Capital , largely owned by the Belzbergs – William , Sam , and Hymie – who might or might not have been cavorting with Genovese mafiosi in Acapulco , but were certainly the largest funders of John Mulheren .
After getting caught on his way to murder Ivan Boesky , Mulheren went to jail , where he spent most of his time in consultation with Anthony “ Fat Tony ” Salerno , a Genovese Mafia capo who had recently begun a 100 year prison sentence .
Upon his release , Mulheren ( whose convictions were later reversed on appeal ) went into business with a “ prominent investor ” named Israel Englander .
Soon after that , Mulheren died ( apparently of a heart attack ) , but Englander continued to manage Millennium Partners , a “ prominent ” short selling hedge fund whose major investors are the Belzbergs – William , Sam , and Hymie .
By this time , David Rocker had left the Belzberg ’s Century Capital to start his own hedge fund – Rocker Partners .
* * * * * * * *
Here I must skip ahead more than a decade :
In 2004 , Deep Capture reporter Patrick Byrne ( pursuant to his day job of being CEO of Overstock.com ) was on a Lehman Brothers - sponsored road show seeing dozens of hedge funds , attempting to sell a $ 120 million convertible bond in Overstock .
When he sat down in Millennium ’s offices , a man entered .
His opening words were , “ Millennium wants to take the entire $ 120 million of this offering .
Of course , we ’ll need a board seat to go with that . ”
This would have given the hedge fund access to inside information about Overstock .
And it would have given Millennium the ability to sell the company short without borrowing shares in the open market .
This is a common strategy employed by short sellers tied to Michael Milken or his associates .
As I will show in future stories , many companies that agree to this arrangement are eventually destroyed or seriously wounded by naked short selling – hedge funds offloading phantom stock .
Overstock board member Gordon Macklin , the former chairman of Hambrecht & Quist , a straight - shooting investment bank , warned Patrick not to do the deal with Millennium .
Millennium , after all , had a certain cachet .
Patrick declined Millennium ’s offer , and went ahead with the offering to a number of hedge funds .
A few months after Millennium ’s offer to acquire the bonds , affiliated hedge fund managers , including David Rocker , began a short selling attack on Overstock .
* * * * * * * *
One hedge fund closely affiliated with David Rocker is SAC Capital , which is managed by Steven Cohen , and is said to account for more than 3 percent of all the trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
BusinessWeek magazine has described Cohen as “ The Most Powerful Trader on Wall Street . ”
Some years ago , there was an article by Fortune magazine called “ The Shabby Side of the Street . ”
This article did not mention Steve Cohen .
It did not mention him because , by this time , Cohen was a “ prominent investor . ”
But while “ The Shabby Side of the Street ” does not mention Cohen , it is all about Gruntal & Co. , which is where Cohen spent his formative years .
Cohen was a proprietary trader for Gruntal in the 1980s and early 1990s – up until the day when he founded SAC Capital .
Gruntal , we can assume , is where Cohen developed his network and learned the tricks that made him the “ most powerful trader on Wall Street . ”
Fortune magazine interviewed a former Gruntal employee , who described the ambience there : “ Gruntal was the Island of the Misfit Toys .
But they did n’t care what was going on in our sick , dysfunctional office as long as we were making money .
We had no manager , and it ’s illegal not to supervise brokers .
I remember doing cartwheels down the hall , drinking beer at my desk , smoking pot , having sex in the stairwell .
Whatever ! ”
* * * * * * * *
The Fortune magazine article about Gruntal also failed to mention Michael Milken .
It did not mention Milken because Milken was , by then , a “ prominent philanthropist . ”
But Milken had been intimately involved with Gruntal , whose parent company , a financial services and insurance conglomerate called the Home Group , had been central to the Michael Milken empire .
As nearly every account of Michael Milken ’s schemes will tell you , Milken worked with a select group of cronies ( many of whom controlled large insurance and financial services conglomerates ) to operate what amounted to a Ponzi scheme .
The cronies would sell junk bonds through Milken to raise finance .
Then the cronies would use much of this finance to buy ( from Milken ) the junk bonds of other cronies in the group .
The cronies and Milken would then trade the junk bonds among themselves , raising their prices incrementally as they passed them on to the next crony ( a process known as “ daisy - chaining ” ) , before fobbing them off to little old ladies and dimwitted pension fund managers .
Until the scheme collapsed , Milken ’s junk - bond merry - go - round generated enormous profits and seemingly unlimited finance for his select cronies .
So the cronies could not only buy more junk bonds from Milken , but they could also use their billions to harass , destroy , or initiate hostile takeovers of public companies .
Meanwhile , Milken presided over a nationwide network of private partnerships ( such as those he had with the Mafia card - counter Edward Thorp ) , arbitrage and short selling partnerships ( such as Ivan Boesky ’s criminal operation ) , short selling hedge funds ( such as Michael Steinhardt ’s Mafia - funded outfit ) , and brokerages that could help put public companies on the defensive .
Home Insurance was a key buyer and issuer of Milken junk bonds .
It was the second largest unsecured creditor to Milken ’s operation at Drexel .
It also owned about $ 15 million worth of Ivan Boesky ’s short selling and arbitrage outfit .
Meanwhile , Home ’s subsidiary , Gruntal & Co. , employed traders who were on quite friendly terms with Milken and others in his network .
* * * * * * * *
Gruntal ’s options department was founded by a man named Carl Icahn .
After leaving Gruntal , Icahn formed Icahn & Co. , receiving most of his finance from Michael Milken , but also a significant chunk of capital from a “ prominent investor ” named Zen Wolfson .
Since then , Wolfson has been involved with a number of Wall Street brokerages that are tied to the Genovese Mafia .
One such brokerage is Pond Securities , which , in 2001 , was implicated by the SEC in a massive naked short selling ( phantom stock ) fraud .
Among the victims of Pond Securities were companies that had employed the services of Ladenburg Thalmann , an investment bank largely controlled by Carl Icahn .
In an upcoming story , I will tell you more about Ladenburg Thalmann ’s role in the naked short selling scandal .
I will tell you more about Pond Securities and its relationship with a man who remains a fugitive in Austria .
And I will tell you more about Carl Icahn , who is not only one of the most “ prominent investors ” in America , but also a man with a certain cachet .
* * * * * * * *
Another employee of Gruntal – a fellow who sat next to Steve Cohen ( later known as “ the most powerful trader on the Street ” ) – was Stephen Feinberg , who had moved to Gruntal from Michael Milken ’s operation at Drexel Burnham Lambert .
Feinberg had been one of Milken ’s most favored employees .
Most likely , he moved to Gruntal ( “ the “ shabby side of the Street , ” as Fortune magazine described it ) to reinforce the relationship between Gruntal and Milken ’s nation - wide stock manipulation network .
Nowadays , Feinberg runs Cerberus Capital , one of the most powerful private equity firms in America .
In an upcoming story , I will tell you how Cerberus loots the companies it seizes .
Its techniques have a certain cachet .
* * * * * * * *
Yet another “ prominent investor ” who sat on Steve Cohen ’s trading floor at Gruntal was Samuel Israel III .
Israel left Gruntal to work for a hedge fund owned by Steinhardt ( the son of the “ biggest Mafia fence in America ” ) .
As you will recall , Israel later wrote “ Suicide is Painless ” on his car and briefly disappeared after being sentenced for masterminding one of the largest hedge fund frauds in history – a fraud that Israel ran with help from a co-founder of Steinhardt ’s hedge fund and another fellow connected to the Genovese Mafia .
Also on Steve Cohen ’s trading floor at Gruntal was Maurice A. Gross , whose biggest client was Thomas Gambino , a prominent member of the Gambino Mafia family .
This was in the days when the Gambinos and the Genovese still collaborated on Wall Street .
Gross later left Gruntal , and in 1997 , he and a Pakistani fellow named Mohammad Ali Khan tried to steal the Gambinos ’ money .
Fortunately , Elliot Spitzer intervened .
At the time , Spitzer was New York ’s attorney general .
Throughout his political career , Spitzer received by far the greatest percentage of his campaign funding from short sellers ( such as Jim Chanos , who provided a rent - free beach house to the hooker who later forced Spitzer to resign as governor ) who are closely tied to Steve Cohen and SAC Capital .
Spitzer forced the former Gruntal broker to give the Gambinos their money back .
There is no evidence , however , that Spitzer was concerned that New York ’s second largest organized crime family was running money through a brokerage owned by cronies of Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky .
In 1996 , Gruntal was charged with embezzling millions of dollars .
By then , Steve Cohen had left to begin his career as the “ most powerful trader on the Street . ”
* * * * * * * *
So in 2006 , I was investigating Steve Cohen ’s SAC Capital , David Rocker , Michael Steinhardt and their network of miscreants .
I was also investigating “ prominent ” journalists ( at The Wall Street Journal , The New York Times , CNBC and other major news organizations ) who had unusual relationships with this network and who were going to extraordinary lengths to cover up the naked short selling ( phantom stock ) scandal .
That ’s when three guys in Armani suits saddled up to me in a quiet bar .
As you will recall from my last installment , one of the Armanis introduced himself to me as a former Boesky employee , and told me a story about a fellow who got his brains blown out after “ peeking ” into the ladies underwear department at Saks Fifth Avenue .
Steve Cohen ’s SAC Capital is known colloquially as “ Sak . ” I do not know for certain that Armani was telling me I should n’t be “ peeking ” at Cohen ’s dirty underwear .
It was a strange encounter , to say the least .
But if you doubt that journalists sometimes receive such threats , consider the case of Los Angeles Times reporter Anita Busch .
One day after work , Busch found , in the front seat of her car , a dead fish and a rose .
In the windshield of her car , there was bullet hole and a note that said , simply , “ Stop ! ”
Later , the LA Times reporter was nearly killed when two men in a black Mercedes tried to run her over .
All of this was the handiwork of Anthony Pellicano , a former soldier in the Genovese Mafia organization who had found employment as a hired - thug and private investigator .
Most of Pellicano ’s clients had been Hollywood actors like Steven Seagal ( who has been reported by some news organizations to have ties to the Mob , though I have not confirmed those reports ) and various billionaires , a significant number of whom had ties to Michael Milken .
When Pellicano put the dead fish and the bullet hole in the reporter ’s car , he was working for Michael Ovitz , the Hollywood mogul .
Busch and the LA Times were investigating the business dealings of Ovitz , and Ovitz apparently hired the former Genovese Mafia soldier to stop the story in its tracks .
Ovitz , as you may know , is one of Michael Milken ’s closest friends .
They were high school classmates .
In later years , Milken and Ovitz did a lot of business together .
While Pellicano was threatening an L.A.
Times reporter , he was also employed by Adam Sender , who runs a hedge fund called Exis Capital .
Sender is a former employee of Steve Cohen at SAC Capital .
Steve Cohen — the “ most powerful trader on the Street ” — provided Sender with most of his start - up capital .
Exis and Sender are considered by most everyone on Wall Street to be essentially subsidiaries of SAC ( a.k.a . “ Sak ” ) .
Apparently , Sender had some kind of dispute with a business partner , so he called Pellicano , the former Genovese Mafia soldier .
In a conversation that was recorded by the FBI , Sender said to Pellicano : “ You have 100 % free reign to do whatever you feel will make this cocksucker as unhappy as possible …
I ’d like to make the fucking asshole as uncomfortable as possible …
I ’m going to continue the lawsuit until doomsday … when the time is right I ’m going to fix him . ”
You can listen to the full conversation here .
In a later conversation , Pellicano allegedly offered to have Sender ’s business partner disappear .
The former Genovese soldier said he ’d make his move while the business partner was driving to Los Angeles from Las Vegas .
He ’d force the business partner off the road .
Then Pellicano would kill the business partner and bury him in the Nevada desert .
Nobody would know a thing .
In court , Sender testified that he turned down Pellicano ’s murder - for - hire offer .
But Pellicano was convicted for multiple crimes – such as offering to have a man buried in the Nevada desert and putting a dead fish , a rose , and bullet hole in the car of a journalist investigating Michael Milken ’s best friend from high school .

I do not know whether any merit can be given to the offshore businessman ’s speculation that Rocker might be “ owned ” by the Mafia .
I do not know whether Rocker had anything to do with the message that the Russian Mafia was going to kill Patrick Byrne .
I do know , however , that in a later phone conversation , the offshore businessman explained how the death threat had been conveyed to him .
He said he returned home one night and his wife told him there was a package on his desk .
“ And there was a beautiful little box , and inside was a matryoshka . ”
“ And I opened up the …matryoshka , and inside is an ` F ’ with a cross on it — which is from Felix . ”
The businessman said he contacted Felix .
And Felix said , “ tell [ Patrick ] …. we ’re going to fucking take it private . ”
* * * * * * * *
In 1998 , Felix – that ’s Felix Sater – forgot to pay the rent on a locker at the Manhattan Mini Storage in Soho .
As a result , police found inside this locker two pistols , a shotgun , and a gym bag stuffed with documents outlining various money laundering and stock manipulation schemes orchestrated by Felix Sater and his partners .
Felix is a Russian immigrant said by authorities to have ties to both the Russian Mafia and the Genovese organized crime family .
In 1991 , Felix stabbed a stock broker in the face with a broken stem of a wine glass .
* * * * * * * *
After reviewing the contents of Felix ’s locker , the FBI launched a sweeping investigation that culminated , in the summer of 2000 , with the bureau ’s famous “ Operation Uptick ” – sometimes referred to as the “ Mob on Wall Street ” operation .
More than 100 stock brokers and investors allegedly tied to the Mafia were arrested – the biggest securities bust in FBI history .
Among those arrested in the “ Mob on Wall Street ” operation were a number of people tied to Michael Milken or his closest cronies .
One of them was Gene Phillips .
In the 1980s , Phillips ran a company called Southmark , which was at the center of the Milken Ponzi .
Southmark was , in fact , the single largest real estate conglomerate ever financed by Milken .
But it did n’t just buy real estate .
In only one of many transactions , Milken delivered over $ 400 million in junk bond finance to Phillips , and Phillips used every penny of that finance to buy ( from Milken ) the junk bonds of other Milken cronies .
The “ Mob on Wall Street ” case alleged that Phillips engaged in stock manipulation schemes with a coterie of miscreants who were tied to the Genovese organized crime family .
Ultimately , Phillips was acquitted .
But even before he was arrested , Phillips had a certain cachet .
* * * * * * * *
Felix Sater ( the man who allegedly sent the matryoshka doll ) was ultimately named as an “ unindicted co-conspirator ” in a Mafia - run stock fraud .
One of his friends co-authored a book , “ The Scorpion and the Frog , ” which suggests that Sater ( whom the author of the book gives a pseudonym , “ Lex Tersa ” ) cut a deal allowing him to avoid prosecution if he helped the CIA set up a phony arms deal with Osama Bin Laden .
Anything is possible , I suppose .
At any rate , Sater is now the ( silent ) proprietor of the Bayrock Group , a real estate investment company .
The Bayrock Group has eleven partners .
All are of interest , but let ’s focus on two of them .
One is The Sapir Organization , which is an organization run by a Russian immigrant named Tamir Sapir .
A lawyer for The Sapir Organization said the organization would answer no questions because the organization is “ very , very private . ”
So information about Sapir ’s background is spotty .
Sapir has stated publicly that he once owned a home electronics store that catered to Russian KGB officials living in New York .
The name of the store remains a mystery .
All Sapir has said is that he was “ the Crazy Eddie of Russia ” – a playful reference to Sam Antar ’s electronics company ( i.e. , the massive fraud that the Antars were going to take private with those Milken cronies , the Belzbergs – Walter , Sam , and Hymie ) .
After electronics , Sapir began trading oil .
Then he struck it big in real estate .
Now , he is believed to be a billionaire .
He might also be a Russian Mafia boss .
Journalists have danced around this issue .
Sapir himself has stated to The New York Times that “ I am not Mob . ”
But he once had Genovese Mafia associates running his real estate empire .
So if Sapir is not a Russian Mafia boss , he is at least a Russian boss of Mafia employees .
By way of example :
The man who formerly ran The Sapir Organization ’s real estate portfolio is named Frederick J. Contini .
In addition to being associated with the Genovese Mafia clan , Contini once entered a secret plea to racketeering .
Also , Contini once stabbed a man in the face with the broken stem of a wine glass .
He said it was just a bar fight .
This was some months after Felix Sater stabbed a man in the face with the broken stem of a wine glass .
Felix said it was just a bar fight , too .
* * * * * * * *
The second important partner of Felix Sater ’s Bayrock Group is Apollo Real Estate Advisors , which is part of the empire controlled by a famous billionaire – Leon Black .
If Michael Milken were to name the ten people who are closest to him , Leon Black would surely be one of them .
The two men have known each other since at least 1975 , when “ prominent investor ” Carl Lindner , who was one of Milken ’s key junk bond cronies , was acquiring shares in United Brands , formerly known as United Fruit , a company that has been accused of everything from bribing heads of state to funneling money to Latin American drug gangs .
Lindner eventually gained control over the company , but not before Eli Black — United Brands ’ CEO and the father of Leon Black — crashed through a thick plate - glass window on the 44th floor of the Pan Am building , and plunged to his death .
They said Black broke through the plate glass window with his briefcase .
They said it was suicide .
* * * * * * * *
Some years after his father crashed through the window , Leon Black was heading up mergers and acquisitions at Drexel Burnham Lambert , home base of Milken ’s junk bond operation .
Black was Milken ’s most ardent ally at Drexel .
After Milken was indicted , Black rallied to Milken ’s defense .
It was Black , more than anyone , who prevented Drexel from firing Milken .
And Black has remained obstinately loyal to the criminal Milken ever since .
After Milken went to prison , Black founded the Apollo Group , an investment partnership that received most of its initial funding from a French aristocrat named Rene Thierry Magon de La Villehuchet .
Among Black ’s first moves as an independent “ prominent investor ” was to launch a takeover bid for Executive Life , a bankrupt insurance and financial services conglomerate .
The Black group won the bid after a fierce battle with a group of competing bidders , led by Jack Byrne , who was then the chairman of Fireman ’s Fund , a major insurance company .
Later , though , it emerged that Black ’s takeover of Executive Life had been illegal because he had secretly been fronting for certain French investors , including Monsieur Rene Thierry de La Villehuchet .
Some of the French investors had illegally parked stock with Black to hide their involvement ( “ parking stock ” being one of the favorite techniques of the Milken - Boesky - Thorp crew , and a recurrent theme in the 98 - count indictment that sent Milken to jail ) .
There were indictments ( though , somehow , not of Black or Monsieur Rene Thierry de La Villehuchet ) .
After the indictments , Jack Byrne , recognizing that he ’d been cheated out of a deal , sued Black and won an $ 80 million dollar judgment , some $ 30 million of which was ultimately paid to Jack Byrne ’s company .
Jack Byrne , of course , is the father of Patrick Byrne , who a few years later received a vicious death threat , allegedly by way of a Russian matryoshka doll delivered by Leon Black ’s Mafia business partner Felix Sater .
* * * * * * * *
None of which is to suggest that Black or Michael Milken had anything to do with the matryoshka doll or the death threat .
Milken is now a “ prominent philanthropist , ” and Black is a “ prominent investor . ”
But if anybody sees Mr. Black , please ask him if he thinks his Mafia friends could help us get to the bottom of this .
( Neither Black nor Felix nor Milken return my calls ) .
* * * * * * * *
Executive Life , the company that Black ’s group illegally purchased , was in bankruptcy because it had been transformed into a Ponzi scheme by Fred Carr , who is widely regarded to have been Michael Milken ’s single most important junk bond crony .
Milken delivered billions of dollars in junk bond finance to Carr , and Carr used much of his Milken finance to buy ( from Milken ) junk bonds that had been issued by Gene Phillips , the Belzbergs , Carl Lindner , and few others in Milken ’s close circle of cronies .
Prior to destroying Executive Life , Carr was tied to a mutual fund company called Investors Overseas Services .
Carr was a “ feeder ” ( somebody who raised money ) for Investors Overseas Services , and at one point he announced that he was a major shareholder in the company and planned to take it over .
Another “ feeder ” to Investor Overseas Services ( OIS ) was John Pullman , a reputed associate of the Genovese organized crime family .
At one point , Canadian police taped a conversation in which Anthony “ Fat Tony ” Salerno ( the fellow whom John Mulheren befriended in prison after failing to assassinate Ivan Boesky ) suggested that Pullman owed him money .
There was also Sylvain Ferdman .
He couriered cash to IOS from clients in South America .
Ferdman testified before a grand jury in New York that he had also been a courier for the Genovese organized crime family .
* * * * * * * *
No story about Michael Milken is complete without reference to a “ prominent investor ” named Meshulum Riklis .
By most every account , Riklis was Milken ’s first big client and his most important mentor – the man who taught Milken the art of junk bond Ponzis and stock manipulation .
Riklis , who was also known as the husband of Hollywood starlet Pia Zadora , began working with Milken not long after Riklis bought Schenley Distributors , a distillery , in a deal that was clouded by accusations of pay - offs to organized crime .
Schenley retained as its major distributors one Joseph Fusco , reputed to be a former member of Al Capone ’s gang in Chicago , and Joseph Linsey , a colleague of the Genovese family mobster Meyer Lansky ( who worked closely with Michael Steinhardt ’s father ) .
Riklis ’s next move was to buy the Riviera casino in Las Vegas .
Reportedly , he was hand - picked for this deal by the sellers , a group of Mafia - affiliated characters led by Morris Shenker , who was the personal attorney , close confidant , and business partner of Jimmy Hoffa , the Mafia - connected president of the Teamsters .
One day , Hoffa had a meeting scheduled with Anthony “ Tony Jack ” Giacalone and Anthony “ Tony Pro ” Provenzano , two capos of the Genovese organized crime family .
Hoffa disappeared on the way to the meeting and was never seen again .
By then , though , the Teamsters had become one of Milken ’s most important customers –dependable buyers of junk bonds that Milken issued for select cronies – Riklis , Carr , Gene Phillips , Carl Lindner ( who was acquiring United Brands when Leon Black ’s father fell through a thick plate glass window ) , and just a few others .
* * * * * * * *
Through Riklis and the Teamsters , Milken built a solid clientele of Las Vegas casino operators , such as Carl Icahn , and related enterprises ( such as the Genovese - financed ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning outfit ) .
One of Milken ’s biggest clients was Steve Wynn , a “ prominent investor ” who received lots of Milken finance to open casinos and buy ( from Milken ) junk bonds issued by other Milken cronies – Lindner , Riklis , Gene Phillips , Icahn , and a just a few others ( all of whom had a certain cachet – more on the others in upcoming stories ) .
Wynn is now widely credited with transforming Las Vegas into the kind of place where you can go with the kids .
Meanwhile , Milken describes
Wynn as one of his closest friends .
In 1983 , which is right around the time that Milken and Wynn began doing business together , the Criminal Investigation Department of London ’s Scotland Yard produced a report stating that “ the strong inference which can be drawn from the new intelligence is that Stephen Wynn …has been operating under the aegis of the Genovese [ Mafia ] family since he first went to Las Vegas in the 1960s … ”
Scotland Yard determined that there was an especially strong relationship between Wynn ’s father , Mike , and Genovese mobster Anthony “ Fat Tony ” Salerno .
Around this time , the FBI caught “ Fat Tony ” on tape , in a conversation that suggested that the mobster had ties to the younger Wynn as well .
Among other things , “ Fat Tony ” told his colleagues that they should try to get the younger Wynn to reign back his activities in Las Vegas .
Wynn had become too conspicuous .
This was before “ Fat Tony ” entered into jail - cell consultations with John Mulheren , the Milken crony who had sought to murder Ivan Boesky .
It was after “ Fat Tony ” was caught on tape describing his relationship with the “ feeder ” who worked with Milken crony Fred Carr on the Investors Overseas Services .
Wynn vigorously denies any connection to “ Fat Tony ” and the Mafia .
By the way , “ Fat Tony ” wore a fedora and usually had big Cuban cigar in his mouth .
These people really do exist .
They have a certain cachet .
* * * * * * * *
Meshulum Riklis also denies having any connection to the Mafia .
But he does not deny that he at one point tried to buy Investors Overseas Services .
This was right about the time that Milken - crony Fred Carr began buying up shares in IOS .
It was also right about the time that Investors Overseas Services was found to be the biggest Ponzi fraud in history .
Soon after , Investors Overseas Services was handed over to a “ prominent investor ” named Robert Vesco , who looted it dry , and fled to Cuba .
* * * * * * * *
Investors Overseas Services was the biggest Ponzi scheme in history until last month , when Bernard Madoff ’s Mafia - affiliated operation was revealed to be the new all - time biggest Ponzi scheme .
Investors Overseas Services was a straight - forward swindle .
Bernard Madoff ’s $ 50 billion Ponzi was more complicated , involving not just his fund management business , but also his brokerages .
Madoff ’s brokerages engaged in naked short selling ( offloading stock that had not been borrowed or purchased — phantom stock ) , likely on behalf of miscreant hedge funds looking to drive down prices .
In fact , Madoff successfully lobbied the SEC to enact a rule that allowed market makers such as himself to engage in naked short selling .
At the SEC , this rule was called “ The Madoff Exception . ”
Moreover , a source who has seen some of Madoff ’s trading records says that Madoff filled buy orders for stock by naked short selling the stock to his customers ’ accounts .
So , perversely , significant buying volume through Madoff ’s brokerages in a firm ’s stock would generate yet more phantom shares , putting downward pressure on the price of that stock .
All of this naked short selling created massive liabilities ( probably accounted for as “ stock sold , and not yet delivered ” ) .
Those liabilities , plus the money that Madoff simply pocketed instead of buying or borrowing real stock , surely accounted for a large chunk of that $ 50 billion figure .
Last summer , naked short selling ( phantom stock ) burst into public view as an integral factor in the implosion of the U.S. financial system .
In November 2008 , former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt , echoing the words of many other experts and officials , said , “ Naked short selling is what ’s causing a lot of the problems in the market . ”
In other words , Madoff ’s operation was not just the largest known swindle in history .
It was also a phantom stock machine .
And that makes it but one participant in a much bigger scandal — a crime that might have brought us to the brink of a second Great Depression .
* * * * * * * *
At any rate , historic achievements tend to have overlapping protagonists .
So it was no surprise to learn that one of Madoff ’s most important “ feeders ” was Fairfield Greenwich Group , part - owned by a “ prominent investor ” named Philip Taub .
Philip ’s father , Said Taub , a “ prominent investor ” from Europe , had been an important “ feeder , ” along with Michael Milken ’s cronies and other people affiliated with the Genovese Mafia , for the Investors Overseas Services Ponzi .
Another Madoff “ feeder ” ( and a partner with Madoff in a brokerage called Cohmad ) was a “ prominent investor ” named Robert Jaffe .
Previously , while working for E.F. Hutton , Jaffe ran money for the Anguilo brothers , the Boston dons of the Genovese organized crime family .
There was also Sonja Kohn , who was a “ prominent ” member of the Wall Street investment community before moving to Austria to set up Bank Medici , the primary purpose of which seems to have been to find Russian oligarchs and mafiosi ( often one and the same ) to participate in Madoff ’s schemes .
According to The New York Times , Kohn has disappeared .
She apparently told people that she feared that somebody would have her killed .
* * * * * * * *
And , finally , there is the sad story of the French aristocrat Monsieur Rene Thierry Magon de La Villehuchet .
As you will recall , this aristocrat almost single - handedly funded Leon Black ’s Apollo Group .
And you will remember that this aristocrat also played a key role in Black ’s bid for Executive Life – a bid that turned out to be illegal , resulting in Black losing an $ 80 million lawsuit to the father of Deep Capture reporter Patrick Byrne .
In later years , this French aristocrat remained one of Leon Black ’s most important business associates .
He was a loyal friend – a committed member of the Michael Milken network – even after Black ’s Mafia business partner Felix Sater threatened to murder Patrick Byrne ( This according to the courier of that threat , who quoted Felix as saying , “ we ’re going to fucking take it private ” if Patrick continued his crusade against illegal naked short selling . ) .
All of which makes it interesting to know that this French aristocrat also raised billions of dollars for the greatest Ponzi scheme the world has ever known – a Ponzi scheme that entailed illegal naked short selling that probably helped topple the American financial system .
That ’s right , Monsieur Rene Thierry Magon de La Villehuchet not only provided most of the initial funding to Milken - crony Leon Black ’s Apollo Group .
He was also one of the most devoted “ feeders ” to the Bernard Madoff $ 50 billion phantom stock Mafia swindle .
And one day last month , police entered a luxurious office in a New York skyscraper .
On the desk , there were pills ( what kind of pills has not yet been revealed ) .
On the floor , there was a box cutter .
There was no note .
But there he was — Monsieur Rene Thierry Magon de La Villehuchet .
He was dead .
They said it was suicide .

Conservative pundit and marital rape apologist Dennis Prager has some advice for you ladies with faltering marriages : do n't think that just because you do n't want to have sex your husband should n't try to fuck you .
Like Tucker Carlson before him , Prager thinks the key to a successful marriage is just doing it even when you do n't want to .
In Prager 's case , he means " whenever your husband wants , " regardless of your " mood , " which should n't matter .
Of course , you could be in that mood because your husband is a liar and a cheat , or because he 's just driven your family into debt or hit you ( not too hard , of course , but things happen ) , but as long as he wants to fuck , well , you should suck it up and submit .
Advertisement
According to Prager , women just do n't understand that men view your willingness to " submit " to his penetration of your body as the way that you show love .
First , women need to recognize how a man understands a wifes refusal to have sex with him :
A husband knows that his wife loves him first and foremost by her willingness to give her body to him .
This is rarely the case for women .
Few women know their husband loves them because he gives her his body ( the idea sounds almost funny ) .
This is , therefore , usually a revelation to a woman .
Many women think mens natures are similar to theirs , and this is so different from a womans nature , that few women know this about men unless told about it .
Advertisement
I mean , of course women do n't desire sex for the sake of , you know , " pleasure " ( and certainly not in Dennis Prager 's house ) , so it 's obviously all about love .
Deep , deep love , which your husband returns so deeply that he has to stick his dick in you all the time whether you want to or not !
Prager adds that women should just accept that men are filthy dirty pigs about sex even when they love you , and women are not being kind if they refuse to let their husbands penetrate them vaginally anytime their husbands want .
I mean , look at all the self - denial husbands engage in by not fucking every other woman in the world !
Compared to most womens sexual nature , mens sexual nature is far closer to that of animals .
So what ?
That is the way he is made .
Blame God and nature .
Telling your husband to control it is a fine idea .
But he already does .
Every man who is sexually faithful to his wife already engages in daily heroic self - control .
He has married knowing he will have to deny his sexual natures desire for variety for the rest of his life .
To ask that he also regularly deny himself sex with the one woman in the world with whom he is permitted sex is asking far too much .
Advertisement
I mean , right ladies ?
Your husband could be regularly having sex with other women [ Ed. : HAHAHAHAHAHAHA ] so it 's your solemn duty to shut up , lie down and spread them whenever he wants to thank him for that daily , nay , hourly sacrifice of not fucking other people like he promised to do " for richer and for poorer and in sickness and in health . "
Otherwise , you know ...
Deny him enough times and he may try to fill this need with another woman .
Also , by the way , his desire for constant fucking regardless of your needs or desires is , after all , why you did n't marry a pussy .
Most women will readily acknowledge that it is certainly not enough for a man to be kind to her .
If it were , women would rarely reject kind men as husband material .
But as much as a woman wants a kind man , she wants more than that .
If a man is , let us say , lacking in ambition or just doesnt want to work hard , few women will love him no matter how kind he is .
In fact , most women would happily give up some kindness for hard work and ambition .
A kind man with little ambition is not masculine , therefore not desirable to most women .
Advertisement
See , if your husband is understanding of your sex drive and needs , he 's just a pussy and you did n't date a pussy because you wanted some asshole with enough drive to take care of your material needs like all women do , so put out already , Jesus .
Quid pro quo , ladies .
I mean , not that it 's actually enough to only tell your husband " no " so infrequently that he barely notices .
Because , really , even once will mean he 's unfulfilled and will fuck around on you anyway .
But , to repeat the key point , rejection of sex should happen infrequently .
And it should almost never be dependent on mood ... At the same time , men need to recognize that complete sexual fulfillment is unattainable in this world .
Advertisement
So , as long as you never refuse to have sex , happily accommodate his every sexual whim and never think about what you want or need sexually , Dennis Prager will happily inform your husband not to seek actual complete sexual fulfillment because he 'll never have that no matter how much you " submit . "
Gosh , it must be so much fun to be married to Dennis Prager , what with all the submission and fucking and being told what to do to make him happy even if you can never fulfill him sexually .
Guess that 's why he 's been divorced twice .

Swedish police have busted a server belonging to one of the largest topsites in the country .
It was part of a ring of servers totaling 65 terabytes of pirated material data .
Several well known ' scene ' groups used the site .
The Swedish anti-piracy bureau assisted in the investigation and says that their war on piracy will continue .
The raids were carried out two weeks ago but were only announced today .
The site , which goes by the name ‘ Sunnydale ’ , was a so - called topsite that hosted pirated movies , software and TV - shows spread out over a dozen servers .
One of the servers was raided .
Topsites are FTP servers where ‘ scene ’ releases are stored and archived .
There are several large topsites hosted in Sweden , some of which host hundreds of terabytes of pirated material .
However , according to ‘ scene ’ etiquette , the files on these are not supposed to leak to other ( more public ) file - sharing networks but eventually they all do , with most of the big releases managing this in mere minutes .
This puts these servers close to the top of the ‘ Piracy Pyramid ‘ and one of the priority targets of anti-piracy outfits .
Two weeks ago , Pirate Bay co-founder Anakata told the court that these scene members “ hate The Pirate Bay ” because they prefer to keep their releases within a select group .
Henrik Pontén from Antipiratbyrån – the Swedish anti-piracy office – applauded the police and said that this was one of the largest busts ever , and the largest in Sweden .
According to one of our own sources , several well known scene groups were using the servers , which means that they may have been compromised .
For now , the investigation focuses on the person who operated the server in question .
“ A person suspected of running the server has been identified and it is now up to the police to investigate this .
Now , we will continue to look for similar pirate servers , ” Pontén told Aftonbladet .
Pontén also claimed that the Sunnydale topsite was the source of all pirated material available on The Pirate Bay , but this was denied by Peter Sunde .
“ More than 800,000 people have uploaded to The Pirate Bay , so I do n’t believe it ’s the source of everything .
But it is possible that it ’s a major source , ” he said .
Antipiratbyrån ’s involvement in this raid is questionable .
In 2005 the police conducted an similar raid at Swedish ISP Bahnhof , only to be presented with evidence that Antipiratbyrån themselves had hired someone to plant copyright material .
It turned out that the infiltrator was far from a passive observer .
The infiltrator had transferred 68,000 files and went as far as buying hardware for the server to increase its storage capacity .
Antipiratbyrån was later sued for illegal trespassing and harassment because of these entrapment practices which are illegal in Sweden .
Now , four years on and they are again involved in a similar raid , but whether they had any help from an insider this time is unknown .
The exact role Antipiratbyrån played in this raid remains unclear , but it is likely that they tipped off the police about the location and existence of ‘ Sunnydale . ’
Pontén said that his organization will continue its “ war on piracy . ”
Update :
Only one of Sunnydale ’s servers was seized , the location of the other servers remains unknown .
Mr and Mrs Tsvangirai had been married for 31 years and had six children .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
If you 're thinking of buying a home , there could be a big bonus for you in the economic stimulus bill that 's now before Congress .
Among its many provisions is a $ 7,500 tax credit for first time home buyers .
The House passed the $ 819 billion stimulus plan , including this tax credit , in a vote late Wednesday .
The Senate may vote on its version of the bill some time next week .
Technically , the stimulus bill is actually changing the terms of the $ 7,500 tax credit that was issued as a part of the Housing Recovery Act , which Congress passed last summer .
That legislation required that the tax credit be repaid over 15 years , making it more of a no-interest loan .
Not surprisingly , the measure had little impact on the market .
The stimulus bill now under consideration would make that tax credit a true credit that does n't need to be repaid .
Many in the housing industry believe this credit could do a lot to jump start the moribund housing market .
" Our economists have studied the effect [ of the credit ] and they say there could be a 10 % increase in home sales if it 's implemented , " said Mary Trupo , a spokeswoman for the National Association of Realtors .
" It gives people who are sitting on the fence or who have inadequate funds for closing costs an incentive to act now . "
A 10 % increase would yield an extra half million sales this year .
Who qualifies
To be eligible , buyers cannot have owned a home for the past three years , and the new home has to be used as a primary residence .
The credit phases out as income rises above $ 75,000 for singles and $ 150,000 for couples , and disappears entirely at $ 95,000 and $ 170,000 , respectively .
Applying for it is easy , or at least as easy as doing your income taxes .
Just claim it on your return .
That 's it .
No other forms or papers have to be filed .
Both the Senate and the House versions of the new act remove the requirement that buyers repay the credit .
The Senate bill applies retroactively to any purchase completed between January 1 , 2009 and the end of August .
The House version is also retroactive to the start of the year , and expires at the end of June .
As long as buyers do n't sell for at least 36 months , they keep the money .
And the credit is refundable , meaning that it can be claimed even if the amount of the credit earned exceeds the buyer 's tax liability .
So even if your total tax bill comes to just $ 5,000 , you can still qualify for a full $ 7,500 refund .
The housing industry has been pushing this idea for many months , arguing that first - time homebuyers are the key to boosting home sales .
First time buyers who purchase from existing homeowners free those sellers to trade up to bigger , better houses .
Buyers beware
But the credit has its drawbacks , according to Bob Williams , a spokesman for the Tax Policy Center , which gave it a mediocre C+ grade in its Tax Stimulus Report Card .
Williams argues that the credit is poorly targeted because it goes to every first - time buyer , not just the ones who would n't buy without it .
So , it merely provides a windfall for many people who would have purchased anyway .
( See correction , below ) .
And in the end , a $ 7,500 tax credit , regardless of the details , does nothing to address the issue that 's holding most buyers back - the suspicion that prices are going to keep falling .
" As long as people are uncertain about what markets are going to do , this wo n't help much , " said Williams .
" It 's not enough to change that . "
The industry would like to make the tax credit stronger by making it available to all homebuyers , not just first - timers .
And it 's pushing to have the credit last through the end of the year , at least .
" By the time it 's implemented , " said Trupo , " there could be very few months left to act . "
An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the tax credit for a home purchased in 2009 could only be taken off of 2009 taxes .
However , homebuyers can choose to take the credit for 2008 , according to the IRS .
Even if they buy a home after they 've filed their 2008 taxes , they can file an amended return .

SOME 141,500 guns were collected at crime scenes in America in 2007 .
Over 42,000 of them had been transported across state lines .
A report by Mayors Against Illegal Guns , a group of 300 city mayors , considers which states are the source of most weapons used in crime .
The group found that Georgia was the biggest single supplier , with 2,631 weapons traced back to the state .
Florida , Texas , Virgina and Califorina each supplied over 2,000 .
Take population of the source state into account , however , and West Virginia , which exported over 40 such guns for every 100,000 of its people , tops the league .
The rate of “ export ” of such weapons is 11.7 , on average , for all states .
But for states that require background checks on those buying handguns at shows , it is roughly halved , at 5.7 .

Introduction
Like any good web developer , I have a tendency to poke around at people ’s web sites to see if I can figure out how they ’re implemented .
After poking at enough sites , I started noticing that people were putting some weird and interesting stuff in their HTTP headers .
So , a couple of weeks ago , I decided to actually go out and see what I could find by scrounging around in HTTP headers in the wild .
A header safari , if you will .
These are the results of my hunt .
Headers ?
HTTP is the protocol used to transmit data on what we know as “ the web ” .
At the beginning of every server response on the web , there ’s a bit of text like :
HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content - Type : text / html Connection : close
The top line specifies the protocol version of HTTP and a response code ( 200 in this case ) used to indicate the outcome of a request .
Following that are a bunch of lines that should consist of a field name ( like “ Connection ” ) , followed by a colon , and then followed by a value ( like “ close ” or “ keep - alive ” ) .
These lines of text are the HTTP response headers .
Immediately after the headers is a blank line , followed by the content of the message , such as the text of a web page or the data of an image file .
Technical Mumbo Jumbo
Want to examine the headers of a site for yourself ?
Try curl :
curl -i http://www.nextthing.org/
In the output of the above the first few lines are the headers , then there are a couple of line breaks , and then the body .
If you just want to see the headers , and not the body , use the - I option instead of - i .
Be forewarned , however , that some servers return different headers in this case , as curl will be requesting the data using a HEAD request rather than a GET request .
What I did to gather all of these headers was very similar .
First , I downloaded an RDF dump of the Open Directory Project ’s directory , and pulled out every URL from that file .
Then , I stuck all of the domain names of these URL ’s in a big database .
A simple multithreaded Python script was used to download all of the index pages of these URL ’s using PycURL and stick the headers and page contents in a database .
When that was done , I had a database with 2,686,155 page responses and 23,699,737 response headers .
The actual downloading of all of this took about a week .
This is , of course , not anywhere near a comprehensive survey of the web .
Netcraft received responses from 70,392,567 sites in its August 2005 web survey , so I hit around 3.8 % of them .
Not bad , but I ’m sure there ’s a lot of interesting stuff I ’m missing .
Obligatory Mention of Long Tail
First of all , yes , HTTP headers form something like a long tail :
In particular , hapax legomena ( one - offs ) make up over half of the headers found .
I expected this .
Unfortunately for me , however , a lot of the really interesting stuff is over on that long flat section of the long tail .
Which means I spent a lot of time poring over one - offs looking for interesting stuff .
Weee .
It ’s a good thing I ’m easily amused .
Off with Her Headers
I found 891 instances of :
X - Pad-For- Netscrape-Bug : 0123456789
Which brought back memories of the days when Netscape was reviled by developers the world ’ round , and had not yet achieved its ultimate ( albeit posthumous ) glory with Firefox .
It ’s nice to know comments by frustrated engineers have such a long half - life on the Internet .
There are a few variants on this header :
X - Pad : avoid browser bug XX - Pad : Padding aheader : WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW !
X- BrowserAlignment : problem
Similarly , people are still blocking Microsoft ’s Dumb Tags :
X - MS - Smart - Tags :
We have nothing to do with them .
X - Meta-MSSmartTagsPreventParsing : TRUE
Speaking of Microsoft , apparently the IIS team felt the need to advertise the domain of the site the user was accessing in every page request :
Server : Microsoft - IIS /5.0 jvc.org : jvc.org
How completely and utterly unnecessary …
They ’re not the only ones , though .
WebObjects powered sites spit out :
HTTP/1.1 200 Apple
Go team !
This cute header is courtesy of Caudium , a webserver written partially in Pike :
X - Got -Fish : Yes
The webmaster of www.kfki.hu should be commended for being on the bleeding edge , both using Caudium and including lots of Dublin Core metadata in the headers .
Although , 32 headers seems a bit much , which is why I ’m not going to show them all :
DC .
Subject : physics DC .
Type : organizational homepage SCHEMA .
DCTERMS : http://purl.org/dc/terms/
X- Got -Fish : Yes
Contrary to popular belief , there are people out there using Smalltalk on the web .
Two of them .
One Smalltalk software company running a web server written in Smalltalk , and another :
Server : Swazoo 0.9 ( Columbus ) X - WIKI - ENGINE : SmallWiki 1.0 CACHE -CONTROL : no-cache X - WIKI - COPYRIGHT : Software Composition Group , University of Berne , 2003
running a Smalltalk user ’s group web site with a wiki written on Smalltalk on a web server written in , you guessed it : Smalltalk .
Cool .
And , of course , it would n’t be the Internet without an appearance by a BOFH :
X - BOFH : http://www.xxxxx.de/bofh/xxxxxx.html
The actual URL it points to has been obscured to protect the guilty , and a local mirror provided in its stead .
Missed Cneonctions
This header :
Cneonction : close
and its variant :
nnCoection : close
were two of the headers which first spurred my interest in HTTP headers .
imdb.com , amazon.com , gamespy.com , and google .com have all at various times used these or similar misspellings of connection , and I ’m not by any means the first to have noticed .
My first thought was that this was just a typo .
After more consideration , however , I now believe this is something done by a hackish hardware load balancer trying to “ remove ” the connection close header when proxying for an internal server .
That way , the connection can be held open and images can be transmitted through the same TCP connection , while the backend web server does n’t need to be modified at all .
It just closes the connection and moves on to the next request .
Ex-coworker and Mudd alumus jra has a similar analysis .
Another data point which would back this up is the Oracle9iAS Web Cache rewriting :
Connection : close
as
yyyyyyyyyy : close Connection : Keep - Alive
Headers with “ X - Cnection : close ” appear to be the result of a similar trick .
One ISP / web host is kind enough to include their web address and phone number in every request to any of their hosted servers :
Phone : ( 888 ) 817-8323 Web : www.wgn.net
This is just super - awesome .
I once spent a good hour trying to find a technical contact for a certain monstrous job site to tell them their servers had been compromised and were displaying the following message to visitors :
You are being sniffed by Carnivore .
Your nation is secure .
………….. OCR IS WATCHING YOU ………….. Content - type : text / html
The message , funnily enough , was being relayed by modifying the HTTP headers .
C is for Cookie
Cookies 2 were defined in RFC 2965 , way back in October of 2000 .
As far as I know , Opera is the only browser in widespread use to support them .
It ’s sad , really , as the original cookie spec that Netscape came up with is kind of lame .
Specifically , Netscape ’s spec defines the expiration as a date , which is vulnerable to clock skew on the user ’s system making the cookie expire early .
The Cookies - 2 spec , on the other hand , uses a max - age attribute , specifying the lifetime of the cookie in seconds :
Set - Cookie2 : Meyer_Sound_777=68.126.233.177.1122451925660461 ; path= / ; max-age=1209600 ; domain=.meyersound.com ; version=1
There are also Comment and CommentURL fields which explain what the cookie is for , but I have yet to find a header which uses them .
* sigh *
On the other hand , I did find 518 Set - Cookie2 headers , which , while miniscule compared to the 764,976 SetCookie headers I received , is more than I expected .
It looks like software written by Sun is responsible for most of these .
A bunch of servers spit out :
shmget ( ) failed :
No space left on device
Doh !
Time to cycle some log files .
Pingback discovery headers like this show up a lot ( 2370 times ) :
X - Pingback : http://www.nextthing.org/wordpress/xmlrpc.php
I do n’t even know what to say to this , found at ebrain.ecnext.com :
HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date : Sun , 24 Jul 2005 18:39:54 GMT

The list goes onâ€ ¦
The Coral Content Distribution Network has been getting some buzz lately , so I was interested to see some
X - Coral - Control : redirect - home
headers show up .
This header is used to tell Coral that if Coral ca n’t handle the load of requests for cached copies of your page , it should redirect these requests back to your site .
Why anyone would think to themselves , “ Gee , if a massively scalable caching service running on hundreds of geographically distributed computers can’t handle the load of people wanting to look at my site , I ’ll just have them bounce people back at me ” , I do n’t know .
Masochism perhaps ?
Speaking of P2P technologies , I was interested to run across a KaZaA server :
HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found X - Kazaa - Username : anonymous_user X - Kazaa - Network : KaZaA X - Kazaa-IP : xx.xx.xx.xx:1348 X- Kazaa-SupernodeIP : xx.xx.xx.x:3699
It looked like it was running on someone ’s DVR .
Anyone have any pointers as to what software does that ?
Along the same lines , haha :
X - Kaza - Username : hrosen X - Kaza - Network : RIAA X - Kaza-IP : 146.82.174.12:80 X- Kaza-SupernodeIP : 68.163.90.12:80 X - Disclaimer : All Your Base Are Belong To Us X - Pizza - Phone : 961.1.351904
They ’re not even the only ones using “ X - Disclaimer ” , a bunch of other sites do too :
X - Disclaimer :
The local sysadmins have * nothing * to do with the content of this server .
It looks like Tux Games is trying to extend the venerable RFC 1097 to the web :
X - Subliminal :
You want to buy as many games as you can afford
Personally , I would ’ve gone for : “ X - Superliminal : Hey you , buy some games ! ” .
I ’m sure these kind folks would be first adopters :
X - Cotton : The Fabric of Our Lives
This person wants to make their opinion known , so here it is :
Veto :
Usage of server response for statistics and advertising is disagreed !
To which I say : Take off every ‘ zig ’!!
You know what you doing .
Robot Rock
I ’d never really paid much attention to the Robots header :
ROBOTS : index , follow , cache
as it ’s mostly used to disable indexing of a page and is intended to be used in a meta tag in the HTML itself , not in the HTTP headers .
However , it seems Google has added a new NOARCHIVE attribute , so let ’s see who ’s using it in their headers rather than in the meta tags like Google specifies .
It looks like the Singapore - based “ Ministry of Pets ” does n’t want to be cached , as does the Civil Engineering department at SÃ£o Paulo Polytechnic University , the realtime - 3d software company MultiGen Paradigm , Swiss handicraft company Schweizer Heimatwerk , a Swiss kitesailing site , the Ragin ’ Cajun Cafe in Hermosa Beach , CA , the London - based Bouncing Fish web consultancy , and the French financial paper La Tribune .
That ’s it .
Bouncing
Fish even goes so far as to use an additional GOOGLEBOT header :
GOOGLEBOT : NOCACHE
How many of these sites are not being cached by Google ?
Zero .
Which just goes to show that one should n’t just expect mix - and - matching of specs to work .
Along the same vein , I do n’t think the first two headers below will work as expected :
X -Meta-ROBOTS : ALL X - Meta-Revisit - After : 1 days Robots : INDEX , FOLLOW
Except , possibly , in spiders using Perl ’s HTML :: HeadParser module .
And , of course , we ’ve already seen that the third header probably wo n’t work , either .
While I ’m on the subject of Google … all Blogspot sites spit out :
test : %{HOSTNAME}e
So Blogger folks , whatcha doin’ ?
It ’s Funny , Laugh
The fine folks at www.basement.com.au want to make it clear that :
Mickey - Mouse : Does_Not_Live_Here
Some people have a lot of fun with headers , as seen here :
Limerick :
There was a young fellow named Fisher Limerick :
Who was fishing for fish in a fissure , Limerick :
When a cod , with a grin , Limerick : Pulled the fisherman in Limerick :
Now they 're fishing the fissure for Fisher .
This is the only ascii art I found :

and it had me puzzled , until I realized it ’s a telnet server , and the above is a really clever hack to redirect browsers towards HTML - land .
This made me laugh :

Apparently the site has an alter - ego , as well .
www.wrestlingdb.com has some interesting headers .
A few requests gets :
X - Stone - Cold - Steve - Austin :
And that 's the bottom line , cause Stone Cold says so .
X - Mick - Foley : Have a nice day !
X - Ric - Flair :
To be the man , WHOOO ! , you 've got to beat the man .

Just so everyone knows , Frostburg students are so totally leet , they do n’t even need to spell it correctly :

Western Europe , that is .
Jaaa .
Speaking of furriners , anyone care to translate :

Similarly :

Going back to my discussion on standards , localizing headers that are used to actually do stuff is a bad idea :

As if we needed further proof that the soft underbelly of the Internet is full of cults , slowly corrupting the moral fabric of society , I present :
X -SAVIOUR : BOB_DOBBS
From the looks of things , Living Slack Master Bob Dobbs is giving Jesus a run for his money among Oregonian carpenters and their web designers .

And if you thought that was an obscure meme , try this on for size :
X - Lerfjhax : Extra yummy
When I first saw an X - Han header , I thought for sure the contents would be “ Shot first ! ” , but instead I found something more obscure :
X - Han : ' I look forward to a tournament of truly epic proportions . '
While we ’re on pop culture allusions :
X - Powered - By : Twine X - Towelie :

And it would be difficult to be more obscure than this :
X - Sven : look out for the fruits of life
Finally , old school Mac - diehards should appreciate :

Back when I was interviewing for an internship at Tellme Networks , they had a comment buried on their homepage that said :

I thought this was just way awesome .
However , if I was disappointed when they removed that comment , I ’m even more disappointed to report that I have yet to find a single HTTP header offering me a cool job .
What ’s wrong with you people ?!
I ’m supposed to be able to find anything on the Internet !
I was , at least , thanked for my efforts , and I found the answer to life , the universe , and everything !
X - Thank - You : for bothering to look at my HTTP headers X - Answer : 42
You ’re welcome !
And thank you all , for making the Internet so interesting !
January 29 , 2009  --
Once named as one of the " 50 Politicos to Watch , " Republican lobbyist Todd Boulanger is now under the spotlight for a very different reason : he is expected to plead guilty to federal charges for influence - peddling as part of the wide - ranging investigation into the activities of the now - jailed Jack Abramoff , according to recently filed court documents .
The documents , filed in federal court in Washington , indicate that Boulanger , a former staffer for former Sen. Bob Smith ( R - NH ) , is expected to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy for honest services fraud for giving " a stream of things of value , " that were intended " as a means of influencing , securing and rewarding official action . "
His expected plea shows that even after the Republicans have fallen from power , the investigation into the party 's abuses continues and is expected to lead to new criminal indictments in the coming months .
It may also put pressure on another former Abramoff associate , Kevin Ring , who has been charged in a 10 - count indictment for conspiring with Abramoff to influence public officials through gift giving and skirting disclosure requirements but maintains that he did nothing illegal .
It is unclear if Boulanger 's plea would lead to trouble for other members of Congress , but he has been tied to fundraising for former Florida Republican Rep .
Tom Feeney , who was defeated last year , and Sen. Thad Cochran ( R - MS ) .
A spokesperson for Cochran said he is not a target of an investigation .
Feeney could not be reached for immediate comment .
Mark Flanagan , a lawyer for Boulanger , said in a statement that " Mr. Boulanger regrets this situation and is accepting responsibility for certain past conduct . "
He added , " Mr. Boulanger is cooperating with the Department of Justice in its investigation and looks forward to its complete and swift resolution . "
Boulanger first began lobbying in 1999 , joing Abramoff at the first of Preston Gates and following him to Greenberg Traurig until 2004 , when the first public reports raised questions about Abramoff 's lobbying operation .
It was then that Boulanger moved to Cassidy & Associates , a Washington lobbyist powerhouse , where he managed to reestablish himself , boasting clients from Whirlpool Corp. to the Motion Picture Association of America .
Indeed , just this year The Politico listed him as one of the " players " to watch , noting , " From his successful weathering of the Jack Abramoff storm to his many cable TV appearances , Boulanger has proven his nattily attired , outside - the - box staying power . "
Tickets for Sporting events and Concerts
The scrutiny into Boulanger was first disclosed in court documents filed in November of as part of the plea agreement of Trevor Blackann , a former congressional staffer to Sen.
Christopher Bond ( R - Mo. ) and Rep. Roy Blunt ( R - Mo. ) .
Blackann pleaded guilty in November to making false statements on his 2003 tax return about $ 4,100 in gifts he received from lobbyists including Boulanger .
This week 's court filing offered few details on Boulanger 's activities as part of the conspiracy .
The only example of his efforts to influence was a series of emails involving someone named as Staffer E , who worked for a senator that could help Boulanger with one of his tribal clients .
Asking how many tickets she could get for various concerts and sporting events , Boulanger once wrote she " should get everything she wants . "
But in Blackann 's plea documents , Boulanger 's link with Blackann was spelled out .
According to the documents , Boulanger began giving Blackann tickets for sporting events and concerts shortly before Blackann joined Bond 's staff December 2000 .
The relationship grew , particularly in 2003 when Boulanger turned to him for a help with a client , United Rentals .
Boulanger would also buy Blackann meals and drinks , continuing until he resigned from Greenberg Traurig in March 2004 .
During 2003 alone , Boulanger spent more than $ 3,100 buying such gifts for Blackann , according to the documents .
The biggest event was in October 2003 when Boulanger took Blackann , along with another staffer and former Abramoff associate John Hirni , who has also pleaded guilty to the same conspiracy charge , on a free trip to the first game of the World Series in New York , including round - trip airfare , an overnight stay in a hotel , a private chauffeur , a souvenir baseball jersey , food and drink as well as " admission to and entertainment at a gentlemen 's club following the game , " according to Blackann 's plea agreement .
During this period , Boulanger would often ask Blackann for help with clients , including in February 2001 when Boulanger asked Blackann to help obtain a letter of support from his boss for " a person seeking political appointment in the Bureau of Indian Affairs , " according to Blackann 's plea .
The Justice Department informed Bond he is not a target of the investigation , according to his office .
Boulanger and Blackann were personal friends .
( According to a 2005 article in The Hill newspaper , the two went sailing together . )
But , according to the court document , " Blackann knew that the lobbyists gave these things of value for or because of officials action they were seeking from him or had obtained from him . "
And , it said , he took those gifts knowingly .

WASHINGTON  The Pentagon has not started complying with a law requiring the payment of monthly bonuses of up to $ 500 to soldiers forced to remain on active duty beyond their enlistment period , military officials said .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman acknowledged the five - month delay in paying the bonuses and said the Defense Department is working on a plan to start paying the almost 13,000 soldiers currently under the Army 's stop - loss orders .
Although Defense Secretary Robert Gates wants to end the policy , the number of soldiers affected has risen since the middle of 2007 .
Congress added $ 72 million to pay for the bonuses in its plan for the budget year that started Oct.
1 . The money was to be paid after the Pentagon submitted a plan outlining how the payments would be made .
But no plan has been provided , Rob Blumenthal , a spokesman for the Senate Appropriations Committee , said Friday .
" It is unacceptable that the Department ( of Defense ) has failed to construct a plan for issuing these payments , " said Rep. John Murtha , D - Pa. , who chairs the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense .
" Stop loss is nothing more than a backdoor draft , and … if the Defense Department is going to insist on holding servicemembers under stop - loss orders , then they should be compensated for their service . "
Paul Rieckhoff , executive director and founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America , said the Pentagon is " dragging its feet " on implementing the pay bonus .
Since 2002 , the military has relied on stop loss to keep its most skilled and experienced troops in the service .
The Army is the only service that has used it in the past five years , according to a Congressional Research Service report released last month .
The number of soldiers affected by stop loss peaked in 2005 at 15,758 .
Gates first directed the Army to minimize the use of stop loss in January 2007 .
However , after falling to 8,540 in May 2007 , the number of soldiers on stop loss has risen to almost 13,000 in December 2008 , Army records show .
That 's almost 10 % of the total number of soldiers deployed in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , the Congressional Research Service report shows .
Gates directed Army leaders in January to present a comprehensive plan for ending the stop - loss policy , Whitman said .
Gates is due to be briefed on those plans this week , Whitman said .
" Senior officials are disappointed that the recent trend has been going in the wrong direction with respect to the numbers ( of soldiers currently stop - lossed ) , " Whitman said .

High dose coffee linked to hallucinations ?
I 've gone through heavy caffeine phases in my life , but never to the point where I was sensing the presence of deceased people :
Heavy drinkers of coffee , tea , energy drinks , and other caffeinated beverages are more likely to hallucinate , hear imaginary voices , and even sense the presence of deceased people , a new study suggests .
Among the 200 test subjects , those who consumed the equivalent of seven cups of coffee a day were found to be three times more likely to have hallucinatory experiences than those who consumed less than a single cup a day .
Before you high school students throw out all your bottles of Robitussin and switch to caffeine binges , take note :
Before you high school students throw out all your bottles of Robitussin and switch to caffeine binges , take note : Lead author Simon Jones , a psychology Ph.D. student at Durham University in the U.K , is intrigued but cautious about the connection .
" This has n't shown that caffeine causes hallucinations , though the data are consistent with that idea , " he said .
" It could also be that people who have hallucinations are more anxious and worried , so that causes them to consume more caffeine . "
Which is kind of a curious statement - I would have thought people who have hallucinations would be reaching for something a little more soothing than caffeine .
At any rate , the overall finding is n't totally surprising ( a super high dose of a stimulant causes weird & freaky experiences ?
no way ! ) - but it does beg the question of how long will it be before this powerful LSD - like substance is banned by the states in order to protect our children ?

It appears James Stevenson of Insomniac Games has let the cat out of the bag in regards to firmware update 2.70 .
According to James , the latest R2 patch that will allow for dual PSN logins for split screen play will require a firmware update .
He admitted this during some banter in Joystiq ’s comments .
“ This is correct .
Resistance 2 is the first game to fully log - in two PSN accounts .
LBP only logs you in locally , and does not register both accounts as online through PSN .
This is a big difference , and what is required for split - screen online co-op with other folks .
And it was dependent on a Sony update , hence why it was n’t in when the game shipped . ”
Thanks ,
JS
So there we have it .
Hopefully the FW update will go live soon and we will find out what goodies await !

Up to 70 % of students from other European Union countries are failing to repay student loans they took out while at UK universities , the BBC has learnt .
The Student Loans Company says 2,240 students should have begun repayments but 1,580 are not accounted for .
A Spanish student said she had heard nothing five years after graduating .
The government says the SLC is doing what it can to track people down .
Take - up of the entitlement is growing fast , with 46,000 now having borrowed £ 130 m .
Students from EU countries have been eligible for low interest loans from the British taxpayer to pay for their tuition fees since 2006 .
EU students are entitled to the same allowances as those in the countries in which they study .
Most of those involved are still at university so are not due to begin repaying loans until the year after graduation or withdrawal from university , and once they are earning more than £ 15,000 .
Lower salary levels apply in most other European countries .
SLC figures show that 2,240 students were due to begin repayment in 2007 and 2008 .
But 59 % of those due to start paying back their loans in 2007 did not do so , while last year that number rose to 70 % .
According to the SLC records those students , some 1,580 of them , are unaccounted for .
The loans for both years were worth about £ 3.8 m .
' Shockingly ineffective '
Experts believe this is a warning sign of much larger repayment problems to come when greater numbers of EU students start graduating .
Students crossing EU borders are entitled to local support David Willetts MP , Shadow Secretary of State for Innovation , Universities and Skills believes the SLC is not doing enough to track students down once they leave the country .
" It 's very important that the Student Loans Company is as energetic in collecting debt built up by students across the continent of Europe as they must be in collecting debts from students in Britain , " he said .
" The evidence that we 're getting already shows that the Student Loans Company is being shockingly ineffective in collecting money that 's owed . "
The BBC found one Spanish former student who graduated from a university in England almost five years ago .
Now living in her home country , she said she had been surprised that she had had no communication from the SLC about repaying her loan since graduating .
She asked not to have her name published .
" If you do n't have anyone reminding you that you owe them money , and that you have to pay , you can forget about it , " she said .
" You do n't live there and you have other priorities .
It 's quite easy just to forget .
" If you owe money to the bank but then you do n't hear from them , then you just do n't worry .
It 's just human nature . "
Voluntary
This graduate owes £ 10,000 and said that in the end she became concerned that the size of her loan was increasing because of interest , so she contacted the SLC herself .
She has just begun repaying the loan voluntarily .
" It is a loan , and when you sign a contract you have to pay it back .
It 's my responsibility to do so , " she said .
However she added that she knew of several other students who were not intending to pay back their loans until they heard from the SLC .
Students applying for loans always have to provide a permanent address , such as their parents ' home address .
But a spokesman for the SLC said it did not routinely write to parents ' addresses because it might be a breach of data protection rules .
No mechanism Collecting debts in the UK is much simpler than overseas .
Loans are recovered automatically through the tax system as soon as a former student is earning more than £ 15,000 .
Outside the country though there is no repayment mechanism .
The SLC has to rely on students informing it of their earnings and making their own payment arrangements .
British ex-students living overseas are also expected to make their own arrangements , and there is no suggestion that EU students are any more likely to avoid repaying their debts than UK students .
The BBC asked the SLC for figures relating to British students ' unpaid debts but it was unable to provide the information .
The government insisted that the SLC was doing everything it could to trace students who moved overseas .
It also claimed that many of the students potentially due to repay their loans might not yet be required to do so because their earnings were not high enough .
' Last resort '
The Higher Education Minister , David Lammy , said he took the issue seriously .
" I think it is wrong to say that there are vast numbers of students not in touch with the Student Loans Company , " he said .
" Of course there are a percentage of young people that take out loans , and then in the early years of their employment do n't repay those loans .
But I hope you are not suggesting that EU students are more dishonest than UK students , because that I would not accept . "
The SLC has not taken legal action against any EU students for non-repayment of loans , although it says it is considering taking nine former students to court .
They are understood to be from France , Spain , Poland and Greece .
Mr Lammy said that would be a last resort .
" None of us are in the business of trying to drive 20 - year - olds through the courts , " he said .
" All of us seek to remind young people of their responsibilities and that applies both to UK and EU citizens . "

EL PASO , Texas , Feb. 23 ( UPI ) --
One - third of El Paso , Texas , residents cross the Texas - Mexico border to Ciudad Juarez , Mexico , for medication and healthcare services , researchers said .
Researchers at The University of Texas School of Public Health El Paso Regional campus found cross - border medication shopping and medical attention can present health dangers -- including medications laced with toxic substances that are banned in the U.S. market ; incorrect medications or dosage prescribed by unqualified personnel ; and counterfeit medications .

Dr. Victor Cardenas said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Texas State Board of Pharmacy do not have strict regulations against cross - border medication and U.S. Customs typically allows the entry of limited quantities of medications .
The study , published in the Journal of the National Medical Association , found while 33 percent travel from El Paso to Ciudad Juarez , 5.2 percent travel from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso seeking more affordable and easily accessible medication and healthcare services .
" This ( study ) is a mirror of what happens across the entire U.S. - Mexico border .
The three main reasons people travel across border lines are affordable medications and services ; savings on doctors ' fees by using a pharmacy attendant as a doctor ; and the attentiveness of bilingual pharmacy attendants who can answer questions in depth for patients , " study investigator Jose Rivera of The University of Texas at Austin said in a statement .
The child was persuaded off the ledge by his favourite superhero
An unusual disguise has helped a Bangkok fireman rescue an eight - year - old boy who had climbed on to a third - floor window ledge , Thai police say .
The firefighter dressed up as the comic book superhero Spider - Man in order to coax the boy , who is autistic , from his dangerous perch .
Police said teachers had alerted the fire station after the boy began crying and climbed out of a classroom window .
It was reportedly his first day at the special needs school .
Efforts by the teachers to persuade the pupil to come back inside had failed .
But a remark by his mother about his passion for comic superheroes prompted fireman Somchai Yoosabai to rush back to the station , where he kept a Spider - Man costume in his locker .
The sight of Mr Somchai dressed as Spider - Man and holding a glass of juice for him , brought a big smile to the boy 's face , and he promptly threw himself into the arms of his " superhero " , police said .
Mr Somchai normally uses the costume to liven up fire drills in schools .
Over the years there have been postings to AUE that were based upon the misconception that the genitive case always indicates possession .
This fallacy leads to people saying things like ' It ca n't be right to say " the room 's furnishings " because a room can't possess something . '
The genitive case is in fact used for several things besides possession .
Bergen and Cornelia Evans , in A Dictionary of Contemporary American Usage , discuss seven genitive types :
Classifying or descriptive genitive ( " the room 's furnishings " )
Possessive genitive ( " Irene 's coat " ) Subjective and objective genitive ( " God 's creation " )
Genitive of purpose ( " He has written many children 's books . " )
Measures and other adverbial genitives ( " At one time the genitive form of certain words could be used as an adverb .
Most of our adverbs that end in an 's ' ( or 'z ' ) sound , such as " nowadays , " " since , " " sometimes , " " upwards , " are survivals from this period . )
Survivals of " an old genitive of source " ( " hen 's eggs " )
Partitive and appositive genitives ( do n't exist in English , but we express them with an " of " phrase , as in " some of us , " " the state of Ohio , " " the title of president " )
( The Evanses give a detailed discussion of each type ; I 've only hinted at their discussions , mostly by giving a few examples . )
Merriam - Webster 's Dictionary of English Usage says , in part :
Bishop Lowth in 1762 used the word possessive in place of the older term genitive ; so then did other 18th - century grammarians , and many grammarians since have used it .
This change in terminology has led to a few minor usage problems based on the erroneous supposition that the only function of the genitive is to show possession . [...]
Fries found that the possessive genitive was the most common , but that it accounted for only 40 - percent of all genitives .
They discuss a number of uses of the genitive and give examples of each .
Under ' descriptive genitive or classifying genitive ' , with the comment ' Fries adds the genitive of measure to this ' , they list :
the room 's furnishings
the airplane 's speed
the building 's foundation
one day 's leave
a dollar 's worth
a year 's wages
the Eighty Years ' War
A comment in MWDEU concerns the rephrasing of the genitive with apostrophe to a structure with a prepositional phrase , as in :
' the airplane 's speed ' => ' the speed of the airplane ' .
They point out that in what one grammarian ( Evans ) has called the genitive of purpose the prepositional phrase must use the preposition ' for ' rather than ' of ' , as in :
' men 's shirts ' => ' shirts for men ' , and
' a girls ' school ' => ' a school for girls ' .
Mark Israel 's AUE FAQ does n't cover the genitive - equals - possessive fallacy per se , but he does skirt the perimeter of it with :
The Latin plural of " curriculum vitae " is " curricula vitae " .
[ . . . ]
This is a feature of the Latin genitive of content , which
differs in this regard from the more common Latin genitive
of possession .
A classic story in linguistics lore tells of the grammarian who tried to classify all of the ways the genitive can be used .
He eventually threw up his hands and said that the genitive is the case that shows any relationship between two substantives .
As we ’ve reported regularly over the last two days , Victoria , Australia has experienced the worst natural disaster in Australian history .
As I type this post , the official death toll has risen to 130 , with up to 200 people believed dead .
It ’s a tragedy beyond all reckoning .
So what do you think the Australian Minister for Censorship Senator Stephen Conroy was doing ?
Well he was promoting the Australian Governments censorship proposal .
In a release titled “ Australia participates in Safer Internet Day 2009 ” Senator Conroy promoted the Rudd Governments $ 125.8 million cyber -safety plan to help create a safer online environment .
The cornerstone of that policy is the Great Firewall of Australia .
In case some bright spark in the Government picks up on the sensitivity fail , the screen capture above captures Conroy ’s fuck the fires , censorship stands in the way of no man press release .
I ’ve sent a message to the Australian Prime Minister on Twitter at @kevinruddpm calling on Conroy to be sacked , and I ’d encourage others to do so .
ZURICH ( Reuters ) - Switzerland is ready to consider taking in detainees from the U.S. prison for terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba if that helps to shut it down , the Swiss government said on Wednesday .
“ For Switzerland , the detention of people in Guantanamo is in conflict with international law .
Switzerland is ready to consider how it can contribute to the solution of the Guantanamo problem , ” the government said in a statement .
Switzerland said it welcomed the expressed intention of U.S. President Barack Obama to close the prison and would investigate security and legal implications of possibly taking in detainees .
Hours after taking office on Tuesday , Obama ordered military prosecutors in the Guantanamo war crimes tribunals to ask for a 120 - day halt in all pending cases .
The camp is widely seen as a stain on the United States ’ human rights record under the administration of George W. Bush .
European governments , which for years have called for the camp to be closed , are under pressure to help find a home for around 245 remaining detainees .
The camp has held more than 750 captives since opening in 2002 , most without trial .
Under Bush , Washington tried in vain to persuade its allies , in particular in the 27 - nation European Union , to take in inmates who cannot go back to their home country and who the United States does not want to accept either .
Switzerland , which is not a member of the EU , has historically attracted refugees from trouble spots around the world and is home to international humanitarian organizations like the Red Cross and U.N. refugee agency .
But its reputation for tolerance has been threatened by the rise of the right - wing Swiss People ’s Party ( SVP ) , and its campaigns against immigration .
The SVP condemned the government overture as giving “ free rein for terrorists . ”
Portugal was the first EU state to say it would accept detainees and France has said it is ready to do so as well , but others are less enthusiastic .
EU foreign ministers will discuss the issue at a meeting on January 26 .
EU Justice Commissioner Jacques Barrot welcomed on Wednesday Obama ’s plans to freeze military trials at Guantanamo .
“ I am delighted that one of the first actions of President Obama was to turn the page on this sad episode of Guantanamo prison , ” he said in a statement .
“ For me , this is very symbolic .
In a lawful state , everybody should enjoy the right to defense . ”
PHNOM PENH ( Reuters ) -
The chief Khmer Rouge torturer went on trial for crimes against humanity on Tuesday , the first senior Pol Pot cadre to be tried by the “ Killing Fields ” court three decades after the deaths of 1.7 million Cambodians .
Kaing Guek Eav , alias Duch and ex-commandant of the notorious S - 21 prison , did not address the court , but sat impassively as lawyers haggled over procedural matters .
Hundreds of victims , including saffron - robed Buddhist monks who were persecuted during the 1975 - 79 Khmer Rouge era , packed the public gallery , reacting with anger and relief at the sight of 66 - year - old Duch in the dock .
“ This is the day we have waited for 30 years , ” said Vann Nath , 63 , one of a handful of survivors from S - 21 where at least 14,000 “ enemies of the revolution ” were tortured and killed .
This week ’s hearings will lay the groundwork for a full - blown trial in March , when Duch and survivors are expected to testify .
Duch , now a born - again Christian , has expressed remorse before facing the joint Cambodian - U.N. tribunal , set up to prosecute “ those most responsible ” for one of the darkest chapters of the 20th century .
“ Duch wishes to ask forgiveness from the victims and the Cambodian people .
He will do so publicly , ” French defense lawyer Francois Roux told reporters at the specially built court outside the Cambodian capital .
The trial is a landmark for the strife - torn country where nearly everyone lost loved ones in the violence , starvation and disease that followed Pol Pot ’s dream of an agrarian utopia .
It also ends a decade of wrangling over jurisdiction and cash at the tribunal , which had left many Cambodians wondering if Pol Pot ’s surviving henchmen would ever face a judge .
“ Today is history and they hope the court will bring them justice , ” said Hong Kim Suon , a lawyer representing victims .
The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia , as the joint tribunal is known , has been called an “ experiment in international justice , ” with domestic and foreign judges working side - by - side to try to ensure its independence .
But critics say its integrity is threatened by allegations of corruption and political interference over who to prosecute .
“ Any hint of political manipulation at the tribunal will undermine its credibility with the Cambodian people , ” said Sara Colm , Cambodian - based senior researcher at Human Rights Watch .

Four other Khmer Rouge cadres have been charged but a bid to go after more suspects was brushed aside last month by the tribunal ’s Cambodian co-prosecutor , who said it would not help national reconciliation .
Cabinet spokesman Siphan
Phay denied any meddling and said the government wanted to complete the trials of the five people already facing charges before going after other suspects .
“ First things first , ” he told reporters .
“ We have never said we opposed anything , but let ’s finish these first . ”

YEAR ZERO
Duch also faces charges of war crimes , torture and homicide while chief of S - 21 , where at least 14,000 men , women and children passed through the barbed wire gates .
After being forced to confess to crimes , they were shot or beaten to death in the “ Killing Fields ” outside the capital .
Only 12 survived , according to the U.S. - funded Documentation Center of Cambodia , which has researched the Khmer Rouge era .
“ Duch ’s hands are full of blood .
It ’s time for Duch to pay for his actions , ” said 39 - year - old Norng Chan Phal , a child survivor of S - 21 who is among survivors expected to be allowed to join the trial process .
Duch is one of five aging senior cadres charged for their roles in the “ Year Zero ” revolution that ended when a Vietnamese invasion forced the Khmer Rouge back into the jungles in 1979 .
He is expected to be a key witness in the trials of “ Brother Number Two ” Nuon Chea , Khieu Samphan , who was the regime ’s ex-president , and Ieng Sary , its foreign minister , and his wife .
These four have denied knowledge of any atrocities by the Khmer Rouge during its rule , which began by driving everyone out of the cities with whatever they could carry .
If convicted , the five could face life in prison .
Pol Pot ’s death in 1998 was followed by a formal Khmer Rouge surrender which helped to usher in a decade of peace and stability , threatened now by the global economic downturn .
Copy and paste , data tethering , and now Flash -- it looks like the Pre 's going to fill in a lot of unchecked iPhone feature boxes , does n't it ?
Yep , Palm 's just joined Adobe 's Open Screen Project , and there 's no two bones about what that means : the press release flat out says " the Open Screen Project will help deliver Adobe Flash Player for smartphones on the new Palm webOS platform . "
That 's especially interesting since the webOS SDK is so heavily based on web technologies and native player support potentially opens the door for Flash - based apps , which would instantly bring a ton of new devs to the Pre .
That 's not a bad thing .
We 'll find out more at the end of the year , when the mobile Flash player is due to arrive .

The smartly dressed young woman scribbles some percentages onto a board .
As she talks about excel spread sheets , due diligence , final contracts and $ 10 m ( £ 6.9 m ) deals , about 40 men sit in rows behind her listen intently and take notes .
It may sound just like any other business school class , but the students are surrounded by the high fences and razor wire of the Cleveland Correctional Facility , just north of Houston .
Four years ago Catherine Rohr was a venture capitalist on Wall Street .
Then she left her job with its six - figure salary and decided to create the Prison Entrepreneurship Program , or PEP .
They do n't all understand risk management as well as they should because they all got busted
Catherine Rohr , Founder of PEP
Since then she has shared her professional experience with almost 400 inmates .
It all started when Ms Rohr was invited into another Texas prison by a fellow executive from her church .
At first she was not very interested .
" I did n't know any prisoners personally , but I thought ' just lock 'em up and throw away the key ' , " she says .
" I saw them as a waste of tax dollars .
I was very brutal in my approach . "
But Catherine then recognised that many were ordinary human beings who had made some serious mistakes in their lives .
She also spotted something else , something missed by the majority of prison visitors , namely the men's ' ROI ' or return on investment potential .
" It was n't just their potential , it was their proven abilities " , she says .
" They understand basic leadership and management principles , profitability .
" They do n't all understand risk management as well as they should because they all got busted when they came to prison , but when it comes to execution and marketing - they get it . "
Felipe Dias is a former member of the Mexican Mafia now studying business .
Ms Rohr realised that influential convicted felons could be America 's most overlooked talent pool .
Felipe Dias is one of the convicts Catherine plans to redirect into a legitimate enterprise .
He was once a lieutenant of the Mexican Mafia gang and made tens of thousands of dollars a month importing drugs and selling firearms and stolen cars .
I ask the soft spoken , heavily tattooed man what made him capable of leading 800 gang members .
He looks me straight in the eye and replies : " When I made a decision it was a firm decision .
I had to use investigative skills .
" You see , before you hurt somebody or you promote somebody in the gang you have to investigate everything from A to Z .
You can not leave a single stone unturned . "
But how do you make men like Dias channel their energies and skills into a more positive and legitimate direction ?
Like many people , Ms Rohr is familiar with The Wire , an American TV series set in gritty west Baltimore , which shows how the drug trade explicitly follows the rules of capitalism .
One of the characters , a high ranking dealer attends evening classes at a business school to learn the rules of running an enterprise .
" Our goal is not to turn a good crack dealer into a better one " , she says .
" We aim to transform the whole personality " .
A fresh start Dias says he wants to start a tailoring shop when he gets out as he has learned to sew recently and often alters prison uniforms , including those of the guards .
But will such a modest enterprise really satisfy him after years of highly lucrative crime ?
" I 've made a decision that I will start from nothing " , he says .
" Sometimes when I am in my cell I tremble from fear because now I know I have to do everything the right way this time around . "
PEP has created a network of top executives and business schools around the country to help the inmates achieve the American dream .
Prisoners get advice on business plans , operating budgets and market research .
They learn to make elevator pitches in front of millionaire executives and Harvard students .
Most funding comes from individuals and private foundations , but the scheme also receives donations from corporations .
Inmates get to pitch their business ideas to leading company executives John Jackson , an oil pipeline boss , got an award for his work with PEP from President George Bush last summer .
In his sleek high - rise office , he explains how he began thinking about the plight of ex-cons after his own brother was convicted for drink driving and could n't get a job on his release .
He says many businesses would like to give felons a chance , but they are afraid of the risks involved with a 50 to 70 % national reoffending rate .
" The beauty of PEP is that there has been an extremely rigorous programme up front " , he says .
" You can come into the prison and see these guys who have really worked hard to do a business plan and they have expressed a sincere desire to change .
" So employers can take a chance on an individual but it is not just a random chance . "
Jimmy Vigil was sent to Texas in 1999 to find new members for the Milwaukee Kings , the biggest Latino crime syndicate in Chicago .
At first he enjoyed the power and the money , but he was convicted of attempted murder , sent to prison and the glamour of his street life faded and he began to feel remorse for his actions .
They give you a clean slate - they do n't look at you as a felon or a convict or somebody who does wrong .
They look at you as someone with potential
Jimmy Vigil , former gang member Vigil saw a PEP flyer on the prison notice board , signed up and four months later he got an interview .
After all , he did have experience in sales and recruitment .
Following an intense screening process of 1,100 applicants from 65 Texas prisons , he was one of 69 selected .
" I felt truly blessed to be one of the 69 , " he says .
" They give you a clean slate .
They do n't look at you as a felon or a convict or somebody who does wrong .
They look at you as someone with potential . "
Permanent change
But staying the course is tough .
Usually only two thirds of the class will graduate .
Some drop out because they cannot handle the peer - driven character assessments .
Others cannot manage the workload , with 40 exams in 17 weeks .
The programme 's reoffending rate , admittedly based on a carefully selected group of students , is less than 5 % and Ms Rohr is determined to keep it that way .
Entrepreneurial success stories include a man who served 10 years for leading a cocaine ring and is now running a tree trimming company with a turnover of more than $ 1 m a year .
PEP graduate
Troy with the first dollar he made from his new business Another man , who served a 30 year sentence for multiple murders , got out aged 55 and is now profitably producing leather purses , belts and Bible covers .
Some 43 of the 370 graduates have started their own businesses .
But Catherine says she is also proud of those who come out , manage to hold down steady jobs and become taxpayers rather than tax consumers .
More than 97 % are employed at an hourly rate of about $ 10.50 within four weeks of release , well above the American minimum wage .
Troy , a PEP graduate , did not have many roles models when he was growing up .
His mother was an addict who died of an overdose and his elder brother is still selling drugs , but he decided he wanted to take another path .
Now he has completed his sentence and has just opened a car repair workshop in South Houston .
" When I was young I thought it was cool to sell drugs and cool to be violent , " he says .
" It took a lot of beating my head against a wall to realise that was n't right .
With PEP
I had somebody to believe in me and mentor me and coach me for the first time in my life . "
Proudly he shows me the new weapons he has to help him go straight ; a box of tools and an air impact gun for changing tyres .
Then I notice the banknote taped to the door .
" It 's the first dollar I earned , " says Troy with a grin .
" I guess I ought to frame it . "

You 've built the ultimate gaming rig with a great processor , fast video , a stunning display and superb sound .
Now you need a keyboard to match , the M1 from ABS .
This is not some throw away unit that will die on you in the middle of a firefight or party raid .
This is a fully mechanical keyboard designed to keep you in the game .
It does n't have all the extra keys common today , it 's just a solid 104 - key unit than can handle just about anything .
Each key has its own mechanical switch .
You will feel each key click as it traverses its 4 mm path so you know that it has been pressed .
The full sized keyboard is made with minimal extraneous space .
The different sections are all close together to keep your hands on the keys and not wandering about hunting .
The smaller size lets you keep mice and joysticks closer to hand as well .
Capping it all off is the gold plated USB connector for maximum connectivity .
Golf can make you deaf , according to an article in the British Medical Journal .
My first thought when I heard this , courtesy of a hilarious article in Scientific American by Steve Mirsky , was that it must be the screams of frustration .
Actually no , it ’s the 112 decibel BANG !
produced by a certain titanium driver 1.7 meters from the golfer ’s ear .
The patient in the BMJ case study suffered 20 dB of hearing loss at frequencies between 3 - 6 kHz .
He described the sound of his King Cobra LD driver hitting the ball as being like “ a gun going off . ”
An Internet search found a number of other comments about the sound of this driver , such as , “ This is not so much a ting but a sonic boom which resonates across the course ! ”
You ’ve got to hand it to the manufacturers of these new drivers .
They ’ve found a completely new way ( after water , bunker , sand , frustration , and boredom ) to spoil a good walk .

EDMONTON - Alberta 's bragging rights as Canada 's economic engine are fading and Premier Ed Stelmach says people seem to be a little grumpy about it .
" Everybody 's saying `Ooh !
This province is doing better than we are , " ' Stelmach said .
" Man , I do n't know what it is that somebody does better and it's like everybody gets concerned . "
The energy bonanza has come to a crashing halt , suddenly putting the province near the bottom of the pack for economic growth in the country this year .
The latest Conference Board of Canada outlook projects growth of minus 0.5 per cent , the first negative figure the province has seen in nearly a quarter of a century .
That 's in stark contrast to a place that led the country in growth for three years starting in 2004 .
But Stelmach actually seems a bit relieved that Alberta is no longer No. 1 .
" Thank God ! " he said in reaction to the news that Saskatchewan is now in top spot with projected growth of 1.6 per cent .
" I hope every province does better .
I hope Manitoba , Quebec and the Maritimes do n't rely on equalization . "
Conference board economist Todd Crawford says Alberta 's extremely strong growth over the past few years overheated things in the province .
" Alberta 's economy has been running so hot the cost of living has exploded , " said Crawford .
" Saskatchewan is just at the beginning of a boom , whereas Alberta has been booming for quite some time .
" With all the activity going on in the oilsands and the price of oil coming down 70 or 80 per cent from its peak last summer , we 've seen most of the oil companies cancel pretty much every major project happening in Alberta . "
But Crawford said oil prices are expected to rebound next year as the U.S. economy begins to turn around , the Canadian economy starts to bounce back and the global economy stabilizes .
" That 's obviously good news for Alberta , " he said .
" We can expect to see the oilsands producers and energy companies begin to reinvest in the province . "
The conference board projects that Alberta will climb back to second place in Canada for 2010 , with growth of four per cent .
But for now , the province is preparing to make some tough decisions as the meltdown continues and the energy windfall that produced surplus budgets for 15 consecutive years evaporates .
" We 're going to have some serious meetings with Albertans to see how to ensure that we do n't put this province in the same situation that we had to recover from in the early ' 90s , " said Stelmach .
The premier says he 's concerned about the impact that Alberta 's falling fortunes will have on the rest of Canada .
" Because our contribution to Ottawa last year was quite substantial , it was over $ 18 billion , " he said .
" There wo n't be the same contribution ( this year ) and yet the prime minister has this equalization pool that he still has to share with the other provinces . "
Alberta recently released a grim update on its finances , projecting a deficit of $ 1.4 billion for the fiscal year that 's just ending and 15,000 job losses in the year ahead .
Former Alberta Liberal leader Kevin Taft , who has a PhD in business , says the province 's economic future is tied tightly to the boom / bust cycles of oil and natural gas prices .
" There 's no question the oilsands boom has gone bust , " said Taft , who is now the Liberal energy critic .
" We were riding the crest of the Canadian wave for a number of years and we could easily be going into the trough here , " he said .
" I think Alberta is in for potentially two or three years of very tough economic news . "
Stelmach , however , is more optimistic .
He told a business audience in Calgary that he expects to see economic improvement starting next year .
" Although government revenues will probably take a little longer to catch up , " Stelmach told the crowd .
" Some departments may even have a reduction from last year , but that 's to find money to fund health and education , which are priority areas . "

We 've discussed the challenges of generating profiles of potential terrorists in the past , but a study that will be released by the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science does a mathematical analysis how we 're deploying the profiles we do have , and suggests we may not be using them wisely .
The study was performed by William Press , who does bioinformatics research at the University of Texas , Austin , with a joint appointment at Los Alamos National Labs .
His background in statistics is apparent in his ability to handle various mathematical formulae with aplomb , but he 's apparently used to explaining his work to biologists , since the descriptions that surround those formulae make the general outlines of the paper fairly accessible .
Press starts by examining what could be viewed as an idealized situation , at least from the screening perspective : a single perpetrator living under an authoritarian government that has perfect records on its citizens .
Applying a profile to those records should allow the government to rank those citizens in order of risk , and it can screen them one - by - one until it identifies the actual perpetrator .
Those circumstances lead to a pretty rapid screening process , and they can be generalized out to a situation where there are multiple likely perpetrators .
Things go rapidly sour for this system , however , as soon as you have an imperfect profile .
In that case , which is more likely to reflect reality , there 's a finite chance that the screening process misses a likely security risk .
Since it works its way through the list of individuals iteratively , it never goes back to rescreen someone that 's made it through the first pass .
The impact of this flaw grows rapidly as the ability to accurately match the profile to the data available on an individual gets worse .
Since we 've already said that making a profile is challenging , and we know that even authoritarian governments do n't have perfect information on their citizens , this system is probably worse than random screening in the real world .
In the real world , of course , most of us are n't going through security checks run by authoritarian governments .
In Press ' phrasing , democracies resample with replacement , in that they do n't keep records of who goes through careful security screening at places like airports , so people get placed back on the list to go through the screening process again .
One consequence of this is that , since screening resources are never infinite , we can only resample a small subset of the total population at any given moment .
Press then examines the effect of what he terms a strong profiling strategy , one in which a limited set of screening resources is deployed solely based the risk probabilities identified through profiling .
It turns out that this also works poorly as the population size goes up .
" The reason that this strong profiling strategy is inefficient , " Press writes , " is that , on average , it keeps retesting the same innocent individuals who happen to have large p j [ risk profile match ] values . "
According to Press , the solution is something that 's widely recognized by the statistics community : identify individuals for robust screening based on the square root of their risk value .
That gives the profile some weight , but distributes the screening much more broadly through the population , and uses limited resources more effectively .
It 's so widely used in mathematical circles that Press concludes his paper by writing , " It seems peculiar that the method is not better known . "
We 're not privy to the exact details of various screening systems , so it 's possible that the optimal solution is in use in a number of contexts .
But , given that things like racial profiling are used in so many law enforcement contexts , from community policing to immigration , it 's a safe bet that there are a fair number in which it 's not .
And , given that the use of profiles is frequently the subject of public debate , having a public that 's informed of the limits of profiling could certainly help inform those debates .

Obviously , Linux vendors will not remain untouched by the economic downturn .
Novell has already announced a number of lay offs , and the openSUSE Linux division has not been spared .
openSUSE board members Pascal Blesser and Bryen Yunashko announced the lay offs .
“ ” As you may know , recently Novell made the decision to reduce the workforce in their organization in the wake of our current economic outlook which is affecting everyone globally in all sectors of life , ” they wrote , “ Unfortunately , this has also impacted some members of the openSUSE Community who were employed by Novell when , earlier this week , they were laid off . ”
Exact details are unknown , but round and about 100 employees of the total of 4200 Novell employees have been laid off .
It is no known how many of those 100 were part of the openSUSE team , but Blesser and Yunashko reiterated that Novel is committed to openSUSE and its development .
They also lashed out at Novell critics .
“ While we cannot speak for Novell and the reasons behind its decisions , we do take offence [ at ] those outside our community who have decided to exploit the hardship of our fellow community members in these trying times for their own personal gain in their misguided rants against the Project and misinterpreted portrayals to the general public . ”
The economy is affecting many companies , so I agree with them that laying off openSUSE people has little to do with Novell ’s commitment to the project .
Sadly , people had to be fired , and some of them happened to be openSUSE engineers .
Let ’s hope they have no trouble finding a new job .
Mr. Hawthorne went on gamely .
“ Learned behavior , no .
But a lot of behavior is hereditary , ” he said .
While he does acknowledge that when it comes to such highly trainable creatures as dogs , it ’s pretty difficult to know where nature ends and nurture begins , he said that in the case of his dogs , the ambiguities have nothing on the essential Missy - ness of the clones .
Image HOWLING TIME Mira , left , and MissyToo appear to be a tough audience for Lou Hawthorne , who had them cloned from the DNA of his mothers dog .

“ The girls love to run after each other , ” he said pointing at the dogs in the distance .
“ You see the speed and athleticism ?
That ’s part of what made me want to do this .
There are dogs that are faster on a straightaway , but I ’d never seen a dog make turns like this until Missy . ”
Mr. Hawthorne sees himself as a cultivator of prodigious talent  from the clones to his team of scientists in South Korea to his 8 - year - old son , Skye , who had accompanied him and the dogs on the hike .
Skye is in third grade but is already studying high school algebra .
Mr. Hawthorne brought along a notebook with a handful of quadratic - equation problems , in case his son got restless .
Last spring , Skye completed a science project , “ Cloning Grandma ’s Dog ” that included a behavioral comparison chart .
Among other findings , the study concluded that Mira shares Missy ’s fondness for broccoli and “ lots of snuggles ”  both dogs scored five out of five points in these categories , in addition to the one for “ likes long walks . ”
( “ Most dogs do , ” Skye noted under “ comments . ” )
Two key matters of variance were “ Jumps into cars ” ( “ Clone still learning which car is ours ” ) and “ Hates camera flash ” ( “ Clone did not respond to standard flash ” ) .
Ultimately , Skye determined that Mira looked a lot like Missy but that their behavior was only 77 percent similar .
“ But that was April , ” Mr. Hawthorne said .
“ I think they ’re a lot more similar now . ”
LIVING with a clone , Mr. Hawthorne claims , is a lot like living with the original dog .
“ It ’s totally as if I ’ve got Missy in my house , once you get over the ‘ wow ’ factor , ” he said .
He and Mira and Skye inhabit a two - story “ 1950s futurist house ” built into a hill in Mill Valley ( Mr. Hawthorne is divorced and shares custody of his son with his ex-wife  “ an excellent genetic donor , by the way , ” he said of her ) .
At night , he said , Mira “ puts Skye to bed , ” which means she walks with him to his room and ascends the stairs of his loft bed with him , waiting to be told “ Good night ” before she leaves .
Mira is an outdoor dog , as Missy was , and sleeps on the front steps .
And who says goodnight to Mira ’s fellow clone , MissyToo ?
Mr. Hawthorne gave her to his mother , Joan Hawthorne , who still misses the original Missy .
But she has yet to take a liking to Missy ’s progeny , and the dog has lived primarily with paid “ handlers ” in the Mill Valley pied - à - terre of her longtime companion , John Sperling .
WASHINGTON  A public park in Utah that includes a monument to the Ten Commandments need not make room for a similar monument reflecting the beliefs of an unusual religion called Summum , the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday .
Permanent monuments in public parks are not subject to the free speech analysis that applies to speeches and leaflets in public forums , the court ruled .
Instead , Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for eight justices , such monuments are “ best viewed as a form of government speech . ”
Since the government is free to say what it likes , Justice Alito said , the Summum church ’s right to free speech under the First Amendment was not violated by the city ’s rejection of its monument .
The decision was unanimous but fractured .
In four concurring opinions , six justices set out sharply contrasting views about the decision ’s scope and consequences .
Al Franken just hit another stumbling block on the road to the Senate , said Pat Doyle and Kevin Duchschere in the Minnesota 's Star - Tribune .
A three - judge panel on Tuesday kept alive Republican Norm Coleman ’s challenge of Minnesota ’s recount by saying that as many as 4,800 absentee ballots were wrongly rejected and should be considered .
“ It is n't clear to me whether the ruling is that the 4,800 ballots in question actually are valid and will be counted , ” said John Hinderaker in Power Line , or merely that they should be reviewed to see if they ’re valid .
“ Either way , it appears to be a big win for Coleman ; one that makes it appear possible that he might make up Franken 's 220 - vote lead . ”
Coleman ’s only hope is to put more ballots in play , said Nate Silver in FiveThirtyEight.com .
So , yes , this ruling is a victory for him .
But out of 150 ballots flagged as “ wrongly rejected ” by Coleman that were triple - checked earlier this month , only 1 ended up getting counted .
If that rate holds , Coleman ’s 4,800 ballots will get him 32 votes — and Franken will get the Senate seat .

Nat Rothschild , the financier at the centre of allegations that threaten to engulf the shadow Chancellor , George Osborne , is no stranger to laws which forbid politicians from accepting donations from abroad .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Political donations from overseas are also illegal in the US , where John McCain ’s campaign team is under investigation for allegedly accepting a benefit in kind from two mega-rich British citizens , namely Nat Rothschild and his father , Jacob , the Fourth Baron Rothschild .
In April , Mr McCain passed through London and spoke at a fund - raising dinner for expatriate Americans , where seats at the cheapest tables cost £ 500 a head .
What caught the eye of Judicial Watch , a Washington - based foundation dedicated to combating corruption , was that the event was held “ by kind permission of Lord Rothschild and Hon Nathaniel Rothschild ” at the family home in Spencer House , St James ’s , the only privately owned 17th - century palace in central London .
The US Federal Election Committee is still investigating the allegation that Mr McCain ’s campaign team broke electoral law by accepting a benefit in kind from the Rothschilds .
“ We have n’t heard from the FEC yet , and do n’t expect to until after the campaign , ” Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch said .

President Lula said the doctors had been trying to save the girl 's life The Brazilian president has criticised a Catholic archbishop for excommunicating several people who helped a young girl have an abortion .
The nine - year - old child underwent the abortion of twins she conceived after alleged abuse by her stepfather .
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , himself a Catholic , said he regretted what he described as the cleric 's deeply conservative attitude .
Brazil only permits abortions in cases of rape or health risks to the mother .
Doctors said the girl 's case met both these conditions , but the Catholic Church said the law of God was above any human law .
In this case , the medical profession was more right than the Church
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva The Archbishop of Olinda and Recife , Jose Cardoso Sobrinho , said the excommunication would apply to the child 's mother and the doctors , but not to the girl because of her age .
But his actions were criticised by President Lula , who said : " As a Christian and a Catholic I deeply regret that a bishop of the Catholic Church has such a conservative attitude .
" The doctors did what had to be done : save the life of a girl nine years old .
" In this case , the medical profession was more right than the Church , " AFP news agency quoted him as saying .
The girl , who lives in the north - eastern state of Pernambuco , was allegedly sexually assaulted over a number of years by her stepfather , possibly since she was six .
The abortion was carried out on Wednesday .
The fact that the girl was pregnant with twins was only discovered after she was taken to hospital in Pernambuco complaining of stomach pains .
Her stepfather was arrested last week , allegedly as he tried to escape to another region of the country .
He is also suspected of abusing the girl 's physically handicapped older sister who is now 14 .

Meredith Whitney , the banking analyst at Oppenheimer & Company , recently predicted that card companies would reduce credit lines by $ 2 trillion , or about 45 percent of all available credit , in the next 18 months .
Here , cardholders have a bit more control .
In reducing credit lines , companies may be looking for people who are already using a large percentage of their available credit .
Try to avoid doing this if possible .
NEW FEES Several years ago , Martin Rodriguez , a resident of Quincy , Mass. , transferred balances onto two Chase credit cards in response to offers promising low interest for the life of the loan .
Recently , however , Chase sent him a note informing him that he would need to raise his monthly payments and turn over a $ 10 monthly fee to keep the low rates on his $ 20,000 in debt .
To Mr. Rodriguez , “ life of the loan ” ought to mean just that .
“ I ’m searching for a legal boundary here , ” he said .
“ If you read the fine print , I would have been better off going to Tony Soprano for a loan . ”
Paul Hartwick , a Chase spokesman , said in an e-mail message that the terms and conditions of the card allowed the company to make such a change .
He also said that these changes affected less than one half of 1 percent of its accounts and were aimed at those who had carried large balances for more than two years while making little progress in paying them off .
But Robert J. Lahm Jr. , who lives in Candler , N.C. , said that he had paid off almost half his Chase balance and still got the same notice as Mr. Rodriguez .
And besides , he argued , any prudent person would delay paying off this sort of permanent low - rate loan , as he had while repaying higher - interest student loans he took on while completing his doctorate .
Mr. Hartwick said he stood by his statement and declined to comment on a class - action lawsuit that was filed in California this week over the issue .
The panel will review the latest evidence before making its decision Taking the drug ecstasy is no more dangerous than riding a horse , a senior adviser has suggested .
Professor David Nutt , chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) , outlined his view in the Journal of Psychopharmacology .
The council , which advises the government , is expected next week to recommend that ecstasy is downgraded from a class A drug to a class B one .
Ministers have outlined their opposition to any such move .
Professor Nutt wrote : " Drug harm can be equal to harms in other parts of life .
There is not much difference between horse - riding and ecstasy . "
Organ failure
The professor said horse - riding accounted for about 10 deaths a year and was associated with more than 100 road accidents .
He went on : " This attitude raises the critical question of why society tolerates - indeed encourages - certain forms of potentially harmful behaviour but not others such as drug use . "
Professor Nutt 's academic work does not prejudice that which he conducts as chair of the ACMD
ACMD spokesman Ecstasy use is linked to around 30 deaths a year , up from 10 a year in the early 1990s .
Fatalities are caused by massive organ failure from overheating or the effects of drinking too much water .
The ACMD last night distanced itself from Prof Nutt 's comments .
A spokesman for the body said : " The recent article by Professor David Nutt published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology was done in respect of his academic work and not as chair of the ACMD .
" Professor Nutt 's academic work does not prejudice that which he conducts as chair of the ACMD . "
' No safe dose ' David Raynes , of the National Drug Prevention Alliance , told the Daily Telegraph : " He is entitled to his personal opinion , but if his personal view conflicts so very strongly with his public duties , it would be honourable to consider his position .
" If he does not , the home secretary should do it for him . "
Last September a Home Office spokesman said the government believed ecstasy should remain a Class A drug .
" Ecstasy can and does kill unpredictably .
There is no such thing as a ' safe dose ' , " he said .
Correction 11 February 2009 : An earlier version of this story , based on an agency report , wrongly attributed to Professor Nutt a figure of 100 horse - riding deaths a year instead of 10 .

( CNN ) -- A
Texas district court judge Friday reversed the conviction of a man who died in prison nearly a decade ago , almost two decades into a prison sentence for a rape he swore he did not commit , CNN affiliate KXAN reported .
Timothy Cole died in prison while serving a sentence for a rape DNA tests show he did not commit .
Timothy Cole was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison for the 1985 rape of 20 - year - old Michele Mallin .
He maintained his innocence , but it was not confirmed by DNA until years after his 1999 death , when another inmate confessed to the rape .
In the courtroom of Judge Charlie Baird Friday afternoon , Mallin , now 44 , faced Jerry Johnson , the man who confessed to the rape .
" What you did to me , you had no right to do , " she told him angrily , according to Austin 's KXAN .
" You 've got no right to do that to any woman .
I am the one with the power now , buddy . "
Cole 's family also addressed Johnson .
" He 'll never have the chance to have children , " Cole 's mother , Ruby Session , said .
" I want you to know he was a fine young man . "
Johnson has been in prison since 1985 on two convictions for aggravated sexual assault , according to the Texas Department of Corrections .
He was given a life sentence for the rape of a 15 - year - old girl , and a jury later tacked on a 99 - year sentence for another rape , according to the Lubbock , Texas , Avalanche - Journal .
He cannot be charged with the Mallin case , as the statute of limitations has expired .
Johnson also spoke Friday .
" I am responsible , " he said .
" I say I am truly sorry . "
Then a student at Texas Tech University in Lubbock , Mallin was walking to her car , intending to move it to another parking lot , when a man approached her asking about jumper cables , she said .
In a matter of seconds , he put her in a choke hold and held a knife to her neck .
He forced himself into her car and drove her to the outskirts of town , where he raped her .
The next day , police investigators showed Mallin pictures of possible suspects .
She chose a picture of Cole and said he was her attacker .
She later identified him in a physical lineup , according to the Innocence Project of Texas .
" I was positive , " she said .
" I really thought it was him . "
But there was one detail : Mallin told police her attacker was a smoker .
" He was smoking the entire time . "
Cole , who suffered from severe asthma , " was never a smoker , " said his brother , Cory Session .
" He took daily medications [ for asthma ] when he was younger . "
" He was the sacrificial lamb .
To them , my brother was the Tech rapist , there was no backtracking .
It was the trial of the decade for Lubbock . "
The " Tech rapist " attacked four women other than Mallin -- abducting them in parking lots near campus and driving them to a vacant location , where he would rape them and flee on foot , according to the Innocence Project of Texas .
The rapist " terrorized " the Texas Tech campus in the mid-1980s , the organization said .
Cole , like Mallin , was a student at Texas Tech .
He had finished two years of college previously and was returning to school after spending two years in the Army , his brother said .
But his dreams of getting married and having children never materialized .
He was arrested and charged with Mallin 's rape , declining a plea bargain offer that would have put him on probation .
A jury convicted him and imposed a 25 - year sentence .
That night , " he hugged my mother and he said , ' Mother , why these people lie on me , why they do this to me ? ' "
Cole 's brother Reggie Session recounted for the Avalanche - Journal , which published a three - part series on the case in June .
" He said , ' They know I ai n't done nothing to that girl .
I do n't even know that girl .
Why they do this to me , mother ? ' ...
He cried in my mother 's arms on the floor . "
Later , while in prison , Cole rejected an offer of parole that would have required him to admit guilt .
" His greatest wish was to be exonerated and completely vindicated , " his mother , Ruby Session , told KXAN .
But the asthma that plagued Cole throughout his life brought about his death on December 2 , 1999 .
The cause was determined to be heart complications due to his asthmatic condition .
He was 39 .
It was 2007 when a letter addressed to Cole arrived at his family 's home , written by Johnson .
Read the letter »
" You may recall my name from your 1986 rape trial in Lubbock , " says the letter , dated May 11 , 2007 .
" Your Lubbock attorney , Mike Brown , tried to show I committed the rape .
" I have been trying to locate you since 1995 to tell you I wish to confess I did in fact commit the rape Lubbock wrongly convicted you of .
It is very possible that through a written confession from me and DNA testing , you can finally have your name cleared of the rape ... if this letter reaches you , please contact me by writing so that we can arrange to take the steps to get the process started .
Whatever it takes , I will do it . "
Johnson did not know Cole had died .
In fact , according to the Avalanche - Journal , he had been writing to court officials for years to confess to the rape , but got nowhere .
Upon finding out that Cole was dead , Johnson wrote he " cried and felt double guilty , even though I know the system 's at fault , " according to the Avalanche - Journal .
" A day later , I am still bothered , terribly , by the death revelation .
Because , not knowing Mr. Cole at all , I wonder if the wrongful incarceration contributed to his death . "
The Innocence Project became involved after Cole 's family received Johnson 's letter .
DNA tests confirmed that Johnson was Mallin 's attacker .
Now , Cole 's family hopes the court hearing will be the final step in clearing his name .
Mallin is helping them .
" I was very traumatized , " she said .
" I was scared for my life .
I tried my hardest to remember what he looked like .
" I 'm trying to get his name cleared .
It 's the right thing to do . "
Cory Session said , " We do n't blame Michele .
She 's very gracious . "

Experts concerned by consumer credit plan

Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner proposed to put a trillion dollars into a program to boost the supply of consumer and small business credit Tuesday , but experts say the government has not yet proved it can carry out that aspect of its plan .
The consumer credit provisions are part of a larger bailout plan that could cost more than $ 2 trillion , which he announced Tuesday at the Treasury and laid out later before the Senate Banking Committee .
Geithner 's plan in the financial crisis spooked rather than reassured Wall Street , in part because of a scarcity of details about implementation .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Geithner 's strategy for boosting automotive , credit card , student aid and small business debt involves fixing one of the most complicated mechanisms in the country 's broken financial system .
As Geithner explained , nearly half of the credit that flows to consumers and small businesses comes from the sale of asset - backed securities - similar types of loans that are packaged and resold to pension funds or other institutional investors .
Economic analyst Jane D'Arista , with the Financial Markets Center think tank , said these asset - backed securities might be bundles of student loans , small - business accounts receivables or credit card balances .
Since the 1990s , a wide assortment of lenders have used asset - backed securities as a way to replenish their funds for loans , by selling off those bundles , she said .
Economist Brian Bethune with IHS Global Insight said this consumer credit mechanism began to break down last year after the defaults on subprime mortgages caused a panic in the mortgage - backed securities market .
Investors stopped buying any kind of debt that was bundled , or securitized , whether it was mortgages or credit cards .
" This dried up the availability of car loans , student loans and small - business loans , " Bethune said .
" Lenders started to ration the credit that was available . "
Geithner said Tuesday that the amount of consumer credit flowing through asset - backed securities decreased by $ 1.2 trillion between 2006 and 2008 .
To fix this credit recycling mechanism he proposed putting $ 100 billion of the remaining bank bailout funds authorized by Congress into a special Federal Reserve fund .
That cash infusion would allow the Fed to finance the purchase of up to $ 1 trillion worth of new asset - backed securities , Treasury and Fed officials say .
This is not a new plan .
Geithner expanded a commitment that former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson made in November when he promised to give the Fed $ 20 billion of bailout funds to finance the acquisition of up to $ 200 billion in asset - backed securities .
In addition to the increase in the funds , Geithner said the program would include more asset bundles crucial to small businesses .
But experts note that the Fed has not yet started using the money pledged in November nor announced when this larger program will go into effect .
That delay is part of what roiled Wall Street on Tuesday .
Steve Brown , president of Pacific Coast Bankers ' Bank , a specialized financial institution in San Francisco , said the expansions would help consumers and small companies .
" The government is doing the best it can , but some of this is trial and error , " he said .
Professor Jim Wilcox , an expert on financial institutions at UC Berkeley 's Haas School of Business , said that once the asset - purchase program gets under way it should revive this mechanism that has been used to raise new money to lend .
" I think we could very easily see the effects of this in the summertime in the form of easier consumer credit , " he said .
Gold Coast lifesavers say a dead kangaroo has washed ashore at Queensland 's Miami Beach .
Duty officer Kevin Dunne says it was a great day to be at the beach until the kangaroo appeared late in the afternoon .
He says it must have floated into the ocean from a nearby creek .
" I 'd say , probably Tallebudgera Creek , where there 's a lot of farms and properties further up there , so it 's a bit unusual , " he said .
" It 's something that you do n't see very often .
We 've had cows float up and dogs and things like that but definitely not kangaroos .
" I suppose the humorous part to come out of it is he would be a lot safer if he was swimming inside the flags I suppose .
" It got a bit of a gathering down there and there was a lot of interest .
" There really was n't much happening on the Gold Coast other than the beaches being fairly well crowded but this will definitely be one we 'll put in the diary . "

With the world and his dog keenly watching Metacritic , especially on the eve of big platform exclusives like our Killzone 2 and the 360 ’s Halo Wars , we caught up with Metacritic ’s Marc Doyle and discussed scores , fanboys and big games .
Great for your lunchtime read , we ’re sure you ’ll agree .
TheSixthAxis : Hi Marc .
So , straight in : why do you think there is so much scrutiny around Killzone 2 ’s Metacritic score , more so than other PS3 exclusives like Uncharted or LBP ?
Marc Doyle : I do n’t think there has been any special scrutiny around KZ2 relative to other PS3 exclusives .
It ’s a highly anticipated game , and all highly - anticipated games create interest around their Metascores .
TSA : So is it just the fanboys that care about the Metacritic score with a Triple - A game so they can use it as ammo against the other side ?
– ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW –
MD : I would n’t say so .
TSA : Is there any correlation between a Metacritic score and sales figures ?
Anything concrete where you can say “ If a game gets 80 it will sell 2 million , 85 will sell 3 million ” ?
MD : Only anecdotally .
Publishers have conducted their own studies using our data and have come to their own conclusions with respect to certain genres , but no , I ’ve never conducted such studies .
TSA : But you ’ve seen thousands of scores over the years – how accurate are you at predicting what a new game ’s Metacritic score will be ?
MD : Not very .
After seeing the first 5 or 6 reviews , though , I ’m pretty good at predicting generally where the final score will be .
TSA : But do you find that you can predict certain publications / sites scores with any accuracy ?
MD : Again , if I ’ve seen a pretty sizeable group of reviews , I often suprise myself at my ability to predict what certain publications will award the game .
TSA : Which of your personal favourite games has ended up with a disastrous Metacritic score ?
MD : I do n’t own any current or last gen consoles .
I was a pretty avid gamer during the Genesis [ Megadrive ] days , especially when I had a year off between college and grad school , but since then , I have n’t had the time to devote a huge slice of time to gaming .
Too busy generating Metascores !
TSA : Have you ever been sent any interesting emails asking you to massage the scores for certain games ?
MD : No .
I ’ve been asked why we include certain publications and why we do n’t include others , and I ’ll get complaints that the critic giving the lowest score to a popular game should be excluded , but that ’s about it .
I ’ve never been asked by my parent company or publishers or developers to alter my process and , by doing so , “ massage ” a score as you say .
TSA : The press is starting to run stories about developer ’s bonuses being linked to Metacritic scores .
How do you feel about that given that your choices – which publication ’s reviews to accept , for example – may ultimately affect that ?
MD : It does n’t affect my decision - making with respect to what publications I choose or how I weight them in the least .
My mission has always been to educate my users – buyers and renters of videogames – with respect to which games are worthy of their valuable entertainment dollars .
TSA : But do you think it ’s a fair way of compensating developers ?
MD : I ’ve never seen an actual clause in a contract which uses Metascore as a threshold for a bonus or penalty , so I ca n’t comment on it in any educated way .
In general , I think it ’s a good thing that publishers are striving for quality in addition to sales .
But I think they should go about striving for quality in a fair - minded way .
But again , every contract is different .
TSA : Other people seem to favour the tried and tested method of using sales success as a benchmark .
However , I think that can be misleading because we do n’t like every game we buy and I ’m sure that ’s never communicated to the publishers on a big scale – so is Metacritic the best judge of a game ’s quality ?
MD : Is it the “ best ” judge ?
I ca n’t say that for everyone in every capacity .
It ’s one way to judge success .
TSA : So to anyone looking to get their site on Metacritic , or are interested in the selection process , what ’s the process a site / publication must go through in order for you to start including their reviews as part of the Metacritic score ?
MD : I ’m constantly evaluating new sites that spring up thorughout the year .
Either I ’ll contact them or they ’ll contact me , but I generally send a questionnaire to get to know their operations a bit better .
Then I read a bunch of their reviews , focusing on the quality of their analysis , their scoring integrity , and whether they ’re able to support their scores with reasoned and well - considered arguments .
I also want to make sure that the publication has established a reputation for credibility and reliability .
I rarely will pick up a new site because such a reputation takes time to establish , but if a new site springs up with established critics who i know and who I ’ve evaluated in the past , I can make an exception .
I do n’t have specific number thresholds for reviews when deciding which publications to track .
TSA : TheSixthAxis , already listed on Metacritic , is a PS3 site , so which PS3 games have had Metacritic scores that surprised you , good or bad ?
MD : Nothing surprises me about scores .
TSA : If you were reviewing Metacritic what would the review say , and what would it score ?
MD : Plenty of people , from journalists to regular users , have reviewed Metacritic , and many have done a very good job , pointing out our strengths and weaknesses .
Many of their observations have helped us improve our offerings .
It ’s not my place to review the site or to give it a score .
What would you give us ?
TSA : Ah , that would be telling .
How ’s your multiplayer ?
And on that 5 /5 bombshell , there ends the interview .
Thanks to Marc for taking the time out of his very busy schedule to speak to us , and our very own Michael for the questions .
Good luck with the site , Marc .
American Press : Beckham Will Stay At Milan
The David Beckham transfer saga seems to be nearing an end as he is set to remain in Milan , according to local media sources ...
David Beckham joined Milan at the commencement of the year , and despite initially signing for the club for a brief two month loan period , he has recently declared his intention to make his move permanent .
In addition to this , the Rossoneri themselves are also keen to keep hold of the former English captain .
Consequently , they have been in deep negotiations with Beckham ’s LA Galaxy side over the past few weeks in order to attempt to reach an agreement to seal his transfer .
Now a local media source , the Los Angeles Times , has published a piece in which a leading writer proposes that Beckham is on his way out of California .
As well as stating the well - known fact that Beckham himself is itching to leave , writers Robin Abcarian and Grahame L. Jones assert that the Galaxy hierarchy are reluctant , but willing sellers .
" The Galaxy publicly says it is trying to keep him , but privately it already is resigned to losing him , " they wrote .
This is great news for all fans of the Rossoneri ahead of their upcoming UEFA Cup clash against Werder Bremen on Thursday night .
However , Galaxy remain adamant - at least publicly - about the fate of Beckham , stating that there are no plans to breach the earlier loan agreement made with the San Siro outfit .
" David Beckham and Landon Donovan remain in Europe on
loan with AC Milan and Bayern Munich respectively , with both players scheduled to return on March 8 , two weeks ahead of the Galaxy ’s season opener against D.C. United , " said the California club in a press release on Tuesday .

A new national study shows that the number of abortions performed in Mexico increased by one - third between 1990 and 2006 ( from 533,000 to 875,000 ) , despite legal restrictions that virtually ban the procedure in most parts of the country .
( In 2007 , the federal district of Mexico City legalized abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy ; the procedure remains illegal in other Mexican states . )
Mexico ’s 2006 abortion rate ( 33 per 1,000 women ) was more than 40 % higher than the abortion rate in the United States ( 19.4 per 1,000 women ) , where abortion is broadly legal and available .
The study , conducted by El Colegio de Mexico , the Population Council Mexico Office and the Guttmacher Institute , found that many abortions in Mexico take place under unsafe conditions , resulting in serious health consequences for women .
Seventeen percent of the Mexican women who obtained abortions in 2006 were treated in public hospitals for complications .
In comparison , fewer than 0.3 % of abortion patients in the U.S. have complications requiring hospitalization .
“ These findings confirm research from other parts of the world – that making abortion illegal does not significantly decrease its frequency , it just makes it unsafe and puts women ’s lives at risk , ” said Fatima Juarez , the study ’s lead author .
A professor at El Colegio de Mexico and a senior fellow at the Guttmacher Institute , Dr. Juarez added , “ The contrast between U.S. and Mexican abortion rates reflects a larger disparity in awareness of contraceptive methods and access to family planning services .
The best way to make abortion less necessary is to help women avoid unwanted pregnancies in the first place by increasing access to a wide range of contraceptive methods . ”
Lack of information on family planning and limited access to contraceptive methods may help explain why Mexican women are increasingly turning to abortion , the authors suggest .
In addition , access to modern contraceptive methods in Mexico has not kept pace with women ’s increasing desire to have smaller families :
The average number of children per family has declined dramatically over the last 30 years , decreasing from 5.6 in 1976 to 2.2 in 2006 .
To reduce the negative consequences of clandestine abortion , the study recommends broadening access to legal abortion beyond Mexico City to the rest of the country ; improving contraceptive services , including postabortion contraceptive counseling ; increasing youth - focused initiatives and school - based comprehensive sex education programs ; and expanding training in safe abortion provision .
The study “ Estimates of Induced Abortion in Mexico : What ’s Changed Between 1990 and 2006 ? ” by Fatima Juarez et al. appears in the December 2008 issue of International Family Planning Perspectives .

Calcutta Muslims in a 2006 protest against Prophet Muhammad cartoons
The editor and publisher of a top English - language Indian daily have been arrested on charges of " hurting the religious feelings " of Muslims .
The Statesman 's editor Ravindra Kumar and publisher Anand Sinha were detained in Calcutta after complaints .
Muslims said they were upset with the Statesman for reproducing an article from the UK's Independent daily in its 5 February edition .
The article was entitled : " Why should I respect these oppressive religions ? "
It concerns the erosion of the right to criticise all religions .
In it , the author , Johann Hari , writes : " I do n't respect the idea that we should follow a ' Prophet ' who at the age of 53 had sex with a nine - year old girl , and ordered the murder of whole villages of Jews because they would n't follow him . "
Mr Kumar and Mr Sinha appeared in court on Wednesday and were granted bail .
Apology
Angry Muslims have been demonstrating in front of the offices of the Statesman since its republication of the article .
Police have broken up the demonstrations using baton charges several times this week .
Some Muslims close to the Jamiat - e - Ulema e Hind ( The Organisation of Indian Scholars , a leading Islamic group in India ) later filed a complaint with police alleging that the publication had " outraged their religious feelings " , which is an offence under Section 295 A of the Indian Penal Code .
Mr Kumar has already issued a public apology for reproducing the article .
" Not anticipating the reaction to the story was an error of judgement and we have regretted that , " Mr Kumar told the BBC in an interview .
The new version of P2P client LimeWire — now at version 5.1.1 — has been in the news lately for a feature that makes it simple for even the newbiest newb to create a " darknet . "
Nothing here is technically ground - breaking , but LimeWire 's massive install base means that millions of users now have a secure and simple way to share files with each other and no one else .
Darknets are going mainstream , something that could make it more difficult than ever for rights - holders hoping to monitor public P2P networks in order to pick off offenders .
That process , already difficult enough , could get a lot harder as such tools migrate out from the geekerati .
Darknet , with a twist of lime
Most P2P networks are open to any client , and it's a trivial matter to find and download content — indeed , this ease of use is the main point .
In doing so , the IP addresses of the peers serving the files are revealed .
When the content those peers serve infringes copyright , the IP addresses make it possible for rights - holders to file lawsuits .
In darknets , there is no public entry point to the network , making it difficult or impossible to know what 's being shared .
The very term " darknet " makes the whole process sound mysterious and quite possibly illegal , but such a darknet can just as easily be used by a family to share photos and video content .
The new LimeWire makes this easy .
Users can share any file or class of files with only certain buddies .
The files are kept updated on all machines , and newly shared files automatically show up on the other machines in the network .
It 's simple to do this using other services like Dropbox , which allows for group shares .
Direct download services like RapidShare have also become popular ways to distribute even gigantic files without putting them on public P2P networks .
But LimeWire already has millions and millions of users , and is one of the most popular P2P clients .
It 's not yet clear how many casual users would want to use the system to share copyrighted material ; hot new releases will require access to public P2P searches unless one happens to be friends with a music business insider .
There is also no facility for adding public P2P users as buddies , meaning that you need to know them first .
For college students , though , such a system could make it easy to browse the music collections of everyone on one 's floor , even with limited technical skills or familiarity with current darknet systems .
Certainly , the new feature is likely to be seen in that light by the music industry , which is already suing LimeWire .
Darknets have been on the increase for some time , but as they get ever simpler to use and deploy , they could make it more difficult for content industry investigators to gather data for use in court cases or for " graduated response " schemes with ISPs .
Massive darknets can be infiltrated , but networks of 10 friends ?
20 friends ?
An extended family ?
It will be nearly impossible to know what 's being transferred there .
And if graduated response truly takes root around the globe , its biggest achievement might well have little to do with stopping copyright infringement and more to do with driving it deeper underground .
Certainly , the simpler the tools become , the more likely is the possibility .
Dedicated to the broken window fallacy .
No other economic myth has caused more damage to the public pocketbook .
The president - elect has been spotted listening to the least cool MP3 player on the market .
Millions of Americans now want their votes back
Gone are the days when politicians established their " cool " by bragging about their record collections or inviting Oasis round for tea .
Music fans have different concerns now – not whether Barack Obama listens to MIA or Julio Iglesias , but whether he uses an iPod or a Zune .
And we can finally answer this nagging question : Obama uses a Microsoft Zune .
Many of his fans have been shocked at the report in Philadelphia 's City Paper that the president - elect uses the least cool MP3 player on the market .
" He walked majestically across the gym floor in his track pants and sweat shirt , " Neal Santos 's article explains .
" He hopped on the machine next to me and broke a mean sweat while reading a copy of USA Today and listening to his Zune . "
USA Today !?
A Zune !?
Surely it should be the Guardian and a shiny steel - and - glass iPod Touch !?
Surely the future Leader of the Free World , the coolest man in politics , the saviour of the world 's sceptical youth , would n't be using the lame Microsoft alternative .
Internet commenters went ballistic .
" NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO , " cried one user at the popular blog Engadget .
" I want my vote back ! "
During the campaign , Obama and his running mate Joe Biden both claimed to use Apple computers .
This was music to young peoples ' ears – a MacBook - toting Obama and Biden stood in stark , hip contrast to Republican candidate John McCain , who reportedly does not use email .
But alas , Zunes are generally not compatible with Apple machines .
And though the City Paper has speculated that Obama was borrowing someone else 's Zune – his wife 's ?
his daughter 's ?
– Zunegate continues unabated .
After all , if Obama 's Apple claim is false , which other parts of his manifesto may turn out to be lies ?
Does the senator from Illinois hate change ?
Does he spurn hope ?
Does he play Pokémon ?
On his second day in office , President Obama directed all of his administration ’s employees to work toward “ an unprecedented level of openness , ” explaining that transparency would “ strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in government . ”
Now the president can begin to make good on his promise of transparency by releasing the dozens of still - secret legal memos written by the Bush administration ’s Office of Legal Counsel .
The Office of Legal Counsel , which is part of the Justice Department , provides authoritative legal opinions to the president and executive branch agencies .
It tells the president what the law allows and , more important , what the law prohibits .
Dawn Johnsen , whom Obama has nominated to lead the once - obscure office and whose confirmation hearing was held Wednesday , wrote in a 2007 law review article that the office must be “ prepared to say no to the president . ”
But under President Bush , the office played a very different role :
Its senior lawyers served not as sources of bona fide legal guidance but as knowing facilitators of the president ’s lawless conduct .
Office of Legal Counsel lawyers told Bush , for instance , that the 4th Amendment ’s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures did not apply to military operations inside the United States .
They also created a legal argument to justify the National Security Agency ’s warrantless wiretapping program .
And they produced memos that permitted the CIA to subject prisoners to waterboarding and other barbaric interrogation methods that the United States had in the past prosecuted as war crimes .
Lawyers for the office -- including John Yoo , Steven Bradbury and Jay Bybee -- churned out dozens of memos on torture , rendition , detention without charge and wiretapping without warrants .
Many of their positions were founded on a conception of unbounded executive power previously articulated most succinctly by President Nixon : “ When the president does it , that means it ’s not illegal . ”
The memos simply ignored the Supreme Court decisions that rejected this theory .
Worse yet , some of the memos were plainly intended to insulate Bush administration officials from criminal liability .
Jack Goldsmith , who as head of the Office of Legal Counsel felt compelled to withdraw some of the most extreme memos written by Yoo and others , has charged that the torture memos in particular , “ in their redundant and one - sided effort to eliminate any hurdles posed by the torture law ... could be interpreted as if they were designed to confer immunity for bad acts . ”
And , according to the Washington Post and other sources , a yet - to - be - released ethics report by the Justice Department ’s Office of Professional Responsibility confirms that lawyers in the Office of Legal Counsel intentionally misrepresented or distorted the law to support the Bush administration ’s policy goals .
How do we know what the Office of Legal Counsel was doing if the documents are still secret ?
Two of the memos have been released as a result of lawsuits filed by the ACLU and its partners ; many other memos have been described in the government ’s legal papers .
And a few have been leaked to the media -- including , most notably , the memo that defined torture to encompass only those methods that inflict the kind of pain associated with organ failure or death .
But in general the Bush administration was remarkably successful at shielding the office ’s work from the public .
The documents most crucial to the historical record -- including many of the memos used to justify the administration ’s most radical policies -- are still being withheld .
The result is that the public lacks access to basic information about how the Bush administration ’s national security policies were developed , who participated in their development and what legal arguments were generated to support them .
The Bush administration contended in court that the memos are protected by the attorney - client privilege or that they ca n’t be released without compromising the nation ’s security .
Historically , though , many of the office ’s memos have been published as a matter of course .
And it is not clear how national security would be harmed by releasing , for example , legal analyses of interrogation methods that are unlawful now and that were unlawful when they were used .
Given what we know about the policies the memos supported , it ’s difficult to escape the conclusion that the memos were withheld by the Bush administration for purely political reasons -- to shield indefensible legal arguments from public scrutiny and to shield public officials from accountability .
At her confirmation hearing , Johnsen said she would urge that the still - secret memos be reviewed for release , but that they might be redacted or even withheld entirely for reasons of national security .
Limited redactions maybe be necessary in extraordinary cases , but national security should not be used as a pretext for the wholesale suppression of the memos .
And there are good reasons to release the memos now .
By releasing them , the Obama administration would signal that it truly intends to end an era in which the Justice Department became shamefully complicit in the most egregious crimes .
Equally important , it would allow the public to better understand the policies that defined the Bush administration and shaped history , and to understand the role that the Office of Legal Counsel played in developing , justifying and advocating those policies .
In dozens of legal briefs , the Bush administration was never able to articulate a persuasive reason for withholding the memos from the public .
The memos should have been released long ago , and the Obama administration should not delay in releasing them now .

In April 1976 , John Vorster , president of the then - racist apartheid regime of South Africa , paid an official state visit to Israel , where he was given the red-carpet treatment .
Israeli television showed him on his first day , visiting the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem .
At an official state banquet held for Vorster , Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin toasted the “ ideals shared by Israel and South Africa . ”
Why was an outspoken member of a Nazi militia in South Africa during the Second World War and a leading member of the party that crafted official apartheid policies in South Africa being feted in Israel ?
A statement in the South African government ’s yearbook made two years after Vorster ’s visit provides an answer : “ Israel and South Africa have one thing above all else in common : they are both situated in a predominantly hostile world inhabited by dark peoples . ”
These close ties came from the identification that both states had for each other ’s cause .
Both were settler states that claimed to be bringing “ civilization ” to so - called backward peoples .
And both were committed to using any and all means to maintain their regional domination over the “ natives ” that they had conquered –in South Africa , to create a white state based on the exploitation of Black labor ; in Israel , to create an exclusively Jewish state through the systematic removal of the indigenous Palestinian population .
Victims of repression in South Africa and Palestine
In an excellent two - part article in the Guardian in 2006 , Chris McGreal quotes Ronnie Kasrils , then the intelligence minister in the post - apartheid government led by the African National Congress .
Kasrils , who is Jewish and had co-authored a petition protesting Israel ’s occupation of Palestinian territory , explained why such a close affinity could develop between the two countries :
Israelis claim that they are the chosen people , the elect of God , and find a biblical justification for their racism and Zionist exclusivity .
This is just like the Afrikaners of apartheid South Africa , who also had the biblical notion that the land was their God - given right .
Like the Zionists who claimed that Palestine in the 1940s was “ a land without people for a people without land , ” so the Afrikaner settlers spread the myth that there were no black people in South Africa when they first settled in the 17th century .
They conquered by force of arms and terror and the provocation of a series of bloody colonial wars of conquest .
Vorster ’s visit signaled an acceleration of economic , diplomatic and military cooperation between the two countries , a collaboration that already had a lengthy history .
South African Gen. Jan Smuts , who had a close relationship with the Zionist leader Chaim Weizman , Israel ’s first prime minister , had been instrumental in convincing Britain to sign the Balfour Declaration that agreed to the “ establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people . ”
After 1948 , South Africa was one of the first countries to recognize Israel .
N. Kirschner , a veteran South African Zionist leader , wrote in 1960 in an Israeli publication : “ There exists a bond between Jewish aspirations and the aspirations of the people of South Africa . ”
That bond was expressed chiefly in growing military and secret nuclear cooperation .
Each country shared its intelligence and counterinsurgency techniques with the other , and South Africa purchased arms from Israel .
Israel purchased nuclear materials from South African in order to develop its secret weapons program , and in return , Israel provided scientific and technical assistance to help South African build its nuclear bombs .
Hundreds of white South Africans graduated from Israeli military training schools .
“ It is a clear and open secret , ” wrote an Israeli journalist in 1976 , “ that in army camps , one can find Israeli officers in not insignificant numbers who are busy teaching white soldiers to fight black terrorists , with methods imported from Israel . ”
The parallels between Israel and apartheid South Africa are striking .
In South Africa , the white colonial settler minority conquered the Black majority , forcing them into Bantustans–so - called independent African homelands –that covered only 13 percent of the country .
This allowed the whites to declare South Africa a white country .
Blacks , who outnumbered whites by 4 - to - 1 , became the cheap labor that built South Africa ’s economy , but they could n’t be citizens .
Likewise , Theodore Herzl , known as the father of Zionism , sold the Jewish state to its potential imperial backers as “ an outpost of civilization against barbarism . ”
Variations on statements such as this one from Joseph Weitz , head of the Jewish Agency ’s Colonization Department , can be found scattered throughout the writings of the founders of the state of Israel : “ There is no room for both peoples together in this country …
There is no other way than to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighboring countries .
To transfer all of them ; not one village , not one tribe should be left . ”
These principles guided the Zionist armies and paramilitary gangs that used massacres and terror to drive 750,000 Palestinians from their homes in 1948 in order to create the state of Israel , and again led to the expulsion of 325,000 Palestinians from their land after the 1967 war .
These are not old , outdated views , but the deeply held conviction of leading Zionists today .
Listen to the ravings of Israeli Professor Arnon Soffer , head of the Israel Defense Force ’s National Defense College , speaking to the Jerusalem Post in 2004 about Israel ’s unilateral pullout from Gaza :
We will tell the Palestinians that if a single missile is fired over the fence , we will fire 10 in response .
And women and children will be killed , and houses will be destroyed .
After the fifth such incident , Palestinian mothers wo n’t allow their husbands to shoot Qassams , because they will know what ’s waiting for them .
Second of all , when 2.5 million people live in a closed - off Gaza , it ’s going to be a human catastrophe .
Those people will become even bigger animals than they are today , with the aid of an insane fundamentalist Islam .
The pressure at the border will be awful .
It ’s going to be a terrible war .
So , if we want to remain alive , we will have to kill and kill and kill .
All day , every day …
If we do n’t kill , we will cease to exist … Unilateral separation does n’t guarantee “ peace ” –it guarantees a Zionist - Jewish state with an overwhelming majority of Jews .
There are some differences between South African and Israeli apartheid .
Israel ’s relationship to Arab labor was different than that of the South Africa rulers to the Black majority .
Rather than exploiting cheap Arab labor , the early Zionist settlers in Palestine built their state - in - embryo by excluding Arab labor , under the slogan “ Jewish Land , Jewish Labor . ”
After the formation of the state of Israel , Arabs did become a source of cheap labor , but Israel has never been dependent on Arab labor–whereas in South Africa , strikes threatened to bring down apartheid because Black labor was its lifeblood .
Yet the similarities are more striking than the differences .
If apartheid South Africa declared itself a white state by creating the fiction of Black “ homelands ” and implementing pass laws to severely restrict the movement of Africans , in Israel , an exclusively Jewish state was creating by expelling the majority of Palestinians from their lands and legally barring their return .
A battery of laws were put in place after 1948 that grant the state legal authority , in various ways , to seize Arab farms , orchards , homes and businesses if the owners are absent for any length of time , or for “ security ” reasons .
At the same time , any Jew in the world was granted the legal right to enter Israel and become a citizen .
Today , Israel treats the Arab minority within its current borders as third - class citizens ( behind the Mizrahim , or the Middle Eastern , as opposed to European , Jews ) .
Palestinians receive lower wages and education funding , face routine harassment and police brutality , and are subjected to high incarceration rates ; they are restricted from owning land , and are victims of land seizures and expulsions that continue to this day .
A paper on Israel ’s Arab minority by Eric Gust of the Center for Contemporary Conflict explained that “ advancement of Arabs within Israeli society , whether in the demographic , economic , political or educational sectors , is viewed as occurring at the expense of the Jewish population , and could be perceived as a threat to the Jewish nature of Israel . ”
Israel is also an apartheid state in form , if not in legal terms , because it has turned the lands it occupied in 1967 – the West Bank and Gaza–into South African - style Bantustans , whose inhabitants face economic blockade and routine assaults from the Israeli army and settlers , and whose towns and refugee camps are cut off from each other by an apartheid wall and a system of checkpoints , while special roads crisscross the West Bank that can only be used by Jews .
Any “ two - state ” solution that Israel accepts will merely put a legal stamp on this fact .
Israeli leaders are usually loath to publicly admit that Israel is an apartheid - style state .
Yet there are moments of candor .
Former Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Force , Gen. Rafael Eitan , speaking at a closed meeting of Israeli professionals in 1983 , gave a presentation that considered South Africa ’s Bantustan policy as a possible solution to the Palestinian problem .
Last November , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert made a statement that if Israel was unable to implement a two - state solution , it would “ face a South African - style struggle for equal voting rights , and as soon as that happens , the state of Israel is finished . ”
He had warned four years earlier : “ We do n’t have unlimited time .
More and more Palestinians are uninterested in a negotiated , two - state solution , because they want to change the essence of the conflict from an Algerian paradigm to a South African one .
From a struggle against ‘ occupation , ’ in their parlance , to a struggle for one - man - one - vote .
That is , of course , a much cleaner struggle , a much more popular struggle–and ultimately , a much more powerful one .
For us , it would mean the end of the Jewish state . ”
Israel leaders look with horror on the prospect of the struggle for a democratic , secular Palestine–a state for all its inhabitants –because the whole basis of the existence of Israel as an exclusively Jewish state would be destroyed .
For that same reason , those of us who oppose Zionism should welcome such a struggle with open arms .
There is a nasty rumor making its way around the interconnected series of tubes we call the Internet .
The rumor was sparked by an article on The Neurostimulation Technology Portal by Liz Elliott entitled " Magenta Ain't A Colour , " which has since had people exclaiming , " Fact : Magenta is n't a color , " or , " Magenta is a lie . "
The truth is a little more complicated than that , but I assure you that magenta is not a lie — or at least not any more a lie than any other color .
See , what we call the " visible spectrum " is really a very narrow band in a much larger spectrum of electromagnetic radiation .
It is visible because our eyes have cells called " cones " in the retina that are sensitive to these wavelengths — in the range of about 400 – 700 nm — to varying degrees .
Some of the cones are sensitive to longer wavelengths , some to medium wavelengths , and others to shorter wavelengths .
These wavelengths correspond to ( roughly ) what we call red , green , and blue light , and form the basis of the RGB color model used by digital images , TVs , flat panels , and more .
This chart shows the range of EM radiation , and the narrow band we call visible light within it .
As visible light enters the eye and strikes the cone cells , the cells send electrical signals along the optic nerve to the brain .
This is how our body " senses " light .
Our brain interprets those three separate sensations to produce the perception that we call " color . "
So back to this rumor that magenta somehow is n't a color .
Elliott 's thesis centers on the argument that magenta appears nowhere on the spectrum of visible light , so it therefore is n't a " real " color .
If you look at a standard CIE chromaticity diagram , which maps wavelengths of light according to human perception , you 'll note that every point along the curve corresponds to a single wavelength of light .
Magenta , as it were , lies along what 's commonly called the " pink - purple line " that runs across the bottom .
All colors along this line do not exist as single wavelengths .
But , all points inside the " color bag " above that line do not exist as single wavelengths , either .
The CIE 1931 color space chromaticity diagram .
The outer curved boundary is the spectral ( or monochromatic ) properties of light , with wavelengths shown in nanometers .
The truth is , no color actually exists outside of our brain 's perception of it .
Everything we call a color — and there are a lot more than what comes in your box of Crayolas — only exists in our heads .
We define color in terms of how our brains process the stimuli produced by a mix of wavelengths in the range of 400 – 700 nm hitting specialized cells in our eyes — " one , or any mixture , of the constituents into which light can be separated in a spectrum or rainbow , " says the OED .
Elliot 's article might be better titled , " Magenta is not a single wavelength of electromagnetic radiation in the ' visible ' spectrum , but our brain perceives it anyway . "
So despite what you read on Twitter , Virginia , there is a magenta .
And it 's all in our heads .

As a new fiscal year begins , the latest state budget estimates continue to show that states ’ ability to fund services remains hobbled by slow economic growth .
The budget gaps that states have had to close for fiscal year 2013 , the fiscal year that begins July 1 , 2012 , total $ 55 billion in 31 states .
That amount is smaller than in past years , but still very large by historical standards .
States ’ actions to close those gaps , in turn , are further delaying the nation ’s economic recovery .
The budget gaps result principally from weak tax collections .
The Great Recession that started in 2007 caused the largest collapse in state revenues on record .
Since bottoming out in 2010 , revenues have begun to grow again but are still far from fully recovered .
As of the first quarter of 2012 , state revenues remained 5.5 percent below pre-recession levels , and are not growing fast enough to recover fully soon .
Meanwhile , states ’ education and health care obligations continue to grow .
States expect to educate 540,000 more K - 12 students and 2.5 million more public college and university students in the upcoming school year than in 2007 - 08 .
[1 ]
And some 4.8 million more people are projected to be eligible for subsidized health insurance through Medicaid in 2012 than were enrolled in 2008 , as employers have cancelled their coverage and people have lost jobs and wages .
[ 2 ]
Consequently , even though the revenue outlook is trending upward , states have addressed large budget shortfalls by historical standards as they considered budgets for 2013 .
The vast majority of these shortfalls have been closed through spending cuts and other measures in order to meet balanced - budget requirements .
As of publication all but five states have enacted their budgets , and those five will do so soon .
To the extent these shortfalls are being closed with spending cuts , they are occurring on top of past years ’ deep cuts in critical public services like education , health care , and human services .
The additional cuts mean that state budgets will continue to be a drag on the national economy , threatening hundreds of thousands of private - and public - sector jobs , reducing the job creation that otherwise would be expected to occur .
Potential strategies for lessening the impact of deep spending cuts include more use of state reserve funds in states that have reserves , more revenue through tax - law changes , and a greater role for the federal government .
Our survey of state fiscal conditions shows that :
States continue to face a major fiscal challenge .
Thirty - one states projected ( and in most cases now have closed ) budget gaps totaling $ 55 billion for fiscal year 2013 .
( See Figure 1 . )
These shortfalls were all the more daunting because states ’ options for addressing them were fewer and more difficult than in recent years .
Temporary aid to states enacted in early 2009 as part of the federal Recovery Act was enormously helpful in allowing states to avert some of the most harmful potential budget cuts in the 2009 , 2010 and 2011 fiscal years .
But the federal government allowed that aid to largely expire at the end of fiscal year 2011 , leading to some of the deepest cuts to state services since the start of the recession .
Far from providing additional assistance to states , the federal government is now moving ahead with spending cuts that will very likely make states ’ fiscal situation even worse .
State finances are recovering , but slowly .
The shortfall totals for fiscal year 2013 are smaller than the totals from the last few years .
But they remain large by historical standards , as the economy remains weak and unemployment is still high .
( Note that even if economic improvement accelerates , state fiscal recovery tends to lag recovery in the broader economy . )
The shortfalls that states have projected for fiscal year 2013 are in addition to the more than $ 540 billion in shortfalls that states have closed over the past four years .
State Budget Shortfalls in 2012 and 2013
States already have addressed extraordinarily large shortfalls as they developed and implemented spending plans for fiscal years 2009 , 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 .
Shortfalls are the extent to which states ’ revenues fall short of the cost of providing services .
Every state except Vermont has some sort of balanced - budget law .
So the shortfalls for 2009 through 2012 — which totaled more than $ 540 billion combined — have already been closed through a combination of spending cuts , withdrawals from reserves , revenue increases , and use of federal stimulus dollars .
The substantial shortfalls projected for FY2013 have also been largely closed .
Figure 2 compares the size and duration of the shortfalls that resulted from the recession during the first decade of the 2000s to shortfalls reported to date following the onset of the latest recession .
In the early 2000s , as in the early 1990s and early 1980s , state fiscal problems lasted for several years after the recession ended .
The same has proven to be the case this time .
The most recent recession was more severe — deeper and longer — than the previous one .
State fiscal problems also have proven to be worse and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future .
States ’ fiscal conditions are improving along with the broader economy .
But states are coming out of a very deep hole .
Figure 3 illustrates the magnitude of the problem .
State revenues have begun to rebound .
State tax intake grew 8.3 percent in the 12 - month period ending in June 2011 — the 2011 fiscal year for most states .
This encouraging growth offers a glimmer of hope that states are beginning to climb out of the fiscal hole caused by the recession .
Unfortunately , that hole was so deep that even if revenues continue to grow at last year ’s rate — which is highly unlikely , as explained below — it would take seven years to get them back on a normal track .
In other words , revenues probably wo n’t come close to what states need to restore the programs that they cut during the recession unless states raise taxes , at least temporarily , or receive additional federal aid while the economy slowly recovers .
As noted below , additional federal aid is unlikely .
Figure 3 shows how much states would be collecting if revenues had not dropped sharply due to the recession but instead had continued to grow at their historical rate of 5 percent .
( The 5 percent rate is based on actual collections between 1980 and 2008 , with adjustments for projected inflation and GDP growth . )
It also shows that , at the 2011 rate of 8.3 percent , revenues would n’t get back on a normal track until 2019 .
State tax collections typically grow faster than normal after a recession as they recover from a reduced base .
But states have n’t seen sustained growth at an 8.3 percent level since the 1960s .
Already , revenue growth for 2012 has slowed compared to 2011 .
Preliminary figures show growth of about 4 percent for the most recent quarter .
Beyond simply coming out of a deep hole , states face major obstacles that will slow their fiscal recovery .
One is the shifting role of the federal government .
It allowed emergency aid to states to largely expire at the end of fiscal year 2011 , leaving states with fewer options to address their still substantial budget shortfalls in fiscal year 2012 and beyond .
Moreover , the federal government has been moving ahead with spending cuts that will very likely reduce ongoing federal funding for state and local governments and make state fiscal conditions even worse .
Another major obstacle to recovery is sluggish economic growth .
Unemployment remains above 8 percent , and many economists expect it to stay at high levels throughout 2012 and beyond .
Continued slow job growth will restrain the rise in state tax receipts .
This is especially true for the sales tax .
High unemployment and economic uncertainty , combined with households ’ diminished wealth due to fallen property values , will continue to depress consumption , keeping sales tax receipts at low levels .
If , as in past recessions , the incomes of the wealthy recover faster than those of low - and middle - income individuals and families , this would mitigate somewhat the effect of a sluggish job market on tax receipts , especially in states with progressive income taxes .
Beyond depressing state revenue collections , the weak economy increases demand for Medicaid and other essential services that states provide .
These factors suggest that state budget gaps will continue to be a problem for states for some time to come .
Estimates from the states , although incomplete , are consistent with this outlook .
Thirty - one states have addressed or are addressing shortfalls totaling $ 55 billion for FY2013 , the fiscal year that begins July 1 , 2012 ( See Table 1 ) . [ 3 ]
These totals may be down somewhat from the daunting budget gaps of the last several years , but they are still very large by historical standards , especially four years after the recession ended .
There are factors that could make it particularly difficult for states to fully recover from the current fiscal situation .
For example , housing markets have been slow to fully recover ; their decline has depressed consumption and sales tax revenue as people refrain from buying furniture , appliances , construction materials and the like .
The weakness in the housing market has also depressed property tax revenue , which largely funds schools and local governments .
Property tax collections were 3.5 percent lower in the 12 - month period ending in December 2011 than in the previous 12 months .
This places a strain on local governments ’ budgets and makes it more likely that they will look to states to help them sustain funding for local services like education and police and fire protection .
Of course , an unexpected acceleration in the economic recovery could speed the pace of state fiscal recovery .
Some states initially were not affected by the economic downturn , but the number has dwindled over time .
Resource - rich states — such as New Mexico , Alaska and Montana — saw revenue growth in the beginning of the recession as a result of high oil prices .
Later , however , the decline in oil prices affected revenues in these states .
The economies of a handful of other states have so far been less affected by the national economic problems .
Only two states , North Dakota and Montana , have not reported budget shortfalls in any of these years .
One other state — Alaska — faced shortfalls in fiscal year 2010 but has not projected gaps for subsequent years .

Washington 's shortfall total assumes that three - fourths of the states $ 855 million mid-biennium shortfall will be closed in FY13 .
The Consequences of Shortfalls
In states facing budget gaps , the consequences are severe in many cases — for residents as well as the economy .
To date , budget difficulties have led at least 46 states to reduce services for their residents , including some of their most vulnerable families and individuals .
[ 4 ]
More than 30 states have raised taxes to at least some degree , in some cases quite significantly .
If revenues remain depressed , as is expected in many states , additional spending and service cuts are likely .
Indeed , a number of states have made substantial cuts to balance their budgets for fiscal year 2013 .
While data are not yet available that would show the mix of state actions to resolve their budget gaps for 2013 , the data through 2012 show that states have enacted more and more spending cuts every year since 2008 .
Federal aid and state tax increases have played diminishing roles in addressing the gaps , as the emergency federal aid ended and the elections of 2010 changed the political leadership in a number of states . [ 5 ]
Spending cuts are problematic during an economic downturn because they reduce overall demand and can make the downturn deeper .
When states cut spending , they lay off employees , cancel contracts with vendors , eliminate or lower payments to businesses and nonprofit organizations that provide direct services , and cut benefit payments to individuals .
In all of these circumstances , the companies and organizations that would have received government payments have less money to spend on salaries and supplies , and individuals who would have received salaries or benefits have less money for consumption .
This directly removes demand from the economy .
Tax increases also remove demand from the economy by reducing the amount of money people have to spend .
However , to the extent these increases are on upper - income residents , that effect is minimized .
This is because these residents tend to save a larger share of their income , and thus much of the money generated by a tax increase on upper income residents comes from savings and so does not diminish economic activity .
At the state level , a balanced approach to closing deficits — raising taxes along with enacting budget cuts — is needed to close state budget gaps in order to maintain important services while minimizing harmful effects on the economy .
Ultimately , the actions needed to address state budget shortfalls place a considerable number of jobs at risk .
The roughly $ 55 billion shortfall that states have faced for fiscal year 2013 equals about 0.36 percent of GDP .
Assuming that economic activity declines by one dollar for every dollar that states cut spending or raise taxes , and based on a rule of thumb that a one percentage point loss of GDP costs the economy 1 million jobs , the state shortfalls projected to date could prevent the creation of 360,000 public - and private - sector jobs next year .
The Role of the Federal Government
Federal assistance lessened the extent to which states needed to take actions that further harmed the economy .
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( ARRA ) , enacted in February 2009 , included substantial assistance for states .
The amount in ARRA to help states maintain current activities was about $ 135 billion to $ 140 billion over a roughly 2 ½ - year period — or between 30 percent and 40 percent of projected state shortfalls for fiscal years 2009 , 2010 , and 2011 .
Most of this money was in the form of increased Medicaid funding and a “ State Fiscal Stabilization Fund . ”
( There were also other streams of funding in the Recovery Act flowing through states to local governments or individuals , but these will not address state budget shortfalls . )
This money reduced the extent of state spending cuts and state tax and fee increases .
In addition , H.R. 1586 — the August 2010 jobs bill — extended enhanced Medicaid funding for six months , through June 2011 , and added $ 10 billion to the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund .
Even with this extension , federal assistance largely ended before state budget gaps had fully abated .
The Medicaid funds expired in June 2011 , the end of the 2011 fiscal year in most states , [ 6 ] and states had drawn down most of their State Fiscal Stabilization Fund allocations by then as well .
So even though significant budget gaps remained in 2012 , there was little federal money available to close them .
Partially as a result , states ’ final 2012 budgets contained some of the deepest spending cuts since the start of the recession .
One way to avert these kinds of cuts , as well as additional tax increases , would have been for the federal government to reduce state budget gaps by extending the Medicaid funds for as long as state fiscal conditions are expected to be problematic .
But far from extending this aid , federal policymakers are moving ahead with plans to cut ongoing federal funding for states and localities , thereby making state fiscal conditions even worse .
The federal government has already cut non-defense discretionary spending by nine percent in real terms since 2010 .
Discretionary spending caps established in the federal debt limit deal this past summer will result in an additional six percent cut by the end of the next decade .
The additional cut by the end of the next decade would grow to 11 percent if sequestration — the automatic , across - the - board cuts also established in the debt limit deal — is allowed to take effect .
Fully one - third of non-defense discretionary spending flows through state and local governments in the form of funding for education , health care , human services , law enforcement , infrastructure , and other services that states and localities administer .
Large cuts in federal funding to states and localities would worsen state budget problems , deepen the size of cuts in spending , increase state taxes and fees , and thus slow economic recovery even further than is already likely to occur .

James Madison ( 1751 - 1836 ) was an American political theorist , Secretary of State in Jefferson ’s administration , and the 4th U.S. President .
Madison is considered the Father of the U.S. Constitution .
He collaborated with John Jay and Alexander Hamilton to create the Federalist Papers which would support the Constitution .
During the Constitution ratification process , Madison supported the idea of a strong national government , but later he changed his attitude and thought that State governments should be stronger .
Madison was the author of many laws .
James Madison Quotes
I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations .
— James Madison ,
In a speech at the Virginia Convention , 1788
It will be of little avail to the people , that the laws are made by men of their own choice , if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read , or so incoherent that they can not be understood .
— James Madison , The Federalist No. 62
Whenever there is an interest and power to do wrong , wrong will generally be done and not less readily by a powerful and interested Party , than by a prince .
— James Madison
Stability in government is essential to national character and to the advantages annexed to it , as well as to that repose and confidence in the minds of the people , which are among the chief blessings of civil society .
— James Madison
The essence of Government is power ; and power , lodged as it must be in human hands , will ever be liable to abuse .
— James Madison
Besides the advantage of being armed , which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation …
Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe , which are carried as far as the public resources will bear , the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms .

Crisis is the rallying cry of the tyrant .
— James Madison
In framing a government , which is to be administered by men over men , the great difficulty lies in this : you must first enable the government to control the governed , and in the next place , oblige it to control itself .

Second Life is still a vibrant virtual world — with over 12.2 million registered users and more than 54,000 online the last time I logged in — but you would n’t know it from the media coverage ( or lack thereof ) lately .
It was n’t always this way , as MediaShift ’s Mark Glaser recounts , in a post covering how Second Life ’s media hype has fizzled .
At its peak in 2006 , Second Life had a story on the cover of Business Week , a 12 - page spread in Wired , and numerous blog posts about brands like Coca - Cola , Scion and even the NBA establishing in - world presences .
Reuters , CNET , CNN and Wired also set up virtual news bureaus , though all but CNN killed off their in - world coverage about a year later ; their stories also shifted from paens to diatribes about how advertisers were “ wasting millions ” in the virtual world .
“ It was a typical hype - and - backlash scenario , ” Glaser writes .
“ Some journalists simply tired of SL , as so many people tried it and then bailed because of its steep learning curve and high technological requirements . ”
Now most of the news in and around Second Life is pushed into the tech or gaming sections of mainstream publications , or from devoted blogs like Wagner James Au’s New World Notes and the long - running Second Life Herald .
Meanwhile , organizations are increasingly using Second Life for distance learning and virtual tradeshows as opposed to marketing ; parent company Linden Labs rolled out the Second Life Grid , which organizations like IBM , Stanford and NASA have used to create their own private worlds within Second Life .
So what does this have to do with Twitter ?
Twitter ’s hype has reached a fever pitch .
Celebrities including Britney Spears and Shaquille O’Neal
Tweet regularly , and with stories on CNN , in the WSJ and the NYT , among others , it ’s garnering about half as much news coverage as Facebook , with barely a tenth of Facebook ’s traffic ( via VentureBeat ) .
Flush with $ 35 million in new funding ( and still no business model yet ) , Twitter could be headed for an incredible backlash .
As Rob Hoff , the Business Week editor who penned the Second Life cover story , told Glaser : “ This kind of cycle is endemic to journalism , for better or worse : Build ’em up , tear ’em down . ”
Back in the early days of the computer game industry , the music , as well as everything else , had to be painstakingly programmed in by hand .
Getting the music to sound anything like a real tune was hard enough , but getting the instruments to sound anywhere near authentic was almost impossible .
Thankfully , as the 80’s turned into the 90’s , machines got bigger and better , and with a lot more resources to not only incorporate music , but to make a half decent job of reproducing the instruments as well .
At the time , the market leader in game music quality was the Commodore 64 ; which had three whole audio channels to play around with ; while rivals Spectrum , Atari , Amstrad and PC had to make do with single channel ‘ plinky - plonky ’ music and sound effects .
Then along came the Commodore Amiga ( and thanks to stolen blueprints , the Atari ST ) , with new 16 - bit technology , and up to 8 available audio channels to mix down to high quality stereo .
In addition , the Amiga ( and ST ) were fully MIDI compatible ; which essentially meant that a computer and a synthesizer would be linked directly to each other at last .
It was n’t long before the seasoned hacks of game audio realised the possibilities of this new solution , and began to experiment .
These are some of the most memorable theme tunes to come out of that five year period , before the CD brought studio sound to the world of gaming .
Note :
Due to the limitations of the Youtube media available , some of these soundtracks are cut short , are of poor quality , or do not represent the game graphics to their fullest or most fluid .
This is the first of two lists which will eventually comprise the 20 best .
10 SWIV Andrew Barnabas ( Storm ) , 1991
SWIV ( short for Silk Worm IV ) is a vertically scrolling shoot - em - up where the player takes control of either a helicopter or a battle jeep to negotiate a vast landscape and hundreds of attacking enemies .
In keeping with the somewhat futuristic and military aspects of the game , Andrew Barnabas carved out a brash and upbeat main theme using music which would not be out of place in an action movie of that period .
Andrew is very prolific , and is still at the forefront of game music today with the likes of Fable II , Star Wars : The Force Unleashed , and Tomb Raider : Underworld .
9 Pinball Fantasies Olof Gustafsson ( 21st Century Entertainment ) , 1992
Pinball Fantasies is the second of three pinball simulators created by Digital Illusions on the Amiga , creating the very first vertical scrolling virtual pinball tables with an authentic feel .
Each game came with four tables of varying difficulty and appeal , with usually one of these standing out as a real jaw - dropper .
These games also earned a reputation for their long introductions and scores , both of high quality and atmosphere .
This second game score by Gustafsson is a vastly more polished track than it ’s predecessor ( Pinball Dreams ) and stands out as a synth - heavy and quite edgy futuristic anthem .
In 2005 , he left Digital Illusions to start a new company , called Motherlode Studios , later known as Epos Game Studios AB .
8 Zool Patrick Phelan ( Gremlin Graphics ) , 1992
Zool ( Ninja ‘ ant ’ of the “ Nth ” Dimension ) is a scrolling platformer similar to the Super Mario games , where the player has to run along and jump over a landscape of cute but deadly creatures and scenery .
Deceased foes release extra Health , and the player could stick to walls in his attempt to negotiate the surprisingly tricky levels .
One of the stand - out aspects of the game was the theme , which could be selected as one of two in - game tunes .
Combining cutesy techno samples with hardcore break - beats , the music capitalised on the urgency needed to play the game through .
Recently , Phelan founded Full Circle Audio to provide audio solutions for games .
He now writes music for commercials , sound design for TV and also provides consultancy and game design services .
7 Turrican 2 Chris Hülsbeck ( Rainbow Arts ) , 1991
Turrican 2 is a multi- directional scrolling platform shoot - em - up , with the player in command of a heavily armoured robo suited character with a variety of lethal weapons .
Among these , the character wielded a very powerful ‘ Ghostbusters ’ type particle laser , smart bombs , bouncing bullets , and could disappear into a gyroscope to slip down cracks and to dice enemies to bits .
The main theme was another master - piece , combining some aspects of opera and synth - pop to emphasise the main Turrican theme developed in the first game .
By playing through the whole theme , the player was rewarded with a cartoon slideshow depicting the games ’ story - line .
Available on the album “ Turrican Soundtrack ” , remixed by the author .
6 Apidya Chris Hülsbeck ( Blue Byte ) , 1992
Apidya is a very unique game indeed .
It features the main character as a wasp ( a wasp ? ) , weaving it ’s way across a meadow , a pond and a sewer , and avoiding or destroying all the insect life it encounters along the way .
The games soundtrack follows running themes and ‘ hooks ’ and develops as each stage of the game is completed – a real encouragement to the player to battle through the mayhem on screen .
Chris Hülsbeck has orchestrated many of his classic themes , and his music from Apidya , Turrican 2 , Turrican 3 and Great Giana Sisters was performed live at the Symphonic Game Music Concert series in Leipzig , Germany between 2003 - 2007 .
The concert album “ Symphonic Shades ” was released on December 17 , 2008 .
The Apidya theme is also available on the album “ Apidya Soundtrack ” , remixed by the author .
5 Sensible World Of Soccer Richard Joseph and John Hare ( Renegade ) , 1995
SWOS is a top - down scrolling soccer game – in the same miniature scale as Cannon Fodder , and features our final theme by composer Richard Joseph .
By now , the technology existed to compress audio samples to such a degree that full speech songs were now possible , and “ Goal - scoring Superstar Hero ” , sung by Jackie Read , did just that .
The song was a triumph of the latest resampling techniques and featured a chorus as well as a verse .
A later remix of this song , made for “ Sensible Soccer 2006 ” , had another two verses added to it .
The CD version of the game also included the studio recording as an audio track .
Richard Joseph went on to win the BAFTA Award in 2000 for best audio in the game “ Theme Park World ” .
He died of lung cancer in early 2007 .
4 State of the Art Rune Svendsen and Paal Granum ( Spaceballs ) , 1992
State of the Art is another demonstration of the sound and graphical capabilities of the Amiga , using advanced programming techniques to combine silhouette dancers with hardware generated special effects – one of the very first sources to do so to such an
extent .
The music is in the hardcore rave style that was very popular at that time , using many high quality synth sounds and modern sounding rhythms ; which seems to complement the presentation to a tee .
3 Project X Allister Brimble ( Team 17 ) , 1992
Project X follows the classic side - scrolling shoot - em - up formula of R - Type and features a selection of ships as well as a wide range of upgradeable weapons and gadgets to help the test pilot through the levels .
It also had a very up - to - date soundtrack for the period .
The main theme returned once again to the hardcore rave scene and in doing so created one of the most recognisable themes on the Amiga .
There are several versions of the theme , and the author himself has remixed and reconstructed it for mainstream release .
Allister now works as a freelance musician and sound designer for the games and console industry with Anthony Putson as “ Orchestral Media Developments ” .
2 9 Fingers Rune Svendsen ( Spaceballs ) , 1993
9 Fingers was one of the later graphical demos to be released by Spaceballs on the Amiga .
If features an updated version of the silhouette model created for the State of the Art demo the year before , and falls back on hardcore trance music to showcase the effect .
This time , the technology allowed for more fleshed out human features and also a slightly higher quality audio experience .
The theme is short and not very technical in it ’s use of the format , but manages to sound almost studio quality in its production – a real step forward in computer sound until the CD age brought ‘ real ’ audio to the industry .
This demo is also incredible in that it manages to squeeze all that onto one 880 k disc !
Today , storing just one single picture or a frame of animation may require more than 1MB !
Rune Svendsen is currently involved in stage and theatre production .
1 Xenon 2 – Megablast David Whittaker ( Image Works ) , 1989
Xenon 2 – Megablast – is a vertical scrolling shoot - em - up with all the associated toys and weapons of that genre .
To give the game the edge , the games creators – The Bitmap Brothers – co-operated with the British musician Tim Simenon of ‘ Bomb The Bass ’ to include the hip - hop track ‘ Megablast – Hip Hop On Precinct 13 ’ ( which is also the origin of the game ’s subtitle ) , as the title music – to become the very FIRST game to accurately include an existing pop single as its theme .
The song itself is based on the theme of John Carpenter ’s ‘ Assault on Precinct 13 ’ movie , and also features samples from Sly and the Family Stone song , ‘ You Can Make It If You Try ’ .
There are two versions of the track in the game : a nearly faithful rendition ( only missing a few spoken lines ) as the loading music , and a simplified version as the in - game background music .
The Amiga version also had a few changes ; such as helicopter sound effects at the beginning and ending of the track .
David Whittaker is also no stranger to programming audio hits .
His sub-tune of ‘ Lazy Jones ’ was the basis for the dance hit ‘ Kernkraft 400 ’ by Zombie Nation , which went to number 1 in many European countries .
David is still busy today working on the LEGO ( Star Wars , Indiana Jones , Batman ) action series of games .
Wal - Mart gets a lot of negative publicity , but one one story that draws plenty of positive coverage is its roster of $ 4 - a - month generic drugs .

Michelle Malkin is at it again , claiming black is white , blue is yellow , and Obama is a closet communist / America hater .
In her latest rant , Malkin accuses Obama of using the politics of fear in trying to pass his stimulus bill :
President Obama is

the stimulus battle .
Fiscal conservatives are winning the message war
on the Generational Theft Act of 2009 .
Flailing and desperate , he has

scare
Washington into ramming his massive , ineffective , debt - stimulating plan through Congress .
This is the age old tactic of accusing your enemy of exactly the same thing you are guilty of ( like calling those who criticised Sarah Palin ' sexist ' , and Karl Rove accusing the Democrats of ' partisan politics ' ) .
While Malkin was all too happy to hype the none existent threat from Iraq , the threat of a genuine financial meltdown does not seem to bother her too much .
For Malkin and her conservative chums , tax cuts , tax cuts and more tax cuts are the key to the problem , despite the annoying fact that they have n't worked at all .
Obama 's warnings are correct , and while his stimulus bill is n't exactly great ( but not for the reasons Malkin thinks so ) , it is a necessary step in order to prevent the economy from falling off a cliff .

Rove skips House Judiciary deposition
John Bresnahan reports :
Former Bush adviser Karl Rove was a no - show today at his scheduled deposition deadline for the House Judiciary Committee 's ongoing probe into the U.S. attorney firings -- setting up a major decision for President Obama on how to respond to congressional subpoenas .
Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) subpeonaed
Rove to find out what he knows about the Dec. 2006 firings which eventually toppled former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
When Rove was subpoenaed in 2007 , President Bush asserted " absolute immunity " for his top aides , refusing to allow them even to appear before a congressional panel .
House Democrats eventually sued , and won an initial legal victory .
The Bush White House , through the Justice Dept. , appealed the ruling , and when Bush left office in January 2009 , the case was still undecided .
White House Counsel Greg Craig has urged the two sides to cut a deal , but Rove and his attorney , Robert Luskin , have kicked it back to the White House , saying it is up to them to assert executive privilege or not .
So the next big development will occur on March 4 , when the Obama administration is scheduled to file a motion in federal appeals court laying out its position on the issue .

— The City Council has been wrestling with whether to throw its support behnind an effort to change state law to require background checks on people trying to buy bullets .
Such a restriction would require a change in state law , but some advocates said support from Durham could create the needed momentum to push a bill through the General Assembly .
" We do n't sell guns to criminals , so why are we letting them buy the bullets ? " said Rev. Melvin
Whitley , a community activist who has fought gangs and crime in Durham for years .
Whitley emphasized his point Monday by going to an intersection where a 14 - year - old was hit by a bullet .
" If you 've never been robbed and you 've never had somebody stick a gun in your face ( or ) you 've never had a gun to go off near you , you probably wo n't understand this issue , " he said .
Gun-owners said the so - called " bullet ownership bill " wo n't prevent crime .
" We need to focus on the person and not the object , because a gun never jumped up off a table and went and committed an armed burglary , " said Wallace Chambers , who said he has twice had to show his gun to protect himself in threatening situations .
" Ultimately , it 's my responsibility to be able to protect my house and my home , " Chambers said .
City Council members were split on the proposal , with some calling it a state matter and others saying they support the concept but not necessarily Whitley 's proposal .
" This is misdirected legislation , " Councilman Eugene Brown said .
" I 've got a very simplified approach to the bullet bill , ( but ) it is not the proposal that has been presented , " Mayor Bill Bell said .
" My sense is that , if you have permission to buy firearms , you ought to be able to buy bullets .
If you do n't have permission to buy firearms , then you should n't be able to purchase bullets . "
Bills have been introduced in 18 states to require laser - engraving bullets with a serial number at the factory to make them traceable .
None has passed .
Under North Carolina law , anyone who fills out the required paperwork , passes a criminal background check and provides two notarized references can purchase a handgun in North Carolina .
Rifle and shotgun purchases do n't require the references .
There is no state restriction on ammunition sales .
" Any mechanism that will reduce the number of gun crimes , we need to explore , " Councilman Howard Clement said .
Councilman Farad
Ali said that if Durham backs the " bullet ownership bill , " city officials need to recruit other counties and cities to support it as well in the General Assembly .

In an important speech delivered at the University of Kansas , Associated Press head Tom Curley charged that the Bush Pentagon had systematically targeted and mistreated journalists as a part of a propaganda program developed by Donald Rumsfeld .
He called on President Obama to end this approach .
Curley , speaking to journalists at the University of Kansas , said the news industry must immediately negotiate a new set of rules for covering war because “ we are the only force out there to keep the government in check and to hold it accountable . ”
Much like in Vietnam , “ civilian policymakers and soldiers alike have cracked down on independent reporting from the battlefield ” when the news has been unflattering , Curley said .
“ Top commanders have told me that if I stood and the AP stood by its journalistic principles , the AP and I would be ruined . ”
Answering questions from his audience of about 160 people , Curley said AP remains concerned about journalists ’ detentions .
He said most appear to occur when someone else , often a competitor , “ trashes ” the journalist .
“ There is a procedure that takes place which sounds an awful lot like torture to us , ” Curley said .
“ If people agree to trash other people , they are freed .
If they do n’t immediately agree to trash other people , they are kept for some period of time –two or three weeks–and they are put through additional questioning . ”

Ever have a cable you wanted to strangle ?
Well you 're not alone , apparently .
A company called E - Filliate issued a new series of USB , HDMI , Cat5 , S - Video , and composite cables called Flexicord at CES this year which will bend -- and stay -- in any position you please , thus eliminating that frustration you must feel every time you plug in your camera or hook up your high fidelity sound system .
The cables act like pipe cleaner or Gumby , so you can twist and shape them as you please , though apparently Pokey had to be killed and dissected so the technology could be obtained .
Enjoy your new cable , murderers .

U.S. Out of Iraq & Afghanistan !
No Wars on Iran , Pakistan , Gaza !
The world ca n’t wait !
Come OUT to the first national protest of the wars under President Obama .
THURSDAY March 19 leave work & school to PROTEST the 6th anniversary of the Iraq War .
SATURDAY March 21 at the Pentagon .
Barack Obama says he will :
* leave 80,000 troops , thousands of private contractors , and 17 permanent bases in Iraq ;
* send 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan , leading to more killings of civilians ;
* keep sending robot drones over Pakistan , killing more civilians ;
* deploy nuclear carriers with enough firepower to annihilate any country in the Mideast ;
* support the Israeli siege on Gaza ;
* keep in place the “ secret rendition ” program which Bush used to torture detainees ;
* keep the government spying on citizens and continue Bush ’s “ state secrets ” justification ;
* increase the U.S. military by 92,000 troops , sending more to die for empire ;
* refuse to investigate & prosecute the war and torture crimes of the Bush regime .
The election of the first black president is effectively re-branding preemptive and illegal wars of aggression to make us feel good about them , enlisting us to “ serve and sacrifice ” for horrors we have no good reason to support .
The U.S. war on Afghanistan is an unjust war of aggression — the supreme war crime , waged not to bring democracy and liberation to the Afghan people , but to control Afghanistan with the goal of permanent domination of the Middle East .
But , we do n’t have to go along !
It ’s immoral to “ wait and see ” or hope for the best from Obama .
If you care about humanity , get in the streets to send a message to the world that there are millions of us who do n’t want these crimes carried out .
It ’s time now to take action & make our demands visible everywhere .

Paedophiles and other sex offenders on probation will face compulsory " lie detector " tests from next month , The Register has learned .
The academic who will run the tests of controversial polygraph technology on sex offenders for the government believes a successful trial will lead to its use in other crimes .
From late April , sex offenders released on licence in the West and East Midlands * National Offender Management Service ( NOMS ) areas will be required to undergo a polygraph examination within three months of release , and then at six week intervals until their probation is served .
The first licences including compulsory testing have already been granted .
Then - Home Secretary David Blunkett first indicated government support for compulsory testing of sex offenders in 2004 , but unspecific plans for a trial scheme this year were n't announced until last September .
Offenders who refuse to submit to the programme will violate their licence conditions and be sent back to prison .
It 's expected that by the end of the trial between 600 and 1,000 primarily child sex offenders will be subject to regular examinations .
Newcastle University 's Professor Don Grubin , who will run the three - year experiment for the Ministry of Justice , said at the end of the trial the government will have to decide whether to use polygraph testing nationally , and whether to extend it to other crimes .
" We need to not outrun the evidence , but provided there is good evidence of success , I would say the argument then needs to be turned to ' what 's the justification for not using it [ for other offences ] ? ' , " he said , citing US authorities who have use polygraph testing in drug addiction and domestic violence probation .
Grubin previously ran smaller , voluntary trials of sex offender polygraph testing for the government between 2003 and 2005 .
During examinations , volunteers were asked about their contact with children , for example .
Researchers found that offenders were more likely to make disclosures about their behaviour if challenged with polygraph results indicating they had lied or withheld information .
According to the Polygraph Rules 2009 , the statutory instrument recently approved to govern the new trial , " a polygraph examination must include ... at least one , but not more than four , relevant questions . "
The laws to allow compulsory polygraph testing by probation services , brought in during 2007 , do not limit the technology to sex crimes .
A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said the government was not currently considering polygraph testing for non-sexual offences and could n't say whether it will be considered in future .
" We 'd have to analyse the outcome of the trial before we'd look at that , " she said .
The main equipment supplier for the trial will be Indiana - based manufacturer LaFayette .
Its polygraphs measure heart rate , sweating and breathing ( abdominal and chest ) .
Polygraph testing of sex offenders is in widespread use in the US , but according to Grubin , " it varies in terms of how mandatory it is " .
" The problem is there has been a lack of good data on its effectiveness , " he said .
Grubin added that given the vulnerability of polygraphs to faking , no decisions about the management of recently - released sex offenders would be made solely on the basis of their results . ®
* The specific prisons and probation offices covered by NOMS East and West Midlands are listed here and here .
Where do you start with a comparison like this and , really , what is the point ?
Well , every now and then it ’s important to take a look at the extremes of an issue just to get some perspective or maybe just because it ’s Tuesday .
We traditionally cover cars that are expensive , exclusive and ridiculously fast .
So , why take pause now ?
Because the new Tata Nano is a game changer , just like the Bugatti Veryon 16.4 Coupe , but for very different reasons .
Let ’s take a look at both the world ’s cheapest car and the world ’s most expensive car and see what you get for you dollars or lakhs .
Amenities
The Tata Nano comfortably seats four adults in a package that has the smallest exterior footprint but is 21 % more spacious than the smallest car available on the market .
There are 3 trim levels available .
The Tata Nano Standard comes in three colors with single tone seats ( as opposed to ultra high - end two - tone ) and a fold - down rear seat .
The Tata Nano CX gets 5 color options with heat and AC , two - tone seats ( bam ! ) , a parcel shelf , booster - assisted brakes ( aka power - assisted ) and a fold - down rear seat with nap rest .
The super pimp Tata Nano LC comes with fabric seats , central locking , power windows up front , fog lamps , trip meter , cup holders , a mobile charger and rear spoiler ( to make sure there is enough downforce when the 33 hp engine is floored . )
The Bugatti Veyron is outfitted with carbon - ceramic brakes , height - adjustable suspension and electronically controlled dampers .
Inside , opulence abounds with two - tone leather upholstery ( just like the Nano CX and Nano LC ! ) , heated sport seats , automatic climate control , a 400 - watt CD sound system , navigation with backup camera and a hands - free cell phone connection .
Aluminum accents are found on the steering wheel , controls and center stack .
Advantage : Bugatti — but the nap rest keeps it close
Performance
The Tata Nano in addition to being the cheapest , may also be the slowest .
The car gets only 33 horsepower from it ’s 623 cc two - cylinder engine with four - speed gearbox .
However , as reported , the car can reach Indian highway speeds which is actually pretty darn cool .
The Bugatti Veyron has a ridiculous 1001 horsepower 8.0 - liter quad turbocharged W16 engine with 922 pound - feet of torque .
Basically , two svelt V8 block engines are mounted in a W configuration to create the most powerful stock engine in a consumer car .
Top speed is rated at 253 mph , making it the second fastest car next to the SSC Ultimate Aero , which tops out at 257 + mph .
Just in case you are tempted to test the spec sheet on your local expressway , Bugatti wants you to take a minute and consider the sanity of this endeavor .
Top speed can only be obtained by using a separate key which , unless activated , curtails your efforts down to 233 mph just to be on the safe side .
O to 60 mph takes less than 3 seconds .
Advantage : Bugatti — but only by 968 horsepower
Safety
The Tata Nano meets all safety requirements .
It even passes tests related to roll - overs and offset impacts which are not regulated in India .
The passenger compartment is reinforced and there are crumple zones , intrusion - resistant doors , mandatory seatbelts and an all - sheet metal body .
It even sports tubeless tires with staggered wheels to give it more stability .
The Bugatti Veyron has front airbags as mandated by the US government but wins no safety awards with its lack of side or side curtain airbags .
You do get stability and traction control to actually make you look like you know how to drive this thing .
Advantage : Nano — by a long shot
Availability
Bugatti releases all of its Veyron variants in low production limited editions .
For example , the 2009 Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport will only have 150 units available and that is traditionally a lot for the company .
The 2009 Bugatti Veyron Bleu Centenaire may only have been produced as a single one - off show car and only a couple dozen of the 2008 Bugatti Veyron Fbg par Hermes have been released .
In 2007 , the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Pur Sang was limited to 5 vehicles .
The Tata Nano will also be in short supply .
Tata has instituted a special process for reserving the Nano starting on April 9th , 2009 .
Buyers must either be able to pay the entire cost or request financing via 15 banks that Tata has partnered with for the booking process .
A computerized random selection process will choose the first 100,000 allotments for deliveries to start in July 2009 .
Subsequent phases will offer additional cars as production increases .
Advantage : Nano
Conclusion
Well , we have taken a stab at a quick comparison between the two and have come to a tie – 2 to 2 .
Traditionally , a tie breaker is needed but in this case I believe that keeping things on even keel is appropriate .
The world ’s most expensive car , the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 , and the world ’s cheapest car , the Tata Nano , both have their pluses and minuses .
But let me leave you with one parting thought .
For the base price of a Bugatti Veyron at $ 1.5 million you could purchase 750 Tato Nanos at $ 2,000 a pop .
And because the point of the Nano is to offer an affordable option for Indian families who are often forced to use two - wheelers for transportation , Tata is making possible an incredible alternative .
And I say Bravo !

A Sharp Poke in the Gums Last week , I went to the dentist to have my gums scaled , which is n't nearly as fun as it sounds .
For those of you lucky enough not to know , this scaling involved a dentist digging deep under my gums with a series of sharp instruments in a desperate search for tartar .
The purpose of this , of course , was to torture me relentlessly until my resolve weakened and I finally revealed the name of our secret operative in the Kremlin .
Also , it helps to keep one 's gums healthy .
As you can imagine , I was a little worried about all this , although luckily my dentist did ease my mind by carefully explaining the procedure beforehand with a flip chart that featured cartooned pictures of teeth .
I knew then that my gums were in the hands of a true professional .
Apparently , I happen to have massive teeth .
Sure , they look normal enough , but they are far too big for my mouth .
They overhang my gums just enough to create this hidden area beneath where all the tartar in my mouth can hang out .
It 's sort of like having a highway overpass in my mouth under which all the bad tartar can go to drink beer and buy drugs .
At this point , I would just like to say that I do floss regularly ( Really , I do ! ) , but it seems to make little difference .
Every single time I go to the dentist , I am given grief for not flossing enough .
In fact , they regard me with the same level of disappointment when I do floss as when I do n't .
No matter what , every trip there feels like going to confession .
" Forgive me , dentist , for I have not flossed enough . "
This procedure was at least supposed to stop some of the damage , and so I leaned back while my friendly periodontist took a sharp pick and hacked away at my gums .
If you ask me , he seemed to be enjoying this just a little too much .
Special tip for any periodontists who happen to be reading : try not to look like you 're having too much fun .
I 'm glad that you enjoy your job , but it really does n't make me feel any better .
Later , he took out an instrument that seemed to be a sharp electric powered hook .
" Now , this is a really cool device , " he told me , which really is a lot easier to say when your gums are not the ones about to be ravaged by the sharp electric powered hook .
Luckily , I was given some novocaine to ease the pain and also to make me look like a slobbering fool for the rest of the day at work .
For the most part , the novocaine did its job so that I did n't feel too much pain .
Still , it 's quite agitating to watch an excited periodontist probe your gums .
The procedure lasted forty - five minutes , but after a few days of soreness and careful chewing I was back to normal .
That 's the good news .
The bad news is that I have to go back in a month to have the same thing done to the left side of my mouth .
Who knows what new toys he 'll have by then ?
In the meantime , I 've been given approximately sixty - seven new dental devices to use on my teeth every night .
One looks like a tiny toilet brush that I 'm supposed to stick between my teeth .
Another is a dental pick that I have to use in case the toilet brush misses anything .
There is even a pink tipped instrument with which I must prod my gums .
This is called a gum stimulator , and I 'm not so sure I 'll be using it .
Frankly , I prefer to stimulate my gums the old fashioned way -- with tartar .
Finally , he gave me another odd dental instrument called a toothbrush .
With all the other tools I 'm supposed to use , I 'm not sure whether I 'll be able to fit this one into my busy dental schedule .

Ciudad Juarez has become synonymous with the violence and crime committed by the Mexican drug cartels .
Over the past several years , countless numbers of women have disappeared or been killed , and in 2008 alone , two thousand people were murdered .
Mexican officials moved 1,500 soldiers into the region to try to regain control of the city and say they plan on having 7,000 in place by the end of the week .
Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora said the troops were there to help support the local authorities , " Ciudad Juarez worries us deeply , " he told Reuters .
The city , located right on the border of the United States , is a key entry point for drug smuggling and rival gangs have been fighting for control of the area .
Mora explained why the President and armed forces decided to take this drastic step , saying , " In areas where drug traffickers have a lot of influence , sadly there is a risk that they will have an interest in influencing the formation of public power , particularly the local authority .
This is something that concerns us . "
The council said anyone taking the advice of the signs could be prosecuted People should ignore signs telling them that it is legal to urinate in certain public places in Nottingham , the city council said .
The signs , which were put up by pranksters in and around Nottingham , are designed to look official .
They feature a toilet sign and include the words : " Public Urination Permitted After 7.30 pm " .
Nottingham City Council is now urging the public to ignore the notices as it sets about removing them .
' Cleaned daily '
The prank also featured a laminated note , headed with the logo of Nottingham City Council , which said the scheme was aimed at reducing the mess faced by residents outside their homes .
A spokeswoman for the authority said : " It is an offence to urinate in public and these signs have been put up illegally , for whatever reason .
" We would urge people to ignore them , otherwise they could find themselves inadvertently facing a prosecution .
" We are taking the signs down as quickly as possible and if anyone spots one of the illegal signs we ask them to please contact the city council so they can be removed . "
The notice reads : " In an attempt to reduce late night public nuisance , during the holiday period , Nottingham City Council has designated several public urination areas across the city .
" This urination area will be cleaned daily between the hours of 5 am and 6 am . "

One of the worst escape attempts EVER as robbers handcuffed together run straight into lamp - post
It was less than a Great Escape .
Two New Zealand prisoners who were handcuffed together as they fled a courthouse foiled their own getaway when they ran to opposite sides of a lamp - post , slammed into each other and fell to the ground .
Jailers nabbed them as they struggled to their feet .
D'oh !
Clockwise from top left :
The pair of robbers , handcuffed together , charge towards freedom - but foil their own attempt by charging straight into the post
Click here to see video of the dreadful escape attempt
Their escapade on Wednesday was captured by a CCTV camera at Hastings District Court on New Zealand 's North Island .
The footage shows the two men trying to make a break for it - but apparently forgetting they were joined at the wrist .
Hastings police Senior Sgt. Dave Greig said one inmate , Regan Reti , 20 , had just been sent to prison for more than two years after being convicted of assault .
The other inmate , Tiranara White , 21 , was in custody for allegedly stealing a car and violating parole .
' As they were being led from the Hastings police cells ... they made a bolt for freedom , ' Greig said today .

" They fell over and they were sprayed with pepper spray .
But they got up and ran out of the court onto the street , across the road to a car park , " he said .
' That 's where they met the pole - it was all over , rover . '
The pair were back in court today , facing fresh charges of escaping from custody .
Police said Reti , who pleaded guilty to the charge , had a month added to his prison term .
White did not enter a plea .
He will remain in police custody while a psychiatric evaluation is carried out .
Grainy footage of the escapade shown on TV One News was billed as ' one of the worst escape attempts ever seen . '

OK , OK , I know .
There are lots and lots of proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem .
( My favorite appears at the bottom of this entry , in case you want to skip to it . )
I ’m not trying to overthrow thousands of years of math here .
I ’m just wondering about something , and I ’ve been unable to find any treatment of this particular problem .
Suppose you ’re walking along and come to an empty lot .
You have to get from the northwest corner of the lot to the southeast corner of the lot .
You could just walk all the way down the west side ( side A ) , then walk all the way along the south side ( side D ) .
You ’d find the total distance equals the length of side A plus the length of side D .
We all know that to shorten your distance , you simply cut across the lot .
H ( the hypotenuse ) does not equal A + D , but is always less than A + D .
But let ’s suppose for just a minute that we do n’t really know what it means to cut across .
We do n’t , in other words , understand diagonal .
Suppose you ’ve got some strange condition where you can only move north - south and east - west , but nothing in between .
Now you try to take a shortcut across the lot , but you get this :
Now if you add up your distance , you ’ll find that it ’s ( more or less ) 1/2 A + 1/2 D + 1/2 A + 1/2 D = A + D !
You did n’t do any better by cutting across the lot in this way .
OK , maybe if we do a little better .
What about this zigzag path ?
This path looks a lot more like the hypotenuse .
In fact , you can make the zigzags arbitrarily small , maybe a million turns , or a billion , or any other ridiculous number you want .
Your total distance traveled is still exactly A + D !
You have n’t done any better by taking the shortcut !
And yet , if you make even a small diagonal movement , you instantly see the benefit .
Consider this path , in which you travel most of A , cut across the corner , then travel most of D .
Your total distance will be less than A + D .
So what ’s going on here ?
Clearly the hypotenuse is the best path , but I ca n’t approximate that hypotenuse , even a little , by using only north - south and east - west movements .
What is this “ diagonal ” and why is it so powerful ?
Any thoughts ?
OK , here ’s the elegant proof of Pythagoras that I like , the one that Albert Einstein found on his own when as a boy he fell in love with what he called “ holy geometry . ”
The first thing to notice is that there are three three similar triangles in this picture .
Why ?
Because :
1 ) similar triangles all have the same internal angles .
2 ) all triangles have the same internal angle measure ( we know it ’s 180 degrees , but that does n’t matter – what matters is that all triangles have the same measure , whatever it is ) .
3 ) by 1 and 2 , if two right triangles share an angle , then they have to be similar .
The three similar triangles are :
ABC , ACX , and CBX ( notice that the order of the letters is crucial here , matching the appropriate angles ) .
In similar triangles , the ratios of the sides are equal .
So the triangle CBX compared to the triangle ABC gives
a/x = c /
a
Cross -multiplying gives a ^2 = cx
The triangle ABC compared to the triangle ACX gives
c /b = b/(c – x )
Cross-multiply again and you get
b ^2 = c^2 – cx
But we already know cx = a ^2 from before , so now we have
b^2 = c^2 – a^2
Rearranging , we get the familiar
a ^2 + b^2 = c^2
The Pythagorean Theorem !
THAT is a beautiful bit of math .
It occurs to me that the proof depends on the very existence of triangles , and triangles only exist in a two - dimensional world .
Somehow , the Pythagorean theorem emerges from the existence of two dimensions as opposed to one .
I still do n’t see how , but it ’s interesting .
Here ’s something else .
If you made it through my light clock blog entry , you know that Special Relativity comes right out of the Pythagorean Theorem .
The light clock is a two - dimensional argument , so it seems that even if we reduced our universe from three spacial dimensions to only two , Special Relativity would still work .
Flatlander twins would still experience the paradox if one rocketed off in a two - dimensional spacecraft , then returned to find her twin aged and wrinkled ( would flat creatures wrinkle ? )
But what is n’t clear to me is whether or not Special Relativity would apply in a one - dimensional universe , one in which everything existed on a line , since in such a universe , there are no shortcuts .
Anyway , if anyone has any thoughts on why the Pythagorean Theorem works , or if you ’ve ever seen an analysis of this sort of north - south , east - west approach and why it fails , I ’d love to hear about it .

The Treasury View : Swimming pool version
A reader of my blog sent me , for comment , one of those letters that circulate through the Intertubes .
This one is sent as “ an explanation of the stimulus bill ” .
I would n’t call it that , but it is quite a good exposition of what ’s known as the “ Treasury View ” [ 1 ] .
If you believe that the economy is like a swimming pool , and that no matter how big a splash some shock ( such as the collapse of the financial system ) might make , the water in it will rapidly find its own level , then you will agree that there is no need for , or possible benefit from , the stimulus package .
And conversely , if you think the economy is not like this , you are entitled to wonder about the kind of economist ( regrettably not imaginary ) who would employ such an argument .
fn1 . The reference is to the British Treasury , circa 1929
Stimulus Bill Explanation
Shortly after class , an economics student approaches his economics professor and says , “ I do n’t understand this stimulus bill .
Can you explain it to me ? ”
The professor replied , “ I do n’t have any time to explain it at my office , but if you come over to my house on Saturday and help me with my weekend project , I ’ll be glad to explain it to you . ”
The student agreed .
At the agreed - upon time , the student showed up at the professor ’s house .
The professor stated that the weekend project involved his backyard pool .
They both went out back to the pool , and the professor handed the student a bucket .
Demonstrating with his own bucket , the professor said , “ First , go over to the deep end , and fill your bucket with as much water as you can . ”
The student did as he was instructed .
The professor then continued , “ Follow me over to the shallow end , and then dump all the water from your bucket into it .
” The student was naturally confused , but did as he was told .
The professor then explained they were going to do this many more times , and began walking back to the deep end of the pool .
The confused student asked , “ Excuse me , but why are we doing this ?
The professor matter - of - factly stated that he was trying to make the shallow end much deeper .
The student did n’t think the economics professor was serious , but figured that he would find out the real story soon enough .
However , after the 6th trip between the shallow end and the deep end , the student began to become worried that his economics professor had gone mad .
The student finally replied , “ All we ’re doing is wasting valuable time and effort on unproductive pursuits .
Even worse , when this process is all over , everything will be at the same level it was before , so all you ’ll really have accomplished is the destruction of what could have been truly productive action ! ”
The professor put down his bucket and replied with a smile , “ Congratulations .
You now understand the stimulus bill . ”

He sends videotapes to the media labeled " Gospels of Blood , " which are just photographs of naked women in bondage , usually crucified in some way , with the camera panning and zooming over the photos .
These photographs account for more than half of the running time .
There is no diegetic sound , only a few title cards , although there is a soundtrack of heavy metal music .

I ’m having trouble concentrating on work again today , which is bad because I have three articles due .
In passing the time unproductively , I happened upon a list of 100 of the World ’s Strangest Buildings , displayed in two parts of 50 each .
The Beer Can House , in Houston , Texas , made number 23 on the second list , making it the 73rd strangest building .
I visited the house after CBC in 2007 and took a bunch of photos .
The house was the hobby of its owner , John Milkovisch , who began working on it in 1968 and kept adding to it for the next eighteen years , using an estimated 50,000 beer cans .
Today it is owned by a local arts foundation , The Orange House Center For Visionary Art .
They recently renovated it , inside and out , and now it ’s open to the public .
I visited it before the renovations were complete , so my photos look a little different than the one at the bottom , which is presumably more recent .
They even have a new website up , which is new since my visit , too .
But the other strange houses that made the list are cool , too , in fact many are pretty amazing , especially if you ’re a fan of architecture .
If you love cool and / or unusual buildings , check them out .
The beer can house is in Part 2 , but Part 1 has some awesome architecture , too .
The crooked house in Poland was their choice for number one .
Worth a look , in my opinion .

The economy is nose - diving .
Unemployment rages .
A yawning budget hole looms .
In these gloomy times , statehouse Republicans see a chance to spur California renewal by refighting a few past defeats .
GOP lawmakers have tugged old battles over workplace rules and the environment into the historic winter budget talks now underway in the Capitol .
From the position of the majority Democrats , who need at least a few Republican votes to pass a spending plan , it pays to listen .
Back on the table are some of the most hard - fought policy issues of recent years , won by Democrats and Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger : labor rules on overtime pay and work breaks , plans to clean up the dirtiest diesel construction equipment and California ’s curbs on greenhouse gases .
Although such policies are not directly connected to the state budget , Republican lawmakers say they are germane to the economic downturn that has depleted tax revenue and helped open California ’s gaping budget deficit .
Delaying or rolling them back , GOP lawmakers argue , will spark a recovery , create jobs and refill state coffers .

“ If we can do things that can help the economy , that should be part of the discussion , ” said Assemblyman Roger Niello ( R - Fair Oaks ) .
“ We need to get shovels in the ground and paychecks in pockets . ”
The state ’s requirement that budgets be approved by two - thirds of the Legislature gives the minority Republicans leverage .
But political experts say the stakes are unusually high in the current budget talks , which are taking place half a year early because of the precipitous decline in tax receipts .
Republican leaders are grudgingly coming around to the Democrats ’ position -- and the governor ’s -- that taxes need to be raised .
In exchange , they will need to score some victories on issues from the GOP playbook .
“ The quid pro quo in this , ” said Barbara O’Connor , a Sacramento State University political communications professor , “ is the Republicans need some things they can sell to their constituency . ”

Among the labor rules GOP negotiators are attempting to change are break and lunch - hour requirements , which they say can prove nettlesome for restaurant owners trying to staff tables during a lunch or dinner rush .
In addition , they are looking to curtail overtime requirements for the eight - hour workday to give businesses more flexibility in scheduling .
“ One man ’s provisions to protect labor can be another man ’s imposition on business , ” said Niello , vice chairman of the Assembly budget committee .
Republicans are also looking to delay or change diesel regulations for big construction equipment , which currently call for an 85 % reduction in pollution by 2020 .
Construction industry officials say the new rules can be delayed because California ’s fiscal doldrums have caused a 20 % decline in construction activity and a 41 % drop in diesel fuel consumption .
As a result of that downturn , they say , the state is already meeting or exceeding the environmental mandates .

Other GOP proposals on the table include exempting several road projects from the state ’s environmental review process , setting up an ad hoc committee of governor - appointed agency chiefs with veto power over environmental requirements hindering some of the state ’s more contentious projects and easing regulations meant to reduce air hazards caused by pesticide use .
The Republican push has labor leaders and environmentalists crying foul .
Art Pulaski , executive secretary - treasurer of the California Labor Federation AFL - CIO , accused the Republicans of engaging in “ blackmail of the budget process ” by tussling anew over labor rules that in some cases date back a century .
Labor leaders are countering with threats of payback .
At a news conference late in the week , Pulaski and others vowed to mount election challenges or even fund recall attempts against lawmakers who vote to weaken workplace rules .

“ They ’re trying to take us backward , ” said Ann Notthoff of the Natural Resources Defense Council .
“ They ’re trying to revive the worn - out debate of economy versus environment .
It ’s the losing side trying to undo the outcome of policy fights that have already been settled . ”
“ We feel a stronger sense of crisis around this budget than any in years , ” said Notthoff .
“ Everything is in jeopardy . ”
O’Connor said all sides in the talks “ are going to have to give up stuff they do n’t want to give up . ”
Meanwhile , she said , the general public is finding it hard to understand why Republicans and Democrats ca n’t sit down , hash it out and “ come up with the best bad solution . ”

Guidelines on alt texts in img elements
In HTML authoring , there are very good reasons to include an alt attribute into every img element .
The purpose is to specify a textual replacement for the image , to be displayed or otherwise used in place of the image .
Thus , the prime rule is : Consider what the page looks like or sounds like when images are not shown .
Then , write for each image an alt text that best works as a replacement .
This document also gives more specific suggestions for simple , common situations , and some uncommon too .
For content - rich images , it recommends explicit links to textual alternatives .
Content :
The alt attribute is an essential part of Web accessibility , which is discussed , for example , in Diffuse 's Guide to Web Accessibility and Design for All and in the extensive Web Accessibility Initiative ( WAI ) material .
In particular , in Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 , the first guideline is : Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content , and the first checkpoint under it says : " Provide a text equivalent for every non -text element ( e.g. , via ' alt ' , ' longdesc ' , or in element content ) . "
It refers to the document on techniques for WAI guidelines , checkpoint 1.1 , for information on how to do this .
The idea of alt is old .
Although the very first implementations of the img tag lacked it , the alt attribute has been in HTML specifications since the first (! ) one , HTML 2.0 .
It said : " HTML user agents may process the value of the ALT attribute as an alternative to processing the image resource indicated by the SRC attribute " , and clarified this further by stating that the ALT attribute value is " text to use in place of the referenced image resource , for example due to processing constraints or user preference " .
And it gave a good example of alt attribute :
< IMG SRC=" triangle.xbm " ALT = " Warning : " >
Be sure to read these instructions .
Simplicity has its price .
Since the alternate is written as an attribute value , it is restricted to plain text with no HTML markup .
We will get back to this issue in section Making text and image really alternative .
However , there is quite some confusion around the very idea of alt texts .
Although the attribute name is an abbreviation of " alternate " , reflecting well the intended meaning and use , even in official documents like later HTML specifications and the WAI guidelines there are also state­ments about alt texts as " text descriptions " of images .
In particular , although WCAG 1.0 refers to " text equivalents " and contains a very good definition of " equivalent " in this context , and generally promotes the idea of alternative rather than descriptive texts , it still has expressions like " For simple content , a text equivalent may need only describe the function or purpose of content .
For complex content ( charts , graphs , etc. ) , the text equivalent may be longer and include descriptive information . "
To see how careless the formulation is , consider a spacer image .
An attribute like alt = " spacer " would be a description of the image , and alt = " a 20 pixels wide horizontal spacer image " would be even more descriptive ; yet , both texts are pointless as substitutes for the image , and the more descriptive the description is , the more disturbing it is as an alternate text .
In the working draft Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 dated 22 August 2002 , the formulation is clearer .
Its checkpoint 1.1 says :
For all non -text content that can be expressed in words , provide a text equivalent of the function or information the non-text content was intended to convey .
The guidelines are intended to be general , not related to HTML specifically , and the checkpoint does not refer to the alt attribute directly .
Rather , different methods can be used , depending on the state of technologies , and other considerations .
But the examples mention " short labels " and " longer descriptions " , which might look suspiciously like generalizations of alt and longdesc .
This is somewhat disquieting , as it might be read so that it is acceptable to rely on the latter , i.e. to assume that both of those attribute values are always available to the user .
In the index of attributes in the HTML 4 specification , the characterization of the alt attribute is " short description " .
Although the description of the alt attribute in the specification clearly defines it as providing " alternate text to serve as content when the element cannot be rendered normally " , people tend to remember short slogans better than long explanations with lots of difficult words .
Besides , the long explanation is n't that exact , and it 's preceded by an even more confusing one : " For user agents that cannot display images , forms , or applets , this attribute specifies alternate text . "
( It 's not only a matter of being able to display images ; it could be just the user 's choice , for example . )
Thus , the meme of regarding alt as a description has become frustratingly common .
It is easy to understand and easy to implement , without thinking about difficult things like the context and communicative purpose of the image .
Luckily the slogan " alt gives an alternate text " has some properties of a successful meme too .
Maybe the most serious official confusion appears in the so - called Section 508 guide , which gives instructions based on the accessibility legislation in the US .
In that guide , the explanation of rule ( a ) ( " A text equivalent for every non -text element shall be provided ( e.g. , via " alt " , " longdesc " , or in element content ) . " ) partly uses adequate phrases like " communicate the same information as its associated element " , partly misleading expressions like " a text description accompanying it that explains the meaning of the image " .
-
It needs to be added here that Web accessibility rules in Section 508 as a whole are well - written and pragmatic .
To some extent this confusion relates to difficulties in writing good alt texts and using descrip­tions instead , as explored below in section
When an image says more than a thousand words .
But there is little hope in getting things right unless we make it clear , and keep it clear , that an alt attribute should be an alternative that stands on its own .
Otherwise authors will get misled into writing descriptions even for spacer and bullet images and other images that have very good textual alternatives .
Let us end the discussion of alt texts as replacements versus descriptions by quoting a famous usability expert :
utility descrip­tions that Some accessibility specialists advocate so - called described images , where text is provided to verbalize what a seeing user would see .
For example , the Web Access Symbol [...] might be described as " a glowing globe with a keyhole . "
In my opinion , such literal descriptions are fairly useless for Web pages unless the user is an art critic .
I much preferthat verbalize the meaning or role of the image in the dialogue : what is the image intended to communicate and what will happen if it is clicked ?
Source : Jakob Nielsen : Accessible Design for Users With Disabilities , alertbox for October 1996 .
Imagine that you are reading your page to someone over a phone .
What would be the appropriate thing to do when you reach an image ?
Would you just skip the image , or would you use words that perform the function of the image , to the extent possible ?
What would you do if it turns out that you can say just part of the content in words since the some essential features are inherently visual ?
If there is no adequate replace­ment , would it be somehow relevant to tell that there is an image with such - and - such content ?
The Core Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 mentions a test like this ( under " Quicktest ! " ) .
But it says this after having given a confusing explanation :
When a text equivalent is presented to the user , it fulfills essentially the same function ( to the extent possible ) as the original content .
For simple content , a text equivalent may need only describe the function or purpose of content .
For complex content ( charts , graphs , etc. ) , the text equivalent may be longer and include descriptive information .
That explanation would be very good without the middle sentence .
How does describing some function or purpose fit in into the idea of actually accomplishing the function or purpose ?
There is a difference between saying " this graph shows our organization " and actually telling what the organization is .
It would be best to write alt attribute first , before an image is chosen .
Such an approach could speed up Web publishing : you could publish information content without waiting for decorations and other images to be ready and processed .
You would first think how to say something in words , then consider what might be a useful graphic alternative to that .
Such an approach is discussed in a more general context in Augmentative authoring - a different look at " graceful degradation " in Web authoring .
In particular , it can be useful to think first how the page works in auditive presentation , then consider adding visual layout and possibly alternatives .
Such an approach could help the visually oriented too .
An author , after designing the page primarily for auditive presentation , would consider how it works as visible text , then move into thinking which parts might need visual alternatives or enhancements .
It would not be decisive what images he has at his disposal , or what graphics wait to get embedded into the page ; instead the question would be : what images does the text call for , either to be used as alternative to textual explanations that would better be presented graphically , or as illustrations that repeat or exemplify the textual content , or as eye - catchers or decorations ?
Authors often include images for the purpose of presenting some text in a particular style .
It could be a company logo , a heading , or a navigational button with text in it , for instance .
Note that you might consider using just styled text instead in some cases .
It is usually trivial to write a good alt text for such an image .
There are , however , some details to note :
You cannot use HTML tags within an alt attribute , just plain text .
However , entities can be used , e.g. é for the character é.
See notes on character set later .
within an attribute , just plain text .
However , entities can be used , e.g. for the character é.
See notes on character set later .
On the other hand , an img element may appear inside other markup .
It is allowed wherever text - level elements are allowed , e.g. within a H1 element ( indicating first - level heading ) .
Thus , you could write
< H1><img SRC=" logo.gif " ALT = " FooBar Company " ></ H1 >
and you probably should do so , if the image actually plays the role of an overall page heading ( e.g. , on FooBar 's main page ) .
The use of H1 markup would have no effect on the image itself , when the img element is shown as an image .
It may have an effect on the text appearance when the alt text is displayed instead ; unfortunately just a few browsers do the logical thing , showing the alt text in such a context in the presentation style used for headings .
In addition , heading markup often causes some top and bottom margins , i.e. extra vertical spacing .
You might wish to use CSS to suppress or reduce the spacing ( even down to using h1 { margin : 0 ;} ) .

An advertisement text might be reformulated so that it becomes obvious that it is an advertisement .
The visual appearance and positioning usually makes this evident , but in non-visual presentation the situation is different .
A simple indication might be suitable : alt = " Ad : New mudgets available ... " .

For an animated GIF image that contains first some text , then something else , the alt text should contain all the textual information .
GIF image that contains first some text , then something else , the text should contain all the textual information .
If the text in the image contains characters that cannot be represented reliably in the character set available in normal text – which is often the reason for using an image instead of text – ; you need to find a way to present the same information otherwise .
For example , a transliteration might be used , as in an old version of the main page of the European Union .
It it contained greetings in different languages , but due to character set problems , the Greek text was there as an image , with an alt text presenting the Greek word as transliterated into Latin alphabet : ( alt= " Kalosorisate " ) .
This made the Greek version look exceptional , deviating .
A later versíon had all the texts as images , with English text alt =
" The European Union On - Line( Greek ) " for the Greek text image .
Though illogical , such an approach might have been preferable for practical reasons , since the Greek letters would not have worked well .
( A transliteration might not be understandable enough to Greek - speaking people , and would confuse others especially since there are different transliteration and transcription schemes in use . )
Nowadays , the EU page is Unicode encoded ( UTF - 8 encoded ) , with all languages treated equally and with all links as text .
( The two - letter codes for languages are images , though , for no apparent reason – they could be presented as styled text . )

If the image is a link and the text in it is an instruction like " Click here " or " Mail me " , then the best approach is to remove or change the image or its use .
Links express relations ; verbs express actions ; hence a link should rarely contain an imperative verb .
Vague words like " Mail " or " Home " , on the other hand , are often inadequate too ; they do n't tell what the link really leads to .
But even if the text in an image is kept as poorly selected , the alternate text could be better .
In particular , it should not refer to clicking but identify the resource that the link points to .
An image of a mailbox , with or without words like " Mail me " in it , as a symbol for E - mail is questionable for several reasons .
If used as a so - called mailto link ( the common case ) , it should preferably have an alt text that specifies the address itself , since people who need alt attributes may well need to use a special E - mail program rather than an E - mail facility built into the browser .
So a reasonable way would be something like the following :
< a href = " mailto:jkorpela@cs.tut.ti " >< img src=" mailbox.gif " alt = " E- mail to author : jukkakk@gmail.com " border = " 0 " ></a>
like " Click here " or " Mail me " , then the best approach is to remove or change the image or its use .

So a reasonable way would be something like the following :
The alternate text need not be identical with the text in the image .
Sometimes the communicative purpose even requires some modifications .
For example , in a list of entries , an image with the word " New " in front of each new entry might work well ; it would be evident from the appearance that the image is a special symbol .
In speech or text - only presentation , things could be different : if alt = " New " were used , the word " New " might be misunderstood as part of the entry text .
Thus , alt = " ( new ) " or even alt = " New entry : " might work better .
If an image contains just text in some particular appearance , it is useful to ask whether it would be better to use just text instead of an image , using a style sheet to suggest some particular presentational properties , such as font face , size , and colors .
( For some properties , you could use HTML markup too , but that would be rather outdated . )
This would imply , among other things , that the characters would scale up ( or down ) according to the user 's wishes and needs .
As an example , using the CSS rule
strong { background : #ffc none ; color : # 060 ; font - weight : normal ; font - family : " Comic Sans MS " , Western , fantasy ; }
you could make all strong elements appear in a particular style .
Your current browser presents it this way :
Sample text
However , such an approach is not always adequate .
In particular , if the image is a company logo , containing the company 's name in a particular presentation style in which it has become a well - known symbol , then it would often be better to use the image .
For most people , the image would be more informative , more easily recognizable , more accessible .
In most situations where imageless browsing is used out of necessity ( rather than convenience ) , it does not disturb the user that an img element is used instead of text , provided that the img element has an adequate alt text of course .
On the other hand , if the image is just a particularly styled version of the company 's name , perhaps different from the style used last ( or next ) week , it would normally be better to use just text ( and CSS ) .
But where do you draw the border between the cases ?
Typically , a logo image cannot be satisfactorily approximated by using CSS styling features on text .
It could even be somewhat alienating to arrive at a page of a widely known company with a widely known logo and not see the logo there , in a browsing situation where images are generally viewed .
In general , there are situations where the appearance of some text is part of its very meaning .
For example , it is possible that a name by itself is not trademarked as a merely verbal expression but a particular visual apperance of a name is trademarked .
A more common example is an abbreviation presented as particularly styled visual symbol .
The visual appearance can be essential for distinguishing the symbol from other meanings of the abbreviation .
If you use such an image on a Web page , you should consider whether the alt text needs to contain a little more than the name or abbreviation only , such as an expansion of the abbreviation in parentheses .
If the image is a link , i.e. the only content in an < a href= ...>...</a> element , write an alt text that corresponds to the destination of the link .
Note that e.g.
HTML Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 do not use or endorse anything like a " Link to ... " prefix in such cases .
( Unfortunately , the first example of text equivalent there is " Go to table of content " instead of " Table of content " , but this is probably an oversight . )
Browsers are expected to indicate links as links .
For example , if a company logo is a link to the company 's main page , you could just put the company 's name there , optionally followed by " ( main page ) " .
See also : Links Want To Be Links , which explains why images as links are often a bad idea , even if you use adequate alt texts .
Consider also using an image and a text in parallel as a link .
Authors often wish to use colored or otherwise decorated bullets .
Although there are ways to do this in a style sheet , using the list - style - image property for a normal ul list , people still mostly use images .
This is relatively risk - free when done properly , including the user of an adequate alt , although it may cause some problems that a construct that is logically a list is not marked up as such .
There are different approaches to writing alt texts for bullet images :
use some character that resembles a bullet , such as " * " use some character that resembles a bullet , such as use a dash - like or other character that is commonly recognized as having a meaning similar to a bullet , such as " - " use a dash - like or other character that is commonly recognized as having a meaning similar to a bullet , such as use a word , with adequate punctuation added , such as " item : " or , perhaps better , words that reflect the progression of the sequence , like " First , " , " Second , " , and so on .
use a word , with adequate punctuation added , such asor , perhaps better , words that reflect the progression of the sequence , like , and so on .
The choice between such alternatives is not a big issue , and they are all superior to not using alt at all or using something pointless like alt = " small green bullet " .
But this case illustrates how the needs of speech presentation are sometimes different from what is optimal visual presentation without images .
The characters mentioned work rather well on text - only browsers , but how will they be pronounced ?
In particular , the use of the letter " o " is not a good idea , despite its bullet - like appearance , since it would be treated as a one - letter word or pronounced as the name of the letter in speech synthesis ; in English , this would probably mean expressing it the same way as the word " oh " .
Other bullet - like characters are n't optimal in speech synthesis either .
Authors sometimes use different bullets for different items in a list , so that the differences carry essential information .
For example , red bullets might indicate new entries in a list , in contrast with green bullets for other entries .
This would , however , violate the accessibility principle " do n't rely on color only " .
It is useful to indicate differences with colors , though hopefully with a contrast other than green versus red ( since red - green color - blindness is so common ) , but it should be accompanied with information that is accessible without the use of colors .
At the simplest , you could append the text " ( New ! ) " to each new item , and then the alt texts for the images could all be identical , or could reflect the order .
Similar considerations apply to punctuation images , used often between short links on one line .
This is bullet - like use in a sense , but with some specific features .
In text - only browsing , " | " or " * " would work rather well .
Hopefully the pronunciations ( presumably " vertical bar " and " asterisk " ) are tolerable .
Ascii graphics ( or Ascii art ) means a construct that presents a graphic using characters as building blocks .
For example , == > is a very simple Ascii graphic , intended to create the visual impression of a rightwards - pointing arrow .
The following example demonstrates how Ascii graphics could be used in a technical explanation :
--------------- ---------------- | 10.10.10.10 |--------L2TP-------|
Assigned by A | | Host A | --- --- | Host B | | 10.1.1.1 |--|NAT
|-----|NAT|--| 10.10.10.10 | ---------------
---
---
----------------
Although this would be " accessible " in the sense that it can be viewed even on simple text terminals , it would become rather incomprehensible when read aloud line by line .
Besides , in alt attributes there is no guarantee of having like breaks preserved .
The term " Ascii graphics " is somewhat a misnomer , since the characters are not always limited to the Ascii repertoire .
In a sense , even a single character could be regarded as an Ascii graphic , when it is used for its visual appearance only .
Someone might even argue that the use of a | ( vertical bar ) character as a separator between links is to be avoided , since it relies upon visual impression only .
In practice , however , we can assume that people using speech browsers will understand what " vertical bar " means ; in a suitable context , even " greater than " might be understood as something like an arrow .
But listening to " equals sign equals sign greater than sign " makes the presentation sound a bit odd .
Apart from simple cases like " == > " , there is rarely a serious temptation to write an alt text that constitutes an Ascii graphic .
One reason to this that Ascii graphics generally rely on the line structure being preserved as written fixed width ( monospace ) characters being used .
And small icon-like Ascii graphics like ~ ~~ ( symbolizing waves ) do n't cause much harm .
Nevertheless , they are best avoided .
It is almost always better to use words in alt texts instead .
However , if there is an Ascii graphic presentation for the content of an image , it might be a good idea to provide a separate , adequately annotated link to it .
A smiley ( emoticon ) like :-) is basically Ascii graphic too .
When images are used instead of such Ascii graphics , it is in a way natural to use the character string as alt text , e.g .
< img src=" smilingface.png " alt= " : -) " >
However , although alt texts have a large number of uses , it seems fair to regard their use in speech synthesis as decisive .
That 's were imageless presentation is needed , whereas , for example , the use of Lynx is mostly just a practical choice .
So the crucial question is : what would you say if you presented your document by reading it over the phone , for example ?
To make things clearer , you can imagine that the listener is blind .
It would mostly be irrelevant , and even irritating , to tell what symbol would be seen if he could see .
What you would say depends on the language and linguistic style in use , but alt = " ( I 'm just joking . ) " might be appropriate .
There are two main opinions about alt texts for logots .
Some people think that for a logo of FooBar , alt = " FooBar logo " is pointless and alt = " FooBar " ( corresponding to the the actual text in the logo ) should be used when needed .
And it would be needed only if the image is a link or if it is used in a heading - like manner or otherwise as identifying the content or context of the page .
Otherwise you could use alt= " " .
Others think that the " logo " concept is more or less universally understood in verbal presentation too and that alt = " Foobar logo " is OK : it is taken as roughly meaning ' this page belongs to Foobar , it has a Foobar stamp on it ' .
Thus , it would have a message of its own to convey .
As a special ( though common ) case , if all pages of a site contain a logo , which is a link to the main page , then it 's probably best to use either alt = " FooBar " or alt = " FooBar main page " for the logo image .
Even if you would otherwise use " FooBar logo " , the context would make the text too misleading .
If you hear " link to FooBar logo " , would n't it be natural to expect that it points to information about the logo , not FooBar main page ?
Note that on the main page itself , the logo should not be a link ; links that point to the page itself tend to cause confusion .
There was an interesting discussion , with the title Is " this - or - that logo " adequate in an ALT text ? , on the WebAIM mailing list , raised by my question there .
I still think the word " logo " should almost never appear in alt texts , even though people presented very good arguments in favor of the opposite view too .
It is not natural speech or writing to say " FooBar logo " when not discussing the logo itself ; the natural way would be something different , like " This is a FooBar page " or " This is a web page by FooBar . "
Besides , each page should have a descriptive < title > element , with content that is understandable in a global context , so it should often include something that identifies the page as being part of a specific site , such as " New products of FooBar " rather than just " New products " .
User agents typically present the content of the < title > element in some way that users are accustomed to , e.g. by reading it first .
Quite often the < title > text is more less similar to the content of the main heading .
This typically implies some reduncancy in speech synthesis , but it 's probably tolerable .
But why would we add more redundancy by including a text like " FooBar logo " ?
When discussing a logo or other visual symbol , it would be adequate to include the logo image with an alt text that explains the appearance of the symbol , such as " The logo of the University of Maine contains the head of a black bear . "
Compare this with item 1 in Creating Accessible Websites by that university ; it uses a noun phrase " The University of Maine Black Bear . " , apparently suggesting that such a text would be adequate for common logo usage !
There are images with messages of their own , like photographs , paintings , and graphs , which really say more than a thousand words .
For such images , the best practical approach is usually to write an alternative textual presentation of the information into a separate document , or into a separate part of a document , and link to it .
You might then use the alt attribute to specify a condensed textual alternative , or just refer to the fact that separate text is available .
There will be an example in the section Making text and image really alternative .
If the purpose is decoration , say no more
If an image is used for decoration only , alt= " " is adequate , no matter how beautiful or artistic the decoration is .
There 's no point in explaining it in words .
Empty alternate text is usually adequate for redundant images too , i.e. for a visual illustration of something that is fully explained in the text , even if the image by itself is content - rich .
Being redundant does n't mean being useless .
Such an image can be very useful to many people , but people who do not see the image have no use for an alternative text when the alternative text has already been given !
The only reason for using a non-empty alt text in such a case would be to help some people decide whether to download the image for viewing , or to switch to a browser that can show the image .
I would suggest that if you do so , use a verbal expression that clearly identifies the image as optional illustration , e.g. alt = " [ Illustration of the above : The main components of the widget " ] distinguishing it from the case where the image is essential .
For an essential image , say something
When an image is essential for communicating what the page tries to communicate , and not just decoration or a visualization of something already explained in the text , you should in principle always try to write an alt text that conveys verbally at least the most essential message of the image .
This would often take a lot of work , and long alt texts cause some problems .
So you might , as a compromise , write an alt text that tells what the picture is about , instead of acting as a replacement for it .
It might be useful to put it into brackets to indicate this .
Examples : alt= " [ my photo ] , alt= " [ a graphic presentation of the main components of the system ] .
Such texts are of little value in text - only browsing , but at least they can help people using graphic browsers with image autoload off , and such information could be used to decide whether e.g. a blind person should ask his friend look at the image and explain its content .
As regards to photos of people , they contain a lot of information but they are typically non-essential for most purposes , but it might still be relevant to know that a photo is available , for the purpose of recognizing a person , or for getting an idea ( often a wrong idea , but anyway ) of what a person is like .
And something like alt= " [ my photo ] should n't normally be disturbing .
As the example of photos shows , the distinction between " essential " and " non-essential " information in images is not always clear - cut . -
If a photo is used as the only information that refers to a person , e.g. when people who belong to a group are identified by their photos only , then the name of a person would normally be an adequate alt attribute value .
But such situations are rare , or should be ; normally the photo should be accompanied with text ( name etc. ) , and then alt= " " would usually be suitable , since the image is basically redundant .
There are images that have real content but cannot be expressed verbally in any satisfactory way , such as works of art when they are part of the subject matter , rather than decorations .
Quite often any attempt to write a textual alternative , or even a description , is just someone 's subjective view .
It often belongs to the the essence of visual art that it can be experienced and interpreted in different ways Could you imagine writing a textual alternative to Mona Lisa ?
I mean a real alternative that conveys the same message , not a description of the theme , style , colors , etc .
We should be honest about material that is inherently graphic , just as we should n't think that any text could really be an alternative to a symphony , or that you could paint a visual equivalent of a poem .
As part of such honesty , a page that is of fundamentally graphic nature should say that at the very start of a page .
Quite often it might be sufficient to use descriptive title and h1 elements ( with a text like " Photos from our trip to ... " ) .
Thus , the approach of using description - like alt texts is usually the only feasible solution for most collections of graphics , or any graphic presented as content , such as a painting .
Typically , those texts would be similar to image captions but shorter .
Even if the images have captions e.g. below each image , as they normally should , alt should be included ; they may help e.g. people who need access the page using a text - only browser that is capable of launching an external application to show images , upon request for a specific image .
The function of an image is decisive
Sometimes it is difficult to draw a border between decorative images and essentially graphic content .
The image itself is not decisive but its intended function .
On a page about Louvre , you might use Mona Lisa as illustration .
It would be a visual example rather than an arbitrary decoration , but I think alt= " " would still be appropriate .
On the other hand , if the image is a link to page that tells about the painting , then alt = " Mona Lisa " would be suitable ; you would simply use the text that you would use as link text if the image were not available to you .
If a page is about Mona Lisa itself , and especially if your text refers to features and details of the painting , then the image is essential and you should use e.g. alt = " [ Mona Lisa , the painting ] " .
Then the message , to people who do not see the image , is that there is some essential graphic content that they miss , and the message also briefly names the content .
This may help people to decide what to do , if they have a chance .
Some of them may have an opportunity to view the image later , or they might ask someone describe the image for them .
Some essentially graphic information could even be accessed using a haptic mouse or in some other non-visual way .
Using brackets to distinguish descriptions from replacements
I have proposed that an alt text be enclosed in square brackets , as above , if the text is descriptive of the image rather than an adequately replacement for it .
This is intended to convey the message that there is something special about the text , something that deviates from normal flow of text .
Whether this really works , and whether it may cause some confusion , is debatable .
But it seems to me that there are no strong opinions against the practice .
For example , if an image contains a pie chart , the alt text could say
" [ Pie chart of our sales in 2002 ] "
or something like that .
Such a text is not a replacement for the image ; it does not communicate in words what the image communicates graphically .
Hence , the use of brackets might be useful for distinguishing such texts from genuine alt texts like
" Our sales in 2002 were dominantly ( 65 % ) Widgets and just 35 % Gadgets . "
The following simple example , from a hypothetical business document , illustrates a genuine text alternative to an image .
In a non-visual presentation , the user might not even know that the text is an alternative text and not normal content .
In a visual presentation , the user probably does n't even see that there is a textual alternative .
It is often obvious from the alt text itself whether it is a real replacement , a description , or something pointless .
But some convention could help in getting a quick clue .
If you start with an alt text that is a description , later write a replacement text , you could keep the description text too , making it ( without the brackets ) the value of a title attribute .
Example :
< img src=" pie.png " alt = " Sales in 2002 : Widgets 65 % , Gadgets 33 % , Mudgets 1 % , Other 1 % " title =
" Pie chart of our sales in 2002 " >
Images that say more than a thousand words would usually not be links , except in contexts like a photo gallery where they might be thumbnails .
If there would be some need to make the pie chart image a link , it 's probably better to use a separate textual link instead .
The link might appear as a caption for the image .
In such a case , if the link points to a page containing the content of the chart in text format ( perhaps in a table ) , you could use alt= " " for the image , since a textual replacement would be unnecessary and even undesirable .
We can distinguish three types of relationships between the information content of an image and an alt text :
text that just describes the image ; text that communicates verbally the same thing as the image ; alt text that partially communicates the same thing as the image , hopefully the most important information .
For example , it might not be feasible and useful for a pie chart alt text to present all the information , down to the items with fractions of percentage .
Would n't it be better to say part of the information in the alternate text , instead of resorting to a mere description like [ Our sales in 2002 ( pie chart ) ] ?
This is a difficult question .
Consider the following idea :
If the picture illustrates a concept , describe the concept , such as " College students in the 1980 's wore their backpacks over one shoulder . "
The example apparently relates to an assumed photo of college students in the 1980's .
If the only purpose for including the photo is to convey the message about that particular feature of behavior , then the text would indeed be a suitable alt text .
The question then arises whether that text should always appear on the page , as image caption , since otherwise the message might easily be missed .
I would say that normally you should either write alternate text that carries the entire message of the image or write a mere description , hopefully adding some way to access some text that presents the entire message .
Intermediate solutions have the problem of giving wrong information .
Some of the omitted details might really matter .
But the alternate text should carry the message that the image is supposed to carry , not all the details that are irrelevant to the message itself .
Some people have even taken the trouble of explaining the colors used in a pie chart , in addition to ( or maybe instead of ! ) the information content of the chart .
Of course , an alternate text should not describe such features of visual presentation that could be modified without affecting the message .
As regards to omitting information , I 'd give the following rule of thumb :
Omit things that you would edit away from the image too if you had time for that .
Do not omit things just because they are less important , if they are still important enough that you would n't want to remove them from the image .
In some cases , you might decide to write an alt that contains part of the information content , and ends with a hint like " ... " at its end , when the element is accompanied with some reference ( preferably , an explicit link ) to more information .
Alternatively , you could use a description text and add remark that expresses some of the content , such as [ Our sales my month in 2002 ( showing small increases ) ] .

Special problems arise when there is a caption below an image or , less commonly , above it or on either side of it .
A caption is a piece of text , typically less than a line , that names an image , identifies it ( e.g. , " Picture 42 " ) , describes its content , or comments on it , or performs several of these functions .
There is no specific HTML markup for associating an image with its caption , and several markup and styling techniques are used for captions so that they appear visually associated with images .
See Image captions on Web pages - HTML and CSS techniques .
In particular , if the image has the empty string as its alt text , a user who does not see the image at all ( and might not even know about the existence of an image ) would still observe the caption text .
For example , the sample image above is a photo with the person 's name below it .
Quite often , it would be appropriate to use alt= " " for the photo if it had no caption .
It would be just an illustration , such as the photo of the author of the document .
Usually there is no point in trying to write a text that expresses the essential content of the image .
You either see the image , or you do n't and you have to proceed without the information in it .
The caption changes this .
A user who suddenly hears or sees a person 's name inside some flow of text may wonder what is going on .
If the caption text is something more elaborated , like a caption for a news photo , it may or may not work well without the image and without any indication of an image .
Sometimes the caption even explicitly refers to something in the image .
Thus , you may need to write some concise alt text that tries to remove the mystery caused by a caption appearing " out of the blue " .
For an image with caption ,
If the image is decorative or would for other reasons have alt= " " if it had no caption , make it so if the caption text makes sense if read as an independent piece of text .
For example , " Ministers X and Y met in Syldavia . "
if it had no caption , make it so if the caption text makes sense if read as an independent piece of text .
For example , " Ministers X and Y met in Syldavia . "
Otherwise for an image that would have alt= " " as standalone , write a short alt text that indicates the presence of an image .
Example : alt= " ( photo of meeting ) " when the caption text is " Ministers X ( on the left ) and Y met in Syldavia " .
as standalone , write a short text that indicates the presence of an image .
Example : when the caption text is " Ministers X ( on the left ) and Y met in Syldavia " .
If the image is essential and needs a lengthy textual alternative , use such an indicative alt and consider making the caption a link to the explanation , as explained in the next section .
In the second or third case , you might also consider using alt= " " if you make the caption text start with a " text identifier " .
By this we mean an expression like " Picture 1 : " or " Figure 42 . "
We might expect that it that makes it clear that the text that follows is a caption for some image .
However , this might look odd e.g. when used for photos on a news page .
It might be quite suitable for an article or essay .
The alt attribute is in many ways a primitive tool .
It is limited to plain text , it can not be very long for practical reasons , and it prescribes that the textual alternative is a secondary option .
Note that even the object element , which is intended to be a more flexible generalization of the img element but is currently poorly supported for such purposes , still effectively makes the image primary and the text secondary alternative .
A more balanced approach is to treat graphic and text as parallel alternatives , when their information content is the same .
It could then be the user 's business to decide whether he finds , in a particular case , one or the other more suitable , or whether he wants to " consume " both of them for understanding the message .
For content - rich images that need long textual alternatives , the simple and robust approach is to write that alternative somewhere in HTML and link to it .
Use a normal link near the image so that it is reasonably clear what the link refers to .
This also lets you use structuring markup , like paragraph division , lists , and even tables .
As a side effect , a user who can access the image could still use the text too .
If you can write a good textual alternative to a content - rich image , why would n't you make it available even when the image is seen ?
Some people are verbally oriented , or would otherwise like to read the text as well , thereby perhaps better understanding the image .
There is no HTML element for saying " this text and this image say the same thing " .
But you can still express the idea in simple way .
Simplest of all , in a sense , you could have just two annotated links , one pointing to a text document , one pointing to an image .
Or even simpler in a sense , you could embed both , e.g. an image ( with alt= " " ) and a textual alternative side by side ; but then you should make a reasonable effort of making it clear that they have the same information , since this is often far from obvious in visual presentation .
Alternatively , you could embed one of them and link to the other , thereby giving preference to the embedded one .
Usually this means including the image and using a link for the textual alternative .
It 's really a matter of judgement and being innovative in finding a way to do this smoothly .
As an example , the previous pie chart example could be modified so that the chart caption is not part of the image ( which is a good idea anyway ) and made to a link to an HTML document containing the information as a table .
Naturally , it could be plain text or non-tabular HTML as well .
You could then use alt= " " for the image or , if desired , you could keep the plain text explanation in the alt attribute , as follows :
In this case , it is actually easy to write an alt attribute that contains exactly the same information as the image , though presented in a very different format .
In the general case , a graph or other image might contain more details than one can ( or need ) to put into an alt attribute .
The example uses a two - cell table , with the first cell containing the caption ( title ) of the image .
You might alternatively use a single - cell table , putting the caption into a caption element .
Or you might decide not to make the caption a link but include a link to the textual alternative into the text preceding the image , e.g .
" The following chart shows our sales in 2002 " .
In that case , the image should have a description - like alt attribute , since the reference to the image in the text could cause confusion if you use alt= " " .
The approach is suitable for org charts , too , though they often need restructuring to avoid excessive amount of information in one chart .
There is more information on this on the page Accessible org charts on web pages .
The approach suggested above , using an explicit link to a textual alternative , avoids the problems with longdesc attributes and so - called [ D ] links .
The longdesc attribute is supported to a very limited extent in browsers .
Even people using browsers that support it might not be aware of this feature , or of the availability of a " long description " for a particular image .
Note that the name of longdesc is misleading too : it suggests a description of image , not an alternative .
If an image really needs a description , short or long , this should be considered as something rather separate from the question of providing a textual alternative .
A description proper would be most useful to people who actually see the image , or at least could see later .
Thus , for example , if you think that the logo of your company needs to be explained verbally , you should simply add the description into a suitable place on your Web site , such as an " About us " section .
There is even confusion about the need for an alt attribute when a longdesc attribute is used .
The formulation of the WAI guidelines themself have part of the guilt .
The wording " ( e.g. , via ' alt ' , ' longdesc ' , or in element content ) " actually seems to suggest that alt and longdesc are alternative ways of satisfying the requirement !
The [ D ] link construct has often been proposed in various discussions and tutorials .
It has however been deprecated in the WAI guidelines , though not in a very convincing way : " in favor of the longdesc attribute " .
A better argument is that you can use normal links instead .
Besides , in addition to being visually somewhat disturbing , a string like [ D ] has no intuitively obvious meaning , and it violates the important rule of using different link texts for different destinations .
Naturally you can use longdesc in addition to the method I have proposed here .
Thatt would be just a matter of adding an attribute referring to a long textual alternative , in addition to an explicit link to it .
Some types of links often work best if the link text is accompanied with an image .
Instead of using two links pointing to the same destination , it is best to make them one link , using markup like the following :
< a href= " address " > < img src= " imagefile " alt= " " > linktext </a>
An important reason for using a single link instead of two links is that when the user tabs from one link to another , redundant links make the use less convenient .
Moreover , if there are two links , the question easily arises whether they really point to the same resources .
Note that the alt attribute should have an empty value , since the image is " redundant " .
You might wish to tune the visual appearance of the construct using presentational HTML attributes , or CSS , or both .
For example , the following link has the attributes align = " middle " border= " 0 " in the img tag to make the image and the text appear " in line " and to suppress a border ( which most browsers use around an image link by default ) :
You might alternatively put the image outside the < a > element , i.e. not part of the link .
But some people have the habit of clicking on images in the hope that they might be links , and why should we disappoint them ?
If an image is intended to act as a divider between major parts of a document , as a decorative counterpart of the hr element , then a visually adequate alt text could be a sequence of hyphens ( - ) , underline characters ( _ ) or macrons ( ¯ ) , or perhaps some other characters like asterisks ( * ) .
Example :
< p align = " center " >< img src=" hr.gif " alt= "------------"></p>
But in speech presentation , the result could be rather bad ( such as " hyphen hyphen hyphen . .. " ) .
A descriptive text like alt =" horizontal rule " is n't much better .
If we consider what we would say in speech , then alt = " Change of topic . " might be natural .
Or you might make it more specific , indicating which part ends or which part will follow , or both .
Examples : alt = " End of introduction . " , alt = " End of page content proper .
Contact information follows . " .
But if headings are used properly to indicate document structure , we might regard divider rules as an additional visual hint only , and use alt= " " .
For a different approach to " decorative horizontal rules " , see CSS1 and the Decorative HR by Alan Flavell .
The method discussed there does not use an img element at all but an hr element together with a style sheet which suggests a presentation style using an author - supplied image .
Thus it naturally uses a normal horizontal rule ( the default rendering of hr on a browser ) as a fallback when the browser does not apply the author 's style sheet .
( When the style sheet is applied but images are not displayed , there might be some problems , though . )
In the special case where you have used an image just to get a colored horizontal rule , you might consider yet another approach :
Use a style sheet to suggest a bottom border ( of the desired color ) for a block - level construct preceding the point where the rule is to appear ( or a top border for a construct after it ) .
For example , to use such rules between major sections of a document , use markup like
< div class=" section " > the section , typically starting with its heading < hr title = " New section " ></div >
for each of the sections except the last one ( unless you want a rule after it too ) , and a style sheet like the following : div.section { border : solid 0 #090 ; width : 100 % ; border - bottom - width : 0.2em ; padding - bottom : 0.5 em ; margin - bottom : 0.5em ; } div.section hr { display : none ; } Note that when the style sheet is not applied , this degrades to a presentation with a default appearance of an < hr > element .
When the style is applied , a dark green rule which is 0.2 em units ( a fifth of the font size ) thick appears instead .
The style sheet is a bit tricky , especially to circumvent some Netscape 4 bugs , cf. to similar tricks for using borders around individual cells in tables .
When writing in a language that has various accented letters ( as in École ) , write them correctly , not omitting the accent .
Unfortunately authors often write alt texts using incorrect spelling , e.g. substituting " a " for " ä " .
There is probably some superstition that says that accented letters should not be used in alt attributes , or attributes in general .
There are many problems with using characters in HTML , but they mostly do not particularly relate to attributes .
If you can use a character in the normal text of a page , you can use it in attribute values as well .
And , in particular , the ISO Latin 1 ( ISO - 8859 - 1 ) repertoire works very well in HTML .
Thus , you can use e.g. the letter É ( either entering it as such , or using the entity reference É ) in attribute values as well as elsewhere .
There is one important exception though .
On Windows 95 and Windows 98 , IE fails to show the so - called Windows special characters like dashes and “ smart ” quotes properly when used in alt attributes , or when used in an attribute that will be displayed as a tooltip .
Instead , the browser displays a thick vertical bar in place of those characters .
It is usually easy to avoid them in attribute values , by using various surrogates like Ascii hyphens ( -) and Ascii quotation marks ( " ) .
You should write alt texts with the same care as normal text , or preferably with more care , since spelling errors cause more problems in speech synthesis than in reading on screen .
This includes the correct use of characters as described above .
It is best to use normal prose in alt texts , instead of " telegram style " .
Thus , our original pie chart example was a bit questionable .
The text " Sales in 2002 : Widgets 65 % , Gadgets 33 % , Mudgets 1 % , Other 1 % " does n't look very good , and does n't sound very good .
If you would present the information in words only , you would probably write a short paragraph like the following : " In 2000 , our sales consisted mainly of widgets , 65 % , and gadgets , 33 % .
Mudgets made only 1 % of the total .
The rest , 1 % , were divided between miscellaneous products . "
But practical limitations on the length of alt texts often make compact , somewhat unnatural language the lesser of evils .
Since use in speech synthesis is one of the key reasons to using alt texts , they should be written so that work in auditive presentation .
In particular , abbreviations should be avoided , unless they are supposed to be read letter by letter .
Similarly , sentences should end with a full stop ( period ) , since this can help the user by causing significant pauses where needed .
Even isolated words and phrases may work better with pauses after them .
In particular , you should expand abbreviations if they would be best read aloud as expanded .
For example , the abbreviation " WWW " is seldom pronounced as an abbreviation .
Hence , your alt text should contain " the World Wide Web " rather than " WWW " .
In this case , the full form is actually shorter than the abbreviation in speech .
But even if the full form is considerably longer , it should be used if it is actually better to speak it out .
This does not mean that verbosity is a virtue .
As in all use of words , the rule is : as short as possible , but not shorter .
In speech synthesis , it is important whether the textual context makes it sufficiently clear what words mean .
Quite often a word is very understandable when you look at it in its context , but only because you 're looking at the context , which gives you a picture of the page as a who .e
In auditive presentation , the context is primarily the textual content before the word , with main emphasis on what was right before it .
In all use of words , but especially in short isolated expressions ( as in a set of navigational links ) , there 's the problem of homonyms in pronunciation : that words spelled differently can get pronounced the same ( or almost the same ) , for example " I " and " eye " .
This is rather common in English , and it implies that spoken words are often more ambiguous than written words .
" Home " is relatively safe ( but its equivalents in other languages might not ) , but think about e.g. the word " sellers " in isolation .
When someone hears it , how does he know whether it is " sellers " or " cellars " ?
If there are " buyers " and " sellers " in succession , the context probably removes the ambiguity .
But quite often we see lists of navigational buttons with texts that have no obvious connection with each other and that might be understood only by looking at the page as a whole .
According to WAI guidelines , an author should indicate the language of each element on the page .
This can be done using the HTML attribute lang , or the XML attribute xml:lang , or both .
It suffices to set such an attribute for the document as a whole , in the < html > tag , and , when needed , for each element that is in a language different from the main language or , more exactly , different from the language of its enclosing element .
Thus , if your document is in one language only , then you have an easy task .
Such an attribute sets the language of all attributes too .
For example , if your document is in English but you have some reason for using another language in an alt attribute , you can do something like the following :
< img src=" dinlogo.png " lang = " de " alt = " Deutsches Institut für Normung ( DIN ) " >
This would indicate that the language of the alt text is German , and this information can be used by a speech generator to pronounce it correctly , and by other software .
For example , a browser might tell the user , upon request , the language of each page element , when language markup has been used by the author .
There is no useful way to indicate language changes within an alt attribute , or any attribute , since attribute values are plain text .
You can not use any markup inside them .
Thus , there is no good solution if you would like to use a bilingual attribute like
alt = " Deutsches Institut für Normung ( DIN ) - German Institute for Standardization " .
However , you might use a trick of using an additional dummy image and specify the second part of the alternate text as the alt attribute for that image :
< img src=" dinlogo.png " lang = " de " alt = " Deutsches Institut für Normung ( DIN ) " >< img src=" transp.gif " lang= " en " alt= "- German Institute for Standardization " >
where transp.gif refers to a single - pixel transparent GIF image , which has effectively no impact on visual appearance .
Make sure that there is no space or line break between the img elements , to avoid undesired visual effects .
In theory , Unicode has " language tag " characters that can be used in plain text .
Their use is however strongly discouraged by Unicode except in special cases .
More importantly in practice , they hardly have any support in any browser , for accessibility purposes or otherwise .
Especially for small images , such as navigational icons and spacers , it is best to omit the WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes .
The reason is that many graphic browsers reserve space according to them even when images are off ; and this implies that the alt texts often do n't fit but are brutally truncated , or even do n't appear at all , if the dimensions are small .
To make things worse , browsers may include an icon of a broken image , such as a red × symbol , into the area , so that there 's even less room for the text .
On Internet Explorer , there is a browser configuration setting " Always expand ALT text for images " ( Tools > Internet options > Advanced ) .
This oddly named option makes the browser ignore WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes when the browser has been configured not to display images , so that alt texts will not be truncated .
Users should check that this option has been selected , but authors should n't rely on such things .
Besides , the setting does not affect situations where the image is not displayed ( and the alt text is used instead ) for any other reason than the browser configuration setting of not displaying images .
Thus , for example , if the browser does not get the image due to network congestion , the text is forced into the dimensions given .
On the other hand , the WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes speed up the rendering of a page , since a browser can allocate space for the image before getting the actual image data .
So if the alt text is short as compared with the size of the image , use those attributes ( and make sure they present the true size of the image in pixels ) .
Problems in WebKit - based browsers
Browsers based on WebKit , such as Chrome and Safari , have a longstanding bug that often suppresses alt texts .
They show the text only if both of the following conditions are met :
The dimensions of the image have been specified in HTML attributes or in CSS .
The alt text fits on one line within those dimensions .
This is usually not a problem if the text is short as compared with the width of the image .
In that case , it suffices to specify the width and height attributes .
In other cases , there is no good solution ; this is a browser bug that authors just cannot deal with .
Notice that according to the HTML 4.0 specification , the alt attribute is required for every img element .
Consequently , a validator ( like the WDG validator ) will report an error if some img element lacks an alt attribute if you validate against an HTML 4.0 doctype .
This is useful for checking whether you have accidentally omitted such an attribute .
A validator however can only check the presence of an alt attribute , not its meaningfulness .
It is thus incorrect to claim conformance to the accessibility guideline on text equivalents just because you have alt attribute for each image ; the guideline is about text equivalents , not just any association with some text .
We cannot automatically check the adequacy of alternative texts , but some programs might try to detect potentially problematic cases .
For example , there are some types of alt texts , like " bloop.gif ( 347 bytes ) " , that are often generated by various programs and do n't do the job that alt texts should .
Some checkers might recognize them and warn about them .
It depends on their logic , and on the type of checking attempted , how often you get false alarms .
Various accessibility checkers , such as Bobby and A - Prompt , verify that all img elements have alt attributes , but they may also warn about things that the authors of those programs regarded as potential problems .
For example , they might warn about alt texts that exceed some length limit , in characters or in words .
As we will discuss shortly , long texts could indeed be a problem , but checkers may report the problems and suggest solutions in a misleading way .
For more information , refer to Notes on some tools for checking and improving Web page accessibility .
There is also an easy to use online service , Wave , that checks a page and flags , in addition to missing alt attributes , blank and " suspicious " alt attributes .
As we have noted , a blank alt text is often quite adequate .
Admittedly it could also be unintentional or based on a misunderstanding .
Various specifications and guides sometimes refer to alt texts as " short alternatives " ( or even " short descriptions " ) .
Although there are serious practical reasons to keep them short , an alt text could be very long , in principle , when the adequate textual alternative needs to be an entire paragraph or more .
There is no prohibition against browsers splitting the display of an alt text over several lines when needed , and no requirement on them doing that either .
And there 's no way to force or to prevent line breaks in the presentation of alt texts .
The practical conclusion is an alt texts should be 50 characters or shorter , if feasible .
By HTML specifications , a newline is equivalent to a space in HTML source .
Thus , e.g .
alt = " Just an
example "
is by the specifications equivalent to
alt =" Just an example "
Your browser presents them as follows ( these are a img elements with those alt attributes and with a src attribute that does not refer to anything ) :
Remember that if the presentations are different , it is an error .
No HTML markup is recognized within an attribute value , so you cannot include a line break into alt text using the < br > tag .
Entity references and numeric character references like are recognized there , but that wo n't help in this issue - a newline is a newline , no matter how it is presented , and still equivalent to a space .
In fact such references just cause extra problems as compared with normal linebreaks .
For example , on Opera may cause the rest of the text to be ignored !
Browser behavior varies :
If the alt text does not contain linebreaks , then most browsers ( e.g. Netscape 4 and IE 5 ) present it as one line .
This is not incorrect but often very annoying if the text is long , since the user has to scroll horizontally to read the whole text , or ( depending on browser ) the text line spans across the screen , and if it is very long , the tail is totally inaccessible .
Opera behaves much better : it presents the text in a box which adapts to the available horizontal space with word wrapping .
That is , it acts as it normally does when displaying document content - it divides the text into words , separated by spaces or , equivalently , newlines , and formats the text to fit the screen area allocated .
As a peculiarity , Opera centers each line horizontally .
Lynx effectively handles an img element as if it were replaced by the value of the alt attribute , so it too formats the text normally , with line wrapping .
Mozilla seems to have reached the same functionality .

If the alt text contains linebreaks , e.g .
alt = " This is one line
and this is another one . "
then Netscape 4 incorrectly ignores the linebreaks , treating our example similarly to alt =
" This is one lineand this is another one . "
We can overcome this problem by putting a space at the end of a line if the attribute value continues on the next line .
Unfortunately Mozilla 1.0 seems to mistreat linebreaks even more badly , introducing some spurious characters into the display .
IE incorrectly ( but somewhat conveniently ) breaks a line in the display of the alt text when there is a newline in HTML source .
( This is incorrect because it violates the above - mentioned requirement about newlines being equivalent to spaces . )
Opera correctly treats linebreak as equivalent to space .
text , e.g. then
In principle , XML rules ( which apply to XHTML ) change the way that character references such as should be handled .
Section Attribute - Value Normalization in the XML specification says :
Note that if the unnormalized attribute value contains a character reference to a white space character other than space ( #x20 ) , the normalized value contains the referenced character itself ( #xD , # xA or # x9 ) .
This contrasts with the case where the unnormalized value contains a white space character ( not a reference ) , which is replaced with a space character ( #x20 ) in the normalized value - -
Thus , in principle , in XHTML alt = " hello world " should be taken so that the alt attribute value contains an actual newline character .
The number 10 corresponds to the Ascii control code line feed ( LF ) .
But browser support corresponding to that specification is probably very limited , if not nonexistent .
If the text is very long , so that it would it occupies vertical space more than ( roughly ) the height of the browser window , it flashes annoyingly ( appears and disappears with a frequency shorter than a second ) , so that it is virtually impossible to read , on some browsers .
The practical conclusion is that you should try to make the alt text short so that it does not matter too much if it is presented as a single line .
If it really needs to be long , use newlines in the attribute value , since that somewhat increases the odds of getting a tolerable presentation , but put a space before each newline to circumvent the Netscape bug .
See below for notes on dividing the text into lines .
If the adequate textual replacement for an image would consists of several paragraphs of text , it is usually best to put it into a separate file and include a link to it near the image .
See section
When an image says more than a thousand words above .
Some guides and checkers say that empty alt texts should not be used .
However , empty alt texts are perfectly valid and correct when the appropriate textual alternative to an image is an empty string .
As the so - called Section 508 rules say about " Text Tags " :
Web page authors often utilize transparent graphics for spacing .
Adding a text description to these elements will produce unnecessary clutter for users of screen readers .
For such graphics , an empty ALT attribute is useful .
Example of source code : < IMG src=" transparent.gif " alt= " " >
Note : What Section 508 rules say about using alt texts is otherwise not quite correct .
In fact , they are rather confusing .
But this part is correct .
In principle , alt= " " and alt= " " say different things , since an empty string ( consisting of no characters ) is not the same as a string consisting of one space character .
In practice , they mostly have the same effect .
Some browsers ( and some checkers ) have problems with either of them , and therefore some people have favored the one about which they have not heard bad information ( or rumors ) .
The constructive approach is to use the logical alternative , which is almost always the empty string alt= " " , since you normally want the browser act as if the img element were entirely absent ( in situations where the image is not displayed ) .
For a spacer image , however , alt= " " is sometimes preferable .
If a transparent image is used between words to create some fixed - width spacing , then alt= " " causes some space to appear when the image is not displayed .
You might even use a sequence of no - break spaces , e.g. alt= " " , in an attempt to create more than a normal inter -word space .
On the other hand , spacer images themselves are deprecated .
If you intend to use them to create some tabular look , use real HTML tables instead .
If you just wish to save some spacing for esthetic reasons , e.g. to present modern poetry , style sheets should be used .
Sometimes an author divides an image into parts , or slices , and then tries to put it together again :
<img ...>< img ...>...< img ...>
I will assume that such elements constitute something that is logically one image .
The considerations below wo n’t apply of the parts are used as invididual images , e.g. by making them links ; in that case , each should have an alt attribute that corresponds to the purpose and use of that particular image .
Slicing is usually a bad idea .
But if an image has been sliced , then it is normally best to write its textual equivalent into the alt attribute of the first img element and use alt= " " for the rest :
<img ... alt= " text " >< img ... alt= " " >...< img ... alt= " " >
The key point is that one alt attribute contains the alternate text and others have empty value .
Putting the text into the first attribute is just the the most obvious way .
It is futile to try to divide the text into different alt attributes even if the slicing somehow corresponds to parts of the image .
Speech browsers have best odds in reading the text well if it is in one attribute .
As an exception , if the parts of the image contain texts in different languages , then you should divide the alternate text between different img elements .
This is discussed in section The language (s ) in alt texts .
There is a peculiar behavior in some popular browsers which is sometimes presented as an argument against using the alt attribute : Browsers like Netscape 4 and IE 5 show the value of an alt attribute as a " tooltip " when the cursor is moved over an image .
( You can probably see such a behavior by moving the cursor over the image on the right . )
Some people regard this as annoying .
Another view on it is that it gives users the option of seeing the textual alternative even if they are looking at the image itself .
The image might be obscure , or its message might be hard to understand , it might contain some text in a font size that is unreadable to the user , etc .
In section Making text and image really alternative we discussed one approach to such problems .
Well , the tooltip effect can be annoying , if you have adopted the habit of moving the cursor around , to see which images are actually links .
Such habits have been created by authors who have taken some extra effort to prevent image links from looking like links , i.e. to prevent browsers from drawing a colored rectangle around image links .
( Admittedly such rectangles can be somewhat unesthetic , but they are the way that popular browsers use as the only way of visually indicating an image as a link . )
And some authors have taken the tooltip effect as the " real meaning " of the alt attribute , and they might then use even attributes like alt =
" Click me ! " , which are very irritating to people who see only the alt text ( and might lack any device to click with , for that matter ) .
So in this area , we have cumulative , cascading , escalating cluelessness by many browser vendors and by many authors .
Anyway , the strong arguments for using alt attributes ( explained below ) more than outweigh the minor unesthetic effect of the " tooltips " .
The " tooltip " effect per se can be useful .
In particular , people using graphic browsers without image autoload could greatly benefit from seeing a description of an image in addition to seeing its textual replacement .
But it 's not the alt attribute that should be used for it .
It 's the title attribute which is designed to be used as an " advisory title " .
Luckily , IE 4 and newer already use it that way .
This means that for an img element , IE uses title as the " tooltip " , though it still uses alt that way , if there is no title attribute .
If you are using IE 4 or newer , you can probably see how the image on the right is treated ; it has alt and title attributes which are quite different from each other .
In " Standards " mode as opposite to Quirks mode , IE 8 does not use the alt attribute for tooltip effects at all , even in the absence of a title attribute .
The same applies to Firefox irrespectively of mode .
Consequently , you can use the title attribute in an img tag in addition to the alt attribute , if you think that the alt value does not work nicely as a " tooltip " .
The text should be relatively short , since browsers typically display it for a few seconds only .
You can write title= " " to suggest suppression of any tooltip behavior .
If the image is a link , then consider the extra problem created by IE 4 + : an alt or a title attribute for the img element is used as a " tooltip " even if the surrounding A HREF element has a title attribute !
Since omitting alt would be unexcusable , the best workaround is to write the title attribute for the img element so that it works as an advisory title for the link too .
In modern browsers , the problem still exists in the sense that the title attribute for the inner img has precedence over the title attribute for the outer A HREF , but that 's a different issue .
In the presentation of tooltips , there are problems with long texts which are partly similar to problems in presenting alt texts in their basic purpose , i.e. as replacements for images .
There is an important practical distinction however : IE displays the tooltip text as divided into lines , with a maximal line length of 50 characters ( on IE 4.0 on WinNT at least ) .
It also breaks a line when there is a linebreak in the HTML source .
This happens on IE irrespectively of where it takes the tooltip text from ( title attribute or alt attribute ) .
Thus , if the length of the title text or , in the absence of that attribute , the length of the alt text exceeds 50 characters , divide the value into lines of at most 50 characters , counting the trailing space too .
The ampersand ( & ) character causes problems on some browsers on some platforms when it occurs in an alt text and a browser displays that text as a " tooltip " .
Some browsers running on Windows systems use display routines in which the ampersand has a special control effect .
This means that an alt text containing , say , " A& M " gets displayed as " A M " with the M underlined .
It 's a browser bug , limited to some browsers on some platforms , in a browser function that should n't exist , but it occurs frequently enough to justify the rule : Avoid using the ampersand character in alt attributes .
If you can reasonably replace the ampersand by the word " and " or the character " + " or something like that , do so .
But if the ampersand really needs to be there , e.g. because it is part of a trademark - like expression , you have a tough decision .
Tentatively , I posted the following message to the Usenet discussion group comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html:
Subject : ALT attributes considered harmful to accessibility OK , now that I have your attention , I can tell that it's not the ALT attributes themselves that are harmful but the recommendations to use them .
And naturally everyone has to use an ALT attribute for every img element , every area element , and every input type = " image " .
But my point is that this is of no use , or is of worse than no use , if the attribute value is not adequate .
And in reality , most ALT attributes on Web pages are useless , or worse than useless .
I 'm afraid that e.g. the howlers discussed in Alan Flavell 's Use of ALT texts in IMGs are rather typical of the actual use , not just shocking examples .
( Maybe not quite so if you count only those actually written by human beings .
But attributes like alt =" mksdy.gif ( 5379 bytes ) " are a reality too , and they fully satisfy the " validation " criteria of many accessibility checkers . )
An element 's ALT attribute should not be decided by considering the element in isolation .
( But such considerations are what people actually make , if they react to recommendations to use ALT for all elements . )
Rather , an author should think how he would write the page if images ( or a particular image ) are not available .
In fact it is best if he actually does just that , writes the page first without images !
( With existing pages , the situation is different of course - it has to be a thought experiment . )
Then the addition of images is to be considered so that the page keeps working in no images mode too .
Sometimes an image replaces some text .
Here 's where we get to using ALT : if the text is quite short and contains no markup , just turn it into an ALT attribute value .
Otherwise e.g. move the text to a separate page and try and find a nice way to refer to it with a link near the image , e.g. in an image 's caption text - and aim at being able to use ALT= " " without preventing access to any information .
Naturally , ALT= " " is to be used to purely decorative images .
And finally , there are images that have content that cannot be described in words , such as a picture of Mona Lisa ; then say that , and name the image in the ALT text so that it becomes obvious that the ALT text is not meant to be taken as such but as a reference to essentially visual information .
Of course , this is ultimately what many people ( including me ) have kept saying .
My mild provocation was meant to ask whether we should say things this way , rather than starting from " use ALT for every image ... " .
After all , all communication fails , except by accident , and when it accidentally fails to fail , the part that gets through is probably the first main point that you make .
That is , people will learn just the formal rule , and start misapplying it .

Despite the interesting discussion that it raised , I still do n't know what to think about this .
I would hate to admit that this document of mine is based on wrong grounds , especially because then I would be morally obliged to rewrite it .

Many UK households can access child abuse image sites , say charities Children 's charities have expressed " serious concerns " many UK households still have access to images showing child sex abuse via their computers .
The government had asked all internet service providers ( ISPs ) to block illegal websites by the end of 2007 .
But firms providing 5 % of broadband connections have still failed to act .
One of them , Zen Internet , said in a statement : " We have not yet implemented the IWF 's recommended system because we have concerns over its effectiveness . "
It is understood other ISPs have cited the cost of blocking the illegal material as a reason not to participate in the scheme .

The blocked websites come from a list supplied by the Internet Watch Foundation ( IWF ) , but some smaller providers refuse to use the list .
Easy access The Children 's Charities Coalition on Internet Safety ( CCCIS ) says self - regulation is not working and it is calling for firmer action by the government .

Home Office minister Alan Campbell " We now need decisive action from the government to ensure the ISPs that are still refusing to block this foul material are forced to fall into line .
" Self - regulation on this issue is obviously failing - and in a seriously damaging way for children . "
Home Office Minister Alan Campbell said : " In 2006 the government stated that they wished to see 100 % of consumer broadband connections covered by blocking , which includes images of child abuse , by the end of 2007 .
" Currently in the UK , 95 % of consumer broadband connections are covered by blocking .
The government is currently looking at ways to progress the final 5 % . "

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Leaders of the NAACP on Saturday called for the firing of the New York Post cartoonist whose drawing lampooning the federal stimulus bill has drawn charges that it 's racist and encourages violence toward President Obama .
NAACP 's Benjamin Todd Jealous says the organization will take issue " national " if Post cartoonist is n't fired .
Speaking at the civil rights group 's annual meeting in New York , NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said that if Sean Delonas is not fired , the group will call for protests of the paper and Fox television affiliates , which are owned by Post parent company News Corp .
" There is consensus that if the Post does not ... get rid of the journalists who are responsible for this bit of hate speech seeing the light of day , that we will move this from a local , regional issue to a very national issue , " Jealous said .
The group also called for the cartoonist 's editor to be fired .
Many critics said the cartoon played on historically racist images by appearing to compare Obama , the nation 's first black president , to a chimpanzee that had been shot by police officers .
The cartoon references the mauling of a Connecticut woman by a chimpanzee who was later shot and killed by police .
In its caption , one of the officers says , " They 'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill . "
Obama had signed the bill the day before the cartoon ran .
On its Web site Thursday , the paper offered a qualified apology , saying it was " most certainly not our intent " to express racism , but also accusing some of jumping at a chance to attack a paper they already disliked .
Watch reaction to the Post 's apology »
" To them , no apology is due , " the paper wrote .
" Sometimes a cartoon is just a cartoon -- even if the opportunists seek to make it something else . "
But NAACP Chairman Julian Bond said that explanation rings hollow .
" This is tastelessness taken to the extreme , " he said .
" For the publication to suggest the only people who object to it are constant critics of the New York Post is beyond ridiculous .
" This was an invitation to assassination of the president of the United States and anyone who was not offended by it does n't have any sensibilities . "

which breaks your novel into chapters and scenes , helping youwhile leaving your mind free to create .
It willwrite your novel for you , suggest plot ideas or perform creative tasks of any kind .
yWriter was designed by an author , not a salesman ! , but you 're encouraged to register your copy if you find it useful .
If you 're just embarking on your first novel a program likemay seem like overkill .
I mean , all you have to do is type everything into a word processor !
Sure , but wait until you hit 20,000 words , with missing scenes and chapters , notes all over your desk , characters and locations and plot points you 've just added and which need to be referenced earlier ... it becomes a real struggle .
Now imagine that same novel at 40,000 or 80,000 words !
No wonder most first - time writers give up .
( Although yWriter was designed for novels , enterprising users have created their own translation files to customise the program to work with plays , non-fiction and even sermons . )
I'm , the designer and programmer .
I haveand I 'm also the author of a science fiction comedy series and a new middle - grade science fiction comedy for ages 9 - 12 .
ALL of my novels were written in yWriter .
Because I 'm an experienced programmer AND a published author , yWriter contains a bunch of tools a working novelist will find useful , and nothing some marketing expert came up with to promote additional sales .
I really struggled with my first novel because I wrote slabs of text into a big word processor file and I just could n't make sense of the whole thing at once .
No real overview , no easy jumping from scene to scene , nothing .
Next I tried saving each chapter to an individual file , with descriptive filenames , but moving scenes between files was a nuisance and I still could n't get an overview of the whole thing ( or easily search for one word amongst 32 files )
My last attempt to use Word involved saving every scene as an individual file - e.g. Chapter 01 Scene 01 - Hal Spacejock Gets a Job.doc .
That was fantastic until I decided to move one scene three chapters ahead , and had to manually rename all the files .
Then I decided to put it back again !
I could never remember which of the 200 + files contained a note I was looking for either .
As a programmer I 'm used to dealing with projects broken into source files and modules , and I never lose track of my code .
I decided to apply the same working method to my novels ... and yWriter was the result .
I realise Word , OpenOffice and other modern word processors have outlining features , but they do n't have snapshot backups to sequential files like yWriter does .
Roll back scenes to where they were half an hour ago , or re-read a version from four months ago - yWriter stores them all , automatically .
A scene is a pleasant chunk to work on - small and well - defined , you can slot them into your novel , dragging and dropping them from one chapter to another as you interleave strands from different viewpoint characters and work out the overall flow of your book .
You can also mark a scene as ' unused ' if you 've written yourself into a dead end , which will keep it out of the word count and exports without deleting the content .
Of course , you can't just write a bunch of unrelated scenes .
You need an overall design goal ... your plot .
yWriter will generate a number of different reports from your scene and chapter summaries , from a brief scene list to a comprehensive synopsis .
If you update the ' readiness ' setting for each scene it will even generate a work schedule showing what you have to do to meet your deadline for the outline , first draft , first edit and second edit .
yWriter also allows you to add scenes with no content - just type a brief description and you can pretend you 've written it .
This is great for the parts you 're not ready to write yet , or for when you get blocked .
Skip over that part and come back later !
Unfinished scenes , rough ideas ... it 's so much harder to keep track of them when they 're all pasted into one long word processing document .
yWriter may look simple , but as the author of several novels written with this tool I can guarantee it has everything needed to get a first draft together .
Without yWriter , I would never have become a published author .
yWriter is awhich runs on Windows PCs .
It , and all data is stored on your own computer .
The only time it uses the internet is if you use the inbuilt ' check for update ' routine ( in which case yWriter simply checks the latest version number from spacejock.com ) , or the ' backup to ftp ' feature ( in which casehave to provide the server address and login details . )
You wo n't pay anything to download yWriter , and the software contains no adverts , unwanted web toolbars , desktop search programs or other cruft .

Landmark Forum
Landmark Forum is a large group awareness training program in which up to 150 people take a seminar together aimed at helping them realize their true potential .
Landmark Forum began in 1985 by those who had purchased the est " technology " from Werner Erhard .
In 1991 the group changed its name to Landmark Education Corporation ( LEC ) , which continues to offer the Landmark Forum training , along with several other programs emphasizing communication and productivity .
Erhard 's brother , Harry Rosenberg , heads LEC , which does some $ 50 million a year in business and has attracted some 300,000 participants .
LEC is headquartered in San Francisco , as was est , and has 42 offices in 11 countries .
Apparently , however , Erhard is not involved in the operation of LEC .
LEC is aimed at New Age explorers of the 1990s , not the Flower Children from the 60s and 70s who were attracted to est .
The search for " It " , which characterized est , is out .
Also out is the Zen master approach of est , which was often abusive , profane , demeaning and authoritarian .
The Forum is apparently just as authoritarian as est but not as profane or abusive .
LEC aims to help people transform their lives by teaching them specific communication and life skills along with some heavy philosophical training .
The advertised goals of LEC seem very grand and very vague .
The programs are hailed as " original , innovative and effective . "
They " allow participants to produce extraordinary and even miraculous results , and provide a useful , practical new freedom which brings a quality of effectiveness and plan to one 's everyday life . "
Landmark is dedicated to " empowering people in generating unlimited possibilities and making a difference .
Our work provides limitless opportunities for growth and development for individuals , relationships , families , communities , businesses , institutions and society as a whole . "
They are " successful " and " internationally recognized . "
They are " committed to generating extraordinary communication -- powerful listening and committed speaking that results in self - expression and fulfillment . "
Landmark is " exciting , challenging and enjoyable . "
" Well being , self - expression , accountability and integrity are the tenets upon which we stand .
This stand leads to our extraordinary customer , assistant and employee satisfaction . "
And , of course , LEC wants to help you fulfill all your human potential , your " capacity to create , generate , invent and design from nothing . "
[ Landmark Education Charter ]
I have never attended a session of either est or Landmark but from what I can gather from those who have , the experience is not likely to be dull .
Jill P. Capuzzo writes that " Other seminars may offer supportive hugs ; this one hits you between the eyes . "
She also claims that " One of the most irritating aspects of The Forum is the hard sell to sign up future participants .
Leaders encourage people to bring friends and family to [ a ] session to help celebrate their newfound love of life and invite them to enroll in the next available weekend . "
Capuzzo claims that 20 percent of the participants in her sessions brought visitors to the open session and nearly half the original participants signed up for an advanced course .
Andy Testa , on the other hand , posted an account of his experience with Landmark Forum , in which he claims that he was hounded by recruiters who insisted that his resistance was proof he needed their help .
Some people claim to have had breakdowns after attending such programs as Landmark Forum [ see Lell , who had one after attending Landmark sessions , and Abstracts of Articles in Psychological Journals concerning est and The Forum ] .
According to Robert Howe , Stephanie Ney , 45 , claims that a two - day Landmark Forum seminar " stripped her of her natural psychological defenses and unleashed the specter of a failed relationship with her father , " leading to a nervous breakdown and commitment to a psychiatric clinic .
Yet , many of those who seek out cults like Scientology or self - help programs such as Landmark are troubled already .
Some are deeply troubled and the training might send them over the edge .
But whose fault is that ?
Such people might have gone to the movies and been pushed over the edge , like " Heinrich Pommerenke , who was a rapist , abuser , and mass slayer of women in Germany . "
He " was prompted to his series of ghastly deeds by Cecil B. DeMille 's The Ten Commandments . " *
( A woman who took est when she was 17 wrote me : " The intent of these seminars is to dig in deeply , without providing any aftercare .
In that sense , they are responsible .
They are taking money , knowing what they are trying for , not allowing people 's natural defenses to operate that tell them when it's a good idea to dig .
Then , the programmers walk away .
Even for non-deeply troubled people , this is a concern and the impact can be negative . "
Programmers should be trained to handle " troubled " people and should know that they can't push every participant to the same degree without occasional disastrous results . )
Another participant describes his Forum experience as " the most powerful and dangerous experience in my life . "
He claims that he was so disoriented after the seminar that he could n't work for three days .
He claims that those " three days after my Forum were a living hell , unlike anything I had experienced in 21 years of formal training and six years of medical residency in New York City . "
However , this participant also said that he would do it again !
A Hare Krishna devotee advises fellow spiritual travelers to take the LEC training .
He claims that the average person reports that Landmark seminars change lives for the better by bringing about improved effectiveness in relating to others , increased personal productivity , greater self - confidence , help in making good decisions by learning how to identify what 's really important in life , and help in learning how to live a more satisfying life without making life more complicated .
He thinks Landmark can help people achieve transcendental realization .
Paul Derengowski , formerly of the Christian cult - watch group Watchman.org , thinks that Landmark " has theological implications . "
Since the training seems to emphasize that one 's past and current beliefs are hindering self - growth , it is easy to see why defenders of traditional religions would fear such programs as Landmark Forum .
In effect , to those who are members of traditional faiths , programs such as Landmark are saying : your religion is a hindrance to becoming your true self .
There is evidence that many of those who sign up for LGAT programs such as Landmark Forum are having major problems in their lives .
Y. Klar , R. Mendola , J. D. Fischer , R. C. Silver , J. M. Chinsky and B. Goff , reported in the Journal of Consulting & Clinical Psychology [ 990;58( 1):99 - 108 ] that
A study was conducted to assess the psychosocial characteristics of individuals who become involved in large group awareness training ( LGAT ) programs .
Prospective participants in The Forum , which has been classified as an LGAT , were compared with nonparticipating peers and with available normative samples on measures of well - being , negative life events , social support , and philosophical orientation .
Results revealed that prospective participants were significantly more distressed than peer and normative samples of community residents and had a higher level of impact of recent negative life events compared with peer ( but not normative ) samples .
People who are having problems , are dissatisfied , feel unfulfilled , desire direction , etc. , are the kind of people who sign up for seminars that will help them .
It is almost inevitable that the vast majority of people who would get involved be in some sort of distress .
Likewise , by " regression " we would expect many people to have upswings and experience fewer problems , be more satisfied and fulfilled , feel less lost , etc. , after periods of distress .
It is predictable that many participants in self - growth programs will attribute their sense of improvement to the programs they 've taken , but much of their reasoning may be post hoc .
Furthermore , their sense of improvement might not be matched by improved behavior .
Just because they feel they 've benefited does n't mean they have .
Research has shown that the feelings of having benefited greatly from participation in an LGAT do not correspond to beneficial changes in behavior ( Michael Langone , " Large Group Awareness Training Programs , " Cult Observer , v. 15 , n. 1 , 1998 ) .
While some Landmark participants may have had breakdowns after their training , it would be a mistake to infer that large numbers of emotionally unbalanced people are signing up for the program .
" Based on psychic distress ( symptoms ) and impairment measures , those who sought out growth groups were not overly represented by those who were particularly disturbed or impaired in their lives " ( Leibermann in Fuhriman and Burlingame 1994 ) .
In fairness , it is also post hoc reasoning to assume that very disturbed individuals who deteriorate rapidly after attending LGAT seminars , do so because of their participation .
Those in need of psychotherapy should not participate in LGAT programs .
They may be too intense for the emotionally fragile .
It is not without good reason that Landmark Forum requires prospective participants to sign a statement declaring that , to the best of their knowledge , they are mentally and physical well .
This gives notice that the program is not for the mentally or physically unstable .
It also may protect Landmark from legal action should a client have a breakdown after attending the Forum , but there is no guarantee that such a signed statement would necessary exculpate Landmark should it be charged with causing someone 's mental or physical breakdown .
The training emphasizes not only how to communicate better but how to relate better to those around you , as it forces the participant to reflect on and examine his or her life .
Such courses , if they are really good , will inspire many people to create themselves anew .
Many will see positive effects immediately .
In fact , many are so impressed that they want to share the experience with others .
They become zealots and recruiters for the program .
Part of their zealotry , however , derives from the intense pressure put on them to bring their friends and family into the program , and to sign up for follow - up courses .
The main marketing tool Landmark uses is high - pressure direct contact with participants , including phone calls that border on harassment , according to some participants .
Some critics even think that recruitment is the main goal of the program ( Faltenmayer ) .
the varieties of the LEC experience
From what I have read by those who have been involved in est or Landmark Forum , the experience is at minimum disrupting and provocative , at best life transforming .
This would indicate that something reaches deep into the emotional life of some participant's .
Some , like Rabbi Yisroel Persky , claim that what they are being given are little more than " common - sense concepts cloaked in esoteric packaging " ( Faltenmayer ) .
But what is common - sense to an educated and well - read person ( in the fields of psychology , philosophy , and communication arts ) , may seem like golden insights to others .
Yet , while there must be something of substance to the content of the message ( culled from the great minds , after all ) the importance of the messenger and the way the message is delivered cannot be overestimated .
The messenger must be believable .
He or she must appear sincere .
He must exude confidence .
She must know how to use her voice and body to get her message across .
He must be a master of communication skills .
She must have wit and humor .
He must be a raconteur .
She must not only talk the talk but appear to clearly walk the walk as well .
And he must do it with a large group and utilize the energy and enthusiasm of the group members to infect each other .
If she or he is successful , the participants will leave charged up and ready to take on the world .
The revival will have revived them .
They will leave running on sixteen cylinders .
They will be tuned up , turbocharged , and empowered to change their lives .
That is why so many people feel they have benefited from programs such as Landmark Forum , neuro - linguistic programming , est ( or even Scientology or Amway ) .
The programs have given people a positive direction and focus , and surrounded them with like - minded folks for reinforcement .
They have helped them achieve peace of mind or to accomplish goals they had been unable to accomplish heretofore .
They have helped with personal relationships with spouses and children or helped them justify getting out of relationships with their friends and family .
The program has forced them to be more self - conscious , forced them to think and examine their lives , something most people do n't do on an ordinary Tuesday .
Any time a rational person reflects on his or her life , or on some of the bigger issues in life , it feels good or it puts things in perspective .
Either way , it is usually satisfying .
Many who take the LEC training feel that Landmark Forum has given them the power and self - esteem they lacked .
Some of the good feeling and carryover in behavior may be long - lasting , or it may be temporary , like the rush that follows an inspirational meeting , or the new perception of reality that follows an intense emotional experience .
Much of the improvement in feeling may be due to predictable regression and might explain the urge of many participants to want to take the follow - up courses and advanced seminars .
These can get quite costly .
For example : LEC offers an advanced course for $ 700 and two advanced courses on Communication and Power for $ 1,050 .
LEC charges $ 1,700 for The Wisdom Program .

A treasure trove of information about pre-human New Zealand has been found in faeces from giant extinct birds , buried beneath the floor of caves and rock shelters for thousands of years .
A team of ancient DNA and palaeontology researchers from the University of Adelaide , University of Otago and the NZ Department of Conservation have published their analyses of plant seeds , leaf fragments and DNA from the dried faeces ( coprolites ) to start building the first detailed picture of an ecosystem dominated by giant extinct species .
Former PhD student Jamie Wood , from the University of Otago , discovered more than 1500 coprolites in remote areas across southern New Zealand , primarily from species of the extinct giant moa , which ranged up to 250 kilograms and three metres in height .
Some of the faeces recovered were up to 15 centimetres in length .
'" Surprisingly for such large birds , over half the plants we detected in the faeces were under 30 centimetres in height , " says Dr Wood .
" This suggests that some moa grazed on tiny herbs , in contrast to the current view of them as mainly shrub and tree browsers .
We also found many plant species that are currently threatened or rare , suggesting that the extinction of the moa has impacted their ability to reproduce or disperse . "
" New Zealand offers a unique chance to reconstruct how a ' megafaunal ecosystem ' functioned , " says Professor Alan Cooper , Director of the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA , which performed the DNA typing .
" You can't do this elsewhere in the world because the giant species became extinct too long ago , so you do n't get such a diverse record of species and habitats .
Critically , the interactions between animals and plants we see in the poo provides key information about the origins and background to our current environment , and predicting how it will respond to future climate change and extinctions . "
" When animals shelter in caves and rock shelters , they leave faeces which can survive for thousands of years if dried out , " Professor Cooper says .
" Given the arid conditions , Australia should probably have similar deposits from the extinct giant marsupials .
A key question for us is ' where has all the Australian poo gone ? ' " .

Other University of Adelaide members of the research team include Dr Jeremy Austin and Dr Trevor Worthy from the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA , part of the University 's newly - established Environment Institute .
The team 's findings have recently been published in Quaternary Science Reviews , an international geological research journal .
Despite the recession , cupcake shop owners are experiencing brisk sales as consumers seek affordable indulgences .
Cupcakes take us back to childhood birthday parties and school bake sales .
The nostalgia and comfort associated with baked goods helped generate more than $ 6 billion in cake and pie sales in the U.S. last year , with cupcakes comprising one of the biggest chunks of that market , according to Mintel , a market research firm .
The trend is expected to continue in 2009 , as the popular Sprinkles Cupcakes in Los Angeles and Crumbs Bake Shop in New York City franchise across the country .
At the same time , other new cupcakeries are popping up , like Megan Faulkner Brown ’s The Sweet Tooth Fairy Bake Shop , which opened last month in Provo , Utah .
According to Faulkner Brown , the recession ’s not holding back customers .
If anything , hard times are boosting traffic to her store .
“ People are still spending money on the smaller luxuries that make them feel good , ” she says .
“ Sure , maybe no vacation to Hawaii , but they ’ll pay $ 2.25 for a cupcake . ”
Intrigued ?
Want to open your own cupcakery ?
Here are a few of the must - have ingredients .
1. Location , Location , Location
While some large cities may be saturated with cupcake shops ( think New York and Los Angeles ) , there are many locations that offer fewer barriers to entry .
Kimberly Martin opened Main Street Cupcakes in her hometown of Hudson , Ohio , about two years ago because her area had little to offer in the cupcake department .
“ What could be better than being the first ? ” says Martin .
The store is situated in an historic building on North Main Street , a destination spot for locals and out - of - towners .
The Sweet Tooth Fairy Bake Shop in Provo is n’t in the hottest section of town , but it's foot traffic - friendly , nestled between a Sam ’s Club ( Stock Ticker : WMT ) and a giant crafts store .
“ If we get even a tenth of their population , we ’re fine , ” says Faulkner Brown .
2. Get Online
If you ca n’t find or afford a smart location for your cupcake start - up ( although now is a great time to haggle down rental rates ) , consider being strictly virtual .
Some successful cupcake shops are web - based , like Baked By Melissa .
Faulkner Brown began selling her cupcakes as a mail - order business from her home two years ago , using a web site to draw customers .
Investing in a talented web designer with search engine skills is important .
In Faulkner Brown 's case , her previous work experience in web design and social media helped optimize her online business without making an extra hire .
Even with her new store front , she has n’t abandoned the mail - order side .
Traffic is up on her site and there ’s even more money to be made selling cupcakes to other zip codes , she says .
3. Conceptualize the Cupcake ( and Be Pretty )
“ Part of why cupcakes have been so successful is that they ’re catchy , ” says Rachel Kramer Bussel , founder and co-editor of Cupcakes Take the Cake , a popular blog dedicated to all things cupcake .
Unless they ’re for your child ’s third grade classroom , slapping some Betty Crocker frosting on a vanilla mini cake is not going to win you much attention .
To thrive in this industry , you need to offer something unique , experts say .
Some cupcake store owners offer customized designs , or different shapes and sizes to differentiate themselves .
Cupcakes Squared in San Diego , Calif. , offers square - shaped cupcakes .
Baked By Melissa boasts miniature tie - dyed and flavor - filled cupcakes .
Manille Bakery in West Covina , Calif. , creates special fondant toppings and Cupcakes Nouveau in Coral Gables , Fla. , sells “ couture ” styled cupcakes inspired by France ’s haute couture fashion .
And do n’t forget , no matter what the concept , appearances count .
“ If [ your cupcakes ] do n’t look fabulous , people are not going to stop by your bakery , ” says Kramer Bussel .
Other cupcakeries like to create an experience inside the cupcake shop .
Sweet Revenge in New York City , for example , takes an upscale approach and encourages patrons to pair cupcakes with a glass of wine or beer at its bar .
4. Deeee - lishousness
Of course your cupcakes need to taste great .
Spending time perfecting the recipe is no waste .
Faulkner Brown thinks her business secret might just be in her special frosting , the ingredients of which she refuses to share with anyone .
By demand she recently began jarring up and selling the cream icing to customers , adding extra revenue .
“ [ My frosting ] is what we ’re going to be able to hang our hat on one day , ” she says .
Sold on the cupcake concept ?
Now take a look at the costs .

I took my Mac laptop with me over Christmas and New Year , with the intention of sorting out some fairly boring but essential tasks in Subversion , and ended up spending a lot more time on it than I ’d anticipated .
A while ago I removed the game Object system from Subversion ( which was responsible for those elevator systems from Part 9 ) and I had planned to get all that stuff re-integrated into the new Geometry Generator so I could carry on where I ’d left off .
That took about a day , leaving me with most of the Christmas holidays free to push further .
I made quite a big leap in terms of integrating the local Site with the wider City views , and everything now has much more of a sense of scale .
Here 's a lovely new screenshot , my favourite from Subversion so far .
The man in this picture is only there for scale purposes and wo n't be playing any part in the finished game ( especially since I stole his image from Google Sketchup ) .
I want to design a system in which I can build highly complex systems made up of lots of smaller Common Components .
I took a shot at this with the Elevator Systems last year , but I was too focussed on getting the script system working well .
So in the elevator system almost every component is running a custom script – the Sensors , the Doors , the Buttons , and of course the control computer .
I now believe I can build almost any system for Subversion out of a few standardised components – specifically Sensors , Actuators , Emitters , and Controllers .
Sensors detect an object or event in their zone – such as Motion , Proximity , Heat , Light , whatever .
Actuators are basically motors , and move other objects around .
Emitters are things like lights , lasers , speakers .
And finally Controllers are the computer systems that make everything work – and these are the only objects that really need custom LUA scripts .
Rather than messing with the working Elevator system , I decided I ’d first create those four basic components , and then build a new system using just them .
I picked a supermarket Sliding Door as a good system to try to build .
This is basically a pair of glass sliding doors ( moved by Actuators ) .
The system is triggered by a motion sensor pointing at the area in front of the doors .
That motion sensor sends its trigger message to the controlling computer , which activates the Actuators controlling the doors .
The doors open , and Proximity Sensors tell the control computer where the Doors are at any point so it can tell the Actuators to stop once the doors are fully open / closed .
A perfect example of a complex system , built up out of simple standardised objects , with just a single ( very simple ) script running the whole thing .
This Sliding Door object could then be packaged up and deployed in any other building as a stand - alone system .
Here ’s a video of this new stuff in action .
The first half shows the Sliding Door operating in the testbed building ( a simple 10 - storey office ) .
You can see the Actuators moving the doors , and the Proximity Sensors lighting up as the doors pass in front of them .
I then open up the WorldObject Inspector , which shows all of the state variables in the Control Computer ( controlled by Lua code ) .
The second half of the video shows the same systems ( Elevator and Sliding Door ) deployed in an actual site in a city .
Still tons of work to do to get the systems at the right place , so if you look closely you ’ll see objects in crazy locations .( xvid codec required ) Why am I doing this ?
Why on earth am I simulating sliding doors down to the level of proximity sensors and actuators ?
Buildings are hugely complex beasts , full of lots of different overlapping systems – doors , locks , elevators , cameras , computers , networks , phones , fire control , air control , security guards , staff .
Ultimately the Subversion game world will be more real , more controllable , more interesting , and more packed with possibility the more detail we simulate the objects in it with .
If you look at modern blockbuster videogames , the number of possible interactions with a world is usually extremely small – and usually involves a gun in your hands – and that ’s because the design team had to create every interaction by hand .
By simulating complex systems in high detail , I do n’t need to think of all the ways the world can be changed – it will just work .
For example – smash one of the Actuators with a hammer , and one of the doors will stay where it is , while the other door continues to open and close .
Smash one of the outer sensors and the Actuator will push the door of the end of its slide .
Cover the motion sensor with a plastic bag and it wont send any detection messages to the computer , leaving the doors closed .
Stick some chewing gum over the inner proximity sensors and they will think the doors are already closed , thus the control computer will leave the doors open .
Push a bin in - between the two doors and they will close on it , and sensors on the insides of the doors will detect this obstruction , and the doors will open slightly , then try to close again .
The doors will be stuck in an open / close / open loop , constantly hitting the bin and re-opening , just as you ’d see in real life .
Cut any of the signal wires , or short - circuit them to set a high or low value .
Or just plug straight into the control computer and tweak the status variables in memory , making the system do whatever you want whenever you want .
None of these are activities or opportunities that I have explicitly created , but all are possible because I ’ve simulated the system in sufficient detail .
The possibilities for amazingly complex systems and interactions – from Introversion AND from the Subversion community – is kind of breathtaking .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Obama administration will not support a policy of taxing drivers based on their mileage , the Transportation Department said Friday after a published interview in which Secretary Ray LaHood called it an idea " we should look at . "
The mileage tax idea involves tracking drivers through GPS units in their cars .
In a written statement , the department said , " The policy of taxing motorists based on how many miles they have traveled is not and will not be Obama administration policy . "
The idea -- which involves tracking drivers through Global Positioning System ( GPS ) units in their cars -- is gaining support in some states as a way of making up for a shortfall in highway funding .
Oregon carried out a pilot program and deemed it " successful . "
Speaking to The Associated Press , Transportation Secretary LaHood , an Illinois Republican , said , " We should look at the vehicular miles program where people are actually clocked on the number of miles that they traveled . "
The remark was part of a discussion about various options to help make up for the highway funding shortfall on the federal level .
When contacted by CNN , the Transportation Department said LaHood was unavailable .
A spokeswoman provided the department 's statement and said she could not elaborate .
Officials in Massachusetts told CNN this week that there has been talk of proposing such a system for the state .
Colin Durant , a spokesman for Gov. Deval Patrick , said " privacy would be our top priority . "
Patrick on Friday announced a different plan to help raise highway funds : a 19 - cent increase in the state 's gas tax .
But he said that alone " will not solve all our challenges , " and some " major reforms " will be needed .
Under a VMT ( vehicle miles traveled ) tax program , GPS units would allow the government to keep track of how much each car is driven and where -- though not necessarily with exact street locations .
The government could also track other things , including the time each car enters a certain zone .
For decades , the fuel taxes that drivers pay at the pump have been the central source of federal and state funding for roads and bridges .
But they are no longer nearly enough .
Last fall , Congress approved an $ 8 billion infusion into the depleted federal highway trust fund .
The problem stems in part from something good : More and more Americans are buying vehicles that have better gas mileage .
That means less gas tax money from each car , though the car is causing the same amount of wear and tear on the roads .
Officials including LaHood have opposed raising the national gas tax , particularly in the current recession , and have said a new system is needed .
A report by the Oregon Department of Public Transportation , published in November 2007 , said a " Road User Fee Pilot Program " found that a VMT tax is " viable . "
" Privacy is protected , " the report argued , saying the pilot program included " engineering requirements to maintain as much privacy as practicable while still allowing a feasible way to audit and challenge billings . "
" No specific vehicle point location or trip data could be stored or transmitted " in the pilot program , and " the only centrally stored data needed to assess mileage fees were vehicle identification , zone mileage totals for each vehicle and the amount of fuel purchased . "
Some officials support using tracking zones and times of day in determining a VMT tax , so that more would be charged for driving on crowded roads during rush hour .
But some people across the country have spoken up against a VMT tax .
" Is this a good idea ?
In a word , no , " columnist Glenn Reynolds wrote in January for Popular Mechanics .
" At best , it 's overcomplicated and intrusive .
At worst , it 's a threat to privacy and the environment . "
Reynolds added , " Gas taxes are a pretty good proxy for road usage -- the more you drive , the more gas you burn -- and there 's a bonus :
Gas taxes encourage people to use less gas .
... A mileage tax , presumably , does n't care whether you 're driving a Prius or a Hummer , giving no incentive to save . "
The Civitas Institute in North Carolina -- which describes itself as standing for " liberty and prosperity derived from limited government " -- said it carried out a poll in North Carolina and found that voters disapprove of the idea .
A federal blue - ribbon panel plans to issue a report next week on ways the country can make up for its highway funding shortfall .
Other possibilities include tolls , higher registration fees and other types of taxes .
In its interim report , the National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission said new technologies could allow for a mileage gas tax that would take into account the type of vehicle and level of emissions .
Programs of that type are being developed in other countries , including Germany and the Netherlands , the report said .
It added , " Such programs may not be ripe for widespread implementation in the U.S. yet , but are maturing rapidly . "

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Shortly after midnight on January 24 , a 16 - year old boy from Powder Springs , Georgia , crashed his car into an oncoming vehicle .
Garrett Reed , a star football player at Harrison High School , died instantly .
Police believe he had been drinking .
Kecia Evangela
Whitfield , 43 , is charged with furnishing alcohol to a minor and reckless conduct .
According to police , the investigation revealed that a classmate 's mother served alcohol to Reed .
Police charged 43 - year - old Kecia Evangela Whitfield with furnishing alcohol to a minor and reckless conduct , both misdemeanors .
Whitfield was released on a $ 10,000 bond and awaits a court date in April .
Records on file with the Cobb County solicitor general 's office indictate she has not yet entered a plea or obtained a lawyer .
She did not return CNN 's phone calls .
If convicted , she could receive up to a year in jail and fines totaling thousands of dollars .
Toxicology reports for Reed will be released in six weeks , officials said .
His death stunned the small community of Powder Springs and sounded an alarm for parents .
" What we have to realize is that our kids do think they are invincible , " said Patti Agatston , a mother of another Harrison High School teenager who lives in Reed 's neighborhood .
" We can't be enablers .
We 've got to be adults and say ' no . ' "
At least ten states including Virginia , Minnesota and New Mexico - and Georgia , where Garrett 's accident occurred , allow parents to give their own child alcohol , according to the Alcohol Policy Information System , a federal website that tracks alcohol laws .
The alcohol can typically be given to the minor in the guardian 's home or a private setting and there are no age limits , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .
However , nowhere is it legal to give alcohol to other people 's children .
Officials say teen binge drinking is reaching epidemic proportions , and states and municipalities are scrambling to implement " social hosting " laws that carry stiff fines for parents whose homes are used for drinking parties , whether they know about them or not .
At least 24 states have enacted social hosting laws that fine parents several thousand dollars for each offense , said Jim Mosher , an expert tracking alcohol policies at the National Conference of State Legislatures .
The fines , he said , are an effective deterrent .
A 2005 study conducted by the American Medical Association reported that about one - third of teens said it was " easy to obtain alcohol " from their parents .
That figure jumps to 40 percent when it comes to getting alcohol from a friend 's parent .
One out of four teens said they had attended a party where minors were drinking in front of parents .
Some communities are using their zoning powers to create local social hosting laws .
These laws usually result in misdemeanor charges and jail time is rare .
Prosecutors ' offices are often busy with other cases and do n't bother to charge unless there is a serious incident or accident , policy experts said .
" It 's very difficult for us to knock on a random door and say ' are you drinking ? ' " said Sgt. Dana Pierce of the Cobb County Police Department , the agency responsible for investigating Reed 's case .
" We usually have to respond to some kind of nuisance call . "
In Massachusetts in January , a court sentenced a mother to jail for serving alcohol to minors at a party in her home .
A teenage boy died in an auto accident after leaving her party .
In Charlottesville , Virginia , two adults served jail time in 2007 for providing alcohol at their son's 16th birthday party .
Some parents consider giving a teenager a drink a rite of passage -- and that contributes to high teenage drinking rates , said Richard Yoast , director of the Department of Healthy Lifestyles and Primary Prevention at the American Medical Association .
" It 's a myth that adults and children are buying into , and it creates pressure on the child to drink , " Yoast said .
" The biggest problem to overcome is the fact that parents feel like they are helping their kids , " said Denise Thames , director of Mothers Against Drunk Driving in Georgia , " They often forget they are in fact breaking the law . "
The affluent suburbs near Powder Springs , where Reed 's accident took place , are not immune .
Police say there were several teenagers hanging out with Reed the night he died , including Whitfield 's stepson .
Several of Reed 's close friends at Harrison High School said alcohol is easy to get in their community and students can find a drinking party each weekend if they want to .
It is easier to get alcohol from older friends and relatives or parents than buying it with a fake ID , they said .
" As long as you have money , you can get it , " said Eric Stallworth , a senior at Harrison High School , who was close friends with Reed .
He described his friend as a charismatic and popular boy , who was fiercely competitive when it came to sports and dreamed of playing college football .
While there is no county or city ordinance on social hosting in Powder Springs , or in Georgia , some parents are fighting back .
The Cobb Alcohol Task Force , which also serves Powder Springs , is a volunteer group working to reduce teens ' access to alcohol .
The group launched a campaign called " Adults Who Host Lose the Most " to educate the public about the dangers of illegally providing teens with liquor .
Surveys in Cobb County show the campaigns are working slowly , said Cathy Finck , Cobb Alcohol Task Force coordinator .
In 2007 , 68 percent of 10th grade students said obtaining alcohol was easy , a decrease from 73 percent the previous year .
But that may not be enough to stop a fatal accident such as Reed's .
" Unless you get everyone to do it , kids will find out one place where they can get alcohol and you will have these kinds of incidences , " Finck said .
" Everyone has to get on board . "
Ultimately , parents need to step up and take responsibility , said Shawna Snapp of Blue River , Oregon .
Her son , Ryan Snapp , nicknamed " Snapper , " died two years ago in a car accident .
He was 17 and the teenage driver had been drinking alcohol obtained from an adult .
" We 're not here as parents to be their best friends , " Snapp said .
" We are here to guide them for life . "

( Corrects to make clear it is Congress Party , not Indian government )
NEW DELHI , Feb 7 ( Reuters ) - India 's Congress Party on Saturday said the international community should consider declaring Pakistan a terrorist state in light of the latter 's release of a scientist who sold nuclear secrets around the globe .
" It is time for the international community to think whether to declare Pakistan a terrorist country , " Manish Tewari , the Congress party spokesman said in New Delhi , in reference to the end from house arrest of Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan .
India 's Congress Party rules in a coalition , and the call to the world community was from the party , not from the Indian government .
Khan , the man at the centre of the world ' most serious nuclear proliferation scandal , was released on Friday after five years of house arrest .
Revered by many Pakistanis as the father of the country 's atomic bomb , he confessed to selling nuclear secrets to Iran , North Korea and Libya in 2004 .
He was immediately pardoned by the government , although his movements were restricted .
India 's Congress party , which faces election in April , where security is likely to be a major voting issue , said Khan 's release was a serious security concern .
" Defending him proves Pakistan as not only an exporter of terrorism , but has also given rise to doubts of certain countries , including ( United States ) America , that nuclear weapons could go into the hands of terrorists , " Tiwari told reporters .
Earlier , the Indian army chief said militant camps in Pakistan were thriving and had increased in the past year , as India put pressure on Islamabad to bring militants behind last November 's attacks in Mumbai to justice .
" I would not talk about the numbers specifically right now ... but infrastructure is existing and active , " General Deepak Kapoor told the Press Trust of India ( PTI ) .
India has said the militant attack on its financial capital Mumbai last November , in which 179 people were killed , was planned from a camp in Pakistan .
Relations between nuclear - armed India and Pakistan have been strained since then , with India saying Pakistan was not doing enough to rein in militants .
Indian Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon said this week Pakistan 's main spy agency was linked to planners of the Mumbai attacks .
Pakistan has denied any involvement by state agencies and has said it was investigating a dossier of information from India , to which it will reply next week .

I do n’t ask that everyone like arthouse movies .
God knows I get in moods when the idea of sitting through two hours of french people smoking cigarettes while they screw up their lives and talk about Nietzche ( in subtitles ) just does n’t appeal to me .
That ’s why movies like “ Wall - E ” and “ Iron Man ” are on my top ten list ; if a movie can pull off interesting themes and good character development within the framework of an audience - pleasing story , I tend to respect it even more .
Which is why my choice of Synecdoche , New York as the most underrated film of the year surprises even me .
On the surface it has everything that can drive me crazy about an arthouse film : whiny characters , discussions of philosophy , surrealist scenes and events , story points that are vague and frustrating , and a downer ending .
But it also has one thing most other indie films do n’t have : Charlie Kaufman .
I ’ve loved Kaufman since Malkovich .
He manages to always be idea - laden and edgy without succumbing to self - aggrandizement , arrogance or condescension .
His movies are very insecure , and I love it .
They are smart and honest and always pushing themselves to do something new without patting themselves on the back when they achieve it .
This is the first time Kaufman has directed , and the best compliment I can give him is this : he directs in the same way that he writes .
Synecdoche tackles all the great big questions of life , and when most movies are that ambitious they usually end up being very smug and self - satisfied and dismissibly condescending .
You really think you have something to say about death that has n’t been said a thousand times before , unnamed filmmaker ?
Kaufman , however , all but admits that he does n’t have anything to say .
In some ways that is what the movie is about –that shared experience of life and death that either means everything or nothing .
Nobody is quite sure which , even the filmmakers .
To really try and explain what the movie is about would be an exercise in futility .
Not necessarily because it is confusing or “ transcendent , ” but because it remains , through all its surrealist imagery and time - shifting devices , a movie about characters slowly working to figure out what their lives are about .
So the meaning changes moment to moment depending on the state - of - mind of the characters and the events they are experiencing .
I ’ve only watched the movie once , but it really does feel like a movie that will have different meanings each time you watch it .
I usually hate this in a film .
Whenever a film is “ open to interpretation , ” that usually just means it ca n’t make up its mind about what it wants to be or it relies on vague and meaningless imagery to make you think it ’s “ deep . ”
Put a chair in the middle of a pig sty filled with naked over - the - hill models and everyone will find a meaning , even if the “ art , ” itself , is completely devoid of intention and value .
Synecdoche , though , feels constructed from the ground up .
It is as if Charlie Kaufman creates a group of characters with their own problems and eccentricities .
Then he watches their lives play out .
By being honest about their interactions , scenes emerge .
By linking these scenes by plot threads and internal character analysis , a movie gets made .
The meaning does n’t necessarily come from artificially inserting motifs or themes , but from the characters analyzing and making choices in their own lives .
When looked at from that wildly unique perspective , every event is important .
Every look , and line , and set design choice has meaning , because it has meaning to the characters .
And because we are there to experience the lives of these characters and judge their actions , every moment has meaning for the audience .
Maybe that ’s what the movie is about .
That and death .
I realize that I am waxing crazy philosophical and most likely dipping into “ deep hippie ” mode , but the movie really is n’t that .
It ’s self - deprecating and funny and weird and honest and false .
It does n’t love any of its characters or hate them , it just presents them .
And , in the end , it says they are really not all that different from each other , or from us .
Whether we are being legitimate or playing a part in life , it all comes to the same experiences and the same fears , thoughts , and emotions .
And then we die .
That is where this movie moves beyond “ interesting ” into the realm of “ brilliant , ” and , yes , I would even say “ moving . ”
There comes a moment when you realize as an audience member that the complicated plot and structure and all the themes , as meaningful and worthy of consideration as they are , all converge on one definite uncontrollable endpoint .
It ’s not an uplifting film .
But it feels honest without wallowing in sadness or despair .
So many movies choose a tone before they choose a story .
So many movies are worried about delivering a message instead of showing us honest characters .
Throughout every frame of this movie , you can feel Kaufman fighting this , asking himself two questions .
1 ) am I being honest ?
and 2 ) should anyone give a shit ?
The answer to both is yes .
So even though the movie feels disjointed ( on purpose , I ’d argue ) , it is n’t .
It ’s a movie that makes you think and makes you feel .
And its a movie that feels like it is speaking directly to only you–assuming , of course , that you are open to what it has to say .
I know I have neglected to talk about any of the story or plot .
I have n’t mentioned a single scene or a single actor .
For this one , the less you know , the better .
I ’m not afraid of spoiling it for you …that would be nearly impossible .
I ’m afraid of making you think it ’s something it ’s not .
Every synopsis I have read thus far is wrong .
Every character description is misleading .
If you showed this movie to ten people , five would love it , and five would hate it .
But I guarantee each one would have completely different reasons behind his / her opinion .
Each person finds different elements with which to define the movie , and I am convinced that almost all are placed intentionally by the filmmakers .
I ’ve had friends point out things that , in hindsight , are much more significant than I ’d realized at the time , and it forces me to reconsider the movie as a whole .
This movie needed some awards love , and it got very little .
I do n’t expect it to win , and I do n’t even think it ’s the kind of movie that would be universally loved .
But it swings for the fences more than any other film this year , and mostly succeeds .
For that , it deserves all the credit I can give it .
Authorities raided Charlie Lynch 's California home .
" They say , ' Search warrant !
Open the door , or we 're gonna tear it down ! "
Lynch told me for my ABC special " Bailouts and Bull " .
" I opened the door , and about 10 to 15 agents with shields , bulletproof vests , guns , masks .
[ They ] threw me on the ground and ... had a gun to the back of my head . "
The federal Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) seized 30 pounds of marijuana .
Sheriff Pat Hedges said the facts were clear , " Charlie Lynch was making a profit off of selling marijuana . "
It was n't hard for the authorities to locate Lynch 's marijuana operation .
They were probably tipped off by the public ribbon - cutting ceremony Lynch held -- the one that the mayor of his town attended , along with city councilmen and the president of the Chamber of Commerce .
The police were invited , too .
You see , Lynch sold medical marijuana , which has been declared legal by California and 12 other states .
California says if a doctor recommends that you use the drug , it 's perfectly legal .
Singer Melissa Etheridge is happy about that .
When she got breast cancer , chemotherapy took her hair and made her sick .
She told me that chemo kills more than cancer .
" It 's like putting acid in your body .
You have absolutely no strength . "
The pills to treat the side effects have their own side effects .
She said , " Take the one drug for pain .
It makes you constipated .
So then you have to take the drug that helps you not be constipated .
But that drug [ gives you ] diarrhea , and so you have to take another drug to combat the side effects of that . "
So her doctor recommended marijuana .
" I had a choice : those drugs and all these side effects , or ... one remedy that takes care of all of the [ side effects ] . "
It worked for high school student Owen Beck , too .
" I was playing soccer , and [ my leg ] was really hurting one day .
... I went and got an MRI .
It was a medium - sized tumor . "
Doctors amputated Owen 's leg and gave him chemotherapy .
Chemo tortured him the way it tortured Etheridge .
" It destroys your appetite , and whatever you can eat , you throw up . "
When prescribed medicine did n't relieve the side effects , his doctors suggested medical marijuana .
" With the marijuana , I could do what I needed to do during the day and just not be in pain .
I could be comfortable . "
Owen bought his marijuana from Charlie Lynch 's dispensary .
Sheriff Hedges says that Lynch 's business " is not in the best interests of the community . "
He was helping people , was n't he ?
I asked Hedges .
" Well , you 're making an assumption that he 's helping people .
He was primarily helping himself . "
The sheriff 's office 's staked out Charlie 's dispensary and sent in undercover agents to see if Charlie was breaking any part of California 's law .
He was n't .
So after a year of diligently documenting that marijuana was indeed being sold by a marijuana dispensary , the sheriff handed the case over to the federal police , the DEA .
U.S. law ludicrously calls marijuana a schedule 1 narcotic .
That puts it in the same category as heroin .
Federal authorities cleverly avoided California 's state courts and took Charlie into federal court , where his lawyers were not even allowed to tell the jury that medical marijuana is legal in California .
Not surprisingly , Charlie was convicted .
Possible sentence : 100 years in federal prison .
He told me his life has been destroyed .
He is bankrupt ; his girlfriend left him ; and friends are afraid to talk to him .
President Obama has joked about his own marijuana use , but since his inauguration , federal police have raided five marijuana dispensaries in states where state law permits them .
Last week , however , the administration announced it would no longer raid legal dispensaries .
That bought Charlie Lynch some time .
This week the federal judge postponed sentencing -- pending more information about the Justice Department 's new policy .
The feds still wanted to lock up Charlie Lynch .
I do n't know why .
The DEA refuses to talk to me about it .
The war on drugs is idiotic .
It deters few , drives drug use underground -- making it more dangerous -- and creates horrible crime .
Adults should be free to ingest whatever they want , knowing they are responsible for their actions .
Merrill Lynch & Co. " secretly " moved up the date it awarded bonuses for 2008 and richly rewarded its executives despite billions of dollars in losses , giving bonuses of $ 1 million or more apiece to nearly 700 employees , New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said .
In a letter to House Financial Service Committee Chairman Barney Frank , ( D. , Mass . ) , Mr. Cuomo said the Wall Street firm awarded $ 3.6 billion in bonuses to more than 39,000 employees before its Jan. 1 purchase by Bank of America Corp. , including more than $ 121 million ...
Houston mayor rips handling of immigrant who shot cop Immigrant who shot HPD officer was in U.S. illegally
Wilfido Joel Alfaro , 29 , was fatally shot last week during drug raid
Wilfido Joel Alfaro had been arrested five times for possession or delivery of drugs – including three times after an immigration judge granted him “ voluntary departure ” in March 2001 .

Houston police identified the suspect in a shooting last week that critically injured a police officer as an illegal immigrant from El Salvador , saying federal immigration officials missed multiple opportunities to deport him .
On Tuesday , Mayor Bill
White said the disclosure about the immigration status of Wilfido Joel Alfaro , who was fatally shot by officers executing a drug search warrant Thursday night , highlights the federal government ’s failure to identify and deport illegal immigrants convicted of crimes .
Officer Richard Salter , shot in the face during the raid , in southeast Houston remains at a local hospital .
White said the federal government has “ let us down . ”
“ As a local law enforcement agency , under law , we ca n’t deport people , ” White said .
“ That is the job of the federal government , and we ’re calling on the federal government to do their job . ”
White said that after the shooting , information about Alfaro ’s immigration status “ was piecemeal and sometimes incomplete and inconsistent . ”
White said immigration officials told him that Alfaro was at one time a legal permanent resident .
Alfaro had been arrested five times for possession or delivery of drugs — including three times after an immigration judge granted him “ voluntary departure ” in March 2001 .
At that point he lost his legal residency .
Voluntary departure allows illegal immigrants to leave the country on their own terms , rather than be formally deported .
People granted voluntary departure benefit from not having a prior deportation on their record if they later apply for legal status .
It also benefits the taxpayer by saving the cost of formal deportation proceedings , said Michael Keegan , a Homeland Security spokesman .
Keegan confirmed that Alfaro left the country after serving time on a felony drug charge , saying an immigration agent saw him board a plane to El Salvador in March 2001 .
Alfaro was arrested again in 2002 in Pearland , and again in 2003 on a drug charge in Angleton , authorities said .
Keegan said immigration officials received no queries from local law enforcement about Alfaro after 2001 .
White said he believes illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes should be deported immediately after they have been released from jail .
He has talked to and written a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano outlining his concerns and recommendations for reforms , he said .
Keegan said Napolitano “ fully appreciates Mayor White ’s frustration , ” adding that she has made identifying and removing criminal illegal immigrants a top priority .
Houston police and immigration officials pledged to improve cooperation after the murder of HPD Officer Rodney Johnson , who was killed in 2006 by a previously deported felon .
After Johnson ’s death , HPD offered Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to the city jails and started to refer previously deported felons and suspects with immigration warrants identified during fingerprint checks to ICE .
Critical of federal effort
Since October 2006 , the Houston Police Department has referred 420 suspected illegal immigrants to federal officials , HPD officials said .
White said on Tuesday that HPD and other law enforcement agencies have limited access to information on suspects ’ immigration history .
The main federal databases available to law enforcement agencies to screen criminals are “ inconsistent and incomplete , ” and more resources need to be devoted to improve them , the mayor said .

The federal government ’s failure to deport illegal immigrants convicted of crimes has become a controversial issue locally and nationally .
Informant warned HPD
A Houston Chronicle investigation last year found ICE failed to detain scores of violent , convicted criminals — some with prior deportation orders — who passed through Harris County ’s jails .
In October , the Harris County Sheriff ’s Office became the first law enforcement agency in the nation to participate in a pilot program that gives jailers access to a database that has more detailed information on suspects ’ immigration status through an automated fingerprint check .
Before Thursday ’s raid in the 9300 block of East Avenue O , an informant warned police that the house was used for narcotics activity and was a hangout for a violent gang , according to court documents .
Salter , 54 , is in critical condition at Ben Taub General Hospital .
However , officials on Tuesday said he moved two of his fingers for doctors , the first time they have asked him to respond .
After Salter was wounded , other officers shot and killed Alfaro , 29 .
Police seized 3.4 grams of marijuana after the shooting , but did not find any cocaine , Houston Police Chief Harold Hurtt said .

A simple SOAP interface in Lisp
SOAP is a powerful but very complicated protocol for doing remote procedure calls .
Its complexity makes it a daunting task even to do simple things .
As part of a project at Franz Inc. we needed code to make Java and Lisp communicate using the SOAP protocol .
There would be a number of services written in Java and and a number of services written in Lisp and calls had to work with Lisp calling Java , Java calling Lisp , Java calling Java and Lisp calling Lisp .
Java has a web service library which we could n't modify so we had to make Lisp 's web services obey the conventions used by Java to expose a web service .
Specifically , the Java code was using the JAXWS - 2.0 library for web services .
We wrote the Lisp code for calling the first Java web service and it was a tedious task .
Not relishing the thought of writing many more interfaces we did what Lisp programmers do , we wrote a program to write our interface code .
This code , which is provided in a modified form here as part of this note , was specific to our project .
It is not part of Allegro CL .
Users are free to take it and adapt it for their own use .
Note it is provided As Is , with no waranties expressed or implied , etc. etc .
Note that your Lisp must have all recent SOAP updates and patches in order for the code to work .
See sys: update - allegro ( the function for downloading patches ) for information on getting updates .
We call our our program to write Lisp SOAP code ssoap , meaning Simple SOAP .
Below we give an example showing how it works .
Because we wrote the code for our specific project , it only supports passing the data types needed for that project .
Users interested in the code must modify and extend it as needed to suit their needs .
ssoap achieves simplicity by eliminating many ( perhaps most ) of the choices you have when writing a SOAP application .
Our goal was not to build a new complete soap interface , just to make simple one which could do the necessary things and to talk to Java applications .
Java 's web services do the following to expose themselves .
If , say , the web service is located at http://machine.com:8080/MyTask/MyTaskService then an http GET request to that URL will return a 200 status code response .
What it returns with that response is irrelevant for our purposes ( what it in fact does is send back a description of the methods that service accepts ) .
All we need is the information that if the web service is up and running , a 200 response is returned for a normal http GET command .
If the web service is located at http://machine.com:8080/MyTask/MyTaskService then the http request for http://machine.com:8080/MyTask/MyTaskService?wsdl will return an xml file which is the wsdl for this service .
This is critical because often Java clients will read the wsdl at parse time to know how to call the service .
The ssoap code arranges for both of the above behaviors to occur for the soap services it starts .
In a SOAP call there are two actors : the client and the server .
The server sits idle and listens for a call .
The client makes the call and optionally passes data to the server .
The server performs the requested action and then notifies the client that it is finished , optionally passing back data to the client .
In ssoap we define a service .
A service consists of one or more methods .
Each method has a client side and a server side .
We will generally know when we define the service whether this is a service we will be implementing in Lisp or whether we just want access to this service as a client from Lisp .
With ssoap you can even do both : build a service in Lisp and also provide the client interface to the service .
In fact if you want to implement a service in Lisp you 'll likely want to define the client interface in Lisp as well so that you can more easily test your Lisp service .
ssoap is used in this way :
you define your service in a file .
you start lisp and load ssoap .
you load your service definition and this causes the interface definition file to be written .
This file contains the definition of your service written for the ACL SOAP module .
you compile and load in that interface file
If you 're just using the Service as a client then you are done .
If you 're implementing the Service as a server you now load in your code that does the work of the service .
Let 's look at an example , this one for a service that does conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit .
We put the following forms in a file called converter - ssoap.cl ( the contents are in the dowloadable ssoap.cl file in a commented section ) :
( in - package :user ) ( let ( ( sss ( make - ssoap - service : name " Converter " : package :user : target-namespace " http://webservice.converter.franz.com/ " : host " 127.1 " : port " 8088 " ;; optional , specify if you want to create a server : server ' start - converter - ss - soap - server : prefix ' converter ;; used to construct names : messages '( ( " CelsiusToFahrenheit " : in ( ( " celsius " : float ) ) : out ( ( " fahrenheit " : float ) ) : client ( converter - ss - celsius - to - fahrenheit &key url celsius ) : server ( converter - ss - server - celsius - to - fahrenheit &key celsius ) ) ( " FahrenheitToCelsius " : in ( ( " fahrenheit " : float ) ) : out ( ( " celsius " : float ) ) : client ( converter - ss - fahrenheit - to - celsius &key url celsius ) : server ( converter - ss - server - fahrenheit - to - celsius &key fahrenheit ) ) ) ) ) ) ( generate - interface - code - file sss " converter-interf.cl " ) ( generate - wsdl sss " converter.wsdl " ) )
The arguments to make - ssoap - service are as follows .
name : the : name should be a capitalized word ( by convention ) .
Here we chose " Converter " so the URL path to our service will be / Converter / ConverterService ( by the convention used by the Java web service code ) .
: the : name should be a capitalized word ( by convention ) .
Here we chose " Converter " so the URL path to our service will be / Converter / ConverterService ( by the convention used by the Java web service code ) .
package : the : package argument should be the same package as is mentioned at the top of the file ( in this case : user ) .
When we generate the interface file ( below ) this is the package that will be mentioned in the in - package form at the beginning of that file .
: the : package argument should be the same package as is mentioned at the top of the file ( in this case : user ) .
When we generate the interface file ( below ) this is the package that will be mentioned in the form at the beginning of that file .
target - namespace : the : target - namespace is the XML namespace in which we 'll define our service .
It should be of the form shown in the example .
Should we generate java code use or serve this service , the interface code will be put in the com.franz .
converter .
webservice java package , so keep that eventual java namespace to java - package conversion in mind when chosing a target - namespace .
host and port : the : host and : port arguments are our best guess as to where the service will be hosted .
This information only used if you create a wsdl file from this definition using generate - wsdl as is shown in the example .
The wsdl file , if generated , is not used by the Lisp code .
It 's only present to allow other soap systems ( e.g. Java ) to be clients or servers of this service .

server : if you want Lisp to serve this service then you specify a value for the : server argument .
ssoap will then create a function to start the server and will give it the name you specify .
The function will take one optional argument , a port number , which is the port on which to start the service .
If you do n't specify a port then the operating system will chose a free port .
The return value from starting the service is a string holding the url of the service ( including of course the port where the service is running ) .

prefix : the : prefix argument specifies a name that the ssoap will use when generating symbol names in the interface file .
Chose wisely and you 'll find debugging easier when looking at stack backtraces .
: the : prefix argument specifies a name that the will use when generating symbol names in the interface file .
Chose wisely and you 'll find debugging easier when looking at stack backtraces .
messages : the : messages argument is where all the soap methods are defined .
Each method begins with the name of the method and then is followed by a sequence of arguments .
The :in and : out arguments specify the values sent to and received from the web method .
Each value is given a name ( that ends up being an XML element name so choose simple names ) , and a type .
So far ssoap only support four types : :int , : string , : float , : base64 Binary .
Other types can be added to the ssoap code as necessary ( by modifying the functions look up - xsd - type and lookup - xsd - type- symbol ) .
The : client argument is optional and if present tells ssoap to create a client function in Lisp to call this method .
The value of the : client argument is the name and signature of the method to call .
The signature will always be &key followed by url and then followed by symbols with the same names as the : in arguments to the function .
Since the signature can be computed automatically why are we forcing the user of ssoap to specify it ?
The reason is that it then makes it clear to the person viewing this service definition file how the client function should be called .
The required url argument to the client function is the location of the service .
The lisp client of the service must know where the service is .
The : server is optional and need only be specified if you want Lisp to serve this service ( in which case you 've also specified the : service argument as described above ) .
The server argument specifies the signature of a function that you must write to perform the action of this method .
Again the signature can be computed from the : in parameters of the method by turning those input arguments into keyword arguments .
The ssoap module forces you to specify it though so that the defintion file explicitly reminds you of the signature of this method .
Once the make - ssoap - service function is run it builds the ssoap - service object and we then pass it to generate - interface - code - file , specifying a file to be written with this interface code .
Next well want to compile and load in this file .
Finally we write out a wsld file which we may need if we 're going to interface with Java , for example , but more on this later .
Before we work with Java let 's show how we can use ssoap to make Lisp talk with Lisp .
Our example above includes both client and server functions so we 'll use it to create both a server and client interface to that server .
We need one more piece of code to run the example .
We need to implement the server side for the service we 've defined .
Let 's do just one , the server for CelsiusToFahrenheit .
( " CelsiusToFahrenheit " : in ( ( " celsius " : float ) ) : out ( ( " fahrenheit " : float ) ) : client ( converter - ss - celsius - to - fahrenheit &key url celsius ) : server ( converter - ss - server - celsius - to - fahrenheit &key celsius ) )
We 've aleady specified the signature of the function :
: server ( converter - ss - server - celsius - to - fahrenheit &key celsius )
Now we define it using that signature
( defun converter - ss - server - celsius - to - fahrenheit ( &key celsius ) ( list " fahrenheit " (+ 32 (* 9/5 celsius ) ) ) )
The value returned from a function implementing a soap service is in property list format , a list of alternating names and values .
In this case we see from the definition of the function
: out ( ( " fahrenheit " : float ) )
we return just one value and its name is " fahrenheit " .
Now we 're ready to run the example .
compile and load ssoap.cl , the module we 're describing here .
load converter - ssoap.cl , the example file above .
There is no need to compile this file .
At this point , two files have been generated : converter - interf.cl and converter.wsdl .
If you 're interested you can view the wsdl file but we do n't need it now .
compile and load the converter - interf.cl file compile and load in the file holding the implementation of the service ( in our case the definition of converter - ss - server - celsius - to - fahrenheit above )
No we can start the SOAP server for the service
cl-user ( 4 ) : ( start - converter-ss- soap - server 8088 ) #<net.xmp.soap:soap-aserve-server-string-in-out-connector @ # x1001e11ab2 > 8088 " http://10.100.40.243:8088/Converter/ConverterService "
The third return value is the URL for the service .
Note you will get a different value .
We can now call the service as a client by using the : client method we declared ( we use the URL value returned above -- if you run this example , you should use the value you get which will be different ) :
cl-user ( 7 ) : ( converter -ss- celsius - to - fahrenheit :url " http://10.100.40.243:8088/Converter/ConverterService " : celsius 100 ) ( converter - ssoap - gen - package : : CelsiusToFahrenheitResponse ( : fahrenheit 212.0 ) ) nil cl-user ( 8 ) :
The return value of the client call is XML expression returned from the server , parsed into what we call lxml format .
It 's easy to find in it the the answer requested from the service .
Finally we 'll consider how to communicate with Java .
Suppose you have a Java SOAP server and you wish to wish to call it from Lisp using ssoap .
At present the only way to do this is for you to write a ssoap definition by hand based on the wsdl for the service .
We hope to automate this at some time in the future .
In order to use Java as a client to an ssoap server you need to create a web client interface in Java .
There are various tools in Java to do this .
The Netbeans IDE makes it particuarly easy .
You can ask Netbeans to create client interface objects from either a wsdl file or from an active url ( such as http://10.100.40.243:8088/Converter/ConverterService?wsdl).
The client interface is hardwired to call the service at the location specified in the wsdl file ( although with a bit of work you can access services whose location you learn about at run time ) .
We used Netbeans to create a client interface based on the wsdl created by our ssoap definition of the Converter service .
Then we asked Netbeans to insert a call to the CelsiusToFahrenheit method of that service .
We specified an initial value to test and added a print statement to show the results and we then had this main program :
package converter ; /** * * @author jkf */ public class Main {
/** * @param args the command line arguments */ public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { // TODO code application logic here try { // Call Web Service Operation com.franz.converter.webservice.ConverterService service = new com.franz.converter.webservice.ConverterService( ) ; com.franz.converter.webservice.Converter port = service.getConverterPort( ) ; // TODO initialize WS operation arguments here float celsius = ( float ) 100.0 ; // TODO process result here float result = port.celsiusToFahrenheit( celsius ) ; System.out.println(celsius + " Celsius is " +result + " Fahrenheit " ) ; } catch ( Exception ex ) { // TODO handle custom exceptions here System.out.
println ( " calling service got exception " + ex ) ; } } }
when this is run it prints
100.0 Celsius is 212.0 Fahrenheit
In summary the ssoap module proves a simple way to describe a soap service and to write the necessary glue code to start that service and to call that service as a client .
Furthermore it implements server behavior expected by java web services so that it will interoperate with them .
Again , the code is availabe here , and will only work if all SOAP updates and patches have been loaded .
News aggregate services have become increasingly popular in the Web 2.0 world — whether you prefer Reddit , Digg , or another service , chances are you 've heard of them .
Malware authors inevitably follow or find ways to exploit popular trends .
Now that even the most advanced CAPTCHA systems have been cracked or are manually broken by large networks of crackers based out of China or India , commercial malware companies are testing the waters of community - vetted news aggregates .
Sean - Paul Correll of PandaLabs Security has documented several instances where users falsely submitted " stories " that led directly or indirectly to malware - infested websites ; the exact attack vector varies depending on the preferences of the assailant or possibly the technical limitations of his infectious agent .
In some cases , malware authors are simply commenting on legitimate stories , while in others , the submitted stories themselves lead directly to infected sites .
The quality of these various hooks can vary considerably .
Correll points to some linked articles and submissions that make no sense whatsoever ( pick an actress , a sexual act , and a farm animal and you get the idea ) , while others are well crafted and may have even been hand - written .
Once the user clicks on one of the offending links we 're treated to the usual song and dance of false codecs , MS Antispyware 2009 ( new updated version ) , and suspicious downloads .
As far as the attacks themselves , there does n't seem to be anything new here — as is so often the case , the new bits are in the attacker 's approach rather than in the means by which illicit software ends up on the system .
Digg representative Jen Burton told the InternetNews that the website is committed to removing users that abuse the system .
" While we do n't comment on specific accounts in order to protect the privacy of our community , malware accounts reported to us by the community are terminated immediately and all content is removed , " Burton said .
" To date , we have terminated more than 300 accounts for malware . "
It 's good to see Digg being proactive , but given the size of the website , 300 accounts is an infinitesimal number .
For the moment , that may be because the attack method itself has yet to become popular , but should that change , 300 accounts could reasonably represent the number of deletions
Digg might need to make in a day .
Digg , meanwhile , may not be able to automate the flag / removal system all that easily ( at least not without disrupting its user - submitted content model ) .
So long as such links remain unpopular and never hit the website 's front page , the risk is relatively small .
The consequences of an infectious direct link going popular and remaining that way for any length of time , on the other hand , could be downright ugly .
Obviously Digg does n't want to precipitate any sort of event that would cause its users to lose faith in the site — for now , a set of human eyes may be the best way to monitor the problem .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Intel Corp. reported a 90 % drop in fourth - quarter earnings Thursday that were in line with Wall Street 's reduced expectations , as demand for semiconductors remains weak .
The Santa Clara , Calif . - based company reported net income of $ 234 million , or 4 cents per share , for the three months ended Dec. 27 .
That 's down from earnings of $ 2.27 billion , or 38 cents per share , in the year - earlier period .
Sales in the quarter fell 23 % to $ 8.2 billion from $ 10.7 billion a year ago .
The results fell in line with Wall Street 's predictions .
Analysts had forecast a profit of 4 cents per share on sales of $ 8.2 billion , according to consensus estimates gathered by Briefing.com .
Intel said it is not providing a revenue outlook at this time , citing economic uncertainty and limited visibility .
For internal purposes , however , the company said it is currently planning for first - quarter revenue " in the vicinity of $ 7 billion . "
Wall Street is expecting Intel to report first - quarter revenues of $ 7.3 billion , according to a consensus of analysts surveyed by Briefing.com .
Intel 's results were widely expected to be bad .
The company had lowered its sales and earnings forecasts twice during the quarter , citing weak demand and inventory reductions in the PC - supply chain .
" The slowing of the worldwide economy resulted in a weak fourth quarter , " said Stacy Smith , Intel 's chief financial officer in a conference call with analysts and investors .
It was the first time in 20 years that fourth - quarter earnings were lower than the third quarter , the company said .
Still , Intel maintains that it is well - positioned for growth when the economy recovers .
" We remain optimistic about where our strategy and execution can take us , " said Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini .
While weak demand and inventory levels are still a concern , the company hinted that its profit margins could return to a " healthy range " by second half of the year .
To that end , Intel said capital spending in 2009 is expected to be flat to slightly down versus last year despite the challenges facing the company .
Capital spending plans , however , will " continue to modulate based on demand , " Smith said .
Intel , the world 's largest chipmaker , is widely viewed as a proxy for the health of the overall PC industry , since its products are a key component for most computer manufacturers .
" The PC industry is having a hard time right now , " said Betsy Van Hees , an analyst who follows Intel for Caris & Company .
" We 're in a global recession and we do n't have a lot of demand - drivers to pull us out . "
Shares of Intel ( INTC , Fortune 500 ) rose 1.6 % in active trading to close at $ 13.29 per share .
The stock was little changed in after - hours activity .

Advertisement Gunmen have attacked a bus carrying the Sri Lankan cricket team on its way to play in the Pakistani city of Lahore .
At least six policemen escorting the team bus were killed , along with a driver .
Seven cricketers and an assistant coach were injured .
Pakistani officials said about 12 gunmen were involved and grenades and rocket launchers have been recovered .
Officials said the incident bore similarities to deadly attacks in Mumbai in India last November .
The Mumbai attacks were blamed on Pakistan - based Islamic militants .

Profiles of players
In pictures : Cricketers attacked Bus driver 's dramatic escape Pakistani cricket was already suffering from serious security concerns .
Pakistan invited Sri Lanka to tour only after India 's cricket team pulled out of a scheduled cricket tour on security grounds , following the Mumbai attacks .
And International Cricket Council president David Morgan told the BBC it would be " very difficult for international cricket to be hosted in Pakistan for quite some time to come " .
Evacuation Reports suggest 10 to 12 gunmen ambushed the team coach and its accompanying police detail on the Liberty Square roundabout in the heart of Lahore , as the convoy was on the way to the Gaddafi stadium for a Test match .
The BBC's Barbara Plett , in Islamabad , says accounts suggest the attack was sophisticated in nature , with one group of gunmen firing a rocket - propelled grenade in order to create a diversion , while others then approached , firing guns on the convoy .
She says the gunmen - two of whom were shown in TV pictures carrying backpacks - seemed to be well - trained .

"
The Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara told Australia 's ABC radio that he and his team mates probably owed their lives to their bus driver .
" We had an amazing driver who just kept driving the bus straight through all of that to the ground and that 's probably what saved us . "
Officials in Lahore said two members of the Sri Lankan team , Thilan Samaraweera and Tharanga Paranavitana , were sent to hospital .
' Security failure '
The Pakistani politician Imran Khan , a former captain of the country 's cricket team , said the Sri Lankan visitors had been given inadequate protection .
" This was one of the worst security failures in Pakistan , " he said .
" The Pakistan government guaranteed the Sri Lankan cricket team that they would provide them security . "

None of the attackers was killed or apprehended at the scene .
Grenades and rocket launchers were found there , police said , and a manhunt is under way .
Our correspondent says security forces will be investigating any connections to al - Qaeda and Taleban militants as well as Kashmiri jihadi groups .
A Pakistani air force helicopter has now airlifted uninjured members of the Sri Lankan team out of the Gaddafi Stadium .
Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse condemned the " cowardly terrorist attack " and ordered the players ' evacuation back to Sri Lanka .
A plane is being chartered for this purpose .
Mr Rajapakse is cutting short a visit to Nepal .
Thilan Samaraweera ( L ) and Tharanga Paranavitana went to hospital Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari also strongly condemned the attack , and ordered an immediate investigation " so that the perpetrators are identified and their motives exposed " , said a statement from his office .
Meanwhile , a spokesperson for India 's foreign ministry offered sympathy and urged Pakistan to take " prompt , meaningful and decisive steps to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure once and for all " .
But a Pakistani minister , Sardar Nabil Ahmed Gabol , reportedly told private Geo TV that evidence suggested the attackers came across the border from India .
He said the assault came in reaction to the Mumbai attacks , and was a " declaration of open war on Pakistan by India " .
The third day of play in the Second Test was scheduled to begin , but officials said the match has now been cancelled .
Security fears Pakistan is engaged in a bloody struggle against Islamist insurgents who have staged high - profile attacks on civilian targets before .
Meanwhile , Sri Lankan authorities are waging their own domestic military campaign against Tamil Tiger separatist rebels .
India and Australia have pulled out of cricket tours in Pakistan in the recent past citing security concerns .
The sport 's world governing body , the International Cricket Council , last month decided not to hold the 2009 Champions Trophy in Pakistan due to safety worries .

1 Dumb and Dumber : Bandits rob a bank , pose with loot , get arrested
Grinning stupidly for the camera and brandishing the proceeds of their ham - fisted raid , two Australian bank robbers demonstrate why they earned themselves the nicknames “ Dumb and Dumber . ” Anthony Prince , 20 , and Luke Carroll , 19 , were jailed last month after pleading guilty to the bungled raid on a bank in Vail , Colorado .
Carroll got five years in a tough US prison and Prince 4 ½ .
Federal prosecutors have released photos the pair took of each other joking in the toilets of a McDonald ’s shortly after stealing $ 170,000 in cash and terrorising bank tellers with fake pistols .
They were captured the next day after leaving a trail of clues , which investigators said made their job laughably easy .
Prince and Carroll had been regular customers at the bank and although they were wearing masks , the tellers recognised their broad Australian accents .
2 The Goat who got arrested for armed robbery
A vigilante group in Ilorin , Nigeria apprehended a group of would - be car thieves , including one man who “ turned himself ” into a goat .
The mysterious goat , according to the Police Public Relations Officer , Mr. Tunde Mohammed , while briefing bewildered journalists at the Force headquarters , is an armed robber who attempted to snatch the said car , and later “ transformed ” into the goat in a bid to escape arrest .
” While one of them escaped , the other was about to be apprehended by the team when he turned his back on the wall and turned to this goat .
They quickly grabbed the goat and here it is . ”
Mohammed said .
The police spokesman said the goat “ armed robbery suspect ” will not be left off the hook until investigations into the case are concluded .
3 The 88 - year - old Grandma who got arrested for not returning a kid ’s ball
Edna Jester , an 88 - year - old grandmother , was arrested by the police last October 2008 , when she refused to return a neighborhood boy ’s football that had landed in her front yard .
A frustrated Edna took the football last Thursday evening after it landed , once again , in the yard of her Blue Ash home , where she has lived since April 1949 .
When Jester refused to return the football , neighbor Paul Tanis , 40 , called the cops .
Though police warned that she would be arrested unless she returned the football , Jester refused , according to the below Blue Ash Police Department report .
The petty theft bust was the first arrest for Jester , who has been widowed for about ten years .
4 The Man who got caught having sex with a picnic table
In March 2008 , Art Price Jr. was arrested after a witness observed him turn over a metal picnic table and performe a sex act upon it .
This is the latest occurrence of Mr. Price engaging in sex with furniture .
On four other occasions neighbors had witnessed Mr. Price copulating with other outdoor furniture .
Price faces up to four charges of public indecency .
5 The Man who got arrested for shouting naked at trees
Dieter Braun , 43 , from Recklinghausen said the stress “ release ” technique had worked perfectly until he was arrested .
It was his marriage guidance counsellor who advised him to run around naked shouting at trees .
” For me it ’s a type of relaxation therapy ” he said .
“ Feeling the breeze on my naked skin really calms me down .
” But local police said other visitors to the forest did not find his behaviour relaxing and have now charged him with causing a public nuisance .
6 The Boy who got arrested for opening his Xmas gift too early
South Carolina boy , 12 , was arrested on December 2006 after his mother called police to report that he had unwrapped a Christmas present without her permission .
According to a Rock Hill Police Department report , the child opened a Nintendo Game Boy , though he had been directed not to by family members .
When the boy ’s mother learned that the $ 85 gift had been opened , she called cops , who charged the juvenile with petty larceny .
In an interview with The Herald newspaper , the boy ’s mother , a 27 - year - old single parent , described her son as a disruptive child , noting that she hoped his arrest would serve as a corrective to disorderly behavior at school and home .
7 The Deaf man who got arrested for swearing at police in sign language
Balraj Gill , 31 , who is deaf without speech , was arrested by police after he swore at them in sign language - and although he made no sound , he has admitted breaching the peace .
Officers had taken Gill back to a hostel where he was supposed to be staying but until a worker translated his sign language for them , they had no idea what he was trying to say .
The worker told officers every swear word Gill had signed at them .
A police officer told reporters :
“ The officers could tell he was angry , but did n’t know what he was saying .
I suppose he ’s unlucky hostel staff were on hand to translate . ”
8 The Woman who got arrested for selling pierced cats
Holly Crawford , 34 , pierced black kittens in the ear , neck and tail and then marketed them as “ gothic ” over the internet before she was charged with animal cruelty .
She was trying to sell the kittens online for hundreds of dollars , PETA said .
The Pennsylvanian woman said she did n’t see the difference between piercing a cat or human , and pleaded not guilty .
9 The Man who got arrested for farting at policeman
Jose Cruz , 34 , was arrested on September 2008 and charged with assault after he allegedly broke wind on a police officer .
Police say they were fingerprinting Cruz , when he moved near Patrolman T.E. Parsons , lifted his leg and passed gas “ loudly ” on the officer .
Cruz then allegedly waved the air in the direction of Parsons , who was preparing a breath test machine at South Charleston police HQ , West Virginia .
10 The Man who got arrested for having sex with street signs
Police in Sioux Falls South Dakota arrested 60 year old Verle Peter Dills after catching him performing various sex on a traffic sign in another residents yard .
After searching his home , police found a “ large amount ” of videos showing Dills having sex with various traffic signs .
Dills has been charged with burglary , unlawful occupancy , and six counts of public indecency .
There 's not much of a surprise in store now , seeing as we 've already seen official photos of Amazon 's newest iteration of its e-book reader ( and gotten a handful of info on price and release date ) .

Pernicious Myth No. 1 : The Container Fiction
Blog » Pernicious Myth No. 1 : The Container Fiction
Posted on
Newcomers to Haskell quickly learn that lots of containers are involved .
Lists and tuples are containers ; a monad is like a container ; constructed data contain the arguments used in construction , and so forth .
It 's a useful fiction , but it is a fiction .
A value of type " [ a ] " does not contain values of type ' a ' , or anything else , for that matter .
The Container Fiction is pernicious insofar as it retards progress toward a deeper understanding of how the notation works and why category theory provides such a powerful semantic framework .
All values are ontologically primitive .
This is obvious if you look at " simple " values like integers .
Is 3 primitive ?
Some mathematicians would disagree .
The number three , they might argue , is constructed using {} and a successor function .
Or they might argue that it's a sequence of lambda expressions of some kind .
There are probably lots of other ways to describe the meaning of ' 3 ' using various mathematical constructions .
These are all just different ways of describing a mathematical object ; but as one of my college professors ( expert in comparative religion ) was fond of saying , map is not territory .
Description of an object does not an object make .
If these various and sundry descriptions all describe the same thing , then that thing must be independent of the descriptions .
Constructive mathematics does not construct its objects , it describes them .
It would be the height of hubris to suggest otherwise ; after all , numbers do not depend on the exertions of mathematicians for their continued existence .
The vitality of the Container Fiction demonstrates the power of the Iconic Fallacy .
Values do not contain , but syntactic expressions do .
We think that an ordered pair ( a , b ) contains a and b .
It does n't , but the graphical form , using parentheses , strongly implies that containment is involved .
This is the Iconic Fallacy : false inference about the nature of the thing signified drawn from the form of the signifier .
An expression like [ 1,2,3 ] " looks like " a list of integers ; it does not therefore follow that it is ( or denotes ) a list of integers .
It would be more accurate to say it is a construction that uses a list of integers to denote a value .
The expression " [ 1,2,3 ] " represents application of a morphism ( the [ ] functor ) to an argument ; if its denoted value contains 1 , 2 , and 3 , then does the denoted value of $ \sqrt 4 $ contain $ 4 $ ?
Part of the problem is that " List " ( i.e. [ ] ) is misnamed , implying that ' [ a ] ' is a list .
It 's named after the target end of the arrow ; a proper name would be something like " TypToList " , thus emphasizing that it is a morphism .
This may seem like so much philosophical splitting of hairs , but it 's not .
On the contrary , it correlates with one of the fundamental insights of category theory , namely , elements do n't matter .
I believe it 's very important for learners of Haskell ( or any FPL with lazy evaluation ) not only to learn to think in terms of mathematics , but also to learn to think about how mathematical notation works .
I speak from experience ; when I first picked up Haskell I used a book that insisted that something like " x = Foo 1 ( 2,3 ) 'a ' " means that x contains 1 , and ( 2,3 ) , and 'a ' .
That did n't match up with the ideas I had formed about algebraic data types , so I eventually ended up dropping the whole thing in exasperation .
More specifically : it 's important ( essential ? ) to realize that we can only talk about values indirectly .
On the one hand that means we have to use a language with syntax , obviously .
But it 's deeper than that .
We can only talk about mathematical objects by " triangulating " using other , related mathematical objects .
As a concrete example consider an ordered pair ( 1,2 ) .
Disregarding syntax , lambda expressions , etc. , the value ( 1,2 ) is a primitive object that is the image of 1 , 2 under the mapping ( ) .
The only way we can talk about it is to use these three things .
Not the " contents " of ( 1,2 ) - it has no contents - but the things we used to construct ( describe ) it , which are completely distinct from the thing itself .
The most important reason to learn to think like this is that it is the primary idiom of category theory .
For example , in CT terms , something like ( 1,2 ) is treated as an opaque object together with two projection arrows fst and snd .
No contents involved , just an object and two mappings .
The internal structure of the object is irrelevant .
Saunders MacLane says somewhere that CT is about " learning to live without elements " ; applied to Haskell , that means learning to live without containers .

It 's only their second day in court , and The Pirate Bay already seems to be winning the legal battle against the plaintiffs - Universal , Warner Bros , MGM , EMI , 20th Century Fox , Colombia Pictures , and Sony BMG .
According to TorrentFreak , half of the charges against The Pirate Bay have already been dropped due to lack of evidence .
Therefore , the prosecutor has dropped all charges related to " assisting copyright infringement , " with the remaining charges being related to " assisting making available . "
It seems that the prosecutor was simply unable to prove that the .torrent files - which are important evidence in this case - are in any way related to The Pirate Bay 's torrent tracker .
So , the Swedish court seems to have recognized that a torrent search engine , which does n't store actual copyrighted files , cannot be guilty of copyright infringement .
This is already a huge victory for The Pirate Bay , even if they lose on other charges - which now seems unlikely .
What seemed to be a long legal battle might turn into a short ( and sweet , for The Pirate Bay ) affair .

Hi !
Note that I 'm not giving google much advance warning : I mentioned few of those issues on irc , but they seemed not welcome there .
And purpose of security system of t- mobile g1 is not to protect owner from evil attacker ; rather it prevents owner from using his phone .
g1 , as shipped , will not for example allow connecting your notebook to the internet .
( I have czech version of g1 ; you can't simply downgrade it to rc8/rc29 , as it is prevented by CID check ) .
Yes , I want to get root on my shiny new t-mobile g1 .
I tried exploiting dnotify hole that was fixed in 2.6.25.1 ... only to find out that CONFIG_DNOTIFY is off in g1 kernel .
So I made sure that CONFIG_INOTIFY is on , and tried exploiting 6ee5a399d6a92a52646836a6e10 faf255c16393e .
It triggers very reliably ... with SLAB debugging on .
With debugging off , it took 2 + hours to reproduce on PC .
Given that I 'd have to manually insert / remove SD card for each try , that is not an option .
I thought that rooting 2.6.25 would be easy , but it turns out it is lot harder than I expected .
I discovered few problems ( see below ) , most are security - relevant , but none of them is enough to root the phone .
If you have any ideas how to get root on 2.6.25 running on ARM , or where weak spots in android security are , let me know .
( Perhaps by private email ) .

AROUND THE WEB
NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) -- Hanso Devi moved to New Delhi from Rajasthan with just one hope -- to make a better life for herself and her family .
Hanso Devi says she and her family have nowhere else to go .
She , her husband , five children and other relatives erected a hut to live in --- a home that provided shelter and a base for her husband 's streetside blacksmith business .
The problem is that the land they built on belongs to the government .
And the government has decided to take it back .
In a matter of minutes bulldozers level the place , leaving Devi and her family perched on a bed atop a sea of rubble .
They have nowhere to go .
" They did it so fast that there was no time to take out anything .
And the bulldozer broke everything on the way , " Devi said .
" It 's like we were picked up and thrown away , " she said .
Watch how people are living in a wasteland »
Bulldozers razed the makeshift home and hundreds of others earlier this month as the Indian government moves to improve New Delhi for the 2010 Commonwealth Games .
Officials say the land is for a road and the demolitions are simply part of a master plan to clean up the city and move slum - dwellers to proper housing .
But , the government says , there will be no relocation for families like Hanso Devi 's because they do not meet relocation requirements .
The government says they are squatting too close to the road , and are located in a major development zone .
Impact Your World See how you can make a difference
" You see they have encroached on the specific project lengths -- there will be no notice , no relocation projects for them , " said New Delhi Mayor Arti Mehra , who says she and the city are worried about those who have been left homeless .
About 3 million people live in New Delhi 's slums , the government estimates .
Mehra says New Delhi is slated to build 100,000 new apartments , though only 6,800 are under construction .
Critics say demolishing housing that has been here for years and relocating some residents but not others will hurt many who live on the margins of society .
" They 'll be pushed to the brink , " said A.K. Roy of the Hazards Centre Sanchal Foundation , a non-governmental organization .
" Eventually I think what the planners are doing , they are not realizing they 'll be building up a pool of violence . "
The people who live in New Delhi 's slums are some of the city 's maids , drivers , street vendors and day laborers .
Roy argues the city could not survive without the services that the slum dwellers provide .
The slums may not have looked like much to outsiders , but to families who had lived there for years , they were everything .
Their businesses , homes and temples were there .
Now they are lost .
Some huts are still standing , for now .
Among them is the home of Sheila Naurang Lal , built more than 20 years ago by the family who still lives there .
But that is little comfort for Lal as she sees what has happened to the homes a few yards from her house .
" I came to the road yesterday after being scared seeing the bulldozer , " Lal says .
" You must have seen the front part has been broken . "
It has been two days since the latest slum eradication , but families are still eking out a living amid the ruins .
A mother cooks for her children , a 90 - year - old woman with a walker sits on her bed and someone 's pet goat is tied up at a shrine , waiting for its owner .
Hanso Devi looks around as night falls .
She will spend another night in the open with nothing to keep her warm but a small fire .
" We are going to sleep right here .
There is no place other than this . "

Many of us adore our cats ; and it looks like the Japanese regard them like children .
Some Japanese housing builders have come up with designs with special features for cats .
Here are the images from a house called Plus - Nyan house by Asahi Kasei , a leading house builder in Japan .
This could be a dream house for every cat owner and their cats , as it would require great deal of research to design these houses keeping in mind the requirements of the clients and their cats .
Here are a few key features : open air cat walks , climbing steps , cat doors in every door , deck built in to the window , extra space in the bathroom designed for their compartment , cat room hidden under the stairs , special fencing to prevent cats from getting away .
Apart from these , there has been use of cat friendly construction materials as well .
Here is another interesting Cat House Update : Do n't miss the Part - II , here is ' Cat - Friendly House Design - Part : 2 '.
Looking for a Blogging Job ?
Today Lynn Truong ( co- founder of Personal Finance blog Wise Bread ) gives some tips on how to apply for one .
I ’ve read thousands of blogging applications over the last few years .
And while explaining what I look for in a blogger is pretty much like trying to pinpoint what one looks for in a mate – generic and unhelpful for any prospects – I can very clearly describe what prompts me to put an application in the “ no ” pile before I even finish reading it .
Unfortunately , these are the applications I get more than any others .
Eight out of ten applications inevitably go into the trash because of the following .
1. Write in no caps .
Yes , you ’re only applying to a blog , but we still publish all our posts with capital letters and proper grammar .
Hit that shift key when you start a sentence , and refer to yourself as I , not i .
This is a real , paying gig , so be professional .
2 . Use the word blog incorrectly .
A blogger is so much more than a writer , so if you do n’t understand this , at least do n’t announce it .
You can use blog as a verb .
I blog frequently is fine .
You can also refer to our site as a blog .
After all , we are looking for a blogger .
But never call a post or an article , a blog .
Do n’t tell me you can write several blogs for us per day .
Do n’t say you ’ve attached sample blogs .
When in doubt , just use write or articles or site instead .
3 . Provide one link to your blog as writing samples .
It is human nature to be proud of every post on your blog .
Selecting just a few for sampling purposes might feel like I ’m asking you to pick a favorite child .
However , it is not possible for me to look through your entire repertoire .
By selecting two or three of your best posts , you are showing me that you know how to identify great content , and that you ’ve put some thought and effort into the application .
I also use the samples to determine how well you understand the type of posts that fit well on our site .
4 . Let me know I can request writing samples .
Nothing tells me that you ’re sending out mass emails to any publisher around like an email that says “ writing samples can be provided by request . ”
My job posting only asks for two things : topic ideas and writing samples .
Do n’t write me a long cover letter explaining why you ’re perfect for the job , attach your resume ( which I did n’t ask for ) , and then say that I can request writing samples .
Why would I bother hiring anybody I already know I ’ll need to ask twice for anything ?
5 . Spell our site name incorrectly .
If the job description says Wise Bread , please do n’t write Wisebread .
6 . Ask me the next day whether I ’ve gotten your application .
My autoreply message specifically says that we can’t respond to every single applicant , but that we appreciate every application and will consider each one carefully .
During a recruiting round , I get hundreds of applications a day , on top of the daily load of regular emails .
I honestly do n’t know if I ’ve gotten your application .
Most likely I have n’t even read it yet .
All I can do is tell you the exact thing my autoreply already did : “ We ’ll let you know if we find a good fit . ”
I know you want to show that you are a person who takes the initiative , but what you ’re actually doing is slowing down the process for everyone .
7 . Give me a 31 page writing sample .
Do n’t send me your college thesis .
I wo n’t have time to read it and your application wo n’t be considered .
8 . Be a mercenary .
I know serious freelancers write for multiple sites .
But if you tell me you write for 20 different sites , and can do 10 articles a day for us , you ’re telling me that you ’re just a content machine who ’s only concerned about your ROI .
9 . Give me irrelevant writing samples .
You might not have any samples that fit our site ’s topic , but at least pick samples that have the proper tone , length , and style .
I do n’t want a press release , letter of recommendation , or book report you thought was fantastic ( although these can be included as extra samples to show your range ) .
10 .
Tell me your life story .
Getting to know bloggers and connecting with them on a personal level is my favorite part of the job .
The cover letter is a way to let your personality shine through , as well as make you stand out in the sea of generic cover letters .
However , your cover letter is not the appropriate place to talk about your personal problems or struggles that are not related to the position .
Please only give me relevant experiences and tell me how you feel about our site .
Keep it professional , please .
11 . Ask for more information without including an application .
Sometimes I get an email that says “ I ’d like to apply , but would like to get more information first . ”
I understand that some writers are wary about sending writing samples , because some unscrupulous site burned you before and published your samples without your permission .
But you have to tell me what additional information you are looking for , so I can properly respond .
Concluding Thoughts
Many bloggers miss out on great gigs because they simply do n’t take the application process seriously .
Sure , blogs generally are n’t as corporate and stuffy .
I might be in my PJs reading your application in bed , but that does n’t mean I ’m still not looking for bloggers who show professionalism .
Keep in mind that writing for a quality blog can really raise your profile .
Many of the great bloggers we have hired from the Problogger Job Board get frequent mentions and interviews from major news outlets like the New York Times , ABC , FOX , CNBC , and Self Magazine .
Many of our bloggers also contributed to our upcoming book , 100,001 Ways to Live Large on a Small Budget , which will allow them to put the coveted “ published author ” designation on their resumes .
It is therefore worth your effort to complete a professional and compelling application .
My biggest tip for anyone applying for a blogging job ( any job , really ) is to read the job posting carefully .
All the information and instructions you need is there , so just pay attention .
It ’s fine to send extra information and materials , but make sure to include everything that is asked for .
I hope these tips can prevent otherwise talented bloggers from missing out on great blogging opportunities !

Not your typical list of long distance activities …
People in long distance relationships can have a hard time staying connected , because couples are limited in what they can do together .
Many are limited to phone calls , emails , instant messaging , and texting which can become a bit humdrum over time , if you ask me .
It is important to keep things interesting .
Here is a list of things you can do with your boyfriend / girlfriend as well as things you can do for them from a distance .
The ideas get more interesting as you go through the list !
If you have an idea for the list , please email us at info@lovingfromadistance.com ~ Michelle & Frank 123 4567891011 »
1. Watch movies or TV shows simultaneously together !
This activity takes the # 1 spot on our list because it is the activity that Frank and I LOVED TO DO THE MOST whenever we were apart .
There are various ways of doing this .
Most couples like to have contact while watching a movie together and do so over the phone and / or instant messenger and / or on their webcams 🙂
You can each go out and physically rent the same movie and watch it together or you can access a streaming movie online .
Frank and I used to both have subscriptions to Netflix .
I bought Frank a subscription as a gift when I got one for myself .
Here ’s a show about a long distance relationship you can watch together !
Some other places you can watch movies and television shows online : YouTube and Amazon both offer movies you can rent online .
Use the links to be taken directly to their online movie rental / video on demand pages .
Frank and I have tried both and they work awesome 😀

2 . Send your boyfriend / girlfriend flowers !
There are lots of websites that will deliver flowers for you , but if you do n’t want to spend money sending a real bouquet , you can send a virtual bouquet using this website .
I just got done sending Frank some roses myself 🙂 Virtualflowers.com
Want to send real flowers ?
ProFlowers has affordable prices .

3. Learn new things about each other with 1000 Questions !
Think you have run out of everything you could say to each other ?
Try this ….
When it ’s one of those days where you guys just ca n’t think of anything to talk about , try asking questions .
Here ’s a list of 100 questions to ask your love : 100 Questions to Ask Your Partner .
These questions are great discussion starters .
For even more questions check out 1,000 Questions For Couples .
I got this e-book myself and Frank during a rough time in our relationship .
We were running out of things to say , and we were arguing a lot , mainly because we had nothing else to talk about .
So I got this book and Frank and I spent hours one night asking each other the questions .
It was so memorable , and we had more fun than what we had in a long time .
The questions are split up into categories such as Attractions , Past & Future , Money , Pets , Sex , and tons more .
You ’ll learn so much about each other , stuff you never knew and / or never thought to ask .
On a side note , by going through this e-book together , it will make it easy to bring up difficult questions you may have wanted to ask your boyfriend / girlfriend but were afraid to ask .
4. Share LDR bracelets .
Love knows no distance TM bracelets were created by Frank and I for long distance couples .
We started offering them in 2009 and couples all over the world wear them as a reminder to stay strong while they are apart .
We ship them ourselves and our order form includes an option to add a printed gift message with a photo for free ! 🙂
If you take a look at our bracelet page , you can see photos couples have submitted of them and their significant other wearing the bracelets ( both together and apart ) .
If you do n’t like wearing bracelets , there is a keychain option as well !
To check them out go here :
Long Distance Relationship Bracelets Includes FREE long distance relationship quote prints in every package !
5 . Send an e-card !
E-cards are virtual cards , usually with animation and sound .
They can be funny , romantic , and cheesy , so what ’s not to love ?
6. HoochyMail !
HoochyMail is a website where you enter information and it automatically generates a story with your names in a MadLib type fashion .
You choose the story level : sexy , x-rated , or off the wall .
I did this for Frank , and cried laughing reading the story the website generated .
7 . Say cheese !
This dates us a little bit ( we were long distance between 2006 - 2011 ) but before Frank and I had webcams and smartphones , I would occasionally take a picture and email it to him so he could see me .
He always loved it 🙂
If he was having a bad day they would cheer him up .
Of course , now we are in a world where you can share photos instantly via text , messengers like Facebook Messenger , and photo sharing apps like Snapchat and Instagram .
I keep this idea here as a reminder for couples to share photos with each other – fun selfies and moments from your day that you want to share with just him / her that you do n’t post to everyone on your public newsfeeds .
Here are some other picture related ideas : WordFoto.com has an “ app that turns your photos and words into amazing typographic works of art . ”

When you visit Shutterfly via Loving From A Distance you can get 50 Free 4×6 Prints , One Free Magnet , and One Free Set of Address Labels !
8 . Share a journal .
I wanted to do this with Frank , but he ’s lazy .
I had this brilliant idea for us to share a journal .
I would keep it for a couple weeks or so , and write in it everyday with my thoughts , and then mail it to Frank , and he could keep the journal and write in it , and it would just keep going back and forth .
I thought it was a good idea .
Maybe your boyfriends / girlfriends will be more willing participants than Frank !
Other journal ideas ?
You could also each have your own journals that you can exchange .
Or have an online journal .
Here are a couple sites : Xanga.com and LiveJournal.com .
These both have privacy controls so you can control who sees your journal .
9. Video chat !
For most couples , this is an obvious “ thing to do , ” but for those that have met online and maybe have only seen pics of each other , seeing each other face - to - face on a webcam or FaceTime for the first time can be a little daunting .
But trust me , after you get over the hurdle of having your first video chat , you ’ll realize it ’s not such a big deal !
There are many ways to video chat – via phone , Skype , Google Hangouts , and ooVoo .
10 . Play a game together .
Frank and I just love playing multiplayer games together online .
Check out our list of multiplayer games that you can play with your boyfriend / girlfriend here : Multiplayer Games for LDR Couples

if you ’ve ever wanted to get up to the smell of bacon this is for you .
designed by american designers
matty sallin , daniel bartolini , hsiao - huh hsu , the ‘ wake n bacon ’ alarm clock cooks a strip of bacon , ready to eat when the alarm goes off .
so how does it work ?
a frozen strip of bacon is placed in ‘ wake n’ bacon ’ the night before .
because there is a 10 minute cooking time , the clock is set to go off 10 minutes before the desired waking time .
once the alarm goes off , the clock it sends a signal to a small speaker to generate the alarm sound .
we hacked the clock so that the signal is re-routed by a microchip that in responds by sending a signal to a relay that throws the switch to power two halogen lamps that slow - cook the bacon in about 10 minutes .

GENEVA , Switzerland ( CNN ) --
The Obama administration has been talking about " pressing the reset button " with Russia after relations " crashed " when Russia invaded Georgia last August .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laugh about their " reset ' button .
When Secretary of State Hillary Clinton greeted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday before sitting down to their working dinner , she presented him a small green box with a ribbon .
Inside was a red button with the Russian word " peregruzka " printed on it .
" I would like to present you with a little gift that represents what President Obama and Vice President Biden and I have been saying and that is : ' We want to reset our relationship and so we will do it together . ' "
Clinton , laughing , added , " We worked hard to get the right Russian word .
Do you think we got it ? " she asked Lavrov .
" You got it wrong , " Lavrov said . "
Both diplomats laughed .
" It should be " perezagruzka " ( the Russian word for reset , ) Lavrov said .
" This says ' peregruzka , ' which means ' overcharged . ' "
The question came up at the news conference afterward .
" In a way , the word that 's on the button turns out to be also true , " Clinton said .
" We are resetting , and because we are resetting , the minister and I have an overload of work . "
Asked by a Russian reporter whether he had pressed the button , Lavrov said that he and Clinton did , indeed .
" It is big and red and I hope that Russia and the United States , and other countries will never press on another button which used to be associated with a destructive war , " he said .
The " overload , " Clinton said , is a broad agenda of issues .
" We are going to systematically go through each and every one of them , " she added .
Clinton said the two sides will get to work on re-negotiating a follow - up to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and nonproliferation .
On other issues like Afghanistan , the Middle East and Iran , Clinton said , " We will work through them . "
On issues where there is disagreement , Clinton said , " We are keeping those on the list because , we think through closer cooperation and building trust in each other , we can even tackle some of those differences . "
Lavrov agreed the burden of the agenda for the two countries is " enormous , " but added : " I do n't think either Hillary or I have any desire to be freed from any burden . "
Clinton called the encounter " a very productive meeting of the minds . "
She said both Lavrov and she are " very practical - minded " and will create a " specific set of objectives and responsibilities " to present to presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev before the leaders ' first face - to - face meeting in April at the G - 20 meeting in London .
On the START treaty , she said Russia and the United States intend to have an agreement by the end of this year when the treaty expires and are " going to get to work immediately " on it .
Lavrov was asked about Russian intentions to install S - 300 missiles in Iran .
He said the decision " will be made exclusively on the basis of law in accordance with Russian law , and will be under expert control , which is one of the strictest in the world and of course in accordance with international agreements . "
Lavrov said the weapons Russia provides to its partners are " nondestabilizing , defensive weapons . "
In an apparent reference to U.S. military supplies to Georgia , Lavrov said , " We want our partners to act the same way and show restraint in military supplies to those countries where , including very recently , those weapons have been used very close to our borders . "
Senior U.S. officials who briefed reporters afterward , however , said they had not read Georgia into the minister 's comments .
They said the discussion ranged broadly over a number of areas and " we now have a very substantive work agenda that they just outlined . "
" It would have been easier and in a first meeting almost natural to be much more general but in this case it was very focused and very productive in laying out steps , " one official said .
On the proposed missile defense system the United States is considering installing in Poland and the Czech Republic , one official said , " Minister Lavrov made it clear he had listened quite attentively to Secretary Clinton 's comments about missile defense ... and I think it 's got them thinking .

For one dexterous octopus , an attempt at a great escape turned into a great flood Thursday at the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium in California .
The female California two - spotted octopus swam to the top of her tank , disassembled a valve with her powerful arm , and released at least 200 gallons ( 757 liters ) of seawater into nearby exhibits and offices .
The foot - long ( 0.3 - meter ) creature remained in her tank and survived her ordeal .
But the aquarium 's brand - new floors were n't so lucky .
Such high jinks are typical of the invertebrates ' still unexplained smarts , experts say .
" Octopuses have a wonderful combination of intelligence , tremendous manipulative ability , curiosity , and strength , " said Jennifer Mather , a psychology professor at Canada 's University of Lethbridge who has studied cognition in octopuses .
" So the result is that everybody who has ever kept octopuses has a string of stories about how octopuses can go where they want in aquariums . "
Unbelievably Brainy ?
Many octopuses show behavior that suggests curiosity , consciousness , and even a sense of humor , said Eugene Linden , author of the 2002 book The Octopus and the Orangutan : More True Tales of Animal Intrigue , Intelligence , and Ingenuity .
In one instance , an octopus given a slightly spoiled shrimp stuffed it down the drain while maintaining eye contact with its keeper , Linden said .
Wild octopuses have also been found to maintain " homes " and can remember where they 've been in their neighborhood , pointing to a sort of self - awareness , Lethbridge 's Mather said .
But it 's hard to directly prove that octopuses are intelligent .
A smart animal that has the lowly clam for a cousin already " flies in the face of conventional wisdom of where you look for intelligence , " Linden said .
Also , many scientists believe that intelligent beings are social , learn from others , and need a long lifespan to accrue brainpower .
Octopuses live only about a year and are solitary animals .
" It 's enjoyable to speculate that nature does n't always follow our rules [ when ] it decides to create an intelligent being , " Linden said .
Fast Decisions
The University of Lethbridge 's Mather suggests octopuses may have evolved braininess to cope with a highly complex environment — usually coral reefs — where they must make lightning - fast , life - or - death decisions .
For example , the animals are extremely flexible , able to fit their boneless bodies through tiny cracks .
Some species can change color in a thirtieth of a second .
As for the crafty cephalopod in Santa Monica , aquarium staffers have rigged her tank with clamps and tape to thwart future getaways , the Los Angeles Times reported .
The fundamental rules that Canadians live under are really very simple when it comes to how laws can be created , changed and / or set aside , and there are two aspects of " the law " which ought to be almost as simple to apply in any case of alleged crime ...
1 ) Canada 's Constitution
Act ( the most basic law in the land , which lays out the rules under which every law in the nation must come into being ) , and the Interpretation Act ( which lays out the rules under which judges may and may not interpret and apply legal statutes ) both state very plainly that the enactment , amendment and repeal of laws ( that means * all* laws ) is the duty and sole jurisdiction of Parliament ... not of " Government " ( the party / parties holding nominal power over policy and its implementation ) , but of " Parliament " ( the entire elected legislative body which represents every voter in every electoral riding in Canada ) .
POL * Parliament ONLY has power to Legislate :
2 ) Courts may strike a law down entirely if there 's a reason in law that they should do so , but they have no power to enact or to substantively amend any law ... and both the Constitution Act and the Interpretation Act are very clear about this .
COA * Courts may Only Abrogate a law they have the authority to judge .
GOVERNMENT vs. THE LAW
These two fundamental rules look simple and obvious ( and they 're also THE LAW in capital letters ) , so the acronym " POL - COA " really ought to be simple enough to remind all prosecutors , judges and legislators of their duties if they care to hear its truth .
Even so , after several years of having ordinary citizens who do understand it drum it into their heads , it still seems that this POL - COA idea is a very difficult concept for our judges and legislators to grasp in any practical sense – * despite * all their experience and training .
However , if you 're a defendant in a cannabis case , your defence is really as easy as A - B-C :
A ) Cannabis prohibition laws in Canada ( specifically about possession and by implication cultivation ) were declared unconstitutional when Ontario 's Court of Appeal last adjudicated Terry Parker 's original case in July 2000 and Canada did not appeal that decision .
B ) Only hours before the end of the ONE year suspension of that judgement ( suspended to allow time for Government to craft and Parliament to enact a new law / amendment allowing the use and possession of Cannabis as medicine ) , Parliament still had not yet been offered a new Bill to consider , let alone passed a new law .
Instead , Canada 's Government ( Paul Martin 's Liberals at the time ) announced and put into force an Order In Council : some regulations ( The Marihuana Medical Access Regulations ) that modified the unconstitutional Cannabis prohibition law – but the MMAR were only a set of unlegislated regulations trying to fundamentally alter a dying law .
Government did this with neither the consideration nor the assent of Parliament .
No new law has been enacted yet to replace what has been struck down by the Parker decision .

This column is about tainted medical research , not MMR .
Now do n't get me wrong : it 's still an interesting week to be right about vaccines .
Brian Deer in the Sunday Times claimed that the medical cases in Andrew Wakefield 's 1998 paper were altered before publication .
The measles figures came out : they 're up by 2,000 % over the last seven years , and rising exponentially .
On Friday , the Autism Omnibus court hearing in the US - a massive two - year case involving 5,000 children - ruled there was no evidence for MMR causing autism ( nor for the mercury preservative thimerosal ) .
There is no reason to believe that MMR causes autism .
The anti-vaccine campaigners will continue to mislead , stifle , or even smear .
But it 's important to keep your head and not be polarised by the other side 's foolishness : because there are plenty of genuine problems in vaccine research , even if the campaigners have focused on a bad - and perhaps simplistic - example .
The British Medical Journal this week publishes a complex study that is quietly one of the most subversive pieces of research ever printed .
It analyses every study ever done on the influenza vaccine - although it 's reasonable to assume that its results might hold for other subject areas - looking at whether funding source affected the quality of a study , the accuracy of its summary , and the eminence of the journal in which it was published .
Now , in my utopian universe , it would n't matter where a piece of research was published , or how bad its summary was , because everybody would read everything with a joyful and attentive anality .
Back in the real world , it has been estimated that each month , journals publish more than 7,000 items - studies , letters , and editorials - relevant to GP care , as just one example .
New research is important , but to read and critically appraise all this material would take physicians trained in epidemiology over 600 hours .
So inevitably people will read summaries - the " take home message " - and only the bigger journals .
We already know that industry - funded studies are more likely to give a positive result for the sponsors ' drug , and in this case too , government - funded studies were less likely to have conclusions favouring the vaccines .
We already know that poorer quality studies are more likely to produce positive results - for drugs , for homeopathy , for anything - and 70 % of the studies they reviewed were of poor quality .
And it has also been shown that industry - funded studies are more likely to overstate their results in their conclusions .
But Tom Jefferson and colleagues looked , for the first time , at where studies are published .
Academics measure the eminence of a journal by its " impact factor " : an indicator of how commonly , on average , research papers in that journal go on to be referred to by other research papers .
The average journal impact factor for the 92 government - funded studies was 3.74 ; for the 52 studies wholly or partly funded by industry , the average impact factor was 8.78 .
Studies funded by the pharmaceutical industry are massively more likely to get into the bigger , more respected journals .
That 's interesting , because there is no explanation for it .
There was no difference in methodological rigour , or quality , between the government - funded research and the industry - funded research .
There was no difference in the size of the samples used in the studies .
And there 's no difference in where people submit their articles : everybody wants to get into a big famous journal , and everybody tries their arm at it .
An unkind commentator , of course , might suggest one reason why industry trials are more successful with their submissions .
Journals are businesses , run by huge international corporations , and they rely on advertising revenue from industry , but also on the phenomenal profits generated by selling glossy " reprints " of studies , and nicely presented translations , which drug reps around the world can then use .
Anyone who thought this an unkind suggestion might need to come up with an alternative explanation for the observed data .
This study is a fascinating example of the academic community turning in on itself , and using the tools of statistics and quantitative analysis to identify a nasty political and cultural problem , and give legs to a hunch .
This could and should be done more , in all fields of human conduct .
But the greater tragedy is that the problem Jefferson and colleagues have revealed could easily be fixed .
In an ideal world , all drugs research would be commercially separate from manufacturing and retail , and all journals would be open and free .
But until then , since academics are obliged to declare all significant drug company funding on all academic articles , it might not be too much to ask that once a year , since their decisions are so hugely influential , all editors and publishers should post all their sources of income , and all the money related to the running of their journal .
Because at the moment , the funny thing is that we just do n't know how they work .
It ’s grim for Small firms across the UK
The victims are putting the blame firmly at the door of the nation ’s “ lend nothing ” banks as they see a crucial sector of the UK economy , that employs 13 million people and provides vital services across the country , disappear down the drain .
“ Small firms are facing a lethal cocktail of rising costs and falling trade , ” said Stephen Alambritis of the Federation of Small Businesses which represents 215,000 UK companies employing up to 50 people each .
“ We are losing many vibrant small businesses that are the mainstay of the UK economy , like the street corner stores that provide vital services for the elderly , the infirm , the single parents , catering for people who ca n’t do their shopping at supermarkets .
“ We are going to lose all that for ever unless the banks release more money .
The Government has to be stronger with the banks .
“ The main culprits are the banks that have been helped out , but are still holding out on giving help to small businesses . ”
The FSB says the current crop of local branch bank managers across the country are too young to have been faced before with difficult commercial finance decisions .
“ The average age of a bank manager these days is 44 .
In the last recession in 1990 they would have been junior bank workers aged only 25 , ” said Mr Alambritis .
“ They are frightened by what they currently face .
Small businesses are still viable but they do n’t want to help . ”
Last week the Sunday Express talked to Small businesses across the country – family firms run by people called Small – to see how they are coping with the financial crisis .
We found hard - working people frustrated at every turn as they try to make a living .
Many of these family businesses have been trading for generations , but said they now have real fears for their future .
LOIS SMALL , Physiotherapist : “ The costs of running a business are rocketing , ” said Lois , 46 , who set up her physiothermic clinic in Birmingham 12 years ago .
But she has taken a brave move in a bid to ride out the recession .
“ It would n’t be fair to pass on the extra costs to my loyal customers , ” said Lois .
“ My profits are taking a hit , but this recession ca n’t last forever and I want to come out at the other end having kept my clientele . ”
JOHN SMALL , Electrical shop owner : “ I ’ve seen and survived recessions before but I ’ve never experienced one like this , ” said John , a 52 - year - old father of two , who has been trading in Watford , Hertfordshire , for 30 years .
He is furious at the fat - cat bankers and the bonus culture that he blames for hitting hard - working businessmen like him .
“ If I got things as wrong as these so - called city slickers I ’d be out of business with no prospect of anyone bailing me out .
" I fail to see why people who have messed with the economy and put businesses like mine at risk can still qualify for their mega - bonuses .
" Bank bosses should be punished for the damage they have caused to the economy , but instead they ’re still being rewarded .
It defies logic , does n’t it ? ”
The takings at John ’s shop have plunged , but he is determined to fight to save his business .
Fingers crossed , he added : “ Word of mouth for good service has kept me going here and hopefully that will continue . ”
PAUL SMALL , Heating engineer : “ I ’d definitely think twice about starting up a business today , ” said Paul , 47 , who runs his firm from his home in Swindon , Wiltshire .
“ Literally everyone is haggling and price - checking these days as they watch every penny and make sure they are getting the best deal .

FriendFeed is a social media feed aggregator that makes it easy to follow many different individuals ’ various social activities on the Web all in one convenient place , instead of jumping from service to service ( and having to create new accounts ad infinitum ! ) to see what the people you ’re most interested in are doing .
It ’s basically a continuous river of information that you can use as a virtual water cooler of news and content , but it ’s also interactive – you ’re encouraged to comment on other people ’s stories , “ like ” something that resonates with you , and more .
If you ’re looking for something that is a one - stop solution for a variety of different content frames : feed readers , micro-blogging , images , etc , then FriendFeed is a good fit .
Let ’s look at a few tips for both beginning and more advanced FriendFeed users that can help you make this service as useful as possible .
FriendFeed : Basic Tweaks
Signing Up
Signing up at FriendFeed is easy .
Just come up with a username , and then start adding all the services you ’d like to trickle through your FriendFeed stream .
Adding Services
For the most part , you wo n’t need specific service URLs , just usernames ( Facebook and Linked In both require specific feed URLs , which is somewhat tedious ) .
Once you have your different media outlets all plugged in , it ’s time to play with your FriendFeed settings , found by clicking on the Account link .
Settings
This is where you can specify how you want your FriendFeed stream to be seen , decide if you want email notifications , or set up IM pings to your Google Talk or Jabber account for specific activities : a comment on your post , activity from friends , etc .
Following People
In order to get the most out of FriendFeed , it ’s important that you find people to follow , and then comment on what they ’ve shared .
Interact .
Become part of the FriendFeed community to make it a more intuitive , useful service .
The more you interact , the more FriendFeed will be able to personalize your friend recommendations and your FriendFeed stream will get more interesting since you ’ll be learning from other people .
Finding Friends
How do you find friends ?
Click on the Friends tab , and you can use your email contacts to initially find people to follow .
Once you have shared a few things on FriendFeed , you can click the Recommended tab on the Friends page for people FriendFeed thinks might be of interest to you .
Friend Organization
You can also find interesting people by joining FriendFeed “ rooms ” – there ’s a long list at http://FriendFeed.com/rooms/search.
Rooms are basically private chat rooms you can use to talk about specific topics : holiday recipes , social media , the Super Bowl , etc .
Once you ’ve got a good list of people that you ’re following , it ’s time to get organized .
In order to make this as meaningful and structured as possible , divide your friends into Lists , found on the FriendFeed Favorites page .
Personal and Professional are already laid out ; you can create more groups as you need them .
FriendFeed is also a sneaky way to get around joining every new kid on the social media block , because you can see what people are doing whether or not they ’re on FriendFeed .
You can do this with the Imaginary Friends feature , found in your Friends settings .
FriendFeed : Advanced Tweaks
Filtering Information
How do you cut down the FriendFeed noise to signal ratio ?
Can you limit which services you see ?
Say you do n’t want to see every mundane ( I like soup )
Tweet , or every Facebook status ( Joe is working ) update .
You can limit your FriendFeed information feed by using the Hide feature , a simple yet effective way to instantly filter what you want to hear from a specific user or service .
Getting More Traffic
FriendFeed is also a great way to get more traffic to your personal site or blog ( if that ’s what you ’re looking for ) .
Since your feed is part of the FriendFeed info stream , once people read it they have the ability to give it a thumbs - up , comment , etc .
If they like it , that particular piece of content gets shared with all THEIR friends , and on and on .
It ’s a snowball effect .
Creating Specialized Groups with Search
FriendFeed has added a Search feature recently , which ( obviously ) enables you to find specific information , but also to create a personalized group of people who are writing exactly about what you want to read .
Add this to your FriendFeed List , say about “ google innovations , ” and you ’ve just created an extremely up - to - date source of information .
Comments
Follow the comments you ( and the people you follow ) make to find new people to follow .
Sometimes the conversations on FriendFeed are the best ways to discover new content or find new people to track .
Desktop Clients
If you do n’t feel like having FriendFeed take up browser space , you can use a FriendFeed desktop client to stay on top of everything .
So far , there are n’t a lot of candidates in this space , but Alert Thingy , Twhirl , and Eluma are worth a look ( for more reviews of FriendFeed desktop clients , read My Search For The Perfect FriendFeed Desktop Tool [ List ] .
Sharing with a Bookmarklet
If you ’re more of a sharer than a talker , then the FriendFeed bookmarklet is right up your alley .
This simple tool allows you to share anything from all over the Web directly to your FriendFeed .
FriendFeed : A Useful Service
FriendFeed , while known mostly for its capability as a social media aggregator , also provides myriad opportunities for connecting with other like - minded people – as well as deep , well - connected , almost real time research that would be difficult to replicate anywhere else .
It ’s simple to set up , easy to personalize , and I ’m sure we ’re seeing the tip of the iceberg as far as FriendFeed innovations ; for instance , I ’d love to see the ability to customize real - time views of my FriendFeed streams with specific topics or cluster different rooms into one rich feed .

News Corporation is flagging job cuts after posting a quarterly loss of nearly $ 10 billion .
The $ 9.7 billion loss is the result of a slump in advertising revenue as well a $ 12.9 billion write - down for the value of its Dow Jones acquisition , television broadcasting licences and other assets .
Most arms of the media group suffered substantial falls in revenue in the final three months of last year .
" It 's the worst global economic crisis we 've witnessed since Newscorp was established more than 50 years ago , " News Corp 's chief executive Rupert Murdoch said .
The company 's Australian newspapers reported an 18 per cent drop in quarterly profit because of the weak advertising market and costs associated with redundancies .
" The downturn is more severe and likely longer lasting than previously thought , " Mr Murdoch said .
" We are implementing rigorous cost - cutting across all operations and reducing head count where appropriate . "
But Mr Murdoch is confident the global economy will rebound .
News Corp also owns the Fox television network , 20th Century Fox movie studio , the MySpace online social network , satellite TV network Sky , and newspapers throughout the United States , Britain and Australia .
" It 's advertising and DVDs - they 're more exposed to advertising than you want to be in this kind of climate , " market analyst David Joyce said .
Shares of News Corp fell as much as 3.5 per cent to $ US6.70 ( $ 10.28 ) in after - hours trading .
News Corp has cut its fiscal 2009 operating income forecast , now seeing a decline of 30 per cent versus its previous forecast for a fall in the mid-teen percentages .
Harry Potter Books Redesigned as Penguin Classic Editions
Amazon's Kindle
Texas Instrument 's Speak & Spell
The artist M.S. Corley has redesigned the Harry Potter book covers to make them look like important , weighty Penguin Classics : Suddenly , the Harry Potter books are simmering , dangerous literature that gets deep at the root of the human experience .
OR MAYBE THEY ALWAYS WERE .
The opposite can be accomplished as well , like these chick - lit redesigns of important literary Works at Radar Online
And then there 's the real deal , such as when a former hack writer gets big - time apotheosis and his or her work moves from cheap pulp to understated immortality .
Like when Philip K . Dick got picked up by the Library of America : You can sell books by not selling them .
You can package books by stripping them naked .
In the future , you 'll be able to pick your favorite cover from all of history to temporarily persist on the front of your ebook reader , lifting your novel to the sacred - human - condition heights or dragging it down into the tawdry , sex - and - murder depths .
Book cover design will hit a tremendous renaissance ( the renaissance of CHOICE ) as soon as publishers get their shit together and demand more from ebook readers : namely , that covers are displayed for all the world to see , and not buried as part of the strange graphing calculator aesthetic that we are currently being sold .
I look at David naked and think , ' You done good , girl ! ' - Victoria Beckham to Marie Claire last month .

US scientists have demonstrated the remarkable power of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) by adapting it to create 3D nanoscale pictures of a tobacco mosaic virus .
The team , led by Daniel Rugar at IBM ’s Almaden Research Center in California , hope their nano - MRI will eventually allow researchers to analyse the three - dimensional structure of large biological molecules at atomic resolution , without damaging samples .
Rugar ’s group have been developing the technique , termed magnetic resonance force microscopy ( MRFM ) , for almost two decades .
Like standard MRI , it images samples placed in a magnetic field , by picking up the radio waves nuclei emit when their spin states react ( ’ resonate ’ ) to an external radiofrequency pulse .
But conventional MRI can only image samples down to a resolution of 40 micrometres because it relies on electric coils to detect the magnetic resonance .
In MRFM , however , magnetic resonance is detected mechanically .
The sample sits on the end of a tiny silicon cantilever to which a radio frequency magnetic field is applied via a magnetic tip .
When the frequency is exactly tuned to the ’ wobbling ’ frequency of nuclei in the sample , they flip rapidly between spinning in the ’up ’ and ’ down ’ directions , making the cantilever vibrate .
Using a laser to detect these vibrations , Rugar ’s team created proton density images of tobacco mosaic virus particles ( which are about 18 nanometres across ) .
The researchers say that not only can they detect proton spin to achieve a resolution of just 4 nanometres , they can do it in three dimensions by scanning through slices of the sample .
In this way , says Rugar , their technique goes one better than scanning tunnelling and atomic force microscopes .
’ Despite how powerful these instruments are , they ’re lacking the ability to see below the surface , ’ says Rugar .
’ The key to three dimensional imaging is to get good resolution even when you ’re relatively far from your probe tip and that ’s what is lacking in scanning tunnelling and atomic force microscopy . ’
The researchers say they can achieve good resolution when the probe tip is as far as 50 nanometres from the sample .
Giant leap
Rugar ’s work represents a giant leap , says Beat Meier , who studies nuclear magnetic resonance at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich .
Indeed , the team have improved on the 90 nanometre resolution they achieved just two years ago by a factor of more than 20 .
And in addition , says Meier , no other technique is so generally applicable .
’ Rugar ’s technique will apply to most compounds , ’ he says .
Rugar says there is still plenty of room for improvement , by making magnetic tips that produce more intense magnetic fields and reducing noise from small disturbances of the cantilever .
John Sidles , an MRFM expert at Washington University who helped to develop the basic technique in 1991 , says the IBM group have made a big step towards one of the oldest dreams of scientists - atomic resolution of undenatured biological specimens .
Unlike electron microscopy , MRFM does little damage to biological structures .
Unfortunately , notes Sidles , there is a price to be paid .
’ The imaging times from the IBM experiment are long , so the hardware will need to improve quite a bit before this becomes a routine tool for structural analysis . ’
Rugar concedes that gaining enough information to build a 3D image can be tedious - it requires scanning a sample from up to 8,000 different positions for a minute at a time .
But , he points out , compared to X - ray crystallography , it ’s a much speedier way to determine protein structure .
’ Even if it is fairly slow , you ’re competing against something that ’s a very time consuming process .
Crystallising a protein can take anywhere from months , to years , to never - many things can’t even be crystallised . ’
Another problem the team face is gaining more detailed chemical information than just proton density .
Because not all nuclei are magnetic , explains Rugar , only certain elements , such as hydrogen , phosphorus and fluorine , can be imaged using MRFM .
The team are therefore resorting to an old trick of NMR spectroscopists to scan for carbon .
’ It ’s very common for chemists to substitute carbon - 13 for carbon - 12 , because ordinary carbon - 12 is not magnetic , ’ says Rugar .
’ This might be a very powerful technique . ’
What interests Sidles , however , is the challenge that emerging MRFM technology presents to theorists .
’ It ’s a challenge for theoreticians just to keep up with the advance of experiment .
One thing we theorists can do is to help everybody be confident that in another few years atomic resolution will become an absolute routine tool of chemistry , ’ he says .

OCAU News Koala Bears Heatwave
Well , 3 people have sent me these pics now , so I 'd better post them !
Thanks to Lil , James and Allen for these . :)
At home in Victoria the temperature has been above 44 degrees all week and they are forecasting another week of 40 + temperatures .
Power is failing , trains have stopped running because tracks are buckling under the heat .
It s just scorching weather and it seems that the people are not the only ones suffering .
Check out these photos of a little Koala which just walked onto a back porch looking for a bit of heat relief .
The woman filled up a bucket for it and this is what happened !

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
You would think that Citigroup had enough on its plate these days , but that has n't stopped the financial behemoth from filing a copyright infringement suit against a Brooklyn , New York , pawnshop over a similar logo .
In the suit filed last week in Brooklyn federal court , Citigroup alleges that in using the same Citi abbreviation and red arc as its banking subsidiary , Citibank , All Citi Pawn has infringed on their trademark .
Citigroup is seeking all of the business ' profits since it adopted the All Citi name .
" What can I tell you ?
Its crazy .
They 're going wild for a little art that I put up .
Theirs is a moon shape , mine is a V - shape , but I 've already taken it down , " pawn shop manager Bob Kay told CNN .
When contacted , Citgroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) would say only that " as a matter of course , we work to protect the value of our trademarks . "
According to trademark attorney Michael Feigin , no matter how small an infraction this may seem , in order to keep a trademark , it has to be protected .
" It is important for Citigroup to know that no one is trading off their name - they need to protect their intellectual property . "
Feigin went on to say , however , that removing the offending logo should resolve the case .
According to Kay , it has not .
Ever look at a product so ridiculous and wonder just how exactly it got approved and / or made ?
First there 's the concept , then the time spent on the blueprints , next comes the working prototype , and finally the finished version .
That 's at least four steps where someone could have sobered up at some point in the production process and put an end to the madness .
One such item has come across our desks today , turning two of our favorite things -- booze and firearms -- into alcohol projectile awesomeness .
The Alcohol Shot Gun from Urban
Trend is one of those products where everything you need to know is right in the title .
This baby blasts out a shot glasses worth of alcohol , allowing you and roommates to have the most delightfully inebriated standoffs in history .
With the help of the Alcohol Shot Gun , drinking games will be more visually hilarious , as frat buddies will now look like they 're trying to blow their heads off every time they take a shot .
Our suggestion though ?
Quick draw tournaments , whoever gets the most booze in their opponent 's mouth wins .
Potential problems ?
Meh , we do n't see many , unless you decide to reach for your alcohol - flinging piece when the cops come to shut down your party .
Their 9 mm bullets against your 1 - ounce vodka shot ?
Fascinating experiment .
Just keep the movie re-enactments indoors and you should n't have too many problems .
In the future though , we 'd like to see some improvements made .
For one , the booze gun can't be quickly reloaded , so how about a clip that holds like 3 - 5 shots worth at a time ?
Or maybe a Tommy gun edition that can be hip fired into sorority girls .
And then of course , the granddaddy of them all , the Keg RPG .
One round , 10 mouths , no problem .

So what changes do we have in store for the 2009 tax year ?
Each and every year there are small changes to the ridiculously large and wordy tax code , but most of them will not effect the average taxpayer .
( Good thing , really – who wants to know all of that stuff ! )
However , there are some that definitely will , so I went looking to see what they are …and here is what I found out :
The Income Tax Brackets Have Changed .
Singles :
10 % Tax Bracket – $ 0 -$ 8,350
15 % Tax Bracket – $ 8,350 - $ 33,950
25 % Tax Bracket – $ 33,950 - $ 82,250

And here is some more income tax bracket info from my friend Ryan .
The Standard Deduction Went Up .
The standard deduction for single filers goes up to $ 5,700 from $ 5,450 last year .
For joint filers the deduction will be $ 11,400 , which is up from $ 10,900 .
The Amount You Can Save In Your 401K Retirement Account Went Up .
Under 50 ?
You can now contribute $ 16,500 each year .
Over 50 ?
You can now contribute $ 22,000 each year .
The Amount You Can Save In Your Traditional Or Roth IRA Account .
Under 50 ?
You can now contribute $ 5,000 each year .
Over 50 ?
You can now contribute $ 6,000 each year .
The Mileage Deduction Has Decreased .
In 2008 you were able to deduct $ .585 per mile for business travel , but in 2009 that deduction has dropped to $ .55 per mile .
Just be sure you are actually traveling for business if you take this deduction !
The Gift Tax Exclusion Went Up .
The gift tax exclusion is now $ 13,000 , up $ 1,000 from 2008 .
This means you can give up to $ 13,000 tax free to anyone else , up to a maximum of $ 1 million in your life .
Wish I could give away that kind of money …
The Earned Income Tax Credit Has Gone Up .
The maximum tax credit for low and moderate income workers and families with two or more children is now $ 5,028 , up from $ 4,824 in 2008 .
Income limit on this credit is now $ 43,415 for 2009 , up from $ 41,646 last year .
Check out what Cash Money Life had to say about the increased 401k contribution limits in 2009 and please , let me know if I missed anything that should be on the list .
These are probably the ones that will affect the most people , but maybe I missed a few ?
If so , let me know in the comments !
Was Doing Versus Did - The Verbs You Use Influence Your Behavior
If you want to perform at your peak , you should carefully consider how you discuss your past actions .
In a new study in Psychological Science , psychologists William Hart of the University of Florida and Dolores AlbarracÃn from the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign reveal that the way a statement is phrased ( and specifically , how the verbs are used ) , affects our memory of an event being described and may also influence our behavior .
In these experiments , a group of volunteers were interrupted prior to finishing a word game and were then asked to describe their behavior using the imperfective ( e.g. , I was solving word puzzles ) or perfective ( e.g. , I solved word puzzles ) aspect .
The volunteers then completed a memory test ( for the word game ) or a word game which was similar to the first one they had worked on .
It turns out , the volunteers who had described their behavior using the imperfective aspect were able to recall more specific details of their experience compared to volunteers who had described their behavior in the perfective aspect .
The volunteers writing in the imperfective aspect also performed better on the second word game and were more willing to complete the task than did volunteers who used the perfective to describe their experience .
In the article " What I Was Doing Versus What I Did " , the authors surmise that when we think about our past behavior in the imperfective ( e.g. what we were doing ) , we tend to imagine that behavior as ongoing ( and not completed yet ) .
This enables us to easily think about what went into that behavior and may help us improve performance on similar tasks in the future .
The authors note that these findings may be relevant to behavioral therapy .
They suggest that " decreasing the frequency of unhealthy behaviors might be facilitated by discussing these behaviors in terms of what I did .
In contrast , increasing the frequency of healthy behaviors might be facilitated by discussing these behaviors in terms of what I was doing . "

Randy , raucous and unexpectedly romantic , Sex Drive follows three friends on the road trip of a lifetime !
There ’s one terrible thing about this week in DVD history .
This is the week that the last of the four straight to DVD Futurama movies is being released , it ’s bad because there ’s no more Futurama movies after this , but it ’s great because we finally get to see that last Futurama DVD movie !
The movie I ’ve been talking up for the last two ( possibly run-on ) sentences is , of course , Futurama : Into the Wild Green Yonder .
The film starts off on Mars where Amy Wong ’s father is planning to destroy Mars Vegas to make way for a new and better Mars Vegas .
Meanwhile , Fry discovers that he can read minds and he is recruited into a secret organization where he discovers that he is the key to saving the universe .
This might be the farewell to Futurama , but I hope David X. Cohen can pull some magic out of his hat and keep the franchise going .
And this weeks DVD Pick of the Week is Breaking Bad – The Complete First Season .
Breaking Bad stars Bryan Cranston the father from Malcolm in the Middle , who plays Walter White , a struggling high school chemistry teacher .
White has a handicapped son , a pregnant wife , and has just learned he has terminal cancer .
In his compromised state he runs into a former student who is now a drug dealer , which gives him the idea to make meth to earn money for his family .

January 11 , 2009 Reynard is a name familiar to all motorsports enthusiasts – founded by the brilliant automotive engineer Adrian Reynard , it quickly grew to become the world 's largest racing car manufacturer before some financial disasters led it to bankruptcy in 2002 .
No - one ever questioned Reynard ’s abilities to produce remarkably competitive race cars though and now he ’s back with a ballistic , road - registerable , two - seater named the Inverter .
Powered by either a Honda Fireblade 1000 cc motorcycle engine , or a Suzuki Hayabusa 1300 cc motor , the Inverter weighs in at 400 kg with all fluids and is so named because it has been designed to generate F1 - levels of downforce – enough to deliver 4G cornering forces .
Given a Hayabusa produces 250 bhp , the Inverter has a power - to - weight ratio in the stratosphere – equivalent to or better than cars that cost an order of magnitude more money .
So that ’s the equation – F1 - levels of downforce , a stellar power - to - weight ratio , oh , and it has been designed to be manufactured VERY cheaply .
The Inverter will be very special and very very affordable .
Form a queue to the right please !
Initially based at Bicester and latterly at Reynard Park , Brackley , UK , Reynard built successful cars in Formula Ford 1600 , Formula Ford 2000 , Formula Vauxhall Lotus , Formula 3 , Formula 3000 and Champ Car .
Now Reynard and new partner Andre Brown have revived the famous name in a new company and intend to build a two - seat sports car fully compliant with SVA regulations for low volume type approval and capable of being road registered .
Designed to compete as a racing car in the 750 Motor Club Bike Sports Championship - this particular vehicle complies with Class C specifications which require a standard Honda Fireblade engine up to 1000 cc and a minimum weight including the driver of 475 kg .
The Inverter , including fluids weighs in at 400 kg , leaving 75 kg for driver , helmet and race suit .
The following text was released by Reynard this week at the launch :
Track performance on Avon slicks will provide a 4G lateral cornering experience , until now unachievable outside the top echelons of high performance racing cars like F1 . ( 8 " X13 " front and 10 " X 13 ' rear wheels )
Road performance will provide excellent acceleration with 360 bhp / tonne power to weight ratio with the smallest standard Honda Fireblade engine or 530 bhp / tonne with the Hayabusa 250 bhp engine .
For road use the car is equipped with treaded road legal tyres .
( 7 " X 16 " front and 9 " X 17 " rear wheels )
Wind tunnel testing has proven that the car with driver can support twice it's own weight at 100 mph and four times its own weight at terminal velocity .
The car will drive upside down on a ceiling at 100 mph , hence the name Inverter .
Technical Description
The frame is constructed from laser cut , CNC bent and TIG welded stainless steel tube .
Production versions may be robotically welded with MIG .
The tubular frame is reinforced with two aluminium honeycomb composite side panels which are riveted into position to enhance torsion capabilities .
These panels will be further reinforced by the addition of an outer lamination of Tegris which provides enhanced side - intrusion protection .
The nosebox has been designed in aluminium honeycomb , with the added feature of frontal side protection .
This type of composite side protection panel and front crash - box concepts have been tested by Cranfield University and demonstrated excellent energy dissipation properties .
The final drive is accomplished by composite tooth belt .
This feature requires no chain lubrication and eliminates the dispersion of grease and oil debris .
Reverse gear is applied by 12v electric motor and applied via a simple sprag clutch .
Differential is Quaife grease filled unit with production CV joints and driveshafts .
Paddle shift will augment the six speed sequential gearbox .
This will enable flat - upshifting and auto - blip downshifting .
The uprights are all non-handed and water - jet cut from standard width aluminium plate .
Minimal machining is required .
All suspension wishbones are similarly non-handed .
The front and rear body panels are designed so they can hinge to facilitate easy access .
They can be moulded in GRP or carbon fibre to customer choice .
The Company
Reynard Racing Cars Ltd was founded in May 1974 by Adrian Reynard and Bill Stone , initially called Sabre Automotive Ltd. Adrian was a 23 years old graduate in Mechanical Engineering from Oxford Polytechnic ( now Oxford Brookes University ) .
Bill Stone was a successful racing driver from New Zealand and at the time , Production Manager at the recently formed March Engineering Ltd .
Adrian and Bill built the first Reynard racing cars in 1973 and first raced his Reynard 74 FF at Silverstone in a 750 MC event .
Adrian won its first race , which set a precedent for every subsequent marque .
Reynard Racing
Cars eventually became the world 's largest race car manufacturer with a sequence of wins in FF2000 , F3 , F 3000 , F Atlantic , Touring Car , Le Mans , IndyCar including two wins in the Indy 500 and Champcar .
In today 's market , Adrian realises it is vital to analyze the core competencies of a racing car company and distil these into efficient and harmonious working practices .
Adrian identified these core activities as design , development and supply chain management .
Adrian Reynard met Andre Brown on an M.I.A. Mission to the Middle East in 2004 .
Both were interested in race car design , innovation , development and production .
Andre was equipped with an excellent Engineering Degree from Bath University and had founded his own company Hartham , to undertake race car design and development .
Andre spent 18 months in Indianapolis during which time he participated in engineering design and wind tunnel development whilst also promoting technical sales at the Auto Research Center , Indianapolis .
Adrian contemplated two theories : ways to manufacture at much lower cost and Adrian had never made a road car .
Adrian had also been influenced by building a Caterham Seven which he drove at BRDC Track Day events at Silverstone .
With his lifetime experience of the industry , Adrian realised that the 750 MC was still actively promoting various low cost formulae .
For further reconnaissance , Adrian purchased an old Fisher Fury with a Honda motorcycle engine and enjoyed the 12,000 rpm track and road experience .
At the end of 2007 , a new Reynard sports car was conceived to meet the 750MC Bikesports Championship regulations and would be the first ever Reynard car registered for road use .
The car was to be smallest in class at 1.5 m wide , simple , light , and easy to make by automated / CNC / robotic techniques .
Aerodynamics are relatively free in Bike Sports formula , so it was particularly attractive for Adrian and Andre to use the knowledge learned in Indy .
Andre built a 50 % scale model and this was evaluated during ' downtime ' at the ARC wind tunnel facility .
The shape and form of the car evolved .
The car was developed for high efficiency , so it was natural that the cross sectional area tapered toward the rear .
The car also featured a shaped underbody that produced ' ground effect ' down force but with little drag induced .
A design office was donated at the Honda F1 facility and the concepts were turned into CAD .
Over the months Andre and Adrian forged the design parameters into real engineering drawings .
Manufacturability was a common denominator .
Keeping cost under control was a constant reminder .
Andre produced the final body surfaces derived from the wind tunnel model and these were routed by a full size CNC machining centre to produce the bodywork buck .
The chassis and suspension parts were fabricated by Brady Fabrications of Bicester .
The car was realised during the first week of January 2009 , nearly a year after work was commenced on the project .
It has been an important goal to keep the ' sunk costs ' to a minimum .
Many car " projects " have unrealistic expectations with over optimistic manufacturing costs and sales forecasts .
The production of the Reynard Inverter will provide the car for the members of the 750 Motor Club , motor sport and Track Day participants who want an extraordinary road car experience .
The advanced and unique aerodynamic characteristics will allow the car to achieve unbelievable cornering abilities .
On track tyres the driver will be able to experience up to 4G lateral acceleration - this is on the same level as F1 .
The car is projected to attain 150 mph , and at that speed it produces down force levels that are four times its own weight .
This would theoretically allow the car to drive upside down at 100 mph , hence the Inverter model name .
The engine presently installed is the Honda Fireblade 998 cc unit that will rev to 14,000 rpm and produces 175 bhp .
Other motorcycle engines are available , including the Suzuki Hayabusa .
Car engine variants are also possible with some redesign of the rear frame .

In an article titled Two - Thirds of Hispanic Women Discover Breast Cancer Themselves at U.S. News & World Report on Thursday , Feb. 5 , Amanda Gardner writes :
Two - thirds of breast cancers in Hispanic women are detected by a self - exam , while only 23 percent come to light through a mammography and another 6 percent through a clinical exam .
Yet screening mammography rates were 83 percent among U.S. - born Hispanic women and 62 percent among non-U.S. - born Hispanic women .
That Hispanic women are both receiving mammograms and beating mammography to the punch with self - exams is encouraging , especially considering the often poor education of the non-U.S. - born subgroup .
However , there ’s more to the story .
. .
What ’s troubling , however , is that about half of all women who noticed an abnormality during a self - exam waited at least a month before seeking medical help .
. . [ Emphasis added . ]
Why did women wait so long before seeking help ?
At this stage of the game , do we really need to ask ?
Largely because of lack of health insurance or other ways to afford medical care .
. .
Another article at U.S. News & World Report the same day , Cancer Patients Often Stranded in Health Insurance Nightmares , fleshes out the story :
. . . more than 1 million of 12 million cancer survivors living in the United States have had to forgo care , including prescription drugs , for financial reasons .
The problem was most pronounced among Hispanics and blacks .
This is just one of 20 heartbreaking stories in a new Kaiser Family Foundation / American Cancer Society report released Thursday , Feb. 5 , called Spending to Survive : Cancer Patients Confront Holes in the Health Insurance System .
All the individuals profiled had health insurance at the time they were diagnosed with cancer .
Presumably , upon diagnosis , a woman who ’s insured seeks immediate treatment ( before , that is , her claims may be denied and she enters American Health - Care Hell ) .
The low - income woman might not even make it through the first gate .
Let ’s attempt to imagine what life is like for an uninsured woman after she ’s been diagnosed .
Patient ( hopefully at some point , that is ) : I found a lump .
Husband :
We must see a doctor .
Patient :
You know we ’re uninsured .
Husband : Do n’t worry about the expense .
I ’ll get another job .
Patient : A third job ?
You ’re already using your second job to pay the $ 10,000 we owe from when little Tomas had meningitis .
Husband : You ’ll die .
Patient :
If we seek treatment , we ’ll wind up homeless .
I ’d rather die at home than in a homeless shelter .
Husband :
We should never have left Mexico .
Finally , terrified by what ’s happening to her body , she seeks out a doctor after a month .
Chances are she loses a breast that she did n’t need to — or her life .
Would that health insurance companies were as concerned with saving lives as those who promote early detection .
Urging early awareness on low - income women and then placing insurmountable obstacles in the way of treatment is a cruel joke .
Roughly two years ago , David Trowbridge and I began development of Review Board for use in our open source projects and our team at VMware .
During that time , we ’ve turned Review Board into a powerful code review tool that works with a variety of version control systems .
Most of VMware has moved over to it , as have an estimated 50 - 100 companies world - wide .
We ’ve had over 100 contributors to the project , people providing volunteer support on the mailing list , and people have developed third party tools for integrating with Review Board .
After all this time in development , with this many people contributing , we decided it ’s probably time to get a release out there .
Sure , we could have done this a long time ago , but there ’s a number of large things we were hoping to get in ( a recently - committed UI rewrite , for instance ) .
Now that we have most of the major features we want for our 1.0 release , we decided it was time for an alpha .
Over the coming months , we ’ll be working on stabilizing the codebase , fixing a few large remaining usability quirks , enhancing performance , and writing some proper documentation ( which is coming along nicely ) .
We ’re eager to get a quality product out there and to begin development on the next release .
There ’s a lot of neat things planned :
Support for writing extensions to Review Board .
A fully - featured API covering every operation you ’ll need to perform .
Some degree of policy support ( specifying which users / groups can see which parts of a repository , for instance ) .
Reviews with statuses other than “ Ship It ” .
This will probably be customizable to some degree .
Possibly some theme customization to allow Review Board to blend in better with corporate sites , Trac installs , etc .
Along with this , I plan to roll out a new website for the project that will have a browseable list of third party extensions , apps , Greasemonkey scripts , and more .
We have more information on our release on our release announcement .
The growing tensions between Israel and Turkey have destroyed prolific commerce relations which took years to establish , says Menashe Carmon , chairman of the Israel - Turkey Business Council .
Diplomatic relations between Jerusalem and Ankara have been strained ever since Israel launched Operation Cast Lead .
Tensions rose further after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan walked off the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , after verbally sparring with Israeli President Shimon Peres over the fighting in Gaza .
Business Ties Aztek signs NIS 12 M deal with Turkey Tani Goldstein Israeli licensing solutions provider chosen to supply small , medium - size businesses in Turkey with Microsoft products .
' Doing business in Turkey has definitely become much harder , ' says company official .
' We even had two clients , who came outright and told us , ' We do n’t want to work with you because you 're Jewish ' Aztek signs NIS 12 M deal with Turkey
announced it would be looking into the possibility of prosecuting Israeli officials for alleged genocide during the Gaza offensive .
The situation has strained the commerce relations between the two countries , which span some $ 3.4 billion per annum , and their future seems vague .
Turkey 's economy was able to stabilize after the financial crisis that hit it in 2001 and its impending induction into the European Union has prompted hundreds of Israeli companies to establish factories and production lines in Turkish cities ; as well as sign import - export contracts with many Turkish companies .
The sensitivities of the new situation have prompted executives in these companies to clam up media - wise , and none are willing to elaborate on the newfound complexities they now have to deal with .
Defense exports as risk
Industry insiders have admitted that the main export lines to Turkey – agriculture and chemicals – have already begun suffering the consequences , as the Turkish government body which subsidizes their contracts declared an embargo on Israeli - made equipment .
Another field of commerce bracing for a blow is that of defense exports .
Turkey has one of the largest armies in the world and Israel 's Elbit Systems Ltd. and Aerospace Industries ( IAI ) signed a $ 141 million deal with its air force just days before the diplomatic crisis erupted .
" They would n’t have won the bid today , " said a source in the defense establishment .
" Elbit and IAI are lucky to have signed it prior to the war in Gaza .
Still , it may take Turkey longer to materialize it . "
The Defense Ministry has scheduled a special session to discus the problems defense exports to Turkey may face next .
" Tensions between Israel and Turkey seem to be subsiding , " said Doron Avrahami , Israel 's commercial attaché in Turkey .
" You must remember that 2008 was a record year for commerce between the two and since the majority of the trade is done between private companies , we can hope that not every poetical statement will automatically mean a secession of commerce .
" We hope to be able to maintain the same scope of business in 2009 , " he said adding that a growth in trade was unlikely .
" Politics aside , the financial crisis has hit Turkey as well .
" We recommend that Israeli companies that already have business in Turkey carry on as usual , but anyone planning on launching new ventures should understand that it may take a lot longer than before . "

Consuming cannabis in Alberta is allowed where tobacco smoking is currently allowed see Tobacco and Smoking Reduction Act ( Section 3 ) with some additional provincial restrictions included .
Cannabis smoking and vaporizing lounges or clubs will not be allowed unfortunately !
These types of businesses would be very helpful in providing education on healthy responsible ways to consume and could also provide harm reduction benefits .
Municipalities will be allowed to create additional restrictions on public consumption using bylaws .
Albertans are encouraged to know their local rules before consuming .

I have put together a new version of hxcpp , the c++ backend for haxe .
New features include improved coverage of language features .
All the unit tests except remoting pass now .
I have also cleaned up the ocaml code a bit and improved the output consistency .
Still a bit to do here , but not that much .
The code now contains a dependency system that allows for incremental compiling , greatly improving the speed .
Dlls are now all in one directory – by adding this to the exe path no dll copying should be required .
This still needs a little thought :-
I tried to delay load the dll , thereby giving greater control over locating it , but it seems the rtti system brings the dll in before I can change the load path .
Apart from this , most of the 0.1 TODO list is finished .
There are still a few little language features required – such as “ break ” from within a return block but it ’s 99 % there , and the external libraries are pretty much untested .
I have also hijacked the neko code to provide OS libraries .
This means that I had to allow “ neko ” class paths in the cpp target – this seems a little odd – I will have to think about a solution here .
Strings are implemented with wchar_t , rather than utf8 bytes , so some neko functions that took “ string ” actually take “ byte array ” in cpp .
On the plus side , multi - byte characters are “ native ” in the c++ target .
The source and demos are in hxcpp-03.zip .
Scientist Retracts Paper Cited by Creationists
In January 1955 , Homer Jacobson , a chemistry professor at Brooklyn College , published a paper called “ Information , Reproduction and the Origin of Life ” in American Scientist , the journal of Sigma Xi , the scientific honor society .
In it , Dr. Jacobson speculated on the chemical qualities of earth in Hadean time , billions of years ago when the planet was beginning to cool down to the point where , as Dr. Jacobson put it , “ one could imagine a few hardy compounds could survive . ”
Nobody paid much attention to the paper at the time , he said in a telephone interview from his home in Tarrytown , N.Y .
But today it is winning Dr. Jacobson acclaim that he does not want — from creationists who cite it as proof that life could not have emerged on earth without divine intervention .
So after 52 years , he has retracted it .
[…]
It is not unusual for scientists to publish papers and , if they discover evidence that challenges them , to announce they were wrong .
The idea that all scientific knowledge is provisional , able to be challenged and overturned , is one thing that separates matters of science from matters of faith .
So Dr. Jacobson ’s retraction is in “ the noblest tradition of science ” Rosalind Reid , editor of American Scientist , wrote in its November - December issue , which has Dr. Jacobson ’s letter .
His letter shows , Ms. Reid wrote , “ the distinction between a scientist who cannot let error stand , no matter the embarrassment of public correction ” and people who “ cling to dogma . ”

Over the past couple of years it ’s become a liberal rallying cry that if Republicans want to filibuster every bill , then Harry Reid ought to make them carry out a real filibuster , Jimmy Stewart style .
Make ’em talk .
Make ’em read from the phone book .
Put it all on CSPAN and let the American public see what GOP obstructionism is really all about .
But Ryan Grim , in an interesting piece over at the Huffington Post today , concludes that it ’s not going to happen .
Apparently Reid ’s office has studied the history of the filibuster and says that although at least one Republican senator can be forced to stay on the Senate floor to prevent a vote , he ca n’t be forced to talk .
Bob Dove , who worked as a Senate parliamentarian from 1966 until 2001 , agrees :
As both Reid ’s memo and Dove explain , only one Republican would need to monitor the Senate floor .
If the majority party tried to move to a vote , he could simply say , “ I suggest the absence of a quorum . ”
The presiding officer would then be required to call the roll .
When that finished , the Senator could again notice the absence of a quorum and start the process all over .
At no point would the obstructing Republican be required to defend his position , read from the phone book or any of the other things people associate with the Hollywood version of a filibuster .
…. Since [ Strom Thurmond in 1957 ] , says Dove , the only time the majority tried to jam a bill through the Senate without having 60 votes ahead of time ended in failure .
Robert Byrd , a Democrat from West Virginia , was majority leader in 1988 , when Democrats controlled 54 seats and wanted to push through campaign finance reform .
But Republican minority leader Alan Simpson of Wyoming was easily able to block it by sitting on the Senate floor and occasionally noting the absence of a quorum , thwarting a vote … .
” It was almost a farce , ” says Dove .
“ The bottom line is the bill never passed . ”
Back to square one , then : get rid of the filibuster entirely .
I would n’t hold my breath waiting for that to happen , though .
Capt .
Chesley “ Sully ” Sullenberger , the pilot who landed a plane safely into the Hudson River , was asked on 60 Minutes tonight about whether or not he prayed when US Airways Flight 1549 had lost its engines .
Here ’s Katie Couric talking with CNN ’s Howard Kurtz about her interview with the pilot :
Couric :…
In fact , at one point I said [ to Sullenberger ] , “ Did you pray at any moment ? ”
And he said , “ There were a lot of people in the cabin doing that for me .
I had to fly the airplane . ”
Kurtz : Right .
You know , even in normal circumstances , I guess , to be a successful pilot , you have to be able to tune out just about every distraction and focus on the job at hand .
Couric : Yes .
He said it took enormous concentration and focus to kind of remove those feelings of fear , and obviously he did what he needed to do to get the job done .
This was from the actual interview :
Asked if he at any point prayed , he told Couric , “ I would imagine somebody in back was taking care of that for me while I was flying the airplane . ”
“ My focus at that point was so intensely on the landing , ” he said .
“ I thought of nothing else . ”
That ’s not the same as saying he ’s an atheist or anything .
I do n’t know what he believes .
But it ’s an important point , I think .
In a time of crisis , the man in charge did n’t stop to pray .
He did n’t think about God .
He focused on what actions he could take .
He eliminated any other “ distractions ” from his mind , including thoughts about God .
That ’s what saved the passengers ’ lives .

Last year , I wrote an article explaining how former Republican Senator Phil Gramm had helped grease the way to the subprime meltdown in 2000 when he was chairman of the Senate Banking Committee .
Gramm would n’t talk to me for the article .
At the time , he was a close adviser to presidential candidate John McCain , and his past support of financial deregulation and his subsequent work as a lobbyist for UBS , the Swiss banking giant , became a campaign issue .
Neither McCain nor Gramm addressd these matters publicly .
And then Gramm generated further controversy when he dismissed Americans worried about the economy as “ whiners . ”
After that , McCain distanced himself from Gramm , who faded from the campaign trail .
Now , Gramm is back–at least to defend himself .
Last week , he spoke at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington .
The subject of his talk : was deregulation responsible for the current financial disaster ?
The real subject : was Gramm responsible for the current financial disaster ?
Mother Jones and the American News Project filmed Gramm , and I was able to pose a couple of questions to him .

Peanut boss refuses to testify at salmonella hearing
The head of the company linked to a massive salmonella outbreak in peanut products refused to testify at a Congressional hearing Wednesday as lawmakers accused him of caring more about profits than food safety .
Peanut Corporation of America President Stewart Parnell invoked his fifth amendment right not to testify , as did the plant manager at the Blakely , Ga. , plant implicated in the outbreak , during the hearing before a House subcommittee .
Both men also refused to eat recalled products that one lawmaker offered to them from a jar .
CALLS FOR REFORM : ' Total systemic breakdown '
BAD FOR BUSINESS : Scare sends peanut butter sales diving The Food and Drug Administration has said that PCA distributed products in 2007 and 2008 that had tested positive for salmonella .
The products should not have been shipped , the FDA says .
The outbreak has sickened more than 600 people may have contributed to nine deaths .
More than 1,900 products have been recalled .
A criminal probe is underway .
VIDEO : One boy 's sickening from salmonella HEALTH : Risks may extend beyond reported victims VIRGINIA : Peanut blanching plants had salmonella risks " We are shocked at what 's been going on in this company , " said Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , at the hearing .
He displayed a document showing that Parnell on Jan. 12 — a day before PCA 's first recall — wrote to employees " we have never found any salmonella " and blamed the news media for creating a stir .
The hearing revealed a few new details about PCA and company e-mails indicating internal frustration about repeated tests showing positive results for salmonella .
In a June 2008 email , obtained by the congressional committee , Parnell was told that a product was " put on hold " after a presumptive positive on salmonella and that it was being retested .
" I go thru this about once a week , " Parnell responded .
" I will hold my breath … again . "
Two months later another e-mail exchange indicates that PCA had a product test positive for salmonella that was then retested by another lab and got a negative result .
In response , Parnell wrote : " Let 's turn them loose then . "
The FDA says it 's well known in the industry that such product should be destroyed as salmonella can be missed in tests .
Parnell also expressed concern about testing costs .
According to another email , the plant manager told him last September that a product had been shipped that tested positive for salmonella .
The product would be retested , he was told .
The plant manager also told Parnell that customers receiving the product should put it on hold .
A week later , an e-mail from Parnell said , " We need to discuss this ….
The time lapse … is costing us huge $ $ $ $ $ " and that PCA needed to " protect our self and the problem is that the tests absolutely give us no protection . "
The hearing also revealed that as far back as 2006 , the plant had a salmonella finding , potentially linked to Chinese - supplied organic peanuts , according to company records .
In November , 2006 , a private lab hired by PCA said in a letter to the company that its roasting step — a kill step for salmonella — had n't been adequately checked for efficiency and noted that improvements were underway .
After an inspection last month , the FDA said the plant failed to show that its roasting was an effective kill step .
JLA USA , one of several private labs that PCA hired to test its products , also told lawmakers that it tested 1,000 samples for PCA from Jan. 1 , 2007 through Sept. , 2008 and found 10 positives .
JLA also told the committee that PCA had shipped product to Utah before a test result turned up positive and that it was told that PCA would destroy the product out west rather than have it returned to Georgia .
JLA President Darlene Cowart told the committee that it appeared that PCA largely dropped JLA as a lab because the lab found higher bacterial counts in its products than did others .
Stephen Sundlof , director of the FDA 's Center for Food Safety , told lawmakers the FDA wanted new authorities to tighten oversight , specifically the right to receive internal test results during routine FDA inspections .
The FDA did n't know about PCA 's internal test results showing salmonella until it requested them after the outbreak was underway .
Such records are not available to the FDA during routine inspections , Sundlof said .
The PCA plant in Blakely , Ga. has been closed for weeks .
PCA 's Texas plant was shut Monday after testing there also revealed salmonella .
It 's not clear yet whether that salmonella is linked to the outbreak strain .
The case has turned a spotlight on gaps in the USA 's food safety net .
The FDA relied on Georgia state inspectors to check PCA 's Blakely , plant and they found only minor violations .
The FDA noted more serious deficiencies in a 14 - day inspection after the outbreak was underway .
Major food makers relied on audits that PCA paid for to guarantee that their processes were good .

Give just 2 minutes a day to call and email the Obama transition and you can do just that .
Equal Rep is putting on its third campaign to urge President - elect Obama to appoint Fred Hochberg the next Secretary of Commerce .
In more than 200 years , the United States Cabinet has never included an openly gay member .
Growing national focus on GLBT civil rights has therefore made the Secretary of Commerce appointment a national issue in the struggle for equal representation .
Fred Hochberg is the most qualified candidate for the job .
Hochberg has more than 25 years of experience in business , government , civil rights activities , and philanthropy .
From 1998 through 2000 , he served as deputy then acting administrator of the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) , an agency elevated to cabinet rank by President Bill Clinton , with more than 4,000 employees and 100 offices across the country .
At the SBA , he directed the delivery of a comprehensive set of financial and business development programs for entrepreneurs , with particular outreach to women and minorities .
He also served on President Clinton 's Management Council .
From 1994 to 1998 , Fred Hochberg worked as founder and president of Heyday Company , a private investment firm managing real estate , stock market investments , and venture capital projects .
Prior to that , he was president and chief operating officer of the Lillian Vernon Corporation , where he led the transformation of a small family mail order company into a publicly traded direct marketing corporation , one of the great success stories of American entrepreneurship .
" It was devastating to learn that gay Americans would n't have a seat at the table within Barack Obama 's Cabinet administration .
They are the only minority group to have never been appointed in the history of the United States . " said Paul Sousa , Equal Rep founder .
" Hochberg is supremely qualified and this opening is the perfect opportunity for our President - elect to show gay Americans they have not been forgotten and he is truly committed to equal representation . "
Phone Obama : 202-540-3000 , press " 2 "
Email Obama
Join the facebook event , invite your friends , and plan on giving the Obama administration a friendly daily nudge to put his call of change into action .
Here 's to hoping that Fred Hochberg is the next Secretary of Commerce !

HIV infection has no cure and no vaccine , but there is a way to completely wipe it out – at least in theory ( Image : Amos Morgan / Photodisc / Getty ) Goodbye AIDS
Read our related news story :
Gene therapy promises one - shot treatment for HIV
Read our related editorial : Ridding the world of AIDS
WHAT if we could rid the world of AIDS ?
The notion might sound like fantasy : HIV infection has no cure and no vaccine , after all .
Yet there is a way to completely wipe it out – at least in theory .
What ’s more , it would take only existing medical technology to do the job .
Here ’s how it works .
If someone who is HIV positive takes antiretroviral - drug therapy they can live a long life and almost never pass on the virus , even through unprotected sex .
So if everyone with HIV were on therapy , there would be little or no transmission .
Once all these people had died , of whatever cause , the virus would be gone for good .
It ’s a simple idea , but the obstacles to implementing it worldwide are enormous .
Persuading everyone with HIV to start therapy purely for public health reasons could be ethically dubious .
To identify everyone who is HIV positive would require such widespread testing that some may feel it breached their civil liberties .
Then there is the question of who would fund such a massive undertaking .
Yet the idea of eliminating HIV is so appealing , and the benefit to humanity so huge , that scientists and policy - makers are seriously considering the concept , albeit on regional scales .
In the next few months the World Health Organization ( WHO ) will meet to …
The Senate Intelligence Committee is preparing to launch an investigation of the CIA ’s detention and interrogation programs under President George W. Bush , setting the stage for a sweeping examination of some of most secretive and controversial operations in recent agency history .
The inquiry is aimed at uncovering new information on the origins of the programs as well as scrutinizing how they were executed -- including the conditions at clandestine CIA prison sites and the interrogation regimens used to break Al Qaeda suspects , according to Senate aides familiar with the investigation plans .
Officials said the inquiry was not designed to determine whether CIA officials broke laws .
“ The purpose here is to do fact - finding in order to learn lessons from the programs and see if there are recommendations to be made for detention and interrogations in the future , ” said a senior Senate aide , who like others described the plan on condition of anonymity because it had not been made public .
Still , the investigation is likely to call new attention to the agency ’s conduct in operations that drew condemnation around the world .
It is also bound to renew friction between Democrats and Republicans who have spent much of the last five years fighting over the Bush administration ’s prosecution of the war on terrorism .

The investigation also could draw comparisons to the special Senate committee formed to investigate the CIA in 1975 and headed by Sen. Frank Church , an Idaho Democrat .
Revelations by the Church Committee led to greater congressional oversight and legislation restricting intelligence activities .
The terms and scope of the new inquiry still were being negotiated by members of the committee and senior staffers Thursday .
The senior aide said that the committee had no short - term plans to hold public hearings , and that it was not clear whether the panel would release its final report to the public .
The inquiry , which could take a year or more to complete , means the CIA will once again be the target of intense congressional scrutiny at a time when it is engaged in two wars and its ongoing pursuit of Al Qaeda .
The agency was stripped of some of its power and prestige after coming under severe criticism in previous investigations of its failures leading up to the Sept. 11 attacks and the war in Iraq .

But whereas those investigations focused largely on errors in the CIA ’s analytic efforts , the new inquiry will dive directly into its most sensitive operations , seeking to unearth details that previous generations of agency officials referred to as the “ crown jewels . ”
During the Bush administration , the agency was often able to safeguard many of those secrets .
Lawmakers have never been told the locations of the CIA ’s secret prisons overseas , for example .
But the Obama administration is expected to give congressional investigators new access to classified records as well as individuals who took part in operating the secret prisons and interrogating detainees .
CIA Director Leon E. Panetta pledged this week that he would cooperate with any congressional investigation .

“ If those committees are seeking information in these areas , we ’ll cooperate with them , ” Panetta said in a meeting with reporters Wednesday .
“ I think that we have a responsibility to be transparent on these issues and to provide them that information . ”
Panetta argued that CIA officers should not face prosecution if they were acting on orders in accordance with Bush administration legal opinions .
“ I would not support , obviously , an investigation or a prosecution of those individuals , ” Panetta said .
“ I think they did their job , they did it pursuant to the guidance that was provided them , whether you agreed or disagreed with it . ”
News of the inquiry was greeted with concern among agency veterans .

“ There is a good deal of investigation fatigue , and a feeling that the agency has become even more than before a pinata , ” said a former high - ranking CIA official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
The new investigation is likely to “ stimulate more risk aversion , ” the former official said .
“ There ’s a potential cost to other operations down the road when the current administration says , ‘ We would like you to take this operation , it ’s been blessed by lawyers and briefed by Congress . ’
Why should we do anything anywhere near cutting - edge if down the road the next administration can decide to get back at their political opponents ? ”
Senate aides declined to say whether the committee would seek new testimony from former CIA Director George J. Tenet or other former top officials who were involved in the creation and management of the programs .
The Senate investigation will examine whether the detention and interrogation operations were carried out in ways that were consistent with the authorities and instructions issued in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks , officials said .
Advertisement
The panel will also look at whether lawmakers were kept fully informed .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , the chairwoman of the committee , and others have said that the Bush administration improperly withheld information from Congress on the CIA ’s operations .
The investigation comes at a time when the Obama administration is in the midst of making dramatic changes in the CIA ’s counter - terrorism programs .
Last month , President Obama ordered the CIA to close its secret prison facilities and to abandon “ enhanced ” interrogation measures , including waterboarding , a method that simulates drowning .
Instead , Obama ordered the agency to abide by the Army Field Manual on interrogation .
The administration has also established a task force to look at the interrogation programs , although that effort is mainly designed to examine their effectiveness and determine whether the CIA should again be granted authority beyond the Army Field Manual .
Advertisement
Senate investigators plan a similar line of inquiry , with a goal of assessing the effectiveness of enhanced interrogation techniques employed by the CIA , including sleep deprivation and subjecting prisoners to cold temperatures .
Panetta ’s immediate predecessor as CIA chief , Michael V. Hayden , has defended the agency ’s use of such methods and argued that the agency should not be bound by Army Field Manual constraints .
Hayden has said the agency has held fewer than 100 prisoners in custody since the Sept. 11 attacks , and less than one - third of those were ever subjected to enhanced interrogation measures .
Three prisoners , including self - proclaimed Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , were subjected to waterboarding .
There has also been a push from other lawmakers to launch an independent investigation of the CIA ’s operations .
The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing next week on a proposal to create a commission like the one that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks to examine CIA counter - terrorism operations under Bush .

“ The last administration justified torture , presided over the abuses at Abu Ghraib , destroyed tapes of harsh interrogations , ” said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , the chairman of that committee .
“ How can we restore our moral leadership and ensure transparent government if we ignore what has happened ? ”
But the Senate Intelligence Committee has direct jurisdiction over U.S. spy agencies , and is launching its inquiry in part to make sure its members have independent data and are in position to influence future interrogation and detention policies , officials said .
Aides said the negotiations were aimed at producing an investigation with broad support from both parties .
Republicans have argued that the inquiry should focus on CIA programs and not become a referendum on Bush administration policies , such as the Justice Department legal memos that underpinned the program .
Sen. Christopher S. Bond ( R - Mo. ) , the panel ’s ranking Republican , “ does not think that witch hunts and discussions of the legality of [ Justice Department ] memos are in any way helpful at this point , ” another Senate aide said .

Over at Cosmic Variance , I learned that FQXi ( the organization that paid for me to go to Iceland ) sponsored an essay contest on “ The Nature of Time ” , and the submission deadline was last week .
Because of deep and fundamental properties of time ( at least as perceived by human observers ) , this means that I will not be able to enter the contest .
However , by exploiting the timeless nature of the blogosphere , I can now tell you what I would have written about if I had entered .
( Warning : I ca n’t write this post without actually explaining some standard CS and physics in a semi-coherent fashion .
I promise to return soon to your regularly - scheduled programming of inside jokes and unexplained references . )
I ’ve often heard it said — including by physicists who presumably know better — that “ time is just a fourth dimension , ” that it ’s no different from the usual three dimensions of space , and indeed that this is a central fact that Einstein proved ( or exploited ? or clarified ? ) with relativity .
Usually , this assertion comes packaged with the distinct but related assertion that the “ passage of time ” has been revealed as a psychological illusion : for if it makes no sense to talk about the “ flow ” of x , y , or z , why talk about the flow of t ?
Why not just look down ( if that ’s the right word ) on the entire universe as a fixed 4 - dimensional crystalline structure ?
In this post , I ’ll try to tell you why not .
My starting point is that , even if we leave out all the woolly metaphysics about our subjective experience of time , and look strictly at the formalism of special and general relativity , we still find that time behaves extremely differently from space .
In special relativity , the invariant distance between two points p and q—meaning the real physical distance , the distance measure that does n’t depend on which coordinate system we happen to be using — is called the interval .
If the point p has coordinates ( x , y , z , t ) ( in any observer ’s coordinate system ) , and the point q has coordinates ( x ’ , y ’ , z’ , t’ ) , then the interval between p and q equals
( x - x ’ ) 2+( y-y ’ ) 2+( z - z ’ ) 2-( t - t’ )
2
where as usual , 1 second of time equals 3×108 meters of space .
( Indeed , it ’s possible to derive special relativity by starting with this fact as an axiom . )
Now , notice the minus sign in front of ( t - t ’ ) 2 ?
That minus sign is physics ’ way of telling us that time is different from space — or in Sesame Street terms , “ one of these four dimensions is not like the others . ”
It ’s true that special relativity lets you mix together the x ,y , z,t coordinates in a way not possible in Newtonian physics , and that this mixing allows for the famous time dilation effect , whereby someone traveling close to the speed of light relative to you is perceived by you as almost frozen in time .
But no matter how you choose the t coordinate , there ’s still going to be a t coordinate , which will stubbornly behave differently from the other three spacetime coordinates .
It ’s similar to how my “ up ” points in nearly the opposite direction from an Australian ’s “ up ” , and yet we both have an “ up ” that we ’d never confuse with the two spatial directions perpendicular to it .
( By contrast , the two directions perpendicular to “ up ” can and do get confused with each other , and indeed it ’s not even obvious which directions we ’re talking about : north and west ?
forward and right ?
If you were floating in interstellar space , you ’d have three perpendicular directions to choose arbitrarily , and only the choice of the fourth time direction would be an “ obvious ” one for you . )
In general relativity , spacetime is a curved manifold , and thus the interval gets replaced by an integral over a worldline .
But the local neighborhood around each point still looks like the ( 3+1 ) - dimensional spacetime of special relativity , and therefore has a time dimension which behaves differently from the three space dimensions .
Mathematically , this corresponds to the fact that the metric at each point has ( - 1,+1 , + 1,+1 ) signature — in other words , it ’s a 4×4 matrix with 3 positive eigenvalues and 1 negative eigenvalue .
If space and time were interchangeable , then all four eigenvalues would have the same sign .
But how does that minus sign actually do the work of making time behave differently from space ?
Well , because of the minus sign , the interval between two points can be either positive or negative ( unlike Euclidean distance , which is always nonnegative ) .
If the interval between two points p and q is positive , then p and q are spacelike separated , meaning that there ’s no way for a signal emitted at p to reach q or vice versa .
If the interval is negative , then p and q are timelike separated , meaning that either a signal from p can reach q , or a signal from q can reach p .
If the interval is zero , then p and q are lightlike separated , meaning a signal can get from one point to the other , but only by traveling at the speed of light .
In other words , that minus sign is what ensures spacetime has a causal structure : two events can stand to each other in the relations “ before , ” “ after , ” or “ neither before nor after ” ( what in pre-relativistic terms would be called “ simultaneous ” ) .
We know from general relativity that the causal structure is a complicated dynamical object , itself subject to the laws of physics : it can bend and sag in the presence of matter , and even contract to a point at black hole singularities .
But the causal structure still exists — and because of it , one dimension simply cannot be treated on the same footing as the other three .
Put another way , the minus sign in front of the t coordinate reflects what a sufficiently - articulate child might tell you is the main difference between space and time : you can go backward in space , but you ca n’t go backward in time .
Or : you can revisit the city of your birth , but you ca n’t ( literally ) revisit the decade of your birth .
Or : the Parthenon could be used later to store gunpowder , and the Tower of London can be used today as a tourist attraction , but the years 1700 - 1750 ca n’t be similarly repurposed for a new application : they ’re over .
Notice that we ’re now treating space and time pragmatically , as resources — asking what they ’re good for , and whether a given amount of one is more useful than a given amount of the other .
In other words , we ’re now talking about time and space like theoretical computer scientists .
If the difference between time and space shows up in physics through the ( - 1,+1 , +1,+1 ) signature , the difference shows up in computer science through the famous
P ≠ PSPACE
conjecture .
Here P is the class of problems that are solvable by a conventional computer using a “ reasonable ” amount of time , meaning , a number of steps that increases at most polynomially with the problem size .
PSPACE is the class of problems solvable by a conventional computer using a “ reasonable ” amount of space , meaning a number of memory bits that increases at most polynomially with the problem size .
It ’s evident that P ⊆ PSPACE — in other words , any problem solvable in polynomial time is also solvable in polynomial space .
For it takes at least one time step to access a given memory location — so in polynomial time , you ca n’t exploit more than polynomial space anyway .
It ’s also clear that PSPACE ⊆ EXP — that is , any problem solvable in polynomial space is also solvable in exponential time .
The reason is that a computer with K bits of memory can only be 2 K different configurations before the same configuration recurs , in which case the machine will loop forever .
But computer scientists conjecture that PSPACE ⊄ P — that is , polynomial space is more powerful than polynomial time — and have been trying to prove it for about 40 years .
( You might wonder how P vs. PSPACE relates to the even better - known P vs. NP problem .
NP , which consists of all problems for which a solution can be verified in polynomial time , sits somewhere between P and PSPACE .
So if P≠NP , then certainly P≠PSPACE as well .
The converse is not known — but a proof of P≠PSPACE would certainly be seen as a giant step toward proving P≠NP . )
So from my perspective , it ’s not surprising that time and space are treated differently in relativity .
Whatever else the laws of physics do , presumably they have to differentiate time from space somehow — since otherwise , how could polynomial time be weaker than polynomial space ?
But you might wonder : is reusability really the key property of space that is n’t shared by time — or is it merely one of several differences , or a byproduct of some other , more fundamental difference ?
Can we adduce evidence for the computer scientist ’s view of the space / time distinction — the view that sees reusability as central ?
What could such evidence even consist of ?
Is n’t it all just a question of definition at best , or metaphysics at worst ?
On the contrary , I ’ll argue that the computer scientist ’s view of the space / time distinction actually leads to something like a prediction , and that this prediction can be checked , not by experiment but mathematically .
If reusability really is the key difference , then if we change the laws of physics so as to make time reusable — keeping everything else the same insofar as we can — polynomial time ought to collapse with polynomial space .
In other words , the set of computational problems that are efficiently solvable ought to become PSPACE .
By contrast , if reusability is not the key difference , then changing the laws of physics in this way might well give some complexity class other than PSPACE .
But what do we even mean by changing the laws of physics so as to “ make time reusable ” ?
The first answer that suggests itself is simply to define a “ time - traveling Turing machine , ” which can move not only left and right on its work tape , but also backwards and forwards in time .
If we do this , then we ’ve made time into another space dimension by definition , so it ’s not at all surprising if we end up being able to solve exactly the PSPACE problems .
But wait : if time is reusable , then “ when ” does it get reused ?
Should we think of some “ secondary ” time parameter that inexorably marches forward , even as the Turing machine scuttles back and forth in the “ original ” time ?
But if so , then why ca n’t the Turing machine also go backwards in the secondary time ?
Then we could introduce a tertiary time parameter to count out the Turing machine ’s movements in the secondary time , and so on forever .
But this is stupid .
What the endless proliferation of times is telling us is that we have n’t really made time reusable .
Instead , we ’ve simply redefined the time dimension to be yet another space dimension , and then snuck in a new time dimension that behaves in the same boring , conventional way as the old time dimension .
We then perform the sleight - of - hand of letting an exponential amount of the secondary time elapse , even as we restrict the “ original ” time to be polynomially bounded .
The trivial , uninformative result is then that we can solve PSPACE problems in “ polynomial time . ”
So is there a better way to treat time as a reusable resource ?
I believe that there is .
We can have a parameter that behaves like time in that it “ never changes direction ” , but behaves unlike time in that it loops around in a cycle .
In other words , we can have a closed timelike curve , or CTC .
CTCs give us a dimension that ( 1 ) is reusable , but ( 2 ) is also recognizably “ time ” rather than “ space . ”
Of course , no sooner do we define CTCs than we confront the well - known problem of dead grandfathers .
How can we ensure that the events around the CTC are causally consistent , that they do n’t result in contradictions ?
For my money , the best answer to this question was provided by David Deutsch , in his paper “ Quantum Mechanics near Closed Time - like Lines ” ( unfortunately not online ) .
Deutsch observed that , if we allow the state of the universe to be probabilistic or quantum , then we can always tell a consistent story about the events inside a CTC .
So for example , the resolution of the grandfather paradox is simply that you ’re born with 1 / 2 probability , and if you ’re born you go back in time and kill your grandfather , therefore you ’re born with 1 / 2 probability , etc .
Everything ’s consistent ; there ’s no paradox !
More generally , any stochastic matrix S has at least one stationary distribution — that is , a distribution D such that S( D ) =D. Likewise , any quantum - mechanical operation Q has at least one stationary state — that is , a mixed state ρ such that Q ( ρ ) =ρ .
So we can consider a model of closed timelike curve computation where we ( the users ) specify a polynomial - time operation , and then Nature has to find some probabilistic or quantum state ρ which is left invariant by that operation .
( There might be more than one such ρ— in which case , being pessimists , we can stipulate that Nature chooses among them adversarially . )
We then get to observe ρ , and output an answer based on it .
So what can be done in this computational model ?
Long story short : in a recent paper with Watrous , we proved that
P CTC = BQP CTC = PSPACE .
Or in English , the set of problems solvable by a polynomial - time CTC computer is exactly PSPACE — and this holds whether the CTC computer is classical or quantum .
In other words , CTCs make polynomial time equal to polynomial space as a computational resource .
Unlike in the case of “ secondary time , ” this is not obvious from the definitions , but has to be proved .
( Note that to prove PSPACE ⊆ P CTC ⊆ BQP CTC ⊆ EXP is relatively straightforward ; the harder part is to show BQP CTC ⊆ PSPACE . )
The bottom line is that , at least in the computational world , making time reusable ( even while preserving its “ directionality ” ) really does make it behave like space .
To me , that lends some support to the contention that , in our world , the fact that space is reusable and time is not is at the core of what makes them different from each other .
I do n’t think I ’ve done enough to whip up controversy yet , so let me try harder in the last few paragraphs .
A prominent school of thought in quantum gravity regards time as an “ emergent phenomenon ” : something that should not appear in the fundamental equations of the universe , just like hot and cold , purple and orange , maple and oak do n’t appear in the fundamental equations , but only at higher levels of organization .
Personally , I ’ve long had trouble making sense of this view .
One way to explain my difficulty is using computational complexity .
If time is “ merely ” an emergent phenomenon , then is the presumed intractability of PSPACE - complete problems also an emergent phenomenon ?
Could a quantum theory of gravity — a theory that excluded time as “ not fundamental enough ” — therefore be exploited to solve PSPACE - complete problems efficiently ( whatever “ efficiently ” would even mean in such a theory ) ?
Or maybe computation is also just an emergent phenomenon , so the question does n’t even make sense ?
Then what is n’t an emergent phenomenon ?
I do n’t have a knockdown argument , but the distinction between space and time has the feel to me of something that needs to be built into the laws of physics at the machine - code level .
I ’ll even venture a falsifiable prediction : that if and when we find a quantum theory of gravity , that theory will include a fundamental ( not emergent ) distinction between space and time .
In other words , no matter what spacetime turns out to look like at the Planck scale , the notion of causal ordering and the relationships “ before ” and “ after ” will be there at the lowest level .
And it will be this causal ordering , built into the laws of physics , that finally lets us understand why closed timelike curves do n’t exist and PSPACE - complete problems are intractable .
I ’ll end with a quote from a June 2008 Scientific American article by Jerzy Jurkiewicz , Renate Loll and Jan Ambjorn , about the “ causal dynamical triangulations approach ” to quantum gravity .
What could the trouble be ?
In our search for loopholes and loose ends in the Euclidean approach [ to quantum gravity ] , we finally hit on the crucial idea , the one ingredient absolutely necessary to make the stir fry come out right : the universe must encode what physicists call causality .
Causality means that empty spacetime has a structure that allows us to distinguish unambiguously between cause and effect .
It is an integral part of the classical theories of special and general relativity .
Euclidean quantum gravity does not build in a notion of causality .
The term “ Euclidean ” indicates that space and time are treated equally .
The universes that enter the Euclidean superposition have four spatial directions instead of the usual one of time and three of space .
Because Euclidean universes have no distinct notion of time , they have no structure to put events into a specific order ; people living in these universes would not have the words “ cause ” or “ effect ” in their vocabulary .
Hawking and others taking this approach have said that “ time is imaginary , ” in both a mathematical sense and a colloquial one .
Their hope was that causality would emerge as a large - scale property from microscopic quantum fluctuations that individually carry no imprint of a causal structure .
But the computer simulations dashed that hope .
Instead of disregarding causality when assembling individual universes and hoping for it to reappear through the collective wisdom of the superposition , we decided to incorporate the causal structure at a much earlier stage .
The technical term for our method is causal dynamical triangulations .
In it , we first assign each simplex an arrow of time pointing from the past to the future .
Then we enforce causal gluing rules : two simplices must be glued together to keep their arrows pointing in the same direction .
The simplices must share a notion of time , which unfolds steadily in the direction of these arrows and never stands still or runs backward .
By building in a time dimension that behaves differently from the space dimensions , the authors claim to have solved a problem that ’s notoriously plagued computer simulations of quantum gravity models : namely , that of recovering a spacetime that “ behave [s ] on large distances like a four - dimensional , extended object and not like a crumpled ball or polymer ” .
Are their results another indication that time might not be an illusion after all ?
Time ( hopefully a polynomial amount of it ) will tell .
REALITY WINS IN COURT !
Three separate test cases were before special courts , all alleging that autism was caused by vaccines .
The courts were set up by the government as part of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program , done basically to look at the very rare cases where it was possible that vaccines caused some harm to the people inoculated .
The cases started in 2007 , and in all three courts , the rulings were basically identical : there is no cause to compensate parents of autistic children due to the vaccines those children received .
In other words , these three special courts all ruled that in these cases there is no scientific claim that vaccines cause autism .
In fact , in one ruling , a special master ( the judge , essentially ) said the parents of one troubled child had " been misled by physicians who are guilty , in my view , of gross medical misjudgment . "
The claims of links between autism and vaccines were also cited as " speculative and unpersuasive . "
Damn straight .
My heart goes out to these parents , looking for some sort of reason why their children are autistic .
I can hardly imagine what that must be like .
But it is absolutely 100 % critical that in our emotional and utterly human outreach for an explanation that we do not grasp at the wrong ones .
Vaccines do n't cause autism .
The science is extremely persuasive , and I would even say conclusive .
However , as I have said before , the vocal antivaxxers will not be persuaded by this .
They are impervious to reason , impervious to evidence , and impervious to facts .
They are not looking at this rationally , they have a religious fervor and nothing can sway them from that .
Here is a quote from one article on the new rulings :
" I think it is a mistake to conclude that , because these few test cases were denied compensation , it 's been decided vaccines do n't play any role in regressive autism , " said Barbara Loe Fisher , the [ National Vaccine Information ] center 's president .
That is complete nonsense .
It 's not been decided based on these rulings , it 's been decided based on many scientifically - produced tests looking for any link between vaccines and autism .
These rulings were based on a few test cases , and those were unpersuasive legally .
Scientifically , the results are extremely persuasive , if you happen to live in the reality - based community .
The point being that vocal antivaxxers do n't have property anywhere near there .
This ruling will only make them dig in further , and double their efforts to make sure that children all across the planet become victims to diseases which can kill or debilitate them , diseases which can be prevented by the simple effort of getting a shot .
These rulings are incredibly important , and definitely cause for celebration .
But the two things we must always remember to do : have sympathy for the parents in these situations ( but not so much that we are swayed by unreasonable arguments ) , and be vigilant .
The antivaxxers will not go away , and we must keep fighting .
It can not be overstated : the lives of our children are at stake here .
This is nothing less than a pending global health crisis .
The Air Force Institute of Technology has come up with a new way to passively monitor BitTorrent traffic .
The system works by passively monitoring all traffic flowing toward users , and then recognizing the BitTorrent header in packets .
Once the system sees such a header , it takes the hash of the file and compares it to a list of known " bad " hashes .
If there is a match , the system logs it for further investigation .
Reportedly , the system uses FPGAs ( field programmable gate arrays ) , which are chips that can be configured to perform different functions .
This may suggest that the system is built to be very fast , but as the sniffing capability tops out at 100 Mbps , it looks like the designers simply used FPGAs as a convenient system - on - a - chip .
Even a five - year old PC can perform light to moderate traffic - sniffing duties at 1 G bps speeds in software .
Big Content would of course be on cloud nine if ISPs could be convinced to install devices like this — and the argument that kicking pirates off the network would free up a lot of bandwidth may go a long way toward convincing them .
On the other hand , inspecting the content of a user 's traffic in this way has serious privacy implications , and is likely to fall afoul of the law in some countries .
Another issue facing such systems is creating a comprehensive set of hashes of copyrighted files in real time .
It would very likely be easier to have the sniffers simply log all hashes , then figure out which are the offending ones later .
But all of this is moot , as the system is easily thwarted by encrypting BitTorrent traffic , which already happens for some 25 percent of BitTorrent traffic today .
Ultimately , it 's not clear that a system like this addresses a real need .
The Achilles heel of BitTorrent is the need for the peers participating in the file transfer to find each other .
Traditionally this is done through a centralized tracker that provides each peer with addresses of other peers , but modern BitTorrent clients can also perform this function in peer - to - peer fashion .

I have watched with mild amusement this week the self - immolation of the Republican Party as it bows before the altar of Rush Limbaugh , begging for mercy , pleading for forgiveness , breathlessly seeking guidance and wisdom from The Oracle .
President Obama and the Democratic Party have wasted no time in pointing out to the American people this marriage from hell , tying Rush like a rock around the collective Republican neck and hoping for its quick descent to the netherworld of irrelevance .
But some commentators ( Richard Wolffe of Newsweek , Chuck Todd of NBC News , etc. ) have likened this to " what Republicans tried to do to the Democrats with Michael Moore . "
Perhaps .
But there is one central difference :
What I have believed in , and what I have stood for in these past eight years -- an end to the war , establishing universal health care , closing Guantanamo and banning torture , making the rich pay more taxes and aggressively going after the corporate chiefs on Wall Street -- these are all things which the majority of Americans believe in too .
That 's why in November the majority voted for the guy I voted for .
The majority of Americans rejected the ideology of Rush and embraced the same issues I have raised consistently in my movies and books .
How did this happen ?
Considering how , for the past eight years , the Republican machine thought they could somehow smear and damage the Democrats if they said it was " the party of Michael Moore , " it appears that the American public heard them loud and clear and decided that , 'hey , if you say Michael Moore is connected to the Democrats , then the Democrats must be OK !'
During this past election , a Democrat in Michigan , Mark Schauer , was running against the incumbent Republican congressman , Rep. Tim Walberg .
Schauer asked me to endorse him and campaign for him , and I did .
The Republicans were thrilled .
They acted like they had been handed manna from heaven .
They filled the airwaves with attack ads showing pictures of me and asking voters , 'is this the guy you want influencing your congressman ? '
The voters of western Michigan said " YES ! " and threw the Republican out of office .
The newly elected congressman told me his poll numbers had gone up once the Republicans started running ads likening him to me .
There have been over a half - dozen attack documentaries on me ( Michael Moore Hates America , Fahrenhype 9/11 , etc. ) , plus a feature film starring Kelsey Grammer and James Woods that had me being slapped silly for 83 minutes .
Several books have been written by the Right in a concerted attempt to denounce me .
One book , 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America , had me listed at # 1 .
The author was so sure people would know why , he did n't even bother to write a chapter on me like he did for the other 99 .
You just get to the end of the book and all it says is " # 1 " with nothing but a big picture of me that takes up a full page .
What made the Republicans so sure that Americans would recoil upon the mere mention of my name , or by simply showing a photo of my face ?
The result of this was one colossal backfire .
The more they attacked me , the more the public decided to check out who this " devil " was and what he was saying .
And -- oops ! -- more than a few people liked what they saw .
Overnight I went from having a small , loyal following to having millions go to movie theaters to watch ... documentaries ?
Wow .
Yes , the more the Right went after me , the more people got to hear what I was saying -- and eventually the majority , for some strange reason , ended up agreeing with me -- not Rush Limbaugh -- and elected Barack Obama as president of the United States , a man who promised to end the war , bring about universal health care , close Guantanamo , stop torture , tax the rich , and rein in the abusive masters of Wall Street .
Think about this road I 've traveled .
At the beginning of the Bush years , I was pretty much an outsider , referred to as being on the " far left . "
I usually found myself holding viewpoints that differed from the majority of the people in this country .
When I spoke out against the war -- before it even started -- I was marginalized by the mainstream media and then booed off the Oscar stage in " liberal Hollywood " for commenting about a " fictitious " president .
Seventy percent of the public back then supported the war and approved of the job George W. Bush was doing .
But I stuck to what I believed in , kept churning out my movies , and never looked back .
The Right and the White House spokespeople came after me time after time .
President Bush 41 called me an " a** " on TV , and I became a favorite punching bag at both the 2004 and the 2008 Republican National Conventions in speeches by John McCain and Joe Lieberman .
On the front page of this morning 's Washington Post , Mark McKinnon , a top adviser to George W. Bush , revealed -- for the first time -- the Bush White House strategy of singling me out in the hopes of turning the country against me and the Democratic Party .
Here 's what the Post said :
Mark McKinnon , a top adviser in President George W. Bush 's campaigns , acknowledged the value of picking a divisive opponent .
" We used a similar strategy by making Michael Moore the face of the Democratic Party , " he said of the documentary filmmaker .
In the end it all proved to be a big strategic mistake on their part .
Thanks to the Republican attacks on me , average Joes and Janes started to listen to what I had to say .
Contrary to Richard Wolffe 's assessment that " there were no Democrats as far as I can remember who were saying they stood with Michael Moore , " Democrats , in fact , have stood side by side with me during all of this .
Here 's the Congressional Black Caucus supporting me on Capitol Hill in 2004 .
Here 's Terry McAuliffe , the head of the Democratic National Committee , enthusiastically attending the premiere of " Fahrenheit 9/11 " with two dozen senators and members of Congress .
Here 's a group of Democratic congresspeople endorsing my film Sicko in the chambers of the House Judiciary Committee in 2007 .
And here 's President Jimmy Carter inviting me to sit with him in his box at the Democratic National Convention .
Far from making me into a pariah , the Republicans helped the Democratic leadership realize that to identify themselves publicly with me meant reaching the millions who followed and supported my work .

Radio show host Michael Savage 's copyright infringement claim against a Muslim rights group has been thrown out , with the judge ruling that the group acted well within the doctrine of fair use when it posted a clip from his show on its website .
The case may be dead in the water for now , but likely wo n't remain there for long ;
Savage plans to amend his claims and continue going after what he describes as a terrorist group that is using his words for its own benefit .
In late 2007 , Savage used his radio show , Savage Nation , to go on a rant about Muslims in America .
On air , Savage detailed how he thought Muslims should be deported from the US immediately , how " 90 percent are on welfare , " and how they are directly tied in to the September 11 terrorist attacks .
The Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) took issue with Savage 's claims and posted a four - minute excerpt of the show on its website , along with a rebuttal .
Savage filed a lawsuit against the group alleging copyright infringement , although his complaint focused very little on copyright .
Instead , he used the vast majority of the lawsuit as an extended rant about " CAIR and it 's [ sic ] terror connections , " and how the group was " tied to terror from the day it was formed . "
He also says his comments were taken out of context , and that other excerpts from his show would show that he is not anti-Muslim .
In addition to all of the above , Savage made a racketeering claim against CAIR , saying that " the role of CAIR and CAIR - Canada is to wage PSYOPS ( psychological warfare ) and disinformation activities on behalf of Whabbi - based [ sic ]
Islamic terrorists throughout North America .
They are the intellectual ' shock troops ' of Islamic terrorism . "
Further , he said that the group had caused him to lose $ 1 million in advertising revenue , and that it was using his words for its own fundraising purposes .
CAIR responded to the suit with the help of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , merely saying that US copyright law allows for anyone to use clips of copyrighted material for criticism or commentary , and that Savage 's complaint is " laced with falsities and xenophobic fantasies to punish and intimidate the Council for American - Islamic Relations . "
That more or less brings us to where we are today .
Late last week , US District Judge Susan Illston dismissed the lawsuit , agreeing with CAIR and the EFF that citizens are allowed by law to use snippets from public broadcasts for comment and criticism .
She said that reprinting or rebroadcasting portions of a copyrighted work is sometimes necessary in order to provide a complete and easily understandable rebuttal .
Additionally , Illston said that Savage failed to provide evidence that the alleged copyright infringement was responsible for his loss of ad revenue , and she ruled that Savage was unable to show how the " alarming " racketeering charges affected him .
Although the case has been dismissed , it is probably not over .
Illston noted that Savage has until August 15 to amend his claims and ask that the case be reheard , which is exactly what he plans to do .
" We are prepared to file a very detailed and well - documented new complaint , " Savage 's attorney Daniel Horowitz told the San Francisco Chronicle .
Horowitz did n't go into detail on how Savage plans to continue going after CAIR ( apart from raising money on his website over the issue ) , but CAIR also indicated that it , too , would continue fighting the case .

A security lapse at Kaspersky has exposed a wealth of proprietary information about the anti-virus provider 's products and customers , according to a blogger , who posted screen shots and other details that appeared to substantiate the claims .
In a posting made Saturday , the hacker claimed a simple SQL injection gave access to a database containing " users , activation codes , lists of bugs , admins , shop , etc . "
Kaspersky has declined to comment , but two security experts who reviewed the evidence said the claims appeared convincing .
" This looks very real to me , " Thomas Ptacek , a researcher at security provider Matasano said via instant message a few hours after the post went live .
He pointed to the address bar of one screenshot that showed usa.
kaspersky.com along with the text " concat_ws ( 0x3a , ver " to the right of that .
" It 's a URL that is being used to alter the database request that 's used to generate the page , " he added .
" One of them can be tricked into pulling arbitrary data from the database .
Game over . "
Roger Thompson , chief research officer at competing anti-virus provider AVG concurred .
" / me feels sorry for Kaspersky , " he wrote to El Reg .
" Ca n't tell for certain , but it looks legit . "
Representatives from Kaspersky declined to immediately comment .
" Given the hour , we are not able available to talk now , but I will work on answers for you to have early tomorrow , " a spokeswoman wrote in an email sent Saturday evening California time , several hours after the post was made .
It claimed that a simple modification of a URL exposed the site 's entire database .
" Alter one of the parameters and you have access to EVERYTHING : users , activation codes , lists of bugs , admins , shot , etc . "
The screenshots showed the attack was focused on Kaspersky 's technical support and knowledge base for the Americas .
It included the names of more than 150 tables .
The URLs were edited to redact the page 's vulnerable handler , but tools that are easy to come by could help anyone who knows how to use them to identify where the SQL injection weakness is located , Ptecek said .
Assuming the hack is for real , it would n't be the first time a Kaspersky site has been hit by a SQL injection attack .
In July , Kaspersky 's Malaysian site and several subdomains were defaced by hacker who left pro-Turkish slogans .
According to ZDNet 's Zero Day blog here , Zone-h archives show 36 website defacements of international Kaspersky sites since 2000 .
This breach appears to be more serious because it potentially exposes customer information and could also open Kaspersky 's site to other types of abuse , security experts said .
" I hope that Kaspersky administrators fix this vulnerability rather quickly as they no doubt have a large customer base , and it would appear that all those customers are now exposed , " Gunter Ollmann , the chief security strategist at IBM 's Internet Security Systems blogs here .
" On top of that , this type of critical flaw can probably be used to usurp legitimate purchases and renewals of their products - which could include the linking to malicious and backdoored versions of their software - thereby infecting those very same customers that were seeking protection from malware in the first place . "

DETROIT  Ford Motor said Wednesday that its new agreement with the United Automobile Workers union would save at least $ 500 million a year and , within several years , bring its labor costs into line with what foreign competitors pay their workers in the United States .
Ford said the deal , which U.A.W. members ratified this week , immediately reduces its “ all - in ” hourly rate , which includes benefits , to $ 55 .
It said the figure would continue to decline as more workers took buyouts and as the new - vehicle market recovered , allowing increased production .
Ford ’s labor costs now amount to a little more than $ 60 an hour , including health care for retirees .
Labor costs for the so - called transplant automakers , including Toyota and Honda , have been about $ 49 an hour in the United States and are rising , Ford estimates .
If your router is n't providing the range you need , try these tips
It might have taken the best part of a decade to ratify but the 802.11n wireless standard was worth the wait .
It also helps that we 've all been able to enjoy the benefits for the last few years while t's were crossed and i's were dotted .
But that 's not to say we all get a perfect wireless experience even with the immense cleverness of MIMO .
So no matter if you 're running a wireless network new or old here are our top tips for tweaking more out of your signal .
1. Switch channels
You might think that with up to 14 channels available there 'd be plenty of free ones for everyone .
Unfortunately physics is a harsh master : the channels are only allocated 5MHz apart and cross- channel interference can affect up to 11MHz either side .
This effectively means only channels 1 , 6 and 11 are adequately separated , though depending on your environmental situations interim channels might be optimal .
For instance is all are taken but 1 and 6 are less powerful , then channel 3 would be best .
2 . The fat channel
As part of the 802.11n specification there 's the option for 40MHz channels .
Idealistically this is designed for 5GHz systems as this region has far more available channels , however it can be activated at the 2.4GHz level but it 's pretty much guaranteed to interfere with anything else nearby taking up the majority of available channels .
We 'll leave it up to your conscience but most routers enable you to force 40 MHz channels .
3 . Go ' N ' only
The 802.11n standard is very sympathetic to older standards .
It maintains a lot of backwards compatibility and anti-interference features so as not to disrupt 802.11b / g networks .
This is rubbish !
If you 're lucky enough , switch your router to 802.11n only , plus opt to use WPA2 security with AES encryption .
WPA2 with AES offers the best encryption option , though it may not be supported by older routers as it requires additional hardware .
Similarly once switched to ' N mode ' you may find an Extra Wireless Protection mode - turn this off as it's about reducing interference to 802.11 b networks .
4 . Check your adaptor 's power settings
A lot of the time your wireless adaptor will , rightly so , adjust itself to your laptop or PC 's power settings .
This is fine but what if you 're in a poor reception situation ?
Windows 7 and Vista offer controls via the Control Panel > Power Options >
Change plan settings >
Change advanced power settings > Wireless Adapter Settings .
You might want to go straight to the horse 's mouth and directly adjust power settings via the Device Manager : select Start > Run > type devmgmt.msc and click OK .
Locate your wireless adaptor under Network adapters , double click it and select the Advanced tab .
5. Avoid interference
The majority of us are running 2.4GHz equipment - it 's a noisy place to live and it's a frequency that 's absorbed and reflected by specific things .
Ideally , avoid brick walls - going through wood floors or interior drywalls is much more preferable .
Water is an issue , it absorbs this spectrum hence why microwave ovens run at the same frequency .
If you have water tanks , avoid them .
Microwaves are also a dead zone , as their shielding will block signals .
Mirrors are also an issue , along with radiators that are metal and full of water .
DECT phones in Europe operate at 1.9GHz , but in the US there are three bands of 900MHz , 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz .
So it 's best to opt for the higher or lower models in that territory .
Hamas is accused of using violence to stifle opposition in Gaza
A long - term truce between the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel may be announced within days , Hamas officials said in Cairo .
Border crossings would reportedly be re-opened and a ceasefire would be called for 18 months under the Egyptian - brokered deal .
Israel and Hamas called unilateral truces at the end of Israel 's offensive against Gaza last month .
US envoy George Mitchell recently urged the sides to extend their ceasefire .
There was no immediate Israeli reaction to Thursday 's announcement by Hamas officials .
The Israeli army said Palestinian militants in Gaza had fired at least two rockets into southern Israel , without causing damage or casualties .
It was not immediately clear which group fired the rockets , which landed near the town of Sderot .
' Obstacles removed '
Moussa Abu Marzouk , a deputy leader of Hamas , said the truce would be announced within 48 hours .
" We have agreed to the truce with the Israeli side for one year and a half [ in return ] for the opening of all six passages between the Gaza Strip and Israel , and the halting of all military activity and aggression , " he was quoted as saying by the Egyptian state news agency Mena .
Hamas , he added , would first have to consult with other Palestinian factions .
Taher al - Nono , a member of Hamas 's negotiating team in Cairo , was earlier quoted by Reuters as saying that the deal would be announced within three days .
" Most of the obstacles that prevented us from reaching an agreement were resolved , " he said .
Saying the gray wolf has successfully recovered in parts of the West , including Oregon , Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar today affirmed a federal decision to remove them from the list of threatened and endangered species .
Conservationists quickly decried Salazar 's action as premature and misguided .
The decision covers gray wolf populations in the western Great Lakes , Idaho , Montana and parts of Washington , Oregon and Utah .
Wolves will remain a protected species in Wyoming , where current state law and wolf management plans do not offer sufficient protection for the existing wolves .
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced its decision to remove the wolf from the list of threatened and endangered species in January , but President Barack Obama froze the last minute Bush administration act for review .
Salazar lifted the freeze this morning .
" The recovery of the gray wolf throughout significant portions of its historic range is one of the great success stories of the Endangered Species Act , " Salazar said .
" When it was listed as endangered in 1974 , the wolf had almost disappeared from the continental United States .
Today , we have more than 5,500 wolves , including more than 1,600 in the Rockies . "
Steve Pedery , conservation director of Oregon Wild , said the action threatened the return of wolves to Oregon and the future of " the icon of American wilderness . "
" Misguided wildlife management policies drove wolves in Oregon to extinction over 50 years ago , " Pedery said .
" True recovery of gray wolves in Oregon will depend on healthy wolf populations existing in neighboring states .
" Unfortunately , Secretary Salazar 's decision to reinstate the Bush wolf policy will put these animals back in the crosshairs in Idaho , Wyoming and elsewhere in the West , and endanger recovery in Oregon . "
Pedery urged the Obama Administration to reinstate the protective listing for gray wolves .
Gray wolves were listed as endangered in the lower 48 states , except in Minnesota , where they were listed as threatened .
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service oversees three recovery programs for the gray wolf -- each with its own recovery plan and goals based on the unique characteristics of wolf populations in each geographic area .
The northern Rocky Mountain Distinct Population Segment includes all of Montana , Idaho and Wyoming , the eastern third of Washington and Oregon and a small part of north - central Utah .
The minimum recovery goal for the region is at least 30 breeding pairs and at least 300 wolves for at least three consecutive years .
That goal was achieved in 2002 and has been exceeded each year since .
There are currently about 95 breeding pairs and 1,600 wolves in Montana , Idaho and Wyoming .
Federal officials will continue to work with the State of Wyoming to develop adequate state protection for the wolves there .
Salazar credited the work of states , tribes , landowners , researchers , sportsmen and conservation groups and the Canadian government with the return of the Gray wolf .
The service will monitor the delisted wolf populations for at least five years to ensure their recovery continues .
At that time , the service could decide to relist the wolves , continue monitoring or end its monitoring .
Wolves in other parts of the 48 states remain endangered and are not affected by today 's action .

A woman who received a $ 5,077 bill from AT&T for data charges on her netbook is suing the wireless carrier , along with RadioShack , for fraud .
The lawsuit was filed by Oklahoma resident Billie Parks last week , and alleges that the two companies conspired to promote a netbook + data deal that deliberately misled customers and tricked them into paying thousands of dollars per month for service .
Parks purchased a netbook from RadioShack in December of 2008 after the electronics retailer began advertising a heavily subsidized netbook deal : for $ 99.99 and a two - year AT&T contract , customers could buy a netbook with AT&T's DataConnect plan , allowing them to get online from anywhere .
The DataConnect service costs roughly $ 60 per month before the usual taxes and fees .
According to Parks ' complaint , she was warned by RadioShack that her first AT&T bill might be a bit more than expected due to a $ 36 activation fee , a month 's worth of service billed in advance , and prorated charges from when she signed up .
She was not , however warned that any Internet data usage over 5GB would result in " astronomical additional charges running into the thousands of dollars . "
She claims that the Customer Service Summary she received states that additional charges apply , but it was impossible for consumers to determine what those charges would be .
As a result , Parks believes that she and other RadioShack / AT&T consumers were victims of fraud due to the companies ' " misleading " advertising and convenient omissions .
The complaint also charges the two companies with engaging in deceptive trade practices and violations of Consumer Protection Acts in the various states where the plan was sold .
Parks is attempting to have her lawsuit classified as a class action and hopes to see RadioShack and AT&T ordered to cover all of the additional charges , cancel the DataConnect contracts , and be hit with an injunction barring the companies from enforcing the contracts in the future .
As usual for these types of cases , AT&T indicates that some of the accusations are a bit excessive and says it goes to great lengths to make sure customers know the details of additional charges .
" We 're reviewing the suit and do n’t have a comment on it at this time , " AT&T spokesperson Seth Bloom told Ars .
" But I can tell you that we go to considerable lengths to inform customers of the limits involved in these plans .
We display the plan usage limits and overage rates on our collateral , terms and conditions , and on att.com , And customers can check their usage using myWireless Account or by using the usage monitoring capability on the AT&T Communications Manager application . "
Their partner , RadioShack does n't appear to make mention of the cap on any of its promotional materials , which is undoubtedly going to take this suit from " slam dunk " status ( on the part of the defendants , that is ) down to " layup . "
Ultimately , the fact that AT&T's own documentation communicates the limit and additional usage charges will hurt Parks ' case , though the lawsuit may prompt the company to be even more direct with customers about how much they could wind up paying when they commit to that contract .

STRASBOURG , France ( Reuters ) - A European Union law to reinforce freedom on the Internet would be unnecessary and put operators in a difficult position , the bloc ’s top telecoms and media regulator said on Tuesday .
European Telecoms Commissioner Viviane Reding speaks during an interview with Reuters in Paris , July 17 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Vincent Kessler
The U.S. Congress has drafted a Global Online Freedom Act. Some European Parliament members want the EU to follow suit , saying authoritarian nations are increasingly censoring the Web by blocking sites and intimidating users with “ cyber police . ”
Such actions violate human rights , the EU lawmakers say .
The American law would promote freedom of expression on the Web and protect U.S. companies from coercion to participate in repression .
“ Should the EU have specific legislation on Internet freedom ?
I am not convinced so far that hard law is the best way to deal with the challenge , ” EU Telecoms Commissioner Viviane Reding told a meeting in the European Parliament .
Instruments sought by some campaigners such as export controls , civil and criminal penalties , and the creation of a specific EU body controlling European Internet companies with operations abroad were “ heavy , ” she said .
“ I believe that we should not put European companies in an invidious position where their choice appears to be to break the law or leave the market to more unscrupulous operators , ” Reding said .
“ Rather , our goal should be to find ways to allow operators and service providers to respect human rights without doing either , ” she added .
Reding said the U.S. State Department and Department of Justice were cautious about the Global Online Freedom
Act as even democratic countries in Western Europe could be subject to restrictions foreseen in the draft bill .
U.S. companies have called instead for a code of conduct setting out minimum corporate standards related to Internet freedom .
Suggestions that EU money could be used to research and develop anti-censorship software were attractive and would be followed up , Reding said .
Thank goodness , yes it is .
There 's a horrible tension when you return to a game that 's entered legend .
What if it was hype ?
What if things have moved on so far that it creaks and you feel silly trying to play it ?
Worst of all , what if you 've been desperately hoping for an oft - suggested sequel , getting excited at the prospect of its existence , and then you discover the original was n't what you remembered ?
Thank goodness , Beyond Good & Evil is still every bit as wonderful .
Hillys , a planet under siege by an alien enemy known as the DomZ , is the home of Jade , a photographic journalist and foster parent to the area 's increasing population of orphans .
It 's an odd place , where various anthropomorphised species co-exist in a city made up of a collection of islands .
Frequent attacks from the DomZ mean life is constantly interrupted with bombardments from horrendous beasts , while many citizens are kidnapped , and never heard of again .
Jade , on her private island , in her lighthouse home , is immediately one of gaming 's most completely lovely people .
Not only is she the most modestly attractive videogame character ever to have stolen our hearts , but she dedicates all her spare time to raising orphans .
Living with her " uncle " , Pey'j , a pig - like creature who helps Jade raise the kids as well as working on mechanical projects in his workshop , times are tough .
The electricity is cut off due to late payment right as an attack arrives , leaving them without a shield .
This leads to the kidnapping DomZ beasts trapping a number of Jade 's adopted children .
These alien foes get seven shades of crap pummelled out of them as you 're introduced to Jade 's dai - jo staff - based combat .
Jade looks sad !
Now I feel sad .
Needing money , Jade picks up work cataloguing Hillys ' flora and fauna for a database .
Which means as the game begins , your first post - fight task is to walk around your island , taking photographs .
It 's a remarkably gentle introduction , letting you explore all the nooks and crannies of the lighthouse and surrounding area .
You quickly get used to using the camera , snapping pictures of the various species of children living with you , your pet dog , and the wild creatures that live nearby .
With enough on film , you receive your first payment , and get the electricity back on .
It 's so mundane , so calm , that it 's hard to imagine any game daring to open this way .
But it sets a mood that 's essential to understanding everything that 's going to follow .
Jade is a calm , practical person , thrown into remarkable circumstances .
She 's not an action hero , and is n't going to become one .
What struck me most , returning to this after many years , was quite how unlike anything else the game was .
There are comparisons to be drawn , certainly .
The gorgeous chunky cartoon world ( still adorable after over five years , thanks in part to smart design in the first place , and partly due to the PC version happily scaling to enormous resolutions ) and third - person action are in some ways traditional , recalling Ratchet & Clank .
That mixture of relaxed exploration punctuated by frantic action .
However , this is a whole other kind of relaxed .
The gang , from left to right : HH , Jade , Secundo and Uncle Pey'j
The story 's broken up into four distinct chapters : the early exploration and discovery of the city , The Factory , the Slaughterhouse , and finally the Moon .
However , between each you 're left to your own devices in a remarkably unhurried fashion .
I 'm so sick of games telling me I can choose what I want to do , while screaming in my ear that I need to be hurrying somewhere else .
While perhaps Jade has good reasons for pressing on as the plot progresses , the game does n't fuss at you if you want to compete in one of the hovercraft races , or chase pirates , or hunt in caves for pearls , or just go and have a chat with the kids milling around the lighthouse or sunbathing on the cliffs .
Maybe play a game with a shark in the bar ( a shark , geddit ?! ) .
Or , most of all , using a scanner you 've purchased , go on the hunt for other species you have n't photographed yet .
There 's a marvellous story to play through , and the game 's distinctly different styles appear in those narrative sections , but BG&E is n't hurrying you .
It 's a quiet , gentle game , and it wants you to feel that , to relax into it .
Hillys is apparently being protected by a military force called The Alpha Section .
Their constant , omnipresent messages on TV , radio and floating video screens , assure citizens that without them the DomZ would kill them all , and how grateful they should be to their Alpha Section overlords .
Unsurprisingly , this is less than truthful .
Jade soon discovers an underground movement of rebels called The IRIS Network , who are plotting against the Alpha Section , who they maintain are in league with the DomZ.
Joining IRIS , Jade 's photojournalistic skills are put to good use , as she 's sent into the Alpha Section areas to photograph illicit activity and send it back to IRIS , who then publish it in their underground literature aimed at undermining the authorities .

“ Mr. Frank will bring back legislation to repeal the UIGEA ( Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act ) , ” the spokesman said , referring to a Republican - crafted bill passed in 2006 when the party controlled Congress and the White House .
Supporters of the ban argued offshore Internet gambling websites take billions of dollars out the U.S. economy , damage families and serve as vehicles for money laundering .
The law cost Europe ’s online gambling companies billions in lost market value as they were forced to retreat from one of their most lucrative markets .
It barred businesses from knowingly accepting payments in connection with unlawful Internet gambling , including payments made through credit cards , electronic fund transfers and checks .
Against Frank ’s advice , the Bush administration finalized regulations late last year to implement the ban and gave companies until December 1 to comply .
Frank said the rules would burden the financial service industry at a time of economic crisis .
Many publicly traded European companies , including PartyGaming and 888.com , withdrew from the United States after Congress passed the ban , but they face possible criminal prosecution for activities before then .
Anurag Dikshit , a founder of PartyGaming , pleaded guilty in December to Internet gambling charges and agreed to pay $ 300 million in fines .
He still faces possible jail time under a deferred sentencing arrangement .
Other PartyGaming founders have not settled with the U.S. Justice Department .
EU industry officials said the pressure on Dikshit to make a deal showed the Justice Department had crossed a major line in its prosecution of cases .
The European Commission , acting on industry petition , began a formal investigation in March into whether Washington was singling out EU companies for enforcement actions while allowing U.S. online firms to operate freely .
Sources familiar with that investigation told Reuters in Brussels on Thursday they expect the investigators ’ report , initially due last year , to recommend action at the WTO when it is released next month .
Rather than move immediately to litigation , EU officials would use the report as leverage to seek a negotiated solution with the United States , they said .

Lawrence Lessig has a new cause — and new job to go with it .
For more than a decade , the Stanford law professor and Creative Commons founder has focused his efforts on Internet and copyright issues , advocating a “ free culture ” that puts fewer legal barriers in the way of artists who adapt and build upon the works of others .
Now he says he ’s finished his final book on the topic , Remix , and he recently announced that he will leave Stanford to run the Edmond J. Safra Foundation Center for Ethics at Harvard .
From this new perch , Lessig will take aim at his latest target : corruption , particularly as it relates to the influence of money in politics .
Last year , Lessig launched a new project , Change Congress , which calls on politicians to back four corruption - fighting reforms : stopping contributions from lobbyists or political action committees , ending earmarks , increasing congressional transparency , and supporting public financing of congressional campaigns .
The organization also provides online tools that allow voters to see which politicians support these reforms , donate money to politicians who stand against corruption , and “ pester ” elected officials who have yet to take a stand .
The organization ’s latest project is a nationwide “ donor strike ” asking citizens to refrain from donating money to political campaigns until Congress takes steps to limit the influence of money in politics .
Mother Jones spoke with Lessig recently about his new job , his hopes for Barack Obama ’s presidency , and how corruption poisons politics .
The interview has been edited for clarity and length .
Mother Jones :
When you announced your decision to leave Stanford for the Safra Center , you indicated that your new focus on corruption would become “ the primary focus of the Center , and complement its mission . ”
Do you think it will be hard to refocus an entire institution like the Safra Center on one specific issue ?
Lawrence Lessig : No , because it ’s a dictatorial organization .
The director gets to choose .
I ’m joking .
In theory it would be hard , but the negotiations that led to my acceptance of the position were pretty clearly focused around the idea that at least part of the work of the center is going to be redirected towards this problem .
Nobody expects that we ’re going to dismantle the ongoing life of the center and direct it exclusively to this , but certainly this is going to be some of its work for the next five years .
MJ : Is there going to be a redesign of the Safra website in the works ?
It ’s pretty Web 0.5 …
LL : Oh my god , yes .
There ’s actually one that I ’ve learned is in the works right now .
I have not seen it yet .
So that might be fine , but yes , a lot of work to do on the Web .
MJ : Are you leaving most of your copyright work at Stanford , in the hands of the institutions that you ’ve worked with there ?
Or are you going to be bringing part of that to Harvard ?
LL : I do n’t think I ’m going to be continuing the work on copyright - reform issues .
I still am on the board of Creative Commons , and obviously will work to support that organization as much as I can , but I ’m trying to be very disciplined about focusing exclusively on this new area .
The complication to that is this book that I finished a year ago that I ’m talking about , so I ’m going to have to continue talking about that book , Remix , but once that ’s in the rearview mirror then I think that ’s it .
MJ : You supported Barack Obama for president .
Is he the person to fix Washington ?
Do you trust that Obama is going to follow through on his promises ?
LL : He certainly is going to follow through on his promises , but the question is what ’s the set of priorities .
I ’ve described this analogy : Imagine you have cancer and you ’re going to the hospital for chemotherapy and on the way you ’re the victim of a drive - by shooting .
That ’s kind of the state of our nation today .
So Obama early in his campaign was talking about the cancer , and then on the way to the election we had this series of catastrophes which have created this traumalike situation , so he ’s got a certain amount of triage that has to be engaged in immediately , for the next chunk of time .
And then the question is whether he gets beyond that to the more fundamental questions of change that he always was focusing on .
I do n’t doubt that he ’d want to do it , but the question is whether he ’s going to be focused enough to get it done .
MJ : It ’s not just Obama that needs to act for this change to happen , though ; it ’s also Congress — that ’s why you founded Change Congress .
Are you surprised that sitting members might be reluctant to take a stand on corruption ?
LL : I ’m not surprised .
My view has always been that the problem here is n’t Democrats or Republicans :
The problem is both .
The problem is incumbency , and any system that changes the dynamics of incumbency is going to be resisted by the incumbents , and I think that ’s what we ’re seeing .
We have a set of strategies about how to overcome that , but it ’s only going to come from lots of pressure on the outside trying to force the system on the inside to change .
MJ : So have you been disappointed in the progress so far ?
LL : I ’m constantly disappointed in the sense that I always think we should be able to do more .
I guess I ’m not surprised .
I wish that we had accomplished more , and we ’re thinking about a way to refocus to accomplish more .
McCain was pretty good at creating ambiguity about who is the party of reform , and that made it hard to focus on the reform issue tied directly to one movement during the presidential election .
So it got to be a more complicated debate than any of us thought six months ago .
MJ : You said that Obama has a lot of different problems he has to deal with , but let ’s say it ’s April or May and Congress has decided , well , maybe we should address this corruption issue .
Do you see yourself in the role of going to Washington and testifying and talking to members of Congress about this issue ?
LL : If I were asked to testify about it , I would of course testify , but I do n’t actually think that there ’s a lot of progress to be made walking around Washington thinking about this issue .
That ’s not the target of my work .
There ’s been 100 years of people thinking about how to reform Washington , and some great work has been done on it , but a lot of this has to be done by people who do n’t have an interest in going to Washington , who do n’t have an interest in becoming part of the system , but instead just want to make the system function .
That ’s where I think I would come into it .
MJ : You mentioned in one of your recent talks that 68 or 69 percent of Americans support some form of public financing .
But the old criticism of that is that while people tend to support process reforms , they do n’t tend to get excited about them .
LL : That ’s been the historical experience over the past 40 years , but process reforms in our history have been quite important moments of constitutional change .
The Watergate changes were a set of process reforms .
The challenge is , how do you phrase issues so that people begin to recognize that the issue that they ’re most concerned about — whether it ’s global warming , or health care , or safety in the workplace , or safe foods for their kids to eat — is at base also an issue about the kind of corruption that I am focused on .
We ’re thinking , how do you get people to have a refrain in their head : “ It ’s the money , stupid . ”
That ’s the constant single thread that links these problems that people look at , and at a certain point , get people to recognize they ’re just going to have to do something about this underlying problem .
It ’s hard .
I just do n’t accept the idea it ’s impossible , which is what people typically infer from the common wisdom about process reform .
Reform is possible , especially here , especially because so many people are so deeply convinced about the underlying predicate for that reform , namely that the system is corrupt .
MJ : You ’ve been saying that it ’s not just government that faces these corruption issues .
It ’s doctors , scientists , lawyers , journalists as well .
So even if you do fix this on a governmental level , how can you address the corruption within the professions ?
LL : That ’s the purpose of this five - year project that I ’ve launched at the ethics center at the Harvard Kennedy School .
The strategy is first to make the similar problem across these domains visible , so that people can begin to see something they ’re familiar with is actually similar to a problem that ’s existing in science or in journalism or in government .
So you can begin to see a common problem , a common thread , and then recognize very plainly the costs that this common problem poses across a whole series of institutions as a way to build a resolve to address it .
Now , I ’m not so naive as to think that we ’re going to build overnight the will to resist it across the domains .
It ’s not a black - and - white problem ; it ’s largely a problem of degree .
What we ’ve seen happen since the mid-1980s is a slow shift to a kind of norm or ethic that accepted that whatever private return you can extract , it ’s okay for you and okay for the system to encourage that .
And it would be enormously beneficial even just to turn that back four or five notches in the other direction , so more and more people find moments or opportunities in their professional experience and private life to resist that dynamic .
I do n’t think someone ’s going to write a book and it ’s going to change the world , but I do think that if we start a conversation that hundreds , thousands of people begin to participate in to focus on this problem , that we can begin to move the dial back the other way .
At least that ’s the hope , because I do n’t see any other way of doing it .

I skipped my annual NBA All - Star Weekend column because I was frantically trying to finish my book .
At least that 's how I rationalized it .
I need to finish this book .
I have a deadline .
I can't afford to spend that writing time on anything else .
But after reflecting for a few days , I came to a sobering conclusion :
The book was a convenient excuse .
I could have found time to pump out that column .
I just did n't want to hand it in .

The Suns might have air - mailed Shaq to Cleveland if the Cavs had been willing to take on his contract .
See , it would n't have been a typical All - Star Weekend account for me .
It would have been about money .
You might remember me writing that the NBA was the No Balls Association two years ago .
Now it 's the No Benjamins Association .
Nobody is rolling in Benjamins anymore .
Everyone is scared .
Money hangs over everything .
That 's what I ended up discussing for four solid days in Phoenix .
Hands down , it was the most depressing All - Star Weekend I 've ever attended .
Celebrities were scarce .
The parties were n't as good or plentiful .
Even the number of groupies seemed lower than usual .
It 's not as if everyone was drinking Natural Light and eating Hamburger Helper , but still , when you 're celebrating a weekend with the No Benjamins Association , you know it .
We should have been talking about Kevin Durant 's coming - out party , a potentially delicious see - if - you - can - top - this battle between Kobe and LeBron at the game ( never happened ) , whether H - O - R - S - E worked , who might emerge in a wide - open playoff race , even whether the Nate Robinson and Dwight Howard dunk contest " battle " was too contrived only everything kept coming back to that dark cloud of money .
For once , the league 's problems have nothing to do with talent , drugs , racial issues or how the sport is being played .
With the country embroiled in its worst economic crisis in 80 years , the NBA is quietly bracing for its own little D - Day only outsiders do n't fully realize or care .
Clearly , we would n't put this budding debacle on par with the Gulf War , the collapse of American car companies , the real estate quagmire , the implosion of Wall Street , the decline of the American dollar , the shaky footing of previously untouchable media institutions ( newspapers , magazines , TV networks , movie studios and publishing companies ) , or even Vegas and the porn industry caving financially .
But All - Star Weekend invariably reflects the state of the league itself :
The shop talk at restaurants , hotel bars , parties and even during breaks at the Technology Summit provides a nice feel for how things are going ( good and bad ) .
Every 2008 conversation centered around four things : LeBron 's evolution as a superstar , the juicy possibility of a Celtics - Lakers Finals , the big Shaq / Kidd trades and the rehabilitation of New Orleans as a tourist attraction .
This season ?
We talked about money .
Constantly .
We did n't even know about the line of credit on the horizon ; that did n't leak until the Monday after the All - Star Game .
( On Thursday , we learned that 12 teams will accept the league 's offer to borrow $ 200 million from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America , with between $ 13 million and $ 20 million available to each team .
I found this ironic after learning in Phoenix that David Stern and Jerry Colangelo blew a jaw - dropping $ 100 million on the entire Redeem Team process from beginning to end .
My how times have changed . )
We knew about layoffs of employees within the league and various franchises .
We knew various local and national sponsors were bailing , most notably car companies and major banks ( two staples for the NBA ) .
We knew certain franchises were losing significant wads of money and reacting accordingly .
( Details are still trickling out .
For instance , after the trade deadline , The Sacramento Bee reported the Kings would have lost $ 25 million had they not dumped Brad Miller 's salary and bought out Mikki Moore , and the newspaper 's Kings blog reported team employees were no longer allowed to work overtime or eat dinner in the media room . )
Even trade talk -- normally a staple of any All - Star Weekend -- revolved more around themes such as , " They have to cut payroll , " " They ca n't take on any money right now " and " They 're too terrified of the tax to do anything . "

Enlarge Sam Forencich / NBAE / Getty Images Raef LaFrentz's Expiring Contract is one of the most desirable assets in the league .
You know who was mentioned in more " Where do you think he 's going ? " scenarios than anyone besides Amare Stoudemire ?
Raef LaFrentz 's Expiring Contract .
That thing got mentioned so many times it could have hired a PR staff and an agent .
Here 's the kicker : Raef can't play .
He 's a basketball invalid .
He has been injured since something like 1973 .
Portland 's insurance company repays the Blazers 80 percent of his salary , making him a cap figure and little else .
In the No Benjamins Association , that makes him a freaking commodity .
Teams wanted to dump clearly superior players on Portland at the deadline just to get Raef 's insurance money .
Phoenix would have traded Shaq for Raef and Channing Frye 's expiring contract in a heartbeat .
Jersey supposedly offered Vince Carter and two protected No. 1 's for Raef 's contract , and Milwaukee supposedly would have given up Richard Jefferson and either Joe Alexander or a future No. 1 for it .
Incredibly , the Blazers turned everyone down .
And this is a team bankrolled by Paul Allen .
And so we finally crossed the imaginary line between " building a good team while being fiscally responsible " and " being fiscally responsible and not giving a crap about anything else . "
( In other words , the rest of the league finally caught up to the Grizzlies , Clippers and Suns. Robert Sarver , who knew ?
We always thought you were heartless , now we know you 're a visionary ! )
Every pre-deadline decision was predicated on fear : fear of the great unknown , fear of a shrinking salary cap ( dropping for the second time ever next year ) and a dwindling luxury tax threshold ( dropping $ 2.5 million next year ) , fear of a landscape where middle - class Americans might collectively decide , " I no longer want to buy tickets for sporting events . "
Sacramento gift - wrapped the two prizes ( Brad Miller and John Salmons ) in a seven - player deal just to clear money .
The Lakers dumped their best 3 - point bomber ( Vlad Radmanovic ) to clear cap space down the road ( and they 're only trying to win a title ) .
Cleveland passed up Shaq for free ( or in this case , Wally Szczerbiak 's expiring deal plus Sasha Pavlovic ) because it could n't take on cash .
New Orleans tried to give away Tyson Chandler ( only its third - best player ) for expiring contracts before The Team That Shall Not Be Named vetoed the trade because it " did n't like his physical " ( or , as many insiders believe , because co-owner Aubrey McClendon had second thoughts about taking on Chandler 's contract since McClendon reportedly lost close to $ 2 billion in the Wall Street crash ) .

In past years , teams would 've lined up to deal for Amare Stoudemire .
The most important trade for playoff purposes ?
A seemingly minor three - teamer between Houston ( landed Brian Cook and Kyle Lowry ) , Orlando ( landed Rafer Alston ) and Memphis ( landed a 2009 first - rounder from Orlando ) .
It happened because Memphis is hemorrhaging money and supposedly saved $ 2 million , even if it meant turning Lowry ( who had been outplaying 2008 lottery pick Mike Conley for two solid seasons ) into a meaningless pick in one of the worst drafts ever .
I 'd say the Grizzlies hurled a flaming bag of dog feces at their fans , but they do n't have any fans .
Still , that trade ( as well as the canceled Chandler deal , New Orleans ' way of turning the Turd Sandwich into its team 's official mascot ) reminded me of the shady stuff that happened in the late ' 70s and early ' 80s , when the league struggled to find a foothold , franchises hopped around , and every trade happened because of money or because a team wanted to nefariously dump a starter who was snorting enough cocaine to kill a police horse .
How did we get here ?
The economy turned in August , well after deposits had been sent in for season tickets , courtside seats and luxury suites .
The league would love for you to believe that attendance has n't been affected , but the NBA 's official tally counts only total " customers , " counted as paid tickets , comps ( seats given to celebrities , sponsors , friends of the team or whomever , a number that can be fudged any way you want ) , discounted tickets and no -shows .
The numbers do n't reflect any falloffs with parking money , concessions , merchandise and restaurant / bar revenue around arenas .
( For instance , at least half the concession stands have been closed for every Clippers home game this season -- except when the Lakers or Celtics were the opponents . )
They definitely do n't reflect aggressive giveaways like Chicago 's recent buy - one - get - one - free promotion or Memphis ' Pepsi Family Plan Pack ( four tickets , four Pepsis and four hot dogs for $ 48 ) .
When you hear the Grizzlies are averaging 12,600 a game , that 's like Amazon.com bragging , " We sold 12,600 books this week " and glossing over the fact that 65 percent of them were bargain books for $ 3.99 or less .
( Amazing but true fact confirmed to me by multiple people : Memphis makes about $ 300,000 per home game .
That 's gross , not net .
Even more amazing , four or five other teams are within $ 100,000 of that number . )
So , yeah , attendance is " up " 1.9 percent , as this recent Sports Business Daily story would lead you to believe .
But not really .
Especially when you include Seattle 's move to a sold - out arena in Hijack City and how it skewed the overall numbers .
Here 's a little game to play during your next NBA outing : Look around for how many suites are dark .
( You 'll notice them specifically in the corners or behind the baskets . )
A dark suite means either that nobody bought it or that somebody did buy it for the season , then made the decision , " Screw it , let 's save the $ 1,200 [ or whatever the number is ] on food and drink and not give tonight 's suite tickets to anyone . "
( Note : Only a handful of NBA teams control the concessions in their arenas . )
That makes the less desirable suites somewhat of a sunk cost -- those companies can't get the money back for the season , but at the very least , they wo n't lose more money on that purchase .
What will happen next season ?
They just wo n't buy the suite .
GET PROMOTED
When I write that NBA teams are unleashing aggressive promotions on their fans to boost attendance numbers , I 'm not exaggerating .
My favorites from this season :
Snowbird Ticket Exchange ( Nets ) : New Jersey season - ticket holders can swap their tickets for a pair of tickets for the NHL's Panthers if they 're ever in Florida , and vice versa .
No , really .
College Night ( Wizards ) : Every Wednesday , upper deck tickets cost $ 10 to anyone with a college ID .
Come and puke in the upper deck !
International Night ( Grizzlies ) :
Heavy discounts for any game involving a visiting foreign player which is every game , but whatever .
Pizza Pack Deal ( Pacers ) : A pair of balcony tickets for 10 games for $ 60 ( plus one free medium pizza from Donatos ) , or two club seats for $ 500 ( yes , you still get the pizza ) .
Guys ' Night Out ( Kings ) : For $ 55 a person , you get a $ 40 ticket , a Kings combo meal and a chance to meet Kings cheerleaders before the game !
Lap dances not included .
Bojangles Friday Feast ( Bobcats ) :
All you can eat in the upper bowl ( chicken , hot dogs , soft drinks , popcorn ) for just $ 35 .
Or , as it's also called , the Joe House Special .
Eat Cheese Curds Until You Throw Up ( Bucks ) : OK , I made this one up .
But they do have a " Guys Night Out " where you get two $ 37 seats , two beer / wine vouchers , two Bucks pilsner glasses and Courtside Club postgame passes ( $ 5 wings ! ) .
Yet another reason to move to Milwaukee .
By the way , please do not hurl your pilsner glasses at Dan Gadzuric .
Again , do n't trust those attendance numbers .
Walk - up sales and short - term packages ( 12 - game packs , eight - game packs and the like ) have n't gone into a free fall only because of steep discounts , and the drop - off for the Big Attendance Three ( premium season tickets , suites and courtsides ) wo n't be felt until next season .
Well , unless you 're talking about the Clippers -- the franchise with the worst luck in sports history -- who picked the 2008 - 09 season , of all years , to offer a " You can change your mind on season tickets up until Opening Night and we 'll give you your money back " guarantee .
In a related story , they 're getting hammered this season .
I 'd give you the actual drop in revenue net , but the NBA guards that stuff as tightly as the Secret Service guards Obama .
As far as we " know , " the 2009 Clippers are " averaging " nearly 16,000 paying fans per game .
That 's about as realistic as Mike Dunleavy claiming he spends $ 100,000 a year on his wardrobe .
( Sorry , he never claimed that .
I just felt like making fun of his wardrobe .
The fans in my section at Staples Center finally figured out how Dunleavy dresses for games : like someone who owns a funeral home .
No , really , he wears ugly gray suits or light blue suits ; they always look as if he bought them at a two - for - one sale ; and he always looks like he 's going to tell you how sorry he is that your aunt passed away .
He even slicks his hair back like an extra on " Six Feet Under . "
In a way , it 's the perfect look for this season .
He 's the undertaker .
In fact , that 's what I hope Clippers fans start calling him : The Undertaker .
It 's perfect . )
Look around during Clippers games , and you can see clouds everywhere .
Half the arena is empty most nights , unless they 're playing a team with transplant fans in Southern California -- such as when the Staples Center was half - filled with Celtics fans Wednesday -- and there are consistently 12 - 15 empty courtside seats for every game .
And it 's not just the Clips .
When Boston played in Denver on Monday , the place brimmed with so many Celtics fans that Carmelo Anthony angrily stormed off before Boston 's blowout victory even concluded .
That has been a recurring theme in general : Fans of popular visiting teams ( Boston , New York , Cleveland , the Lakers ) overpowering home arenas of unpopular teams .
Flick around on any busy NBA night , and you 'll see a staggering number of empty seats between the baskets in the first 15 rows in Miami , Memphis , New Jersey , Charlotte , Indiana .
I mean , we 're a few weeks away from the NBA adopting Vegas ' current policy of closing off as much of the blackjack area as possible so the open tables seem crowded .
Section 321 , come on down , we need you courtside !
And TV cameras , please , do n't show any wide - angle shots of the north end of the stadium !
The NBA is turning into the WNBA .
Just a little .
Yet declining attendance is n't even one of the league 's four biggest problems right now .
I would rank the top four like this :
1 . The 2011 Lockout That Has n't Happened Yet
Oh , but it 's coming .
Fading power broker David Falk was the first to play it up publicly ; hoping to stir interest in his new book , he happily played the doomsday card in a New York Times feature Sunday .
( Sadly , none of the chapters in Falk 's book is called , " How I Convinced Elton Brand To Stab The Clippers In The Back And Sign With Philly So People Would Think That I 'm Not Washed Up As A Super - Agent , Even Though I Am . " )
But you know what ?
That conniving has - been nailed it when he called the NBA 's current system " broken . "
The revenue - sharing system dictates specific thresholds for the cap and tax , which is fine as long as revenue does n't drop dramatically with teams already tied into unsavory player contracts through 2010 , 2011 or , in Philly 's case with Brand , 2075 ( or maybe it just feels that way to Sixers fans ) .
Think of the arrangement like this :
Let 's say my deal with ESPN.com were tied directly to revenue pulled in by the Web site .
Let 's say ESPN paid me $ 5 million a year for each of the past four years , and I felt pretty good about staying there with that number .
Let 's say I hired 10 interns and locked them into deals for $ 100,000 apiece through 2012 ( thinking I could easily make those payments because the total each year was only one - fifth of my salary ) .
Then , let 's say ESPN told me this coming December , " We got crushed by the economy and our revenue is way down , so your 2010 salary will be $ 950,000 . "
Well , what do I do ?
I already owe more money than I 'm making just in 2010 .
Because I mistakenly projected what salary numbers I THOUGHT I COULD PAY and never anticipated my revenue would drop that dramatically , basically , I 'm screwed .
( Hold on , three exclamation points coming . )
Welcome to the NBA 's world !!!
Teams are locked into swollen contracts that suddenly make no sense , whether it 's non-franchise players making franchise money ( Vince , T - Mac , Shaq , Brand , Baron , Jermaine O'Neal , Dalembert , Okafor , etc. ) or overpaid role players making six to 600 times what they should be making ( Marko Jaric , Nazr Mohammed , Larry Hughes , Radmanovic , Mo Peterson , etc. ) .
In the irony of ironies , the league finally learned something that fans knew all along -- nobody was buying a ticket to see the likes of Luol Deng , Gerald Wallace or Corey Maggette , much less Tim Thomas or Andres Nocioni .
With the cap / tax thresholds slipping , teams can't dodge them by dumping overpaid mistakes like when Phoenix bribed Seattle to take Kurt Thomas ' contract and two No. 1 picks last year .
Someone
In The Know told me that 20 of the 30 NBA teams will lose money this season and we have n't even come close to hitting rock bottom yet .
Just wait until next season .
Which brings us to the Lockout That Has n't Happened Yet .
Unless the players ' association agrees to major concessions by the summer of 2011 -- highly doubtful because that would involve applying common sense -- the owners will happily lock out players as soon as the current CBA expires , then play the same devious waiting game from the summer of 1998 .
David Stern will grow another scruffy beard .
The owners will plant their feet in the sand , grab the tug - of - war rope and dig in .
Only this time , they KNOW they will win .
See , we learned a dirty little secret in the last lockout :
An inordinate number of NBA players live paycheck to paycheck .
Yes , even the guys making eight figures a year .
You can play high - stakes poker with them and you will win .
[+]
Enlarge Ned Dishman / Getty Images David Stern and the owners might settle in for a long lockout in 2011 .
Quick tangent :
You 're asking yourself , " Wait , how can a dude making $ 8 - 10 million a year live paycheck to paycheck ? "
Easy .
First , he 's only banking 40 percent once the IRS and agents are done with him .
Second , he 's probably overpaying for multiple houses and luxury cars just to keep up with everyone else .
Third , he 's buying expensive clothes and dinners , chartering planes , buying expensive TVs , going to casinos , and paying for friends and family at every turn .
Fourth , there 's a decent chance he 's supporting a bunch of people back home -- family and extended family -- and not just that , but he might have gotten roped into funding at least one dumb " investment " by a loser family member .
( " Uncle Lenny , I thought you told me this nightclub could n't miss ? " )
Fifth , he is , um , " dating " frequently -- even if he 's married -- and if you " date " frequently , mistakes might happen that lead to hospital bills and child support payments .
( If you catch my drift . )
And sixth , he 's not adding these numbers up in his head because he 's thinking , " I do n't need to worry about money , I 'm making $ 10 mil a year ! "
I know it sounds farfetched , but I 've heard the Inexplicable Tale Of Financial Woe with NBA stars too many times to count and that does n't include stars such as Scottie Pippen who were screwed by their financial advisers .
It 's a long and inglorious list , and if you do n't think we 're headed for 15 " Real Sports " segments in the next decade with Bernie Goldberg catching up with Broke Former NBA Superstar X , you 're kidding yourself .
Remember the lessons of the ' 99 lockout -- the players HAD to come back .
And it was n't because they missed playing .
Team Stern and the owners know this better than anyone .
They will pick the next fight , and again , they will win .
When the players ' union waves a white flag and the lockout finally ends ( 2012 ? 2013 ? ) , I predict a raise of the individual salary max ( to $ 24 - 25 million ) , a softer salary cap , a restriction on long - term contracts ( ca n't be more than three years unless you 're re-signing your own star ) , the elimination of opt - out clauses and the midlevel exemption , and the rookie age limit rising to 20 .
That 's seven predictions in all and I bet I 'll end up nailing six .
Will the league survive a yearlong disappearance ?
What about two years ?
We 're less than 29 months from starting to find out .
If you think it 's a good idea to disappear for even six months in shaky economic times , ask any Writers Guild member how that turns out .
These wealthy or used - to - be - wealthy owners do n't want to keep losing money just to feed their ego by continuing to own a basketball team .
They will make other arrangements , the same way they would arrange to sell their favorite yacht because they did n't feel like splurging on gasoline anymore .
These guys do n't want to fix the system ; they want to reinvent it .
( And by the way , nobody loves basketball more than me .
I mean , NOBODY .
But when an NBA player with two years remaining on his contract for a total of $ 44 million shows up for the season out of shape , complains most of the year , lets down his teammates and fans again and again , lands in some trade rumors and decides , " Instead of getting traded to a team I do n't like , I 'm going to announce that I 'm getting microfracture surgery four days before the trade deadline and kill any potential trade , and even better , I 'll be healed by next spring , just in time to showcase myself for another contract , " and successfully pulls this off -- with no repercussions from anybody -- then yes , the system is broken and needs to be fixed .
Because that was disgusting .
Tracy McGrady , you are officially indefensible for the rest of eternity .
Even your cousin Vince would n't have done that .
And that 's saying something . )
2 . The fear of trading ultimately hurting the quality of the league
Actually , I should n't say that ; it depends on what you like .
If you 're into sloppier basketball with the caveat that more contenders now have a chance to make the conference finals ( kind of like what has happened to the NFL in the past few years ) , you might enjoy the " Anything might happen ! " aspect of this spring 's playoffs .
If you enjoy watching basketball played at its highest possible level , if you enjoy results that make a slight bit of sense and if you enjoy comparing current great teams to past ones you probably wo n't enjoy the next three postseasons .
Even though my perfectly coiffed colleague Ric Bucher already tackled this topic , allow me to pile on :
Once upon a time , contenders added one in - season piece to push them over the top ( think Mychal Thompson , Brian Williams , Clyde Drexler , Pau Gasol , Rasheed Wallace , Jason Kidd , etc. ) .
This season ?
It swung the opposite way .
Detroit got a jump start with its shrewd Iverson - Billups trade , an unapologetic salary dump that conned a surprising number of fans and media members into thinking that ( A ) the Pistons did it to " shake things up , " and ( B ) it might work .
( Important note : Joe Dumars could trade a 2009 Maybach for a 2005 Prius and $ 25,000 and the media 's reaction would be , " What a guy , he loves the environment !
It 's a shame everyone does n't think that way ! " )
Every other contender except Orlando had a fixable flaw , thought about fixing it , then said , " Nahhhhh maybe we can win anyway . "
Boston never replaced James Posey .
Cleveland never landed a quality shooter with size .
The Lakers never found Andrew Bynum insurance .
Portland seems content to be just a Promising Young Team With a Huge Internet Following for the next 12 years .
Utah , San Antonio and Dallas stood pat with expiring contracts to move .
And the Hornets nearly committed franchise suicide with a Chandler trade that seemed curious considering they have attendance triggers tied to their current lease .
( Note : Any conspiracy theorist -- here I am ! -- could argue the Hornets intentionally antagonized their fans in a last - ditch attempt to shed the lease .
They need to average about 15,000 fans to activate the lease through 2014 , and they 're a few hundred over this season but that number would have dropped after the Chandler trade , right ?
Would you put a ploy that devious past the likes of George Shinn ?
Me neither . )
Even Amare 's brief appearance on the bargain rack had an unprecedented conclusion .
Here was the perfect storm for a panic trade -- the Suns struggling with a bad coaching hire , their fans turning on an unhappy Amare , the franchise basically announcing , " We 're going broke , we will take 60 cents on the dollar for our best player " -- and nobody took advantage .
In three - plus decades of following the league , I can't remember a fire sale for a player of Amare 's caliber being greeted with such dramatic disinterest .
This guy will average a 29 - 9 if you run with him and he 's happy .
Any takers ?
Any ?
Nope .
That 's the NBA in 2009 -- you 're better off with LaFrentz 's basketball corpse than a four - time All - Star .
3. Lousy officiating
This has nothing to do with the economy , obviously .
But what the hell ?
Seriously , what the hell ?
HOW COULD THE REFEREES BE THIS CONSISTENTLY BAD ???
THEY ARE KILLING THE PRODUCT !
THEY ARE KILLING IT !!!!
I CAN'T STOP USING CAPS !!!!
How are we enabling such staggering incompetence on a day - to - day basis ?
A great example : I knew we were in trouble before Wednesday 's Clips - Celts game when I saw Bennett Salvatore , Courtney Kirkland and Leroy Richardson , or as they 're more commonly known , " The Three Stooges . "
I told my wife , " These guys will find a way to decide this game , you watch . "
She did n't care ; she was more interested in devouring the bag of Sour Patch Kids we had just purchased .
But sure enough , with the Celts somehow leading by just one ( they were awful all night ) and only 35 seconds to play , Rajon Rondo missed a free throw that ricocheted to Mardy Collins , only Big Baby Davis somehow swiped the ball away as Richardson 's whistle blew .
The Boston bench exploded , thinking it was an undeserved foul , only Richardson had blown his whistle for a Clippers timeout .
One problem : Collins never had the ball .
He fumbled the easy rebound to Davis even as the Clippers were signalling for time .
Richardson granted the timeout because he 's inept at his job and did n't make sure Collins , you know , actually secured the rebound .
Did you know you can call timeouts when you do n't have the basketball ?
Me neither .
As a kicker , the Clips scored the winning basket on their free possession .
These screw - ups seem to happen four times a week .
The league claims to care and made a big stink about hiring Ronald Johnson this past summer to clean things up .
Nope .
It 's still a mess .
Three weeks ago , the Lakers and Celtics played the highest - rated regular - season cable game in 13 seasons .
Guess which crew the NBA assigned to that beauty ?
That 's right , Leon Wood , Monty McCutchen and Jim Capers Jr. ( only because Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne were unavailable ) .
So TNT 's record audience was treated to a comically choppy slopfest in which Boston 's best player ( Kevin Garnett ) fouled out on a touch foul 35 feet from the basket with five minutes to play .
The NBA : Where Amazingly Bad Officiating Happens .
When will someone take responsibility and admit that something is seriously , drastically , undeniably wrong ?
Why ca n't Stern announce in June , " Our best three referees right now are Steve Javie , Mark Wunderlich and Joey Crawford , and we want the best championship series possible , so those guys will be handling every 2009 Finals game because we care about the quality of our sport ? "
For a league that claimed to take the Donaghy scandal so seriously , we have n't seen any inclination that it did .
Not even a hint .
Not a whiff .
It makes me want to commit a flagrant foul 2 on myself .
But I digress .
4 . The dawning of NBA Franchise Hot Potato .
Ohhhhhhhh , it 's coming .
I became obsessed with this topic over All - Star Weekend and solicited input from as many people in the know as I could .
Franchise Hot Potato hinges on five factors in all , although only three need to be in play .
You need a team with a dwindling fan base and / or bailing sponsors and suite / courtside customers .
( I count 11 : Indiana , Memphis , Milwaukee , Sacramento , New Jersey , New Orleans , Miami , Orlando , Minnesota , Charlotte and Philly . )
You need a team trapped in an aging stadium that can't drum up local money for a new one .
( I count three : Sacramento , Jersey and Milwaukee . )
You need an owner who purchased his team because he was worth a ton of money ON PAPER only now , he 's worth significantly less and might even be worth $ 10 for all we know .
( Consensus candidates for this list : Phoenix , Hijack City , Jersey , Memphis , Indiana , Atlanta , Milwaukee , Charlotte and , surprisingly , Sacramento and Cleveland . )
You need cities with NBA - ready , modern arenas either finished or about to be finished that would love nothing more than stealing a team .
( Definitely Kansas City , Anaheim , San Jose , Louisville , Tulsa and Pittsburgh ; possibly Columbus , St. Louis ; and just for fun , let 's throw in Montreal and London . )
And you need a struggling team that can actually extricate itself from its lease .
The last " need " is easier said than done , as the Grizzlies would tell you -- owner Michael Heisley would leave treadmarks fleeing Memphis if he were n't tied to FedEx Forum through 2015 .
Then again , Hijack City owners McClendon and Clay Bennett showed us a nice blueprint for weaseling out of a lease in Seattle last year , a strategy best described as , " make up selfish reasons to leave , make your move , leave a trail of broken hearts , bastardize the integrity of the league , then make everything OK by just paying everyone off because the city will be greedy enough to accept a cash settlement right away over fighting you in court for the next six years . "
Thank you , fellas .
You guys will be remembered as the Lewis and Clark of Scumbag NBA Owners .
Looking at the next 15 months only , the consensus of people in the know was that multiple NBA franchises ( guesses ranged from three to eight ) will move cities , get sold to new owners or throw themselves on the mercy of the league ( meaning the NBA would effectively take over operations of that franchise , kinda like what happens in the MLS or WNBA ) .
Nobody believes the league will contract or merge two franchises , simply because Stern is stubborn that way ; that would be an undeniable sign of weakness in his eyes .
( If you do n't believe me , I have five words for you : Season 13 of the WNBA . )
On the other hand , he 's the one who opened the door for 21st - century franchise relocation with his callous handling of Seattle 's situation .
The other 29 NBA cities learned an ominous lesson from SonicsGate :
If you do n't heed every arena - related wish of your team , no matter how insane or unrealistic those wishes are , then it might move and the commissioner 's office will not protect you .
As long as we have cities like K.C. and Anaheim waiting with open arms , teams will keep moving .
And they will .
( Important Note No. 2 : I already planted this seed to my friend Jason Whitlock , but it 's worth mentioning again I am fine with the Kings moving back to Kansas City because Sacramento stole them in the first place .
It 's like if I left the Sports Gal for Megan Fox , stayed with her for 15 years , then the Sports Gal stole me back and we spent the rest of our lives together .
You could n't blame the Sports Gal for this , right ?
Hold on lemme enjoy this scenario for a few more seconds hold on hold on OK .
Also , I like the thought of Pittsburgh landing the Nets or Grizzlies for some reason .
Did you know Pittsburgh 's team in the ABL ( circa 1962 ) was named " The Pittsburgh Rens " after Pittsburgh 's annual renaissance festival ?
You 're not gonna believe this , but they went under .
Then their next team was called the Pittsburgh Pipers ( ABA , late - '60s ) and they went under .
Regardless of what you think about Pittsburgh as an NBA city , at least admit it can come up with phenomenally dumb nicknames .
Keep your fingers crossed for the Nets to become the Pittsburgh Ironmen ( What ?
They already tried that one ? ) or the Pittsburgh Coal . )
So that 's the climate for the No Benjamins Association right now : Murky , unpredictable and not so lucrative .
And you wonder why I did n't want to write about All - Star Weekend .
Looking at the big picture , the league wo n't struggle even 1/10th as much as the NHL in years to come -- of all the wildest predictions I heard in Phoenix , the craziest came from a connected executive who predicted that fifteen NHL teams would go under within the next two years ( and was dead serious ) -- and Major League Baseball is about to get creamed beyond belief .
Other than the NFL , the NBA will emerge from this financial quagmire in the best shape of any professional sport ; not just because its billion - dollar deals with Disney and Turner ( inked fortuitously in the summer of 2007 ) run through the 2015 - 16 season but because the Lockout That Has n't Happened
Yet will ultimately solve every major league issue except its stupefyingly dreadful officiating .
One last thought :
For most of the decade , Stern and his team kept thinking , " We 're going global , we 're going global " and never anticipated their American foundation could crumble .
But it might -- at least to some degree -- and even if the league ultimately lands in a more econonically feasible place , we might see some things in the next three or four years that we never imagined .
You know , just like we 're seeing with every other business in this country .
Maybe the NBA really is America 's game .

Yes , The Pirate Bay 's backers are on trial in a Swedish court and might face two years in a clean , cold Nordic jail cell ( perhaps right next to this guy ) , but that has n't stopped them from writing a book .
The book , naturally released on The Pirate Bay , is called MAckt , Broccoli , och Kopimi , and though it 's written in Swedish , you do n't need to read the language to see that this is not Serious Literature .
It is , however , apparently designed to make a point about The Pirate Bay 's method — if that 's even a word that can be used in this context — of organization .
" This book is a spontaneously organised cluster swarm project with a single purpose — Kopimi will intensify , multiply , condensate , " says the introduction , according to an early English translation .
" We want to reach further into ourselfs and into Kopimi .
We want to penetrate into you and into the future . "
( I can't speak for " the future , " but I personally have no desire to be " penetrated into " by the authors .
One hopes this is merely an unfortunate translation . )
The book goes on to offer " 100 simple instructions on how to achieve impossible things . "
For instance :
071 .
Found and own a think - tank .
072 . Deny magnetism .
073 .
Found a business school .
Drop out .
074 .
Write many press releases .
075 .
Use irc in underwear , and eat pizza .
076 .
Juggle with other people ’s balls .
Point 100 , of course , is " PROFIT . "
The book is a celebration of " kopimi " ( " copy me " ) , the basic philosophy of The Pirate Bay .
" According to Kopimi , " begins the book , " all truths can be summarized in a single sentence : ' the Internet is right . ' "
But back in the Swedish courtroom where the trial is taking place , prosecutor Hakan Roswall and a pair of music and movie industry lawyers continued their attempt today to show that the The Pirate Bay 's sophomoric philosophizing about " kopimi " was really just a way to pocket some cash and watch Hollywood blockbusters without paying a dime ( or a krona ) .
The day opened with the charges against the four defendants being altered again ( half of them were dropped on the trial 's second day in order to " streamline " the case ) .
Today 's changes were relatively minor , but did include the deletion of the sentence , " All components are necessary for users of the service are able to share files with one another . "
Prosecutors today called two of their own investigators as witnesses , though the results were less than spectacular .
First up was Magnus M�rtensson , an IFPI music industry lawyer and antipiracy investigator who trolled through The Pirate Bay and downloaded a host of copyrighted works .
But M�rtensson admitted he was not a tech expert , and although his testimony seemed designed to make the case that The Pirate Bay 's tracker was used in all his downloads , he had no actual evidence of this .
Defendant and BitTorrent expert Gottfrid Warg pressed M�rtensson on this point .
" I think I ’ve said this three times , that I just assumed it , " was the eventual response .
Defense attorneys also pressed him on whether he had downloaded illegal content from the site itself ; the answer , of course , was that it was his BitTorrent client — connecting directly to other peers — that had downloaded the files .
Next up was antipiracy investigator Anders Nilsson , who appeared to know his tech .
Rather than relying on mere screenshots , Nilsson logged all network activity as he performed BitTorrent transfers and went back through the logs to verify that he had used The Pirate Bay 's own tracker for the downloads .
Nilsson went on to note that 93 of the top 100 most - traded files appeared to be copyrighted .
On this point , he was pressed by defense lawyers , who asked him if he looked at anything on the site beyond this list .
Nilsson said that he had " clicked around " but had done no systematic investigation .
He was eventually asked whether he could " present us a document showing that the majority of files are pirated , " and had to answer " no . "
Court recessed early today , but tomorrow promises to be interesting as the head of music 's global trade group IFPI takes the stand and testifies in English .
But today 's brief hearing left the pirates feeling buoyant ; Swedish Pirate Party head Rick Falvinge , who has been covering the trial , summed it up with a one - word tweet : " PWNAGE . "

Sanam Navsarka died in May 2008 after a long period of suffering
The mother of a two - year - old girl who suffered more than 100 injuries watched and did nothing as her daughter died in severe pain , a court heard .
Zahbeena Navsarka , of Riddings Road , Huddersfield , West Yorkshire , is charged with her partner Subhan Anmwar of murdering Sanam Navsarka last May .
The girl died with fractures to all her limbs , Bradford Crown Court heard .
The couple , both 21 , are accused of repeatedly assaulting Sanam over a month - long period .
They deny murder .
Continuing the prosecution 's opening of the case , Julian Goose QC said : " Sanam died as a result of really serious injuries , deliberately inflicted upon her , over a period of up to four weeks before her death .
Tiny handprints
" The defendants either inflicted that violence upon her together or one encouraged the other , standing by and doing nothing over all those weeks whilst she was being repeatedly assaulted and severely injured . "
They had watched her " deteriorate ... from a normal , happy child to one in severe pain , unable to walk and suffering regular fits " , Mr Goose added .
The jury was told the defendants left Sanam alone and dying in their home while they went to register with their GP .
The court also heard how tiny handprints and bloodstains were found inside cupboards at the home in Huddersfield and also at a property on Howley Walk in Batley , West Yorkshire , where they had lived .
Mr Anwar , who is not Sanam 's father , admitted to police he put the girl in the cupboard to punish her and said Miss Navsarka did the same thing , the court heard .
Drowning claim
When the couple were interviewed by police , they blamed each other for the injuries Sanam suffered , Mr Goose said .
The court has been told Sanam had 107 separate external injuries when she died .
The couple claimed Sanam died when they left her alone in the bath for 10 minutes and returned to find her under the water .
But a pathologist who conducted a post - mortem examination on Sanam ruled out drowning as a cause of death .
Mr Anwar also denies a charge of causing or allowing the death of a child .
Miss Navsarka has admitted an alternative charge of failing to protect Sanam .
The trial continues .

My friend spends over $ 21,000 / year going out .
Most people 's reaction to that : “ OH MY GOD , THAT'S SO MUCH *#%(#%(# %! ”
But let 's break it down .
And see , is it really extreme ?
Let 's say you go out 4x / week – to dinners and bars – and spend an average of $ 100 / night .
I 'm being conservative with the numbers here , since a dinner can run $ 60 / person and drinks could be $ 12 each .
I 'm not including bottle service , which might cost $ 800 or $ 1,000 .
( He lives in a big city . )
That 's easily $ 400 / week .
Now , this guy also makes a healthy six - figure salary , and he 's invested quite a bit in his 401 ( k ) and outside investments ( including real estate ) .
The key here is that he works such long hours that he 's only really free Friday and Saturday nights .
And so he goes out .
Hard .
In just a couple of years , this guy has saved more than almost any of my friends .
But he 's also spent more on going out than anybody I know .
And although $ 21,000 sounds outrageous on the surface , you have to take context into consideration .
For example , look at his spending by percentage : Just for easy calculations , if we assume that this guy makes $ 210,000 / year net , his going - out budget is roughly 10 % of his income .
For my friends who make $ 35,000 / year , you can be damn sure that they 're spending more than $ 3,500 / year ( $ 67 / week ) on going out .
But my other friend has a plan and he 's decided to spend his money this way .
The Large Hadron Collider will begin blasting apart atoms starting in October , scientists at CERN confirmed today .
The much - ballyhooed " most complex machine in the world " will officially restart in September , going through a series of tests , before it progresses to actual science experiments that could ( all together now ) provide new understanding about the nature of dark matter and the first few moments after the Big Bang .
That is , if it does n't break like it did last September , mere days after it started up and a week before the first collisions were scheduled to take place .
Last time around , a helium leak seriously damaged part of the tunnel track on which beams are accelerated .
Psyched physicists , who 've been waiting for a generation to test the sprawling ideas of theoretical physics , were forced to postpone their experiments for yet another year .
Now , they 've got a date to repin their hopes on .
" The schedule we have now is without a doubt the best for the LHC and for the physicists waiting for data , ” said CERN Director General Rolf
Heuer .
“ It is cautious , ensuring that all the necessary work is done on the LHC before we start - up , yet it allows physics research to begin this year . ”

Winnie - 2006
Microsoft Windows Pony
Designed by Angelika
Custom by Aikarin
Winnie is a very unique pony .
Her designer is a pony fan who actually works for Microsoft !
^_^
She asked her company for permission to have this pony created for her personal use .
Winnie is made from a 1st generation pony .
The gentle light blue base color is natural .
[ click on picture for enlarged view - warning - huge file ! ]
Winnie was re-rooted in four different colors of nylon hair : blue , bright green , orange - red blend , and golden yellow .
Since the base pony had an extra " stripe " in addition to the two rows of her mane , she 's got a little extra reddish - orange stripe .
It 's hidden under her mane .
^_^
Her tail features the same four colors .
I love how her bold colors came together !
Her symbols are based on the famous flag logo seen on Microsoft Windows software products .
The non -display side image was not reversed .
The symbols were very carefully painted by hand and sealed with a matte sealant .
[ box pic respectfully removed due to legal concerns about MLP logo ]
Here is Winnie in her box with a custom printed front panel .
The box is from a special G3 pony that came with a DVD .
The brush is a G1 shooting star brush .
Winnie is a bit too large to fit comfortably in a regular G3 box !
Some Work - In - Progress pictures :
Here , we were deciding on which color of green to use for her hair .
Her designer originally selected Lucky Clover .
However , Key Lime seemed to match her eyes and symbols closer .
These pics show how I wired Winnie to her box .
First , I wrapped some plastic - covered wire around her feet .
They were anchored to a heavy piece of clear plastic .
Then , I taped this to the bottom of the box .
I hope she makes it through the shipping !
And here is a Photoshop rendering of the pony 's design , before we got started on the project .
^_^
This is another version of the pony that we considered .
This one has a newer version of the Windows logo .
Her designer decided to leave out the hoof mark .
Winnie will be heading to her new home in Washington state .
She is signed and dated under one hoof .
She is an original design and she will NOT be repeated .
This pony is NOT FOR SALE .

Google has given its
Web search engine an injection of semantic technology , as the search leader pushes into what many consider the future of search on the Internet .
The new technology will allow Google 's search engine to identify associations and concepts related to a query , improving the list of related search terms
Google displays along with its results , the company announced in an official blog on Tuesday .
" For example , if you search for ' principles of physics ' , our algorithms understand that ' angular momentum , ' ' special relativity , ' ' big bang ' and ' quantum mechanic ' are related terms that could help you find what you need , " wrote Ori Allon , technical lead of Google 's Search Quality team , and Ken Wilder , team engineer at the company 's Snippets project .
Revamping Search
Google has often been criticized for using what is considered an aging approach to solving search queries based primarily on analyzing keywords and not on understanding their meaning .
Google executives over the years have acknowledged that semantic search technology will be an important component of search engines in the future .
" Right now , Google is really good with keywords and that 's a limitation we think the search engine should be able to overcome with time , " Google Vice President of Search Products & User Experience Marissa Mayer said in an interview with IDG News Service in October 2007 .
" People should be able to ask questions and we should understand their meaning , or they should be able to talk about things at a conceptual level .
We see a lot of concept - based questions -- not about what words will appear on the page but more like ' what is this about ? ' .
A lot of people will turn to things like the semantic Web as a possible answer to that . "
She cautioned , however , that Google sees semantic search technology as part of the algorithmic mix , not as a replacement to its traditional keyword - analysis approach .
" What we 're seeing actually is that with a lot of data , you ultimately see things that seem intelligent even though they 're done through brute force , " she said .
" Because we 're processing so much data , we have a lot of context around things like acronyms .
Suddenly , the search engine seems smart , like it achieved that semantic understanding , but it has n't really .
It has to do with brute force .
That said , I think the best algorithm for search is a mix of both brute - force computation and sheer comprehensiveness and also the qualitative human component . "
In January of this year , during Google 's fourth - quarter earnings conference call , CEO Eric Schmidt touched briefly on this topic , hinting that the company is getting more serious about semantic search technology .
" Would n't it be nice if Google understood the meaning of your phrase , rather than just the words that are in the phrase ?
We have [ done ] a lot of discoveries in that area that are going to roll out [ soon ] , " Schmidt said .
Field Advances
There is an entire field of Google competitors that are busy developing and perfecting semantic search engines , betting that they will be able to deliver on the promise of this technology : to let users type in queries in natural language and have the search engine understand their meaning and intent .
Microsoft last year acquired Powerset , one of these companies , in order to improve its Web search engine with semantic search technology .
Google also rolled out on Tuesday another enhancement to its search engine : longer " snippets , " which are the text excerpts Google extracts from Web sites to show in search results where the query keywords appear .
Critics have often pointed out that these excerpts are n't very useful in previewing enough context so that users can decide whether to click over to the Web site .
Now , when people enter queries that are three words or longer , Google will deliver longer snippets in order to provide users with a better view as to how their query keywords appear on the Web site .
It remains to be seen if Web site publishers will cry foul over longer snippets .
In the past , publishers have sometimes complained that search engine abstracts that are too long give away too much of their sites ' content .
This in turn , they say , could cause potential visitors to not click over to the page , particularly if the abstract , or snippet , gives them the information they 're looking for .
This is an area where search engines have to strike a delicate balance between fulfilling their mission -- giving their users the most precise information possible related to their query -- and not violating the copyrights of Web site publishers .
Whoops !

If you have an opinion on the expansion of children ’s health insurance , hop on over the White House website , where the SCHIP bill is open for comments .
If Obama ’s campaign promise is followed , commenting will last for five days , at which point the President will sign the bill .
While the move is an admirable nod to openness , it ’s more of a presidential party trick than anything else .
Here ’s why :
(1) Public comments are n’t made public .
The page that I link to above points you to the full text of the SCHIP legislation and has a submission field for a comment , but it does not display previously made comments .
I submitted a comment and it was swallowed up by the White House website , presumably never to be seen again .
When the Obama team was in transition , it hosted a site called “ Seat at the Table ” that enabled everyday citizens to view the policy papers that think tanks and interest groups were submitting to the President - elect .
The site allowed users to comment and read the comments of others .
That model ought to be followed on the White House website now .
If comments could be viewed by everyone , one everyday citizen could identify a problem with the legislation , another could research it further , and a third could suggest a better idea .
People could work together to push for improved law .
And that ’s the point , is n’t it ?
(2) There is no guarantee that administration officials will actually read the comments .
The transition website had a feature called “ Open for Questions ” that allowed users to submit questions to top Obama officials and to vote up or down the questions of others .
Popular questions were answered on a somewhat haphazard schedule ( and never in fully in - depth way ) but at least there was an guarantee that someone was paying attention .
The same can not be said for the five - day commenting period .
(3) The bill has already passed both the House and the Senate .
There is no mechanism in the legislative process to change it now that it is on the president ’s desk .
( Obama could use a presidential signing statement , an old Bush Administration trick .
But Obama and his camp frowned upon the practice during the campaign . )
“ All they can do is veto it , ” says Ellen Miller , Executive Director of the Sunlight Foundation .
Given that Obama is n’t going to veto something like a long - sought children ’s health care bill , one has to wonder if this is little more than a way to generate good PR .
“ It is far more important to have this kind of opportunity for the public to comment during the legislative process , ” says Miller , “ when changes could actually be made . ”
(4) The site demands that users fit their comment inside 500 characters .
The paragraph above is 621 .
“ The notion that there can be quality commenting in 500 characters on a piece of legislation is laughable , ” says Miller .
Miller suspects that the Obama team simply screwed up .
The first bill Obama signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act .
He did so without making the bill available for comment at all , a fact that earned him the scorn of the transparency community and his first broken promise from PolitiFact.com .
That led to the subpar commenting system up now .
Says Miller , “ They realized they goofed last week and they really needed to create this feature immediately , so they did a very simple , very straight - forward feature .
I have every expectation that the ability to comment will become far more meaningful than it is right now . ”
Fostering legitimate public comment on legislation is clearly a difficult challenge .
It does not appear the Obama Administration has the solution just yet .
From the ' counter - intuitive ' files :
Microsoft is suing GPS vendor Tom - Tom over alleged patent violations that might include Linux .
Is this the beginning of the big Linux versus Microsoft patent showdown ?
Microsoft has long asserted that open source somehow infringes on Microsoft 's intellectual property .
My view is this is a great thing for Linux .
Really .
You see to date , Microsoft has never formally engaged in patent litigation on Linux related items .
Yes they have patent covenants with some vendors including Novell , but the true scope of Microsoft 's patent claims has never seen the light of day in a courtroom .
The problem that I see ( that many others have commented on over the years too ) is that Microsoft has never ' shown its hand ' and layed out what it 's grievances are .
Once they do , the open source community could then potenitally re-act with prior art issues to invalidate the patent and / or just re-code the offending application to not infringe on the patent .
By knowing what the issue is , Linux can defend itself against patent claims .
Ignorance of the claim is not bliss and is not a defence .
Additionally , thanks in part to the legacy of SCO , the Linux community has resources and organizations that could mount a formal legal defence if the need should arise .
So far as I see the current Microsoft claim is very specific to just Tom - Tom but prospect for a wider patent battle surely does exist .
Regular Linux users need not be too woried though , the big ' guns ' are ready to defend Tux .
" The Linux Foundation is working closely with our partner the Open
Invention Network , and our members , and is well prepared for any claims
against Linux , " Jim Zemlin Executive Director of the Linux Foundation blogged .
" We have great confidence in the foundation they have
laid .
Unfortunately , claims like these are a by - product of our business
and legal system today .
For now , we are closely watching the situation
and will remain ready to mount a Linux 's defense , should the need arise . "

Circle ' round the Moon
Credit & Copyright : Laurent Laveder ( PixHeaven.net / TWAN )
Explanation :
If your sister - in - law phoned you at 1 am to tell you there was a circle around the Moon , how would you react ?
When it happened to him early last Sunday morning , photographer Laurent Laveder , grabbed his equipment and ran outside !
He was rewarded with the sight of a bright lunar halo shining in his neighborhood skies above Quimper , France .
With a radius of 22 degrees , the beautiful halo is produced by the refraction of moonlight in hexagonal - shaped ice crystals formed in thin , high clouds .
Laveder captured a series of digital images that he used to create this composite fisheye view as well as a remarkable 360 degree VR panorama .
Acupuncture is a widely used alternative therapy Traditional acupuncture is effective at preventing headaches , a scientific review finds - but so is a sham form .
The Cochrane Review reviewed 33 separate trials into acupuncture and its so - called " sham " counterpart .
The latter also involves the insertion of needles - but not into traditional " energy points " .
The scientist leading the review said the results showed that putting needles into particular locations might not be that important .
We certainly do n't call what we do ' sham ' acupuncture , as we believe there is growing evidence for a mechanism behind what we do
Dr Mike Cummins
British Medical Accupuncture Society Acupuncture is still regarded as a " complementary " therapy , but is increasingly being viewed as a potential mainstream treatment for certain conditions , such as chronic pain .
The finding by the Cochrane Collaboration is likely to lead to further calls for it to be made more widely available on the NHS .
The traditional explanation of its effects involves tapping into a network of " meridians " around the body to regulate the flow of an energy called " chi " .
Acupuncture points are located at various positions along these meridians .
However , many modern acupuncture specialists believe that the insertion of needles actually cause subtle changes in the nervous system and brain activity which can be beneficial - and place needles in other parts of the body rather than concentrating solely on traditional acupuncture points .
The Cochrane reviews involved a total of 6,736 patients , who were given acupuncture to prevent either mild to moderate " tension " headaches , or migraine attacks .
Following a course of at least eight weeks , acupuncture patients suffered fewer headaches than those given only painkillers .
' Not a sham ' Acupuncture was also superior to preventative drug treatments in migraine , the reviewers concluded .
However , acupuncture relying on non-traditional needle positions was just as good as the traditional variety in preventing tension headaches , and almost as good in the migraine patients .
Dr Klaus Linde , from the Centre for Complementary Medicine Research at the Technical University of Munich in Germany , said that much of the benefit for both might be due to a " placebo effect " , in which the experience itself of being treated can produce results independently of the effects of the treatment .
He said : " Much of the clinical benefit of acupuncture might be due to non-specific needling effects and powerful placebo effects , meaning that the selection of specific needle points may be less important than many practicioners have traditionally argued . "
Dr Mike Cummings , medical director of the British Medical Acupuncture Society , welcomed the research .
He said that the differences between so - called " true " and " fake " acupuncture remained controversial within the profession .
" I think that , quite literally , many practioners have missed the point in the past .
" We certainly do n't call what we do ' sham ' acupuncture , as we believe there is growing evidence for a mechanism behind what we do .
" However , we still do n't fully understand what is happening when needles are inserted , although these reviews suggest that for certain conditions , it is effective . "

“ Dear Lord , ” said Dorothy Robinson in Metro Philadelphia , “ how we wish we could figure out George Clooney ’s type . ”
The " studly actor " has reportedly gone from dating cocktail waitress and Fear Factor contestant Sara Larson to Fatima Bhutto , a poet and journalist who 's also slain Pakistani Leader Benazir Bhutto ’s niece .
( Watch an interview with Fatima Bhutto here , via YouTube ) Quite a switch , but “ we doubt it ’ll work — she sounds much too smart to move to LA . ”
Which is exactly why Clooney might really be interested , said Celebitchy .
If Bhutto “ ever expressed a desire to be more available to him , Clooney would probably bail . ”
He 's “ an unapologetic bachelor and falling for a lovely accomplished woman who necessarily lives far from him is just another way he ’ll ensure he remains single for the foreseeable future . ”
Do n’t be so sure , said Gawker .
Apparently , Clooney has said that he ’s willing to abandon his bachelor ways if Bhutto wants to get serious with him .
And who could blame him ?
Fatima Bhutto is smart , pretty , politically minded , and principled .
Plus , she comes from money “ so you know she 's not just looking for his . ”
A perfect match .
But given the economy and the raids going on across the country against non-corporate raw milk dairy farmers ,
it would make an exceptionally interesting piece to see those raids put into the context of what is happening to dairy farmers across the country , since raw milk dairy farmers exist within a completely different set of economies involving grass - fed cows and milk sold only locally , avoiding any corporate middleman , export issues , or the drastically rising cost of inputs for corn and soy .
Martin's story is describing only the industrial side and gives a window into the whole mess of globalization of milk .
And while it is not mentioned , one can feel in the background , the impact of Monsanto 's monopoly over grains ,
click here
The story is of glut and large swings in the market and farmers being knocked around in it all .
Meanwhile , at a local level ( the level we say we are most interested in developing and protecting ) , there is growing demand for raw milk
and there is actual safety for the farmer within a local economy ( as well as for the consumer ) , ESPECIALLY during hard times .
Mr. Martin did n't mention of rBGH
which is also Monsanto's legacy to all this glut of milk ( even if they recently sold it ) .
While there is huge resistance against rBGH - milk here with some concerned about its link to breast cancers , prostate cancers , colon cancers .
So , are we exporting diseases to countries which have previously had low levels of breast cancer .
How much is corporate advertising and fast food multinationals responsible for demand for milk and ice cream and cheeses in countries that never depended on dairy to begin with ?
What has this done to health in these countries ?
" The bags of milk powder represent a startling reversal of fortune for the dairy industry , which flourished in recent years in part because of a growing appetite for milk , cheese , ice cream and pizza in places like Mexico , Egypt and Indonesia . " ...
" Much of the increase was caused by increased demand in developing countries , where a growing middle class replaced starch in their diets with protein sources like meat and dairy products .
Some Asian countries had little history of eating dairy products but were introduced to milk and mild cheeses by government nutrition programs or by restaurant chains like McDonald ’s and Pizza Hut . "
Was our government responsible for getting milk introduced into those nutrition programs as part of " free " trade agreements ?
" In China , for instance , per-person dairy consumption nearly doubled in just five years , to 63 pounds in 2007 from 33 pounds in 2002 ( though it remains far below the per-capita consumption in the United States of about 580 pounds ) , according to the U.S. Dairy Export Council .
The growth translates into the need for nearly 40 billion pounds more milk each year , roughly equal to California ’s annual milk production .
" In addition to the increased demand , exports from the American dairy industry benefited from a relatively weak dollar and tight global supplies .
For instance , droughts reduced milk production in New Zealand and Australia , two major dairy exporters , allowing American suppliers to fill the gaps .
" American dairy shipments soared to places like Algeria , Bangladesh , Indonesia and the Philippines .
The biggest market , however , was Mexico , where imports from America increased to $ 853 million in 2007 from $ 258 million in 2003 , according to the Agriculture Department . "
The EU is n't listed .
Is it still the case that the EU wo n't touch our milk products because of rBGH despite Bill Clinton leaning on them heavily to do so ?
Clinton even pushed Codex to set a standard to allow for rBGH .
" By refusing to set a standard today , Codex has recognized that there is no consensus on rbGH safety in the international scientific community , and that national governments should be able to decide whether rbGH should be permitted in their milk supply , " said Jean Halloran , Director of the Consumer Policy Institute at Consumers Union .
" The U.S. has pushed Codex to adopt a standard to ensure the continued export of its dairy products from cows treated with the rbGH drug .
However , U.S. - driven efforts to persuade the international community that rbGH is safe have been blocked twice before at Codex , in 1995 and again in 1997 , primarily by opposition from European governments . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that a Utah city can refuse to put a religious group ’s monument in a public park near a similar Ten Commandments display .
Supreme Court justices listen as President Barack Obama gives his primetime address to a joint session of the Congress on Capitol Hill , February 24 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
The justices unanimously sided with the city of Pleasant Grove , which had said a ruling for the religious group would mean public parks across the country would have to allow privately donated monuments that express different views from those already on display .
The Summun religious group , founded in Salt Lake City in 1975 , sought in 2003 to erect a monument to the tenets of its faith , called the “ Seven Aphorisms , ” in a park where there are other monuments , including a Ten Commandments display .
Pleasant Grove rejected the request , citing its requirement that park displays be related to its history or be donated by groups with longtime community ties , like the Fraternal Order of Eagles that gave the Ten Commandments monument in 1971 .
The religious group sued and argued that it violated the constitutional right to free speech for the city to allow one message on public property while excluding another message .
A U.S. appeals court agreed .
Attorneys for the city argued that the appeals court ’s ruling would require cities and states to remove long - standing monuments or result in public parks nationwide becoming cluttered junkyards of monuments .
The Supreme Court agreed .
In the court ’s opinion , Justice Samuel Alito said the placement of a permanent monument in a public park was not subject to scrutiny under the U.S. Constitution ’s free - speech clause .
“ It is hard to imagine how a public park could be opened up for the installation of permanent monuments by every person or group wishing to engage in that form of expression , ” he wrote .
If governments must maintain viewpoint neutrality in selecting donated monuments , they must prepare for cluttered parks or face pressure to remove long - standing and cherished monuments , Alito said .
‘ LANDMARK DECISION ’
Jay Sekulow , who argued the case for the city , said , “ It ’s a landmark decision that clears the way for government to express its views and its history through the selection of monuments -- including religious monuments and displays . ”
The U.S. Justice Department supported the city , which has about 31,000 residents , most of whom are Mormons .
Department lawyers said a ruling for the religious group could force it to allow private displays at national parks and historic sites .
The Supreme Court last addressed the issue of displays of religious symbols on public property in 2005 when it allowed a Ten Commandments monument on a state Capitol grounds that also has numerous other monuments and statues .
The Rev. Barry Lynn of the group Americans United for Separation of Church and State reacted to Wednesday ’s ruling by saying all permanent religious symbols should be removed from government - owned parks .
Summum is a Latin term meaning the sum of all creation .
Its followers believe Moses received two sets of stone tablets on Mount Sinai -- the Seven Aphorisms and the Ten Commandments .
One of the aphorisms states , “ Summum is mind , thought ; the universe is a mental creation ” while another one states , “ Nothing rests ; everything moves ; everything vibrates . ”

Haskell has some ugly corners - not many , but a few .
One that many people consider exceptionally ugly is the monomorphism restriction .
In this post I 'm going to discuss three related issues - Constant Applicative Forms ( CAFs ) , the monomorphism restriction and defaulting .
But before we start , lets take a simple example .
Haskell already provides thefunction which represents the value of pi , but lets assume it did n't .
Taking a quick look at Wikipedia we can see that one way of computing Pi is the Gregory - Leibniz series .
We can calculate pi as : pi = ( 4/1 ) + ( - 4/3 ) + ( 4/5 ) + ( - 4/7 ) + ( 4/9 ) + ( - 4/11 ) ... So let 's write that as a Haskell program :
Here the constant 1000000 gives the accuracy of our approach , increasing this value will give a higher precision .
As it currently stands , the Haskell library saysand our program says .
Thirteen matching digits should be suffient for most uses of pi :-)
The disadvantage of ourfunction is that ( under Hugs ) it takes about 4 seconds to evaluate .
If we are performing lots of calculations with pi , calculatingeach time will be a serious problem .
CAFs are the solution !
A CAF is a top - level constant , which does n't take any arguments , and will be computed at most once per program execution .
As a slight subtlety , if the constant has class constraints on it ( i.e. is , instead of ) then it is n't a CAF because the class constraints act like implicit arguments .
Ourfunction above does n't take any arguments , so is a CAF .
Whiledoes n't have any class constraints , the right - hand side ofdoes !
Take a look in Hugs :
The right - hand side works for anyandtype , for example , butis restricted to .
The reason is the defaulting mechanism in Haskell - if a type can't be nailed down precisely , but is one of a handful of built - in classes , then it will default to a particular type .
This feature is handy for working at an interactive environment , but can sometimes be a little unexpected .
Without defaulting the compiler would infer the type ofas .
However , such a definition would be rejected by the monomorphism restriction .
The monomorphism restriction states that a function with no explicit arguments , but with class constraints , must be given a type annotation .
This rejects functions like : To fix the problem there are two solutions :
For a function likeonly the second approach is applicable .
The addition of dummy arguments to avoid the monomorphism restriction is sufficiently common that the HLint tool never suggests eta-reduction if the argument is namedSo why was the monomorphism restriction first introducted ?
For a function with no explicit arguments , the programmer might think they had written a CAF , but class constraints may substantially degrade the performance .
Defaulting reduces the number of cases where the monomorphism restriction would otherwise bite , but it is still useful to be aware of the ugly corners .
There are proposals afoot to remove the monomorphism restriction and to increase the power of the default mechanism - hopefully both will be included in to Haskell ' .
Obama approval ratings rise 17 percent after speech RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday February 25 , 2009
Print This Email
This A flash CBS News poll conducted Tuesday evening found broad increases of support in almost all areas surrounding President Barack Obama 's approval of the economy .
In fact , Obama 's approval rating for handling the economic crisis leapt 17 percent after the speech among those who watched it , from 63 to 80 percent .
51 percent of viewers felt that Obama 's economic plans would help them personally , with 36 percent before the speech -- and increase of 15 percent .
" Seventy - five percent of speech watchers now say they were able to get a good understanding of President Obamas economic plans , compared to 58 percent before the speech , " CBS wrote .
" Seventy - four percent of speech watchers think President Obamas plans will make the economy better .
Eleven percent think they will make them worse , while 15 percent think they will make no difference . "
Among those who watched the speech , 80 percent said they were optimistic about the next four years as opposed to 71 percent beforehand .
Both figures were a far cry from the ratings of erstwhile President George W. Bush .
" Seventy - six percent of speech watchers think Barack Obamas economic plans will help the housing crisis , " CBS said .
" Twenty - four percent think they will not . "
Get Raw exclusives as they break -- Email & mobile Email - Never spam :
It ’s been quite a while ( back in 2002 , flash 5 ) since I did some serious work using oscillators and waveforms .
I ’m writing this down while trying to get back on track .
The stuff described here is definitely no secret .
It ’s basic , but relevant to create some tunes in flash or whatever technology you might want to use .
Hopefully you ’ll find some of it useful .
Through the introduction of the SampleDataEvent it is now easy to write data back to the audio stream :
private function noiseWave ( event : SampleDataEvent ) : void { var sample : Number ; for ( var i:int= 0 ; i< 8192 ; i++ ) { sample = Math.random ( ) - .5 ; event.data.writeFloat( sample * AMP_MULTIPLIER ) ; event.data.writeFloat( sample * AMP_MULTIPLIER ) ; } }
This will simply generate some noise .
Sounds rather boring , does n’t it ?
Do n’t neglect the noise though , it ’s a great source for percussive sounds , when treated accordingly .
Anyway , to get something more exciting we need to introduce pitch , timber ( quality of sound ) and loudness .
Tones & Pitch
To produce a sound we perceive as a tone at a certain pitch , we need to introduce a bunch of data that is repeated over time .
This gives us a repeating pattern .
Let ‘s call a cycle of that pattern the waveform .
Aha , so let ’s simply write 1 , - 1,1 , - 1,1, - 1 … to the stream , right ?
Yes , we could do that , but no , you and I would n't hear a bleep .
It would simply be out of our hearing range .
To get the tones into the hearing range , the pattern needs to be repeated a certain amount of times per second .
Remember the note , your music teacher in school was desperately hammering on his piano , to get everyone in tune ?
That was probably an A above middle C . This note has a frequency of 440 Hz , meaning the waveform ( or data in our case ) cycles – or oscillates - at 440 times per second .
The next lower A is at 220 Hz , the next higher 880 Hz .
Basically , the more cycles per sec , the higher the frequency , the higher the pitch .
Flash works at a sampling rate of 44100 Hz .
It uses 44100 samples / sec to produce sound .
If we want to generate an A ( 440 Hz ) in flash , we need to repeatedly write a bunch of 44100/ 440 ≈ 100 samples to the audio stream .
The 100 samples are actually the wavelength represented in samples .
private function sineWave1 ( event : SampleDataEvent ) : void { var sample : Number for ( var i:int= 0 ; i< 8192 ; i++) { sample = Math.sin((i+event.position ) * TWO_PI_OVER_SR * BASE_FREQ ) ; event.data.writeFloat( sample * AMP_MULTIPLIER ) ; event.data.writeFloat( sample * AMP_MULTIPLIER ) ; } }
This will generate a pure sine A440 Hz .
By layering multiple sines of different frequencies a vast number of waveforms can be created .
A square wave could be generated using multiple sines , but that would put heavy loads on the CPU .
Luckily we can cheat :
private function squareWave1 ( event : SampleDataEvent ) : void { var amp : Number = 0.075 ; var sample : Number ; for ( var i:int= 0 ; i< 8192 ; i++) { sample = Math.sin(( i + event.position ) * TWO_PI_OVER_SR * BASE_FREQ ) > 0 ? amp : - amp ; event.data.writeFloat(sample ) ; event.data.writeFloat( sample ) ; } }
This gives us a nice square wave , but there ’s quite an expensive Math.sin ( ) in it .
Another approach might be better regarding performance :
var phase : Number ; private function squareWave2 ( event : SampleDataEvent ) : void { var amp : Number = 0.075 ; var sample : Number ; for ( var i:int ; i < 8192 ; i++) { sample = phase < Math .
PI ? amp : - amp ; phase = phase +
( TWO_PI_OVER_SR * BASE_FREQ ) ; phase = phase >
TWO_PI ?
phase - TWO_PI : phase ; event.data.writeFloat(sample ) ; event.data.writeFloat( sample ) ; } }
The square wave has the same pitch as the sine wave above but sounds different ( different quality of sound or timbre ) .
Why ?
Overtones .
Timbre ( quality of sound )
The perceived timbre of a sound is determined by its spectrum and loudness over time .
The spectrum is basically the sum of different frequencies in a sound .
Based on the fundamental frequency ( in our example 440 Hz ) there could be other frequencies ( overtones ) on top of that .
These overtones can either be harmonic , when they are multiple octaves above the fundamental frequency or in - harmonic , when somewhere in - between .
We do n’t need to deal with overtones , let ’s just state that the waveform and timbre of a sound are coupled .
HOW a waveform sounds is mainly a question of perception and association .
The other factor that defines the timbre is the loudness of a sound over time .
Loudness
Loudness of a sound over time is another factor that defines the timbre .
If we change
- this : event.data.writeFloat(sample ) ; event.data.writeFloat( sample ) ; - to that : event.data.writeFloat( sample * ( 8192 - c ) / 8192 ) ; event.data.writeFloat( sample * ( 8192 - c ) / 8192 ) ;
we get a sound with a strong attack and a linear decay .
However , the sounds we got so far are a little static .
To get more interesting results , we need to introduce modulation .
Modulation can affect all kinds of parameters ( like pitch , loudness , envelope , shifts in overtones , anything ) to slightly or drastically change the waveform over time .
Here ’s an example that modulates the pulse width and the amplitude of a pulse wave :
private function pulseWaveMod1 ( event : SampleDataEvent ) : void { var amp : Number = 0.075 ; var pwr : Number = Math .
PI / 1.05 ; var dpw : Number ; var am : Number ; var pos: Number ; var sample : Number ; for ( var i:int= 0 ; i< 8192 ; i++) { pos = i + event.position ; dpw = Math.sin ( pos / 0x4800 ) * pwr ; sample = phase < Math .
PI - dpw ?
amp : - amp ; phase = phase +
( TWO_PI_OVER_SR * BASE_FREQ ) ; phase = phase >
TWO_PI ?
phase - TWO_PI : phase ; am = Math.sin ( pos / 0x1000 ) ; event.data.writeFloat( sample * am ) ; event.data.writeFloat( sample * am ) ; } }
By modulating different parameters the sound gets more interesting .
Now , nobody stops you from modulating the modulators , giving more drastic results .
Here ’s a little test of basic waveforms up to rather heavily modulated :
Turn down volume first .
Needs the latest Flash - Player 10 ( rc 091508 ) .
Here ’s the source .
UPDATE : Adobe changed the sound api .
Use SampleDataEvent .SAMPLE_DATA instead of Event .
SAMPLE_DATA for the listener .
Yeah , sounds still thin , though
You ’re right .
To get those fat bastard sounds we need more voices , effects ( the holy reverb ) , filters , compressors etc . but that ’s a whole different story .
In the end , at the basis of it all are the waveforms .

Gruber points out that many of the criticisms of MacHeist were based on a flat - payment scheme they used before , and that this time , developers are being paid a percentage .
Gus Mueller ( whose previous scathing criticism can be found farther down the page ) writes :
So why is Flying Meat participating in MacHeist time around , when I blasted it a couple of years ago ?
Well , it ’s pretty simple .
The folks at MacHeist fixed the payment terms after MacHeist 1 , and developers are getting a much better deal now .
Tada .
This is a Good Thing , for sure .
I ’m still not buying the bundle .

Its clear that many people take issue with MacHeist .
My goal is to show some of the reasons I ’ve decided to never support them , and I have faith that you are capable of making up your own mind .
In response to his criticism of MacHeist , Marco Arment received a well - written email from Phill Ryu , one of the MH organizers .
In response to this , John Casasanta , another of the organizers , replied to Phill with a cc to Marco : I do n’t know why you feel the need to explain yourself to this ignorant , insignificant piece of shit .
( yes the cc was intentional this time ) I respect Marco ’s decision to edit his post , but feel that the insight it gives into the attitude and behavior of John Casasanta , someone who stands to profit handsomely from MacHeist , remains newsworthy .
Additionally , Marco wrote a post last month entitled Negativity that is well worth a read , especially now .

EventBox MacHeist milen :
You might have noticed that we ’re featured on MacHeist and it ’s a free download .
I expect many people to ask the question why buy it then ?
Here ’s the short answer : the MacHeist Edition of EventBox is not the same as regular EventBox .
Here are the reasons :
The MacHeist edition includes no official support whatsoever .
If you ’re having a problem or want to request a feature , you ’re probably out of luck .
.
If you ’re having a problem or want to request a feature , you ’re probably out of luck .
Most importantly , the MacHeist edition includes no updates at all .
This means you ’re forever stuck at build 566 .
Since we ’re planning on adding many many new features in the future , you ’re essentially going to be running an ancient version .
I ’m talking about syncing , multiple accounts , TwitPic , centralized notifications , more services .
We will be adding TONS of new stuff .
And this is only up until version 1.0 .
We ’re planning to have a very long 1.x series , so buying EventBox now will last you at least 1.5 - 2 years .

You wo n’t be able to use Digg from the MacHeist edition .
I hope that clears things up .

Gus Mueller explains why he skipped MacHeist ( in the comments ) John said : “ Right Gus .
So you ’re implying that the devs involved had guns held to their heads for this . ”
You must have skipped the part where I said “ I ’m certain the developers who are participating in the bundle know what they are getting into , and have good reasons for doing so ” .
John said : “ You had the chance to be involved here and you turned it down . ”
I turned it down because it was a horrible deal for me .
At the time , the deal was 5 k to the developer for the rights to sell the app for a full week .
I tried to negotiate for a percentage and was told there was no negotiating , the deal was the same for everyone across the board .
And at the time there would have been at total of 5 apps .
I was also told that you guys need to sell 2 k to “ break even ” .
Let ’s look at the math for that and why I turned it down .
49 * 2000 = 98000
98000 * .75 = 73500 ( this is the number after charity )
73500 - ( 5 * 5000 ) = 48500
And let ’s just say it was 5 k for credit card processing , which is a bit on the high side but that ’s ok because the numbers make you guys look better .
So that means you guys needed $ 48,000 dollars to “ break even ” .
That set off a ton alarm bells in my head , and they were all shouting that you guys were going to screw me over .
Let ’s say that you do make 10,000 sales like you hope , let ’s look at the numbers for that - and I ’ll even double the amount you guys are paying the devs to 10 k .
49 * 10000 = 490000
490000 * .8 = 392000 ( charity + 5 % credit card processing )
392000 - ( 10 * 10000 ) = 292000 $ 292,000 profit for you guys .
Yea , that ’s fair .

Alastair 's
Place breaks down the math in 2007
And following on from John Gruber ’s original guesses as to the amount of money made by the organisers of MacHeist , Wikipedia notes that MacHeist I raised $ 200,000 for charities and took $ 800,000 in total …
So MacHeist ’s organisers could have pocketed as much as half a million U.S. dollars , some 86 % of the profit after the charitable donation and expenses , as compared with a total of 14 % for the developers , or an average of just 1 % per developer , and more than twice as much as was paid to charity .
12:29 Link
Gruber on MacHeist in 2006 Estimated profit for the MacHeist team : $ 463,500 MacHeist ’s percentage share of the total profit : 87.5 Average percentage share of the total profit for each individual developer : 1.3 12:28 Link
Think Mac Blog : " The economics of MacHeist " ( 2006 ) “ MacHeist themselves were rewarded disproportionately for their efforts ” “ … in conclusion , like most of these other free / heavily discounted app promotions that have been non -stop for awhile now , the only real value you get is in marketing exposure - unless your app really is only worth $ 4 per sale . ”

( CNN ) --
At a friend 's sleepover more than a year ago , 14 - year - old Phillip Swartley pocketed change from unlocked vehicles in the neighborhood to buy chips and soft drinks .
The cops caught him .
Former Luzerne county President Judge Mark Ciavarella pleaded guilty , faces prison and was disbarred .
There was no need for an attorney , said Phillip 's mother , Amy Swartley , who thought at most , the judge would slap her son with a fine or community service .
But she was shocked to find her eighth - grader handcuffed and shackled in the courtroom and sentenced to a youth detention center .
Then , he was shipped to a boarding school for troubled teens for nine months .
" Yes , my son made a mistake , but I did n't think he was going to be taken away from me , " said Swartley , a 41 - year - old single mother raising two boys in Wilkes - Barre , Pennsylvania .
CNN does not usually identify minors accused of crimes .
But Swartley and others agreed to be named to bring public attention to the issue .
As scandals from Wall Street to Washington roil the public trust , the justice system in Luzerne County , in the heart of Pennsylvania 's struggling coal country , has also fallen prey to corruption .
The county has been rocked by a kickback scandal involving two elected judges who essentially jailed kids for cash .
Many of the children had appeared before judges without a lawyer .
Watch the corruption scandal that is rocking Pennsylvania »
The nonprofit Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia said Phillip is one of at least 5,000 children over the past five years who appeared before former Luzerne County President Judge Mark Ciavarella .
Ciavarella pleaded guilty earlier this month to federal criminal charges of fraud and other tax charges , according to the U.S. attorney 's office .
Former Luzerne County Senior Judge Michael Conahan also pleaded guilty to the same charges .
The two secretly received more than $ 2.6 million , prosecutors said .
The judges have been disbarred and have resigned from their elected positions .
They agreed to serve 87 months in prison under their plea deals .
Ciavarella and Conahan did not return calls , and their attorneys told CNN that they have no comment .
Ciavarella , 58 , along with Conahan , 56 , corruptly and fraudulently " created the potential for an increased number of juvenile offenders to be sent to juvenile detention facilities , " federal court documents alleged .
Children would be placed in private detention centers , under contract with the court , to increase the head count .
In exchange , the two judges would receive kickbacks .
The Juvenile Law Center said it plans to file a class - action lawsuit this week representing what they say are victims of corruption .
Juvenile Law Center attorneys cite a few examples of harsh penalties Judge Ciavarella meted out for relatively petty offenses :
Ciavarvella sent 15 - year - old Hillary Transue to a wilderness camp for mocking an assistant principal on a MySpace page .
He whisked 13 - year - old Shane Bly , who was accused of trespassing in a vacant building , from his parents and confined him in a boot camp for two weekends .
He sentenced Kurt Kruger , 17 , to detention and five months of boot camp for helping a friend steal DVDs from Wal - Mart .
Several other lawsuits on behalf of the juveniles who have appeared in Ciavarella 's courtroom have emerged .
The private juvenile detention centers , owned by Mid Atlantic Youth Services Corp. , are still operating and are not a target of the federal investigation , according court documents .
The company cooperated in the investigation , the documents said .
A spokesman from the company denied that its current owner , Gregory Zappala , knew about the kickbacks .
Ciavarella assured the community that he could provide justice .
Elected to the bench in 1996 , he once ran for judge on the promise that he would punish " people who break the law , " according to local reports .
The corruption began in 2002 , when Conahan shut down the state juvenile detention center and used money from the Luzerne County budget to fund a multimillion - dollar lease for the private facilities .
Despite some raised eyebrows from the community , county commissioners approved the deal .
The federal government began investigating in 2006 .
" It 's been a dark cloud hanging over the county for a very , very long time , " said Luzerne County Commissioner Maryanne C. Petrilla , whose office approved the judges ' budgets during the corruption .
" I 'm looking forward to the ship turning around now and us moving in the right direction . "
The kickback scandal highlights a major problem in the juvenile justice system in Luzerne County and across the country , attorneys say .
They say hundreds of children who appeared before Ciavarella did n't have lawyers .
" Kids think very much in the present , and they have limited abilities to understand long - term consequences , " said Robin Dahlberg , an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union in New York who specializes in juvenile issues .
Dahlberg 's recent study in Ohio revealed that some of the counties had as many as 90 percent of children going through the court system without a lawyer .
" This Pennsylvania case is a sad reminder of why kids need an attorney , " she said .
A 1967 Supreme Court ruling says children have a right to counsel .
However , many states allow children and their parents to appear without an attorney by completing a waiver .
Pennsylvania is among about half of the states in the country that allow waivers to be signed for juveniles to appear before a judge without an attorney , legal experts say .
In Luzerne County , teens who waived counsel were at greater risk of being sent to placement center than those with representation .
About 50 percent of the children who waived counsel before Ciavarella were sent to some kind of placement , the Philadelphia - based Juvenile Law Center reports .
In comparison , the Juvenile Court Judges ' Commission in Pennsylvania found that 8.4 percent of juveniles across the state wind up in placement .
" When you have this many kids waiving counsel , then that 's way out of line , " said Marsha Levick , an attorney at the Juvenile Law Center .
" There was no record [ Ciavarella ] was assuring the child and parent about the consequences of not having representation . "
Minors charged with nonviolent crimes were often given harsher sentences than what probation officers recommended , court documents say .
Other investigators say the trials lasted a few minutes at most .
All four of the teens cited in this story say they appeared before Ciavarella without lawyers .
" I was sort of shocked and taken aback , " Hillary Transue , the MySpace offender who is now 17 , said of her experience in Ciavarella 's courtroom in April 2007 .
" I did n't really understand what was going on . "
The Juvenile Law Center says it first red-flagged Ciavarella in 1999 after discovering that a 13 - year - old boy was detained without being read his rights and had appeared in court without a lawyer .
When the case became public , Ciavarella promised the public that every minor in his courtroom would have a lawyer .
Judges must verbally explain the consequences of appearing in court without counsel to minors and parents , lawyers say .
Juvenile Law Center officials say Ciavarella neglected to do so in many cases .
Yet in the past five years , attorneys , law enforcement officials and other judges did not report Ciavarella 's behavior to the Judicial Conduct Board of Pennsylvania , says Joseph A. Massa Jr. , chief counsel at the board .
Privatizing detention facilities is a growing in popularity among governments because the companies say they offer lower rates than the state .
Pennsylvania has the second highest number of private facilities after Florida , accounting for about 11 percent of the private facilities in the United States , according to the National Center for Juvenile Justice in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
Critics say private prisons lack transparency because they do n't go through the same inspections and audits as a state facility , and this may have allowed payoffs to go so long without being noticed .
" Once somebody is going to make more money by holding more kids , there is a pretty good predictable profit motive , " said criminal justice consultant Judith Greene , who heads a nonprofit group called Justice Strategies .
" It 's predictable that companies are going to tolerate certain behaviors they should n't . "
An audit draft obtained by the Philadelphia Inquirer showed that Luzerne County was spending more than $ 1.2 million in expenses that were n't allowed under state regulations .
The Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare , the agency overseeing the audits , says the audit drafts are not final .
The audits also allege that two people paid the judges .
Attorneys for former Mid-Atlantic owner Robert Powell say that their client is one of those people but that he was pressured by the judges to make payments .
The attorneys say Powell never offered to pay the judges , never sought to influence any juvenile case and is now cooperating with the investigation .
Zappala and Powell were partners until Zappala bought out Powell in 2008 .
Senior Judge Arthur E. Grim of Berks County is reviewing the cases for minors who appeared before Ciavarella .
Court officials say some children may have their records expunged or be granted new hearings .
The Philadelphia Bar Association has expressed outrage , assuring the public that the rest of the judges on the state 's bench are " composed of highly qualified , honorable and honest people , who take their responsibilities to the public very seriously . "
But some of the children -- many who , like Phillip Swartley , are now young adults -- have become jaded and believe that their cases were tainted in Ciavarella 's courtroom .
After being sent to boarding school , Phillip , now 15 , became withdrawn and depressed , his mother says .
" What do these kids see of the legal system and of authority figures ? "
Amy Swartley asked .
" These kids see people who abuse their power .
Now , we have a whole county and generation of children who have lost trust in the system . "

Any real guitarist will tell you that Guitar Hero has nothing to do with any real - world instrument .
Disney , surprisingly , has created an educational and inoffensive spin that uses a real guitar as a controller .

Disney Star Guitarist , made with help from Washburn Guitars , uses the same style of " falling notes " that Guitar Hero and Rock Band use so well .
But instead of cheap plastic buttons that mock my years of slaving over a sweaty fretboard , trying to learn some shitty Dave Mathews Band song so girls at college would sleep with me , Star Guitarist makes use of a real guitar .
The special strings are included with the $ 200 game , and can be strung onto any standard guitar .
Disney Star Guitarist , along with similar versions for keyboards and vocals , will be released for both PC and Mac this summer .

The wild fox population on Santa Catalina Island is so robust that biologists said Tuesday they may seek to have the small animals taken off the federal endangered species list next year .
The number of Catalina Island foxes -- a subspecies found only on the 75 - square - mile island 22 miles off the coast of Southern California -- topped out at 784 in a new count , a remarkable rebound for animals that were nearly wiped out a decade ago after an outbreak of distemper possibly introduced by someone ’s pet .
“ These numbers are fantastic news , ” said Julie King , senior wildlife biologist for the Catalina Island Conservancy .
Rain -- and a lack thereof -- contributed to the population growth , King said .
Advertisement
“ In 2007 , we had an extreme drought with less than 3 inches of rain , ” she said .
“ As a result , mule deer were dying in great numbers , and the foxes were able to scavenge off the carcasses .
By the time breeding season arrived in 2008 , we literally had obese foxes , and females in such good condition that they were having larger - than - normal litters . ”
In addition , 2008 was “ a good rain year , so the rodent population exploded , ” she said .
“ The mice were convenient to - go packages of protein for females to retrieve and feed to their pups . ”
About 1,300 foxes once lived on the island .
The population had crashed to roughly 100 by 1999 , when the conservancy and the Institute for Wildlife Studies launched a $ 2 - million recovery program that included vaccinations and a captive breeding facility .
In 2004 , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the fox as endangered .
Advertisement
“ For a small conservancy to bring a species back from the brink of extinction to a stabilized , growing population in less than 10 years is no small feat , ” said Carlos de la Rosa , chief conservation and education officer for the conservancy .
“ The foxes will be starting their breeding season in the next few weeks , so you will probably start seeing more pairs of foxes than singles on the roads during February and March . ”
On Tuesday afternoon , conservancy biologist Calvin Duncan and volunteer pilot Mike Sheehan conducted an aerial survey of the island ’s 56 foxes outfitted with telemetry collars , which emit a rapid - fire pinging sound if an animal has not moved for 12 hours .
After an hour of flying about 2,500 feet above rugged island terrain , Duncan gave a thumbs up and said , “ We got everybody .
All 56 are accounted for , and there are no fatalities . ”
The foxes are trapped once a year and inspected for any illnesses , including an unusual ear cancer that recently began showing up in older foxes .
“ We want to keep them as virus - free as possible , ” Duncan said .

Air and ground observations suggest the omnivorous 5 - pound foxes are faring well , feeding at night on cactus fruit , berries and insects , scurrying through shrubs and ravines , and establishing territories .
The island ’s captive breeding program ended in 2004 .
But the foxes ’ problems are not over .
Today , the primary cause of death among foxes is “ road kill , ” Duncan said .
“ We ’ve got 4,000 people living in Avalon , and driving all over the island . ”
The conservancy ’s fundraising efforts have fallen $ 150,000 short of the $ 222,000 needed to sustain the fox recovery effort through the end of the year .
All field activities , equipment , radio collars , vaccines , medications , fuel , vehicles and seasonal staff are funded through grants and donor contributions , King said .

“ We ’re reaching out to people interested in contributing , ” she said .
“ A radio collar costs $ 250 , a vaccination is about $ 10 .
These costs add up quickly . ”

1 The Fertility Clinic that used the wrong sperm
When Nancy Andrews , of Commack , N.Y. , became pregnant after an in vitro fertilization procedure at a New York fertility clinic , she and her husband expected a new addition to their family .
What they did not expect was a child whose skin was significantly darker than that of either parent .
Subsequent DNA tests suggested that doctors at New York Medical Services for Reproductive Medicine accidentally used another man ’s sperm to inseminate Nancy Andrews ’ eggs .
The couple has since raised Baby Jessica , who was born Oct. 19 , 2004 , as their own , according to wire reports .
But the couple still filed a malpractice suit against the owner of the clinic , as well as the embryologist who allegedly mixed up the samples .
2 Received the wrong heart and lungs , then died
17 - year - old Jésica Santillán died 2 weeks after receiving the heart and lungs of a patient whose blood type did not match hers .
Doctors at the Duke University Medical Center failed to check the compatibility before surgery began . .
After a rare second transplant operation to attempt to rectify the error , she suffered brain damage and complications that subsequently hastened her death .
Santillán , a Mexican immigrant , had come to the United States three years before to seek medical treatment for a life - threatening heart condition .
The heart - lung transplant that surgeons at Duke University Hospital in Durham , N.C. , hoped would improve this condition instead put her in greater danger ; Santillán , who had type - O blood , had received the organs from a type - A donor .
The error sent the patient into a comalike state , and she died shortly after an attempt to switch the organs back out for compatible ones failed .
The hospital blamed human error for the death , along with a lack of safeguards to ensure a compatible transplant .
According to reports ,
Duke reached an agreement on an undisclosed settlement with the family .
Neither the hospital nor the family is allowed to comment on the case .
3 A $ 200,000 testicle
In yet another case of a wrongful operation , surgeons mistakenly removed the healthy right testicle of 47 - year - old Air Force veteran Benjamin Houghton .
The patient had been complaining of pain and shrinkage of his left testicle so doctors decided to schedule surgery to remove it due to cancer fears .
However , the veteran ’s medical records suggest a series of missteps — from an error on the consent form to a failure on the part of medical personnel to mark the proper surgical site before the procedure .
The error , which took place at the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center , spurred a $ 200,000 lawsuit from Houghton and his wife .
4 A 13 - Inch souvenir
Donald Church , 49 , had a tumor in his abdomen when he arrived at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle in June 2000 .
When he left , the tumor was gone — but a metal retractor had taken its place .
Doctors admitted to leaving the 13 - inch - long retractor in Church ’s abdomen by mistake .
It was not the first such incident at the medical center ; four other such occurrences had been documented at the hospital between 1997 and 2000 .
Fortunately , surgeons were able to remove the retractor shortly after it was discovered , and Church experienced no long - term health consequences from the mistake .
The hospital agreed to pay Church $ 97,000 .
5 An open heart invasive procedure … on the wrong patient
Joan Morris ( a pseudonym ) is a 67 - year - old woman admitted to a teaching hospital for cerebral angiography .
The day after that procedure , she mistakenly underwent an invasive cardiac electrophysiology study .
After angiography , the patient was transferred to another floor rather than returning to her original bed .
Discharge was planned for the following day .
The next morning , however , the patient was taken for a open heart procedure .
The patient had been on the operating table for an hour .
Doctors had made an incision in her groin , punctured an artery , threaded in a tube and snaked it up into her heart ( a procedure with risks of bleeding , infection , heart attack and stroke ) .
That was when the phone rang and a doctor from another department asked “ what are you doing with my patient ? ”
There was nothing wrong with her heart .
The cardiologist working on the woman checked her chart , and saw that he was making an awful mistake .
The study was aborted , and she was returned to her room in stable condition .
6 Hospital makes a wrong - sided brain surgery … for the third time in a year
For the third time on the same year , doctors at Rhode Island Hospital have operated on the wrong side of a patient ’s head .
The most recent incident occurred Nov. 23 2007 .
An 82 - year - old woman required an operation to stop bleeding between her brain and her skull .
A neurosurgeon at the hospital began a surgery by drilling the right side of the patient ’s head , even though a CT scan showed bleeding on the left side , according to local reports .
The resident reportedly caught his mistake early , after which he closed the initial hole and proceeded on the left side of the patient ’s head .
The patient was listed in fair condition on Sunday .
The case echoes of a similar mistake last February , in which a different doctor operated on the wrong side of a patient ’s head .
And last August , an 86 - year - old man died three weeks after a surgeon at Rhode Island Hospital accidentally operated on the wrong side of his head .
7 The Surgeon who removed the wrong leg
In what was , perhaps , the most publicized case of a surgical mistake in its time , a Tampa ( Florida ) surgeon mistakenly removed the wrong leg of his patient , 52 - year - old Willie King , during an amputation procedure in February 1995 .
It was later revealed that a chain of errors before the surgery culminated in the wrong leg being prepped for the procedure .
While the surgeon ’s team realized in the middle of the procedure that they were operating on the wrong leg , it was already too late , and the leg was removed .
As a result of the error , the surgeon ’s medical license was suspended for six months and he was fined $ 10,000 .
University Community Hospital in Tampa , the medical center where the surgery took place , paid $ 900,000 to King and the surgeon involved in the case paid an additional $ 250,000 to King .
8 The healthy kidney removed by mistake
In St. Louis Park , Minnesota , a patient was submitted at Park Nicollet Methodist Hospital to have one of his kidneys removed because it had a tumor believed to be cancerous .
Instead , doctors removed the healthy one .
“ The discovery that this was the wrong kidney was made the next day when the pathologist examined the material and found no evidence of any malignancy , ” said Samuel Carlson , M.D. and Park Nicollet Chief Medical Officer .
The potentially cancerous kidney remained intact and functioning .
For privacy and family ’s request , no details about the patient were released .
9 Wide - Awake Surgery led to his suicide
A West Virginia man ’s family claims inadequate anesthetic during surgery allowed him to feel every slice of the surgeon ’s scalpel – a trauma they believe led him to take his own life two weeks later .
Sherman Sizemore was admitted to Raleigh General Hospital in Beckley , W.Va. , Jan. 19 , 2006 for exploratory surgery to determine the cause of his abdominal pain .
But during the operation , he reportedly experienced a phenomenon known as anesthetic awareness — a state in which a surgical patient is able to feel pain , pressure or discomfort during an operation , but is unable to move or communicate with doctors .
According to the complaint , anesthesiologists administered the drugs to numb the patient , but they failed to give him the general anesthetic that would render him unconscious until 16 minutes after surgeons first cut into his abdomen .
Family members say the 73 - year - old Baptist minister was driven to kill himself by the traumatic experience of being awake during surgery but unable to move or cry out in pain .
10 Not so funny : wrong artery bypassed
Two months after a double bypass heart operation that was supposed to save his life , comedian and former Saturday Night Live cast member Dana Carvey got some disheartening news : the cardiac surgeon had bypassed the wrong artery .
It took another emergency operation to clear the blockage that was threatening to kill the 45 - year - old funnyman and father of two young kids .
Responding to a $ 7.5 million lawsuit Carvey brought against him , the surgeon said he ’d made an honest mistake because Carvey ’s artery was unusually situated in his heart .
But Carvey did n’t see it that way : “ It ’s like removing the wrong kidney .
It ’s that big a mistake , ” the entertainer told People magazine .
( CNN ) --
An Ohio sheriff had harsh words for ice fishermen who had to be rescued Saturday after high winds and rising temperatures caused an ice floe to break away and strand about 150 of them on Lake Erie .
People were stuck when an 8 - mile - long chunk of Lake Erie ice broke away near Toledo , Ohio .
The incident , in which one person was pronounced dead after being transported to the hospital , came after the National Weather Service issued a warning that ice floes could break away from the main ice area in the western section of the lake .
At least some of those rescued were fishermen .
" This just cost the taxpayers a ton of money , " Ottawa County , Ohio , Sheriff Bob Bratton said .
" We lost a life out there today .
... I 'm sorry a man lost his life out there today .
These people should have known better . "
Bratton said those rescued should never have been on Lake Erie in the first place because weather conditions made it risky , and " if there was a section in the code about common sense , we would have had 150 arrests out there today . "
Watch sheriff express frustration »
A spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard said the person who died fell in the water when the ice floe broke away from land .
View ice safety tips »
" We have rescued more than 150 people , and unfortunately there were two people in the water , " Chief Petty Officer Robert Lanier said .
" One of the people was recovered and brought to shore , " but the other man was pronounced dead after being taken to a hospital .
" This was wrong .
These people endangered the life of volunteer firemen , [ and ] the United States Coast Guard , " Bratton said , estimating the cost of the sheriff 's office response at $ 25,000 .
" I 'm sure that 's going to climb . "
Bratton told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that the fishermen displayed poor judgment in building a makeshift bridge to get from one section of the ice to the other .
" I have no problem with people ice fishing , but these idiots should realize that when you see open water , you should not build a bridge and cross it , " he said .
" It 's a shame you ca n't arrest people for stupidity . "
Among the hundreds of people who went fishing Saturday were Gary and David Vaughn of Conneaut Lake , Pennsylvania .
They told the Plain Dealer that they set up a shanty about 7 a.m. and did n't come back out until 11 a.m. , when they saw a crowd gathered at the edge of the ice .
It was then that they knew they were in trouble .
" When we were over there waiting to be rescued , we feared the ice would just break up under us , " Gary Vaughn , 47 , told the newspaper .
" I feared for my life . "
The sheriff told the Toledo Blade that the people who went out on the ice did not take proper precautions .
" Where is the common sense when they know the ice is broken ? " Bratton said .
" The experienced fishermen , I guarantee , are not out there , " he told the newspaper .
" They 're not reading the weather .
If the ice is broke , you do n't build a little bridge to get from here to there . "
" Ice fishing and recreation on the ice is a culture in the Great Lakes .
It 's something we 've become used to , " Lanier said .
iReport.com : Were you there ?
Share your photos , story
The sheriff said there were a host of factors that the fishermen should have been aware of , which caused them to risk their lives unnecessarily .
" The weather changed ; the temperature went up ; the wind was coming out of the south .
These are all things that are indicators [ that an ice floe break could occur ] . "
Asked whether there are signs or other notification systems to discourage fishermen from going out on the ice under risky conditions , Bratton said there are only Web sites fishermen can check .
" We will go back and look at that , " he said .
" We can't develop the attitude , ' Go out on the ice .
If you get caught , we 'll be there to get you .
We 'll bring you in . '
You 've got to have common sense . "
Watch lake officials describe rescue efforts »
Unprecedented numbers of fishermen have taken to the ice this winter because thicker ice allowed them to go farther out onto the lake , according to the Plain Dealer .
But Saturday 's unseasonably high temperatures apparently melted chunks of the ice .
The ice floe , 8 miles long , was created when a large piece of ice broke off from land near Locust Point , Ohio , east of Toledo , Lanier said earlier .

Last year was a bad one for pension plans worldwide , with the global financial crisis vacuuming an aggregate $ 5 trillion from companyoperated retirement plans in such key markets as the United States , Japan the United Kingdom and The Netherlands .
The plunge in stock prices knocked worldwide pension assets down from $ 25 trillion to $ 20 trillion , an excruciating decline of 19 % , Reuters reported .
In Russell Hoban 's novel Riddley Walker , the descendants of nuclear holocaust survivors seek amid the rubble the key to recovering their lost civilisation .
They end up believing that the answer is to re-invent the atom bomb .
I was reminded of this when I read the government 's new plans to save us from the credit crunch .
It intends - at gobsmacking public expense - to persuade the banks to start lending again , at levels similar to those of 2007 .
Is n't this what caused the problem in the first place ?
Are insane levels of lending really the solution to a crisis caused by insane levels of lending ?
Yes , I know that without money there 's no business , and without business there are no jobs .
I also know that most of the money in circulation is issued , through fractional reserve banking , in the form of debt .
This means that you can't solve one problem ( a lack of money ) without causing another ( a mountain of debt ) .
There must be a better way than this .
This is n't my subject and I am venturing way beyond my pay grade .
But I want to introduce you to another way of negotiating a credit crunch , which requires no moral hazard , no hair of the dog and no public spending .
I 'm relying , in explaining it , on the former currency trader and central banker Bernard Lietaer .
In his book The Future of Money , Lietaer points out - as the government did yesterday - that in situations like ours everything grinds to a halt for want of money .
But he also explains that there is no reason why this money should take the form of sterling or be issued by the banks .
Money consists only of " an agreement within a community to use something as a medium of exchange " .
The medium of exchange could be anything , as long as everyone who uses it trusts that everyone else will recognise its value .
During the Great Depression , businesses in the United States issued rabbit tails , seashells and wooden discs as currency , as well as all manner of papers and metal tokens .
In 1971 , Jaime Lerner , the mayor of Curitiba in Brazil , kick - started the economy of the city and solved two major social problems by issuing currency in the form of bus tokens .
People earned them by picking and sorting litter : thus cleaning the streets and acquiring the means to commute to work .
Schemes like this helped Curitiba become one of the most prosperous cities in Brazil .
But the projects that have proved most effective were those inspired by the German economist Silvio Gessell , who became finance minister in Gustav Landauer 's doomed Bavarian republic .
He proposed that communities seeking to rescue themselves from economic collapse should issue their own currency .
To discourage people from hoarding it , they should impose a fee ( called demurrage ) , which has the same effect as negative interest .
The back of each banknote would contain 12 boxes .
For the note to remain valid , the owner had to buy a stamp every month and stick it in one of the boxes .
It would be withdrawn from circulation after a year .
Money of this kind is called stamp scrip : a privately issued currency that becomes less valuable the longer you hold on to it .
One of the first places to experiment with this scheme was the small German town of Schwanenkirchen .
In 1923 , hyperinflation had caused a credit crunch of a different kind .
A Dr Hebecker , owner of a coalmine in Schwanenkirchen , told his workers that if they would n't accept the coal - backed stamp scrip he had invented - the Wara - he would have to close the mine .
He promised to exchange it , in the first instance , for food .
The scheme immediately took off .
It saved both the mine and the town .
It was soon adopted by 2,000 corporations across Germany .
But in 1931 , under pressure from the central bank , the ministry of finance closed the project down , with catastrophic consequences for the communities that had come to depend on it .
Lietaer points out that the only remaining option for the German economy was ruthless centralised economic planning .
Would Hitler have come to power if the Wara and similar schemes had been allowed to survive ?
The Austrian town of Wörgl also tried out Gessell 's idea , in 1932 .
Like most communities in Europe at the time , it suffered from mass unemployment and a shortage of money for public works .
Instead of spending the town 's meagre funds on new works , the mayor put them on deposit as a guarantee for the stamp scrip he issued .
By paying workers in the new currency , he paved the streets , restored the water system and built a bridge , new houses and a ski jump .
Because they would soon lose their value , Wörgl 's own schillings circulated much faster than the official money , with the result that each unit of currency generated 12 to 14 times more employment .
Scores of other towns sought to copy the scheme , at which point - in 1933 - the central bank stamped it out .
Wörgl 's workers were thrown out of work again .
Similar projects took off at the same time in dozens of countries .
Almost all of them were closed down ( just one , Switzerland 's WIR system , still exists ) as the central banks panicked about losing their monopoly over the control of money .
Roosevelt prohibited complementary currencies by executive decree , though they might have offered a faster , cheaper and more effective means of pulling the US out of the Depression than his New Deal .
No one is suggesting that we replace official currencies with local scrip : this is a complementary system , not an alternative .
Nor does Lietaer propose this as a solution to all economic ills .
But even before you consider how it could be improved through modern information technology , several features of Gessell 's system grab your attention .
We need not wait for the government or the central bank to save us : we can set this system up ourselves .
It costs taxpayers nothing .
It bypasses the greedy banks .
It recharges local economies and gives local businesses an advantage over multinationals .
It can be tailored to the needs of the community .
It does not require - as Eddie George , the former governor of the Bank of England , insisted - that one part of the country be squeezed so that another can prosper .
Perhaps most importantly , a demurrage system reverses the ecological problem of discount rates .
If you have to pay to keep your money , the later you receive your income , the more valuable it will be .
So it makes economic sense , under this system , to invest long term .
As resources in the ground are a better store of value than money in the bank , the system encourages their conservation .
I make no claim to expertise .
I 'm not qualified to identify the flaws in this scheme , nor am I confident that I have made the best case for it .
All I ask is that , if you have n't come across it before , you do n't dismiss it before learning more .
As we confront the failure of the government 's first bailout and the astonishing costs of the second , is n't it time we considered the alternatives ?

Mini Bio ( 1 )
In 1976 , if you had told fourteen - year - old Franciscan seminary student Thomas Cruise Mapother IV that one day in the not too distant future he would be Tom Cruise , one of the top 100 movie stars of all time , he would have probably grinned and told you that his ambition was to join the priesthood .
Nonetheless , this sensitive , deeply religious youngster who was born in 1962 in Syracuse , New York , was destined to become one of the highest paid and most sought after actors in screen history .
Tom is the only son ( among four children ) of nomadic parents , Mary Lee ( Pfeiffer ) , a special education teacher , and Thomas Cruise Mapother III , an electrical engineer .
His parents were both from Louisville , Kentucky , and he has German , Irish , and English ancestry .
Young
Tom spent his boyhood always on the move , and by the time he was 14 he had attended 15 different schools in the U.S. and Canada .
He finally settled in Glen Ridge , New Jersey with his mother and her new husband .
While in high school , Tom wanted to become a priest but pretty soon he developed an interest in acting and abandoned his plans of becoming a priest , dropped out of school , and at age 18 headed for New York and a possible acting career .
The next 15 years of his life are the stuff of legends .
He made his film debut with a small part in Endlose Liebe ( 1981 ) and from the outset exhibited an undeniable box office appeal to both male and female audiences .
With handsome movie star looks and a charismatic smile , within 5 years Tom Cruise was starring in some of the top - grossing films of the 1980s including Top Gun - Sie fürchten weder Tod noch Teufel ( 1986 ) ; Die Farbe des Geldes ( 1986 ) , Rain Man ( 1988 ) and Geboren am 4 . Juli ( 1989 ) .
By the 1990s he was one of the highest - paid actors in the world earning an average 15 million dollars a picture in such blockbuster hits as Interview mit einem Vampir ( 1994 ) , Mission : Impossible ( 1996 ) and Jerry Maguire : Spiel des Lebens ( 1996 ) , for which he received an Academy Award Nomination for best actor .
Tom Cruise 's biggest franchise , Mission Impossible , has also earned a total of 3 billion dollars worldwide .
Tom Cruise has also shown lots of interest in producing , with his biggest producer credits being the Mission Impossible franchise .
In 1990 he renounced his devout Catholic beliefs and embraced The Church of Scientology claiming that Scientology teachings had cured him of the dyslexia that had plagued him all of his life .
A kind and thoughtful man well known for his compassion and generosity , Tom Cruise is one of the best liked members of the movie community .
He was married to actress Nicole Kidman until 2001 .
Thomas Cruise Mapother IV has indeed come a long way from the lonely wanderings of his youth to become one of the biggest movie stars ever .

( August 22 , 2006 ) Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone announced through the " Wall Street Journal " that Viacom ' Paramount subsidiary was terminating its development deal with Cruise after 14 years .

Movie pundits were somewhat surprised by the announcement , as Cruise remains the top box office draw in North America and was Paramount 's cash cow .
Cruise 's films reportedly have accounted for 32 % of Paramount Pictures ' revenues in the last six years , and he was named the Top Box Office draw for a record seventh time by Quigley Publications for the year 2005 .

At the time of the announcement , Cruise and his advisers were considering Paramount 's new offer of $ 2 million per year in development money when Redstone dropped this bombshell .

We were going to do what it took to do this picture , whatever time , because I felt - and Nic [ Nicole Kidman ] did , too - that this was going to be a really special time for us .
We knew it would be difficult .
But I would have absolutely kicked myself if I had n't done this .
I have cooked turkeys in my day but when Mom 's around I let her do it .
I was 18 when I saw Akira Kurosawa 's Die sieben Samurai ( 1954 ) .
After about 30 seconds , I realized that this was not just a cultural thing , it was universal .
Years later , I read Bushido .
It talked about many things that I strive for in my own life : loyalty , compassion , responsibility , the idea of looking back on your life and taking responsibility for everything you 've ever done .
I 'm fascinated by the samurai and the samurai code - it's one of the main reasons I wanted to make Last Samurai ( 2003 ) .
Awards are wonderful .
I 've been nominated many times and I 've won many awards .
But my journey is not towards that .
If it happens it will be a blast .
If it does n't , it 's still been a blast .
I believe in life .
I know that life comes in at your heart and it does n't matter if you 're an actor , a filmmaker or a gentleman on the street , it comes at you .
What Scientology gives me is the tools to deal with that , to better enjoy my life and to be able to contribute more .
[ on his role as the hit man in Collateral ( 2004 ) ]
I 've never played a character like this before .
Vincent interested me because he is such an anti-social personality , bringing destruction and chaos with him wherever he goes .
He 's a force of nature .
I remember getting through high school and thinking , " Boy , I 'm glad I got that behind me ! " .
Then , when I was 19 , I got Lockere Geschäfte ( 1983 ) , and I realized , " Ah , so this is life - it's a little bigger than I thought ! " .
As a young actor , people were trying to define who I was before I really knew that for myself .
But I still remember thinking , " This is what I love doing , and I hope I 'm going to be able to do it forever . " .
I 've had a very interesting life .
There are ways of handling the complexities .
I 'm willing to take on responsibilities as a father , as a producer , as an actor - and I enjoy that .
I 've always been changing and evolving and growing .
There 's no pinnacle of power where you can sit back and rest .
Because I grew up in so many different places , I was used to rumors [ about me ] .
You know , I did n't have the right shoes , I did n't have the right clothes .
I even had the wrong accent .
Nic [ Nicole Kidman ] and I do n't talk publicly about custody but , definitely , both of us share the kids back and forth .
They 're amazing kids .
I would live with all of my sisters if I could .
We 've always been very close , my sisters and me .
The important thing with a child is that you love them , you protect them and you help them to grow and find out who they are .
And as a parent , it 's my responsibility to help them to become independent and get all the knowledge and a broad view of the world and life .
I know that Nic [ Nicole Kidman ] absolutely agrees with that .
And that 's what 's important : being there .
I 'd like to be with a woman who goes [ he switches into a woman 's voice ] , " I 've reviewed your schedule , and I 'm going to set up this motorcycle trip for you , because you 've been working really hard .
And I 'm going to go with you .
We 're going to go riding together .
And I 've already been working on it for a couple days so it can be special . " .
I do n't really keep counsel with others .
I'm the kind of person who will think about something , and if I know it 's right I 'm not going to ask anybody .
I do n't go , " Boy , what do you think about this ? "
I 've made every decision for myself - in my career , in my life .
SAT ( exam ) scores have gone right down the toilet .
The parents are blaming the teachers , the teachers are blaming the parents and the psychs are putting everyone on drugs .
[ on the relationship with Katie Holmes , about other people thinking it's a publicity stunt ]
It 's amusing at first .
It 's funny .
But then you sit back and realize how sad it is that there are people who can't even imagine feeling like this .
But my friends are happy for me .
The people who know me are happy .
My mom is happy .
My family is happy .
I 've never agreed with psychiatry , ever .
Before I was a Scientologist , I never agreed with psychiatry .
Here 's the problem .
You do n't know the history of psychiatry .
I do .
I 'm passionate about learning .
I 'm passionate about life .
[ on the invasion of Iraq ]
Personally , I do n't have all the information President [ George W. Bush ] has .
But I believe [ Saddam Hussein ] has committed many crimes against humanity and his own people .
Every single time I start to do a picture , without fail , I feel as if I do n't know what I 'm doing .
( on his father ) He was a bully and a coward .
He was the kind of person where , if something goes wrong , they kick you .
It was a great lesson in my life - how he'd lull you in , make you feel safe and then , bang !
For me , it was like , " There 's something wrong with this guy .
Do n't trust him .
Be careful around him . "
There 's that anxiety .
[ on Geboren am 4 . Juli ( 1989 ) ]
When I made that film people said , " This is going to ruin your career .
Why are you doing this after you did Top Gun .
Why not just do Top Gun 2 ? " .
I wanted to challenge myself .
( 1992 quote ) I 'm very careful in choosing things .
I 'm not one of those people that 's in , that 's out .
Once I make a decision , nothing will stop it .
It 's not something that takes me months to make a decision either , but I evaluate it very carefully , specifically , at the time , taking into account a lot of things .
( 1992 quote ) I really enjoy talking to other actors and directors .
Sometimes , if I see their movies , I 'll call them up or write them a note saying , " I enjoyed it , " or asking , " How did you do that ?
How did you make that work ? " .
I just saw Billy Crystal 's movie Mr. Saturday
Night a couple of weeks ago - he did a phenomenal job directing this - and afterwards , I talked to him for a couple of hours .
It 's true , I can be very shy around famous people .
I remember , Sean Penn and Emilio Estevez and I used to drive by Brando 's house and Nicholson 's house .
We 'd see a light go on inside and go , " There he is - let 's go knock on the door , " then go , " Nah , nah , they 'll never let us in . " .
( 1992 quote on fame )
In the beginning , when people were looking at me , it could be unnerving .
People just start looking at you , staring at you .
I used to get nervous .
Sometimes , I still get a little nervous when , all of a sudden , so much attention is directed at me just like - [ snaps his fingers ] .
( 1992 , on career choices )
My choices are sometimes dictated by many considerations .
I 'm interested in making different kinds of movies .
My path is very simple : I want to challenge myself , find something that lifts me up and makes me want to get out there and work out .
Sometimes , you might look at something I 've done and go , " Degree of difficulty : not so great . "
But , every time , man , it 's a new ring with a hell of a lot of work to be accomplished in it .
( 1992 , on Eine Frage der Ehre ( 1992 ) and working with Rob Reiner ) I finished In einem fernen Land ( 1992 ) and started immediately on it .
So , the first time I met Rob Reiner - I 'd been told , " You know , Tom , he 's a pretty aggressive guy . "
He 's a big guy .
Big hands .
Very bright , articulate .
When he talks his points , he gets very loud because he gets very excited .
He 's just so fucking smart .
He 's very intense , but he 's also like a teddy bear you want to hug .
We read the script together - I 'd already planned on doing it , but we were working on things like structure - and he would read it imagining the nine different characters .
And he started imitating Jack Nicholson .
That 's how he found out that Jack Nicholson should play the role .
The character I play , Kaffee , is a very tough , complex role to play .
You 're either going to hit or miss with this guy .
All of the scenes , all the rhythms , come from character and even though Rob worked so hard on it himself , he trusts the actors to breathe life into their roles .
You 'll look over at him on the set and he 's saying the lines along with the actors .
You become really bonded with this guy because there 's nothing more he wants for you than to be great .
And you feel that .
[ on his character Jack Reacher in Jack Reacher ( 2012 ) ]
Reacher is such a great character .
He does n't have a cell phone , he does n't have email .
He 's off the grid .
He pays for things in cash .
People look at things through the prism of the colours of their life , but Jack Reacher does things the way we want to sometimes .
In that sense , he 's sort of a Dirty Harry , a James Bond , a Josey Wales .
I 'm not the Stanislavsky kind of actor .
I just want to communicate with the people in the scene .
[ on Rock of Ages ( 2012 ) ]
Adam Shankman , the director , asked me if I could carry a tune .
I said , " We 'll see , wo n't we ?
This is either going to work or it's going to be dreadful . " .
What do I want ?
I want a world without war .
I want a world without insanity .
I want to see people do well .
And I do n't even think that it 's as much of what I want for myself .
It 's more what I want for the people around me .
( 2012 ) I have a standard of what winning is .
How do you define winning and losing ?
If I get beaten in a basketball game , I do n't care .
How a movie does is based on so many things , including release dates and marketing .
I understand the box office game .
I was there in the beginning when they started fixating on the number one film and the competition in that .
I really came up with promoting films around the world , and studios fought me , but I mainly did it because I wanted myself and my kids to see the world .
But here 's the game I 'm playing .
I want to make great films that entertain an audience and hold up .
I can control only the effort I put into it and the experience we all have making it .
After that , it is what it is .
( 2012 ) Whether it 's making a film or raising my children , personally I 'm striving to do the right things and to learn .
I 'm an all - or - nothing kind of person , and when I become interested in something , I give it my all .
In life , I always wanted adventures and to learn different fields of endeavor .
The great thing about being an actor is I 've gotten to see what a fighter pilot 's life is like and a race car driver's .
I 've gotten to fly airplanes , race cars , learn about motorcycles .
In Rock of Ages ( 2012 ) , I studied music , learned how to sing and see it from a singer 's vantage point .
I carry those interests and lessons through my own life .
I guess I am always striving to be competent .
( 2012 , on his favorite ' toy ' )
Each one has its different level of freedom .
A fast motorcycle is wonderful , but I 'd have to say it would be the P - 51 Warbird .
I have a 1944 Tuskegee Airmen P - 51 that was part of their training squadron .
When I traveled around as a kid , I had a picture of a Spitfire and a picture of a P - 51 .
P means " pursuit " , and you can fly hard through the canyons .
It 's a beautiful airplane , unlike anything else .
( 2012 , on learning to fly ) I always wanted to fly , and that was one of the reasons I did Top Gun - Sie fürchten weder Tod noch Teufel ( 1986 ) .
I just never had the time to learn .
Then I met Sydney Pollack .
I was 19 or 20 .
He was editing Tootsie ( 1982 ) , and I 'd just finished Lockere Geschäfte ( 1983 ) .
I got a meeting with Sydney that was supposed to be 20 minutes and ended up being over two hours .
Outside of my admiration for him as a filmmaker , we talked about a big mutual interest that we had in aviation because I knew he flew .
Sydney became a lifelong friend , and when we finished Die Firma ( 1993 ) together in 1993 or 1994 , he gave me flying lessons as a gift .
He said , " I know how much you love flying .
Take the time , right now , and do it , because otherwise you 'll never get to it . "
I had two kids by then , and I worked all the time .
In a few months , I had my instrument rating and , a little while after that , I had my commercial rating .
I trained mostly in aerobatics , because I wanted to fly the P - 51 .
I was doing rolls , loops , all kinds of aerobatic maneuvers .
My first airplane was called a Pitts , and then I flew a Marchetti .
That 's a third - world air force trainer they use in the Navy 's TOPGUN schools for air - to - air combat .
This was all in preparation to fly the Warbird , the P - 51 .
I searched all over the world for my P - 51 and found it in 2000 .
It 's called " Kiss Me Kate " , which covers two things I love most , my wife and movies .
[ on Tony Scott ]
He was a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable .
[ on preparing for Rock of Ages ( 2012 ) ]
I spent months studying the history of rock ' n ' roll for my role as Stacee Jaxx and Queen and Freddie Mercury were a big part of that .
[ on this intense passion for his work ] I love what I do .
I take great pride in what I do .
And I can't do something halfway , three - quarters , nine - tenths .
If I 'm going to do something , I go all the way .
[ on what he likes about London , England ]
I love the fish and chips , the crews are fantastic , it 's such a beautiful city , and the people are so easy and cool .
I like a good curry , I like it hot , and you have great Indian food here also .
I like it very spicy .
If I 'm not sweating I do n't feel like I have had good Indian food .
[ on Ireland and his part Irish ancestry ] I 'm very proud to be Irish .
There 's a pride in America of being Irish .
I can't wait to come back and I want to visit the land of my ancestors and the castle that they had .
In 1988 , Tom himself was quoted saying : " I have always been pretty much the same weight , 147 pounds - at 5 feet 9 inches . " .
[ People magazine - July 5 , 2010 ]
My first celebrity crush was Ingrid Bergman in Berüchtigt ( 1946 ) .
[ on Eyes Wide Shut ( 1999 ) ]
I did n't like playing Dr Bill .
I did n't like him .
It was unpleasant .
But I would have absolutely kicked myself if I had n't done this .
Action is action , but if it does n't have story and character it 's not involving .
[ on Edge of Tomorrow - Live . Die. Repeat ( 2014 ) ]
I hope you enjoyed it .
I can't wait for you to see the film .
I think you 're gonna love it .
So thank you very much for coming on this adventure with us .
[ on Edge of Tomorrow - Live . Die. Repeat ( 2014 ) ]
It 's a very ambitious movie , it takes you on a journey and its enormously entertaining .
Flying is something that has always been a lifelong passion .
As a kid I used to have a photo of a Spitfire and a photo of a P - 51 .
I 'd put them up on the wall right where my bed was so that I could stare at them , because I just wanted to fly .
So , have you met an SP ?

President Barack Obama is set to deliver the worst fiscal news since the Great Depression .
Obama : Deficit is big , my plan is bigger
Last week , America ran up the credit card .
This week , the statement arrives .
President Barack Obama is set to deliver the worst fiscal news since the Great Depression .
Advertisement
On Monday , he ’ll outline a deficit of $ 1.3 trillion , the largest as a share of the nation ’s economy since World War II .
He ’ll blame years of runaway budgets , two costly wars , exploding health care costs – and even the massive stimulus package he signed last week , accounting for fully one - quarter of it .
Then he ’ll try to convince Americans that he knows how to fix it , with a pledge to slice the deficit in half in four years .
It ’s easily the trickiest public relations challenge of his young presidency – balancing sober , but optimistic talk about the government ’s dismal financial state , on a timeline not of his making .
Also , there could be a crushing cost to failure , with stocks already tanking , consumer confidence scraping bottom and unemployment rising .
“ The budget news is very bad in the short , and the long run , ” said Alice Rivlin , Bill Clinton ’s budget director .
Obama ’s team has settled on a three - part plan to deliver the bad news to America , aides and experts say .
First , they will begin the week with a “ fiscal summit ” Monday designed to stress that the president cares about the deficit and plans to reduce it , by raising taxes on the wealthy , drawing down in Iraq and reining in Medicare and other entitlement costs .
Second , the president will explain the widening gap in an address to Congress Tuesday in positive , hopeful terms .
He ’ll say a brief bulge in government spending is needed to stimulate the economy , and to reform health care , education , and energy policy – key campaign promises that he ’ll flesh out as he releases his first budget outline on Thursday .
And third , the current White House will take advantage of a ripe but waning opportunity : to blame it all on President George W. Bush .
Blaming Bush is perhaps the easiest move in the budget dance , though aides say it wo n’t be put too sharply .
It also dovetails nicely with an Obama campaign promise to engage in more transparent budgeting .
The budget will be “ honest in its assessments , ” Obama said Saturday .
The president will , aides say , write the estimated cost of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan into the budget , and set aside millions for natural disasters – moves his predecessor resisted .
In that way , he ’ll turn Bush budgeting on its head – crafting a budget whose imperative is to reflect the worst case scenario , not the best , and most of which is inarguably Obama ’s inheritance from his predecessor .
“ We ’re inheriting quite a fiscal mess , ” Obama budget director Peter Orszag told POLITICO .
The main focus next week , however , will be on trying to get the public to see past the grim present toward a more hopeful future .
In his short time in office , Obama already has pitched two massive bailout efforts – for Wall Street and struggling homeowners – and now must ask for a little more public patience as he grapples with the federal budget .
But it ’s slow going .
Monday ’s fiscal summit will be unique in the history of such events , for instance , in at least one respect : it is n’t expected actually to produce anything .
“ ‘ Deficit reduction ’ is only on the table at this meeting to the extent that the president wants to get the discussion started , ” budget watcher Stan Collender wrote Saturday , noting that few economists see cutting the deficit as an appropriate policy amid the current economic crisis .
“ [ G]etting the deficit reduction discussion started a year or so before a decision is needed by itself will be a major achievement whose importance should not be minimized . ”
Indeed , even the phrase “ fiscal responsibility ” has been sharply redefined .
“ It has to be fiscal responsibility in context , ” said Robert Bixby , the executive director of the Concord Coalition , which has long pushed for balanced budgets .
“ Obviously in the immediate future with the economy the way it is and the banking system the way it is and the housing situation the way it is , it ’s not a time to worry about balancing the budget – and I say that as a confirmed deficit hawk . ”
Obama ’s aides now talk about “ bending the curve ” – that is , changing the rate of increase of the deficit – rather than balancing the budget .
The plan released this week will “ seek to restore the nation to a sustainable fiscal trajectory over of five - to - ten year window , ” Orszag said .
Obama ’s pledge is to reduce the budget by 2013 to a mere $ 533 billion , a figure that previously would have been thought of as staggering .
If the fiscal summit will seek to cast record spending in the terms of responsibility , Obama ’s address Tuesday is expected to include more positive talk about the future .
In contrast to last week ’s promises that stimulus measures would not be converted into permanent budget lines , Obama will now turn to the substantive promises of his first budget .
Obama ’s aides say the president ’s ambitious healthcare agenda remains very much on the table , and that cuts and incentives inserted in Medicare and Medicaid spending could be a first step .
The budget – and Obama ’s pledge to budget based on actual policy plans – could also force the president to “ show his hand ” on other policy areas , said Douglas Holtz - Eakin , John McCain ’s campaign policy director and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office .
Energy policy is expected to be prominent in Obama ’s budget , for instance , and the budget is likely to reflect any planned revenues from plans to impose a cap - and - trade system for greenhouse gas emissions .
There are other political bombs buried in the budget .
It will also mark Obama ’s first income tax increase , as he follows through on campaign plans to allow income tax cuts on the wealthy signed by Bush to expire in 2011 .
It will also put into hard numbers his promise to withdraw from Iraq , in the form of declining spending there .
Skeptics on both sides say Obama may regret elements of his ambitious first budget .
For one , it will signal which , if any , items in the stimulus package will continue beyond its two - year timetable .
“ The pressure ’s on to show clearly defined exit strategy [ from the stimulus ] , ” said Holtz - Eakin .
“ That ’s what this budget will have to show . ”
Some liberal economists , meanwhile , say Obama ’s continued focus on deficits sets the president up for a fall .
“ A trillion is not a ‘ bleak ’ number , per se .
It 's just a number .
We might need two trillion , ” said the University of Texas ’s James Galbraith in an email .
“ Deficits have to grow .
They will grow .
Please get used to it . ”

As climate change progresses it is likely to have dramatic affects on the supply of water .
In some areas it may increase , for example at higher latitudes , but water - stressed areas in the mid-latitudes are expected to face a reduction in available water .
The projections of per-capita water availability in the maps above were made by Martina Floerke and colleagues at the University of Kassel in Germany , by combining different types of forecast .
A computer model of climate change developed by the UK Met Office Hadley Centre generates projections of future temperature and rainfall .
The Kassel team applied Hadley projections on a finer geographical scale .
These projections were fed into a programme that models water flow in river basins .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) produces " scenarios " suggesting how society may develop economically and socially over time .
The Kassel researchers used these scenarios to project water use by various sectors of the economy .
( This particular analysis used a scenario where economic growth and technological change are " uneven " , and population growth " high " . )
Having forecast the availability of water and the demand from industry , it was then possible to calculate how much water would be available per person at different points in the future .
These are projections , not predictions , and none of the models used is likely to be completely accurate .
The projections were adapted from a paper that originally appeared in the journal Hydrological Sciences in 2007 .

In this video , economist Milton Friedman explains his position on why drugs should be legalized , how drug laws created the market for crack cocaine ( " the stronger the drug laws , the stronger the drugs " ) and why the government 's drug laws result in 10,000 additional deaths per year .
Bottom Line : Contrary to the position of the University of Chicago faculty that Milton Friedman was a right - wing , conservative economist , this video clearly demonstrates that Milton Friedman was a libertarian , and not a conservative .
Friedman 's advocacy of drug legalization would immediately disqualify him as a Republican and / or a conservative , and would demonstrate that on at least this topic , Friedman was actually radically left - wing .
Would the anti-Friedman faculty at the University of Chicago agree with Friedman that drugs should be legal ( in which case they should drop their objections to the " conservative " Friedman Center ) , or would they align themselves with the right - wing , conservative Republicans in the " War on Drugs " ( in which case they are conservatives themselves ) ?
Seems like a no - win outcome for them ?
An Israeli policeman wearing a hard helmet is shown headbutting a Palestinian woman in a video released by a human rights group today .
The short film was recorded by the Israeli group B'Tselem during a protest against the demolition of Palestinian homes .
The Jerusalem municipality destroyed two houses because , it said , they had been built without permission .
The pictures , taken on November 5 but not released until today , show the actions of one policeman whose reinforced visor is pushed back above his helmet .
At one point he grasps the hands of a Palestinian woman and slams against the top of her head with his protective headgear .
She reels back , clutching her head .
Other residents object , and the policeman is seen grabbing the wrists of a Palestinian man and headbutting him as well .
According to an Israeli police spokesperson , the family living in the house that was destroyed refused to leave the building , and local residents threw stones and firebombs at officers .
" [ On ] the day , severe riots took place in Silwan , " Micky Rosenfeld , a police spokesman , told Reuters .
" As a result five policemen were wounded and evacuated to hospital , 11 locals were arrested for assaulting policemen and throwing firebombs and six police vehicles were damaged .
This event was exceptional and is now being examined by an external police investigation unit . "
Police were said by B'Tselem to have used stun grenades to break up the crowds .
Witnesses later claimed police fired live ammunition in the air .
Silwan is in Arab East Jerusalem , an area annexed by Israel in 1967 .
Palestinians want the eastern part of the city to be the capital of a future Palestinian state .
B'Tselem monitors human rights violations in the Israeli - occupied West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem .
In July , B'Tselem activists filmed two Israeli soldiers shooting a bound Palestinian with a rubber bullet .
They were later charged by the army .
B'Tselem in Hebrew literally means " in the image of " , but the group says it is also used as a term meaning human dignity .
The French attempt to pass the world 's toughest " graduated response " law against P2P file - sharers has been en retard for months .
But the negotiations are finally over , the " Cr�ation et Internet " bill has been drafted , and today it finally came up before the National Assembly for debate .
Despite furious opposition , the bill could well pass soon , laying down severe penalties for " not securing one 's Internet connection " and forcing public WiFi operators to allow access only to a " white list " of acceptable sites .
And all this for one industry .
Libert� , �galit� , fraternit� ...
HADOPI ?
The French law goes by many names .
Officially called " Cr�ation et Internet , " it is also known as the " Loi Olivennes " after Denis Olivennes , the head of French electronics giant FNAC .
Olivennes headed the group that came up with the plan , which will be implemented by a new group called HADOPI — which is why the bill is also known as HADOPI .
But whatever one calls it , the principles remain the same .
When ISPs are notified about alleged file - sharing , they first send an e-mail to the customer involved .
The second time , the customer gets a registered letter .
The third time , the customer gets booted off the ' Net for three months to a year .
( A HADOPI blacklist will apparently keep blocked users from simply switching ISPs . )
In return , French DVDs will appear a couple of months closer to their theatrical release date and music and movie groups will have to drop much of their DRM .
Global music trade group IFPI thinks this is a wonderful trade - off .
CEO John Kennedy , last seen testifying at The Pirate Bay trial in Sweden , said today that " our future , like that of the film industry and other media depends on whether we can sustain a legitimate business in an environment that has been swamped by unauthorised free music .
Over the last two years the French government has led the way in addressing this critical challenge .
It has recognised that involving ISPs in addressing the massive flow of infringing content on their networks is not only essential to protect the rights of creators and producers , but can provide a sensible and proportionate solution that will work effectively in practice . "
Critics are n't convinced .
Those critics include the European Parliament , which last year twice expressed its displeasure with such schemes on the ground that the punishment was grossly disproportionate to the crime and that only judges should be allowed to order such disconnections .
That has not dissuaded the Sarkozy government , which has continued to push the idea hard .
The toughest in tout le monde
It would n't be too much to say that the world is watching .
Although Agence - France Presse said today in an article that " the new law would make France the fourth country , after the United States , Ireland and Italy , to cut off web access for illegal downloaders , " the reality is that no countries currently have such a national policy in place .
In the US , only " discussions " have been announced , and those are voluntary ; in Ireland , a single ISP has voluntarily agreed to adopt graduated response principles ; and Italy 's parliament has simply agreed to follow the French model at some point in the future .
The UK , which is considering graduated response legislation , has already taken " Internet disconnection " off the table as a potential penalty .
New Zealand , which has actually passed a law requiring ISPs to boot repeat copyright infringers off the ' Net , has delayed implementation after a public outcry .
But even if the New Zealand law does go into effect before the French , the French law is much stricter .
For instance , " Cr�ation et Internet " requires home Internet users to install certain approved security software and to secure their networks .
The old " I had an open WiFi network and someone across the hall probably logged on and downloaded all those episodes of The Office " wo n't work ; while that may be what happened , the law tries to avoid such controversies by simply making each Internet subscriber responsible for what happens on their connection .
One obvious retort is that people will simply slip down the boulevard to the caf� for a cup of overpriced espresso , a waiter with bad case of ennui , and an afternoon of torrenting .
But the Law will not be mocked so easily .
When French Minister of Culture Christine Albanel answered some parliamentary questions about public WiFi networks , she said that the solution was simple : such hotspots would offer only a " white list " of approved websites .
This sort of " plug every hole in the dike , the consequences be damned ! " strategy shows just how far the government is willing to go in order to protect the copyright industries ; not even rank censorship is a bridge too far .
And the logic of this approach suggests that the current practice of scanning BitTorrent swarms for IP addresses will have to give way to deep packet inspection of Web content as users shift to streaming media , direct download links , and darknets .
" This return to a centralized , state - controlled network is as scary as inapplicable , " said J�r�mie Zimmermann , co-founder of La Quadrature du Net , a lobby group that works for an open Internet .
" Yet , this is emblematic of how a government legislates with the same ignorance and archaism as the entertainment industries that promote the ' graduated response . '
They are , like this law , doomed to fail . "
Consumer group UFC Que Choisir compared the entire project to France 's ill - fated Maginot Line , examples of World War I thinking that were famously bypassed early in World War II by blitzkrieging German panzer units .
Instead , UFC Que Choisir calls for new thinking — in this case , a license fee paid for total access to movies and music .
Such a solution is backed by some French artistic groups " et m�me ... par le groupe Warner aux Etats - Unis " ( an apparent reference to Warner 's Choruss project ) .
The implication is clear : even the music labels can see the future , and this law is straight out of the past .
True or not , however , the bill appears to have a good chance of passing into law , and the European Commission has so far ( under French pressure ) resisted the European Parliament 's efforts to block France from implementing it .
Pakistan announced that it has arrested 71 members of Lashkar - e - Taiba and detained 124 more in an effort to crack down on the Islamic militant group believed to be responsible for November 's attacks on the Indian city of Mumba .
India 's foreign minister insisted that Pakistan must extradite the suspects for trial in India , backing down from his earlier statement that India might accept a trial in Pakistan .
The Associated Press reports that the arrests come as part of Pakistan 's investigation into the attacks , which left 164 people dead and heightened tensions between the neighboring nuclear powers .
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 .
Pakistan insisted it would help India to bring those behind the Mumbai terrorist attacks to justice , saying Thursday it had shut down extremist Web sites and suspected militant training camps , and detained 71 people in a deepening probe .
Still , a top Pakistani official said authorities needed to further investigate information about the attacks provided by archrival India before it could be used to prosecute suspects in court .
Days after the November attacks , the U.N. Security Council declared that Jamaat - ud - Dawa , a charity in Pakistan , was merely a front for the outlawed militant organization .
Pakistan announced that Lashkar - e - Taiba founder Hafiz Mohammed Saeed and its " operations commander " Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi were among those detained by Islamabad , according to English - language newspaper Dawn in Pakistan .
" We have arrested a total of 124 mid-level and top leaders of JuD in response to a UN resolution — 69 from Punjab , 21 from Sindh , eight from Balochistan and 25 from the NWFP — blocked six websites associated with the organisation and closed down its five relief camps , " the adviser said .
He said 20 offices , 87 schools , two libraries , seven seminaries and a handful of other organisations and websites linked to Jamaatud Dawa had also been shut .
Dawn adds that although Mr. Malik did not comment on legal action against any of those arrested or detained , sources told the paper that Pakistan is considering bringing at least three of Lashkar - e - Taiba 's leaders to trial .
After Islamabad 's announcement , Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee retreated from his earlier indication that India would accept a Pakistani trial for the suspected Mumbai attackers , reports Reuters .
" We have never given up the demand that the perpetrators of the terror act should be handed over to India , " Mukherjee said .
" There is no question of that [ giving up the extradition demand ] or climb down . "
The minister was reported to have said this week in an interview with the India Today media group that those accused in the Mumbai attacks could be tried and punished in Pakistan , a comment Indian newspapers interpreted as a climbdown in New Delhi 's demand for extradition of militants .
Mukherjee 's India Today interview came after Britain 's Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the Pakistani state was not linked to the Mumbai attacks and he showed no support for India 's demand for extradition of the accused .
The BBC notes that Mr. Miliband is currently visiting Pakistan in an effort to ease tensions between the two nations .
He said Thursday there is no evidence that the Pakistani government was involved in the Mumbai attacks , and he has not supported Indian demands for extradition of the suspects .
The US is working to increase the cooperation between India and Pakistan , indicates The Wall Street Journal .
The Journal writes that the CIA has been serving as a go - between for the two countries in order to better resolve the consequences of the Mumbai attacks .
A senior Pakistani official said significant progress has been made in the investigation of the attacks .
A report on Pakistan 's findings was sent to India through the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency last week , the official said .
New Delhi and Islamabad have mainly been communicating through the CIA , the official said .
The chief of Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence agency , Lt. Gen. Shuja Ahmed Pasha , met with a top CIA official this month in connection with Pakistan 's investigation , the official said .
CIA Director Michael Hayden on Thursday confirmed the CIA 's efforts .
" We 've had some success in that regard , " he said .
" We 've had a long , and frankly in many ways very profitable , relationship with ISI , and we 've tried to use our friendship with the service to help this move in the right direction . "
The " right " direction is what is in the U.S. government 's interest , he said , describing that as : " Who did this ?
Why ?
Do n't let it happen again .
And bring justice to those who have done it . "
But despite Pakistan 's announcement of the crackdown , India remains skeptical , reports the Los Angeles Times .
" This is what Pakistan 's done for a long time , " said Suba Chandran , assistant director of New Delhi's Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies .
" The arrests are always challenged in the court of law of Pakistan and they 're released in a week or 10 days .
And most of the schools are asked to close , then reopen in a day or two . "
The Times also noted the Indian press 's dubiousness , writing that during the broadcast of Malik 's comments on CNN - IBN , the Indian news channel ran a caption declaring " Pakistan Double Talk Again . "
Nor was the Indian media any softer on its own government 's initial response .
Mr. Mukherjee ignited a firestorm of criticism when he indicated India 's acceptance of trying the Mumbai suspects in Pakistan .
IBN Live declared that New Delhi " gave in . "
The Statesman described New Delhi 's decision as " capitulation . "
The Economic Times was slightly kinder , saying that the New Delhi was " settling " for a Pakistani trial , but still criticized the decision as " yet another instance of ' one step forward , two steps backward ' approach " of the government .
The Economic Times continued , citing experts who criticized the government for putting British and American policy interests above India 's own .
Analysts criticized the government for failing to take even the most elementary of steps to send a strong message to Pakistan .
Brahma Chellaney , professor of strategic studies with the Centre for Policy Research , accused the government of outsourcing its Pakistan policy .
" It 's obvious we have outsourced our Pakistan policy .
the only thing we are doing is engaging in a war of words , " he said .
He further pointed out that the government is yet to take the smallest of diplomatic steps like cutting cultural or sporting ties .
" With one eye on the elections , the government appears tough without actually being tough , " he added .
" Seven weeks have passed since Mumbai and we have nothing to show for it . "
Another analyst Bharat Karnad pointed out that with the passage of time , India 's options are dwindling .
" Once you leave it to a third country , you have lost the initiative , " he said .
He pointed out that the US and UK would follow their own national interest .
" They are not going to let the Pakistan state go down .
No matter what , " he said .
A female hitchhiker has been killed in a traffic crash just moments after robbing a motorist in Perth .
Police say the woman was hitchhiking on Tonkin Highway last night when a woman stopped to give her a ride .
The hitchhiker threatened the woman with a pair of scissors before stealing her handbag .
However , as the hitchhiker attempted to escape by running across the highway she was hit by a car and died at the scene .
Yet Vilsack spoke on January 30 , 2009 of " investing in programs that alleviate hunger and suffering overseas and support long - term agriculture development . "
Kissinger said control food , control people .
Hillary Clinton is Secretary of State .
Monsanto is taking over food supplies around the world , using our government to do so .
This is more than " agriculture " - this is Monsanto as US foreign policy .
I began this article with material on what Clinton had done through a corrupt connection to Monsanto , forcing genetic engineering on the world against its will and even knowledge and impacting health and democratic control over food .
Domestically , Hillary Clinton , closely connected to Monsanto , remained silent about the risks of genetic engineering , its undemocratic non-labeling and its strong links to increased risk of cancers and diabetes .
As Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton needs to get away from power and see the real people whose lives have been destroyed by Monsanto .
Sneeds to go to India and spend time with the widows and children and see what happened because Bill opened India to Monsanto .
She needs to go to Africa and hear farmers angry that the US and their own corrupt governments are forcing Monsanto 's GMOs and patents on them even though a huge UN studied proved organic farming can feed Africa easily and bring democratic and health benefits .
www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/organic-farming-could-feed-africa-968641.html
And most of all , since Hillary Clinton needs to go to Iraq and see that farmers and all future generations of Iraqis were robbed of thousands of years of their biologic inheritance by the US , working for Monsanto .
The American people were " sold " the Iraqi war with lies .
They were told it was to help innocent people being crushed by tyranny and they wanted to help .
Instead , Americans must now carry the moral burden of inflicting on Iraqis one of the most severe totalitarian controls ever devised in human history .
Monsanto is considered the most evil corporation on the face of the earth .
articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/07/08/tthe-most-evil-company-on-the-planet-monsanto.aspx?source=nl
Hillary Clinton needs to redeem herself and Bill for what he did and she remained silent about , for Monsanto 's benefit , and at the expense of all human beings .
Hilary Clinton 's first act as Secretary of State , must be a redemptive act - for herself , for the United States Government , and for badly misled American who only wanted to offer freedom - the removal of the sadistic and fully fascist seed laws in Iraq .
Hillary Clinton must order that the genetic inheritance of Iraq stolen by Monsanto and the US be returned in full and that Iraqi farmers ' freedom ( something Sadam Hussein never took from them ) be restored in whole so the Iraqis can exist and survive as free people , not as what the US and Monsanto have been reduced them to by stealing their seeds - dependent , easily starved slaves .
Vilsack spoke on January 30 , 2009 of " investing in programs that alleviate hunger and suffering overseas and support long - term agriculture development . "
It is time to see past symbolic shows of " the White House farmer " or empty compassionate words , to the immense threat coming at all of us through Monsanto influence over the USDA and the FDA .
Our food supply and those of other countries are being taken over - in Africa as " charity , " in India as " knowing better how to farm , " in Iraq with all pretense put aside .
Here , Monsanto and other corporations use " food safety " or " public health " or " food security . "
But away from the show , they have written massively controlling and destructive regulations , www.opednews.com/articles/FOOD-SAFETY-REGULATIONS--by-Linn-Cohen-Cole-090108-947.html are planning to gain more power through a centralization of already corrupted food agencies , and have orchestrated Homeland Security regulations to be handy for military force , warrantless , seizures and destruction of non-corporate farmers ' animals and crops , using " diseases " or " bioterrorism " as the excuse .
Hillary Clinton has a profound moral obligation to make up for what happened when she and Bill were at the White House .
Acting as Secretary of State she must restoring stolen seeds to the Iraqi people 's full and unlimited control - thus restoring democracy we took and which human ownership of seeds depends upon .
Millions of people around the world marched to try to stop Bush 's war in Iraq .
Bush did not listen .
After the catastrophe that has happened there , the world must now ensure the United States stand up for the freedom it promised .
We would all applaud Hillary Clinton 's moral courage in making her first act as Secretary of State the full restoration to Iraqis of what is theirs by birthright - the most basic of democratic freedoms and most profound of human rights for all people - the right to own their own seeds and control their own food supply .
This would not be " a show of freedom , " with an entire nation stripped of survival necessities and left with servitude to Monsanto and US control as the reality .
It would be democratic freedom at its most fundamental , what US citizens believe in and so many have died to bring to Iraq .
This much we owe Iraq , morally .
For the Iraqi people and the restoration of their most profound human right to survive , people around the world would march again .
It is where we must begin .
A great Secretary of State , working on behalf of a great President , must end the " show " of democracy in Iraq and deliver back to them what is essential for a true one .
Predictably last week , when the 32,000 ton French aircraft carrier Clemenceau was towed into a breakers ' yard on Tees - side to be dismantled , headlines reported that this was arousing angry protests from â environmentalists ' .
A BBC news item led on an interview with one such â environmentalist ' complaining that Able UK , the firm responsible for the largest ship - breaking contract in Europe , had â no experience ' , did n't have a dry dock and was preparing to strip down this huge ship , carrying hundreds of tons of deadly asbestos , in the middle of an internationally - recognised nature reserve , Had the BBC done a little more homework it might have hesitated before leading its report on such a travesty of the facts .
Far from being inexperienced , Able has since 1986 built up its reputation as the most expert dismantler of ships , oil rigs and power stations in the world .
Far from not having a dry dock , it has the largest there is .
And exhaustive studies have shown that , like the Hartlepool power station next door , it co-habits perfectly happily with the waders in the Ramsar - accredited nature reserve across the water .
Many people lack the need to hire a personal lawyer .
People assume they do n’t require them in everyday life and thus stay without one , only to be shocked when taken to court and need a lawyer to represent them .
This last - minute rush costs them a lot since it ’s also a process to hire one .
With a personal lawyer you will get an attorney mailing list to stay updated .
Below are some of the reasons as to why one requires a personal lawyer to overcome life inconveniences :
Represent , Defend and Protect the Family from Law Abuse
In this case , a lawyer is needed in divorce matters and how property will be shared among the spouses .
They also determine who is responsible for staying with the kids and how they will receive support .
Helps in solving issue involving guardianship , where one is assigned legally to take responsibilities of a child who is not theirs .
However , this does not deny the birth parents to claim ownership of their child .
Help With Legal Aspect of Business
Here , a personal lawyer helps one in business formation ; they help form a business entity and take it through the right process of taxation , its growth , and ownership .
Help determine the level of your business as either a corporation or a limited company .
Educates on how to establish contracts and explain to you what it entails .
Provide knowledge where there is a need to merge one business with another .
Useful in Will Writing
When investing your money in either building estates and venturing in business , one needs to be assured that their property will be safe even in their absence .
A lawyer assists one in coming up with a will on how your wealth will be shared among the family members .
It allows proper and safe division of property among the members without the need to go to court .
Helps One Stay on the Right Side of the Law .
Lawyers understand all that the law requires .
They act as a reminder to an individual to always do the right thing .
But if a case is filed against you , your lawyer takes charge .
They are knowledgeable in the law and can challenge the evidence until one is proven guilty and can negotiate and bargain on the bills passed until a fair one is reached .
In summary , it evident that there is a need to have a personal lawyer regardless of the amount required to pay them .
Hence saves you a lot by being guided in making decisions and in understanding the law .
For the last two decades , human cognitive superiority had a distinctive sound : the soft click of stones placed on a wooden Go board .
But once again , artificial intelligence is asserting its domination over gray matter .
Just a few years ago , the best
Go programs were routinely beaten by skilled children , even when given a head start .
Artificial intelligence researchers routinely said that computers capable of beating our best were literally unthinkable .
And so it was .
Until now .
In February , at the Taiwan Open —
Go‘s popularity in East Asia roughly compares to America ’s enthusiasm for golf — a program called MoGo beat two professionals .
At an exhibition in Chicago , the Many Faces program beat another pro .
The programs still had a head start , but the trend is clear .
“ It ’s a silly human conceit that such a domain would exist , that there ’s something only we can figure out with our wetware brains , ” said David Doshay , a University of California at Santa Cruz computer scientist .
“ Because at the same time , another set of humans is just as busily saying , ‘ Yes , but we can knock this problem into another domain , and solve it using these machines . ' ”
Arrayed by opposing players trying to capture space on its lined 19×19 grid , the black and white Go stones can end a game in 10171 possible ways — about 1081 times more configurations than there are elementary particles in the known universe .
Faced with such extraordinary complexity , our brains somehow find a path , navigating the possibilities using mechanisms only dimly understood by science .
Both of the programs that have recently defeated humans used variations on mathematical techniques originally developed by Manhattan Project physicists to coax order from pure randomness .
Called the Monte Carlo method , it has driven computer programs to defeat ranking human players six times in the last year .
That ’s a far cry from chess , the previous benchmark of human cognitive prowess , in which Deep Blue played Garry Kasparov to a panicked defeat in 1997 , and Deep Fritz trounced Vladimir Kramnik in 2006 .
To continue the golf analogy , computer Go programs beat the equivalents of Chris Couch rather than Tiger Woods , and had a multi- stroke handicap .
But even six victories was inconceivable not too long ago , and programmers say it wo n’t be long before computer domination is complete .
There is , however , an asterisk to the programs ’ triumphs .
Compared to the probabilistic foresight of our own efficiently configured biological processor — sporting 1015 neural connections , capable of 1016 calculations per second , times two — computer Go programs are inelegant .
They rely on what Deep Blue designer Feng - Hsiung Hsu called the “ substitution of search for judgment . ”
They crunch numbers .
“ People hoped that if we had a strong Go program , it would teach us how our minds work .
But that ’s not the case , ” said Bob Hearn , a Dartmouth College artificial intelligence programmer .
“ We just threw brute force at a program we thought required intellect . ”
If only we knew what our own brains were doing .
Inasmuch as human
Go prowess is understood , it ’s explained in terms of pattern recognition and intuition .
“ When there are groups of stones arranged in certain ways , you can build visual analogies that work very well .
You can think , ‘ This configuration radiates influence to that part of the board ’ — and it turns out it ’s a useful concept , ” said Hearn .
“ The revolutionary people in the field have an intuitive sense , and can look at things completely differently from other people . ”
Image - based neuroscience supports this explanation , albeit vaguely .
When University of Minnesota researchers led by cognitive scientist Michael Atherton scanned the brains of people playing chess and compared them to Go-playing brains , they found heightened activation in the Go players ’ parietal lobes , a region responsible for processing spatial relationships .
But these observations , said Atherton , were rudimentary .
“ The higher - level stuff , we did n’t figure out , ” he said .
In a more recent brain - scanning study , Japanese researchers compared professional and amateur
Go players as they contemplated opening - and end - stage moves .
Both displayed parietal lobe activity .
During the end stages , however , professionals had extremely high activity in their precuneus and cerebellum regions , where the brain integrates a sense of space with our bodies and motions .
Put another way , professionals fuse their consciousness into the decision tree of the game .
Go players have an ability “ to think creatively and prune the search tree in an aesthetic sense , ” said Atherton .
“ They have a feel for the game . ”
Artificial intelligence researchers historically tried to harness this pattern - based approach , however poorly understood , to their Go programs .
It was n’t easy .
“ When I ’ve talked to Go professionals about how they come to their decisions , it ’s been difficult for them to describe why a move is right , ” said Doshay at UCSC , who designed a Go computer program called SlugGo .
“ Go is a game of living things , and you talk about it that way , as if the patterns might be alive . ”
But if turning cryptic statements from
Go masters into working algorithms for determining the statistical health of game patterns was impossible , there did n’t seem to be any other way of doing it .
“ It was possible to sidestep the cognitive issues by throwing brute force at chess , ” said Hearn , “ but not at Go . ”
Compared to the challenge posed to a Go program , Deep Blue ’s computations — possible moves in response to a move , carried 12 cycles into the future — are back - of - the - napkin scribblings .
“ If you look at the game trees , there ’s about 30 possible moves you can make from a typical position .
In Go , it ’s about 300 .
Right away , you get exponential scaling , ” said Hearn .
With every anticipated move , the possibilities continue to scale exponentially — and unlike chess , where captured pieces are counted immediately , Go territory can switch hands until the game ’s end .
Running a few branches down the tree is useless : take one step , and it needs to be pursued , exponential scale by scale , until the game end .
According to Doshay , the number of Go‘s end - states — 10171 — is almost inconceivably smaller than the 101100 different ways of getting there .
Without patterns to eliminate whole swaths of choices from the outset , computers simply can’t cope with it , at least not within time frames contained by the universe ’s remaining existence .
But to Doshay , guiding computers with human - rules patterns was wrong from the beginning .
“ If you want computers to do something well , you concentrate on the ways computers do things well , ” he said .
“ Computers can generate enormous quantities of random numbers very rapidly . ”
Enter the Monte Carlo method , named by its Manhattan Project pioneers for the casinos where they gambled .
It consists of random simulations repeated again and again until patterns and probabilities emerge : the characteristics of an atomic bomb explosion , phase states in quantum fields , the outcome of a Go game .
Programs like MoGO and Many Faces simulate random games from start to finish , over and over and over again , with no concern for figuring out which of any given move is best .
“ At first , I was dismissive , ” said Hearn .
“ I did n’t think there was anything to be gained from random playouts . ”
But the programmers had one extra trick : they crunched the accumulated statistics , too .
Once a few million random games are modeled , probabilities take form .
Thus informed , the programs devote extra processing power to promising branches , and less power to less - promising alternatives .
The resulting game style looks human , but aside from a few rough human heuristics , the patterns articulated by our intuitions are unnecessary .
“ The surprising , mysterious thing to me is that these algorithms work at all , ” said Hearn .
“ It ’s very puzzling . ”
Puzzling it might be , but the game is almost over .
Hearn and others say that , having started to beat human professionals , Monte Carlo - based programs will only get better .
They ’ll incorporate the results of earlier games to their heuristic arsenal , and within a few years — a couple decades at the most — be able to beat our best .
What is the larger significance of this ?
When computers finally triumphed at chess , the world was shocked .
To some , it seemed that human cognition was less special than before .
But to others , the competition is an illusion .
After all , behind every machine is the hand that made it .
“ There ’s a strong tendency in humans to have a conceit about how far we ’ve advanced , ” said Doshay .
“ But we ’ve only really started programming computers . ”

He ’s since expanded it to 72 CPUs running multiple Go modules .
One module , still under development , is patterned after his Go teacher .

NASDAQ - 100 Revenue per Employee
I was discussing Revenue per Employee with some colleagues this week and noticed a lack of published ratios on the web .
So I wrote a simple script to screen scrape revenue per employee data for the NASDAQ - 100 from Google Finance .
Note : I usually prefer Yahoo Finance because it is much more thorough , but I chose Google Finance for this application since it conveniently lists both revenue and employees on the page , making screen scraping easier .
Revenue per Employee is commonly used to compare productivity between companies in the same industry .
Revenue listed below is from each company ’s latest full fiscal year as of February 6 , 2009 .
Employee count comes from the latest quarter .
Note that revenue for non-US companies ( ADRs ) is not in USD .

By Kim Tong - hyungStaff ReporterComputer games publisher NCsoft built its reputation on action games featuring mythical creatures , aliens and other bizarre fantasy characters .
However , back in the real world , the company seems to have encountered an equally quirky foe in a patent troll .
The Korean gaming giant finds itself entangled in a patent dispute with U.S. - based Worlds.com , which filed a suit last week in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas .
Worlds.com , a developer of online technologies , claims to have invented a ``system and method for enabling users to interact in virtual space ' ' back in 1995 and was granted a patent for the concept in 2007 .
Critics argue that the patent , based on the loose concept of ``highly scalable architecture for a three - dimensional graphical , multi-user , interactive virtual world system , '' could theoretically put every 3D online application under legal threat .
There does n't seem to be a clear reason for Worlds.com to file its first complaint against NCsoft as opposed to other companies , and there is a possibility that the current suit is the first of many to come .
And if past court rulings are any indication , East Texas is not a place where non-American firms want to find themselves involved in patent disputes .
`` We have n't received the court papers yet and we have n't analyzed the patent , '' said an NCsoft spokesman , who declined to speak further on the subject .
A Seoul - based patent lawyer said Worlds.com is apparently a ``patent troll , '' or an opportunistic company that enforces its patents on those who infringe aggressively despite lacking the intention to manufacture and market the product .
`` Worlds.com is likely to be more interested in getting paid in a huge settlement than shutting down NCsoft 's games , '' he said .
`` This is certainly an annoying situation for NCsoft , because if Worlds.
com 's patent claims are true , most of the Korean company 's massively multiplayer online game ( MMO ) products would fall under the category .
The whole process would cost NCsoft time , money and effort , and the company is certainly an easier opponent than bigger players such as Blizzard Entertainment .
'' Ncsoft 's concern is that East Texan courts have a reputation for being weighted toward plaintiffs in patent disputes .
Earlier this year , Nintendo lost a $ 21 million patent suit to an East Texas company , Anascape , for violating a patent the plaintiff had on handheld devices , including controllers for Wii and GameCube .
In an interview with Virtual World News ( www.virtualworldnews.com), James Gatto , from U.S. law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP , pointed out that Texas may offer other advantages to Worlds.com .
``Being a foreign defendant in Texas is not a pleasant thing , '' he said .
`` The juries are , many would say , biased towards American plaintiffs and have a propensity to offer high damages .
Some defendants might view them as an unfriendly jury and it might make the defendant more likely to settle . '' NCsoft is one of the world 's biggest online game companies by revenue , thanks to the success of titles such as ``Lineage ' ' and ``Guild Wars . ''
Intelligent life could be thriving on 40,000 planets
Science ’s quest to discover life on Mars has so far failed to find even one little green man .
But not to worry .
Aliens could be alive and well on almost 40,000 other planets .
Researchers have calculated that up to 37,964 worlds in our galaxy are hospitable enough to be home to creatures at least as intelligent as ourselves .
This planet , located near the centre of the Milky Way about 20,000 light years from us , is just one of the 40,000 which could be harbouring intelligent life
Astrophysicist Duncan Forgan created a computer programme that collated all the data on the 330 or so planets known to man and worked out what proportion would have conditions suitable for life .
The estimate , which took into account factors such as temperature and availability of water and minerals , was then extrapolated across the Milky Way .
Three scenarios of how life could develop were also taken into account .
The first - that it is difficult for life to form but easy for it to evolve - concluded there are at least 361 planets harbouring intelligent life .
The second , which assumed that life is easily formed but struggles to develop further , came up with a total of 31,513 .
The third scenario , which assumes that life can be passed from planet to planet with the help of asteroids , saw the total rocket to almost 38,000 , the Journal of Astrobiology reports .
What is more , these lifeforms would not be mere amoeba wriggling on the end of a microscope but fully - fledged aliens , because the scientists ' definition of intelligent life is a species at least as advanced as humans .
Mr Forgan , who believes it will take 300 to 400 years for us to make contact with our far away neighbours , said : ' I believe the estimate of 361 intelligent civilisations to be the most accurate .
' These would certainly be the most Earth - like civilisations but the bigger figures are certainly possible .
We can't rule them out .
' Most of the other planets we have looked at are older than our own - so I would expect to see more advanced civilisations than ours existing .'

Though the clemency granted by George W. Bush to the criminal I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , for his part in illegally covering up the investigation into the unprecedented White House outing of a covert CIA asset , was reprehensible , Bush showed admirable restraint in his issuing of Presidential pardons on his way out the door .
There !
Never let it be said we could n't come up with something positive to say about his reign !
Took us eight years , but there ya go .
Even a broken clock is right at least once every eight years .
By way of underscoring his nearly once - in - a - lifetime apparently ( accidentally ? ) good judgment , it 's worth noting that many of Bush 's supporters ( such that there still are any ) are pissed off that he had n't issued a full pardon for Libby before leaving :
Weekly Standard , " Bush 's decision not to pardon Libby has angered many of the president 's strongest defenders .
One Libby sympathizer , a longtime defender of Bush , told friends she was ' disgusted ' by the president .
Another described Bush as ' dishonorable ' and a third suggested that refusing to pardon Libby was akin to leaving a soldier on the battlefield . "
According to conservative columnist and Cheney biographer Stephen F. Hayes , writing in the , " Bush 's decision not to pardon Libby has angered many of the president 's strongest defenders .
One Libby sympathizer , a longtime defender of Bush , told friends she was ' disgusted ' by the president .
Another described Bush as ' dishonorable ' and a third suggested that refusing to pardon Libby was akin to leaving a soldier on the battlefield . "
Hayes quotes Cheney himself as saying , " ... Obviously , I disagree with President Bush 's decision . "
Waytago , Decider !
You finally did something right !
News articles based on a survey indicating public opposition to Phorm 's web snooping and advertising system have been withdrawn after the firm made legal threats to their publishers .
The independent consumer watchdog Which ?
sent a press release to newspapers earlier this week entitled " Internet users say : Do n't sell my surfing habits " .
It detailed survey findings that UK internet users are opposed to plans by BT , TalkTalk and Virgin Media to monitor and profile their browsing in collaboration with Phorm .
The findings contradicted market research repeatedly cited , but not published , by Phorm that the majority of people want the more " relevant " web experience it claims its " Webwise " - branded technology will provide .
BT is much further along the route to rolling out the system than rival ISPs , having conducted two secret trials without customer consent in 2006 and 2007 , and a third trial with consent at the end of last year .
The Which ? survey was covered yesterday by the Press Association , Channel 4 News , The Telegraph , and The Daily Mail .
The press release , however , was swiftly followed by this statement :
Urgent withdrawal of press release from Which ? - Internet users say : do n't sell my surfing habits
Which ? has received further information and representations from Phorm about the proposed Webwise service , and it has agreed to withdraw the above press release , issued under embargo on 24 February 2008 , while we consider them .
Some of the information in the press release and related article is said to be inaccurate and as a consequence may be defamatory .
You are strongly urged not to write an article based on the press release or the related article ' Online privacy matters ' in Which ?
magazine .
The Press Association , Channel 4 News and Telegraph stories have all been removed ( here , here and here ) .
The Daily Mail has edited its story online to remove all references to the negative survey findings .
A Which ?
spokeswoman declined to comment on what particularly in its press release had drawn Phorm 's legal attack .
Phorm said its libel lawyers , who it declined to identify , were working with Which ? to " correct " the press release .
In the past Phorm has employed Schillings , a well known media law firm offering " reputation management " services .
A Phorm spokesman said that the survey had been based on inaccurate information and that the press release itself contained inaccuracies .
" It repeatedly stated the Webwise system collects and sells on data which is misleading .
We also would n't allow the creation of advertising channels on sensitive subjects such as for medical products , " he said . ®
Background Humans hear frequencies from 20 Hz up to 20,000 Hz .
As we get older , or exposed to loud sounds which damage our ears ( such as loud concerts ) , the upper limit decreases .
This test helps you benchmark the highest boundary of your system 's frequency extension .
If you can't hear any of the high frequencies played back during this test , do n't blame your speakers too quickly .
Unlike low frequencies , high frequencies are easily reproduced through smaller ( and cheaper ) speakers .
Assuming your sound card is not prone to aliasing — please refer to the third section below — the weakest components in this test are your ears .
This extended high frequency audiometric test can be seen as an audiophile - grade hearing test , assessing the very last octaves of our hearing and the frequencies that we are supposed to hear when we are young and in good health .
Since regular audiograms produced by audiologists do not cover those frequencies , this test is highly valuable for us audio enthusiasts .
For a regular hearing test , use our Online Audiogram Hearing Test or the test available from hearingTest.online .
The Test File 22 kHz → 8 kHz Sweep
+ Voice Over A -9 dbFS sweeping sine tone , from 22 kHz ( supposedly inaudible ) down to 8 kHz ( if you can't hear this one , consider checking your hearing ) .
On the top of the test tone , a voiceover tells you which frequency is currently playing .
For this one , keep your computer 's audio levels down !
You do n't want to damage your hearing .
Use the voice - over as a reference .
Keep it quiet , and you will be safe .
Play back the file until you start hearing the underlying high pitch tone as it descends .
The voiceover tells you the frequency you have reached .
This frequency more or less represents the upper limit of your audio system , or your hearing .
Confirm your result with our High Frequency Audibility Blind Test .

Операционная система « Фанто м »
Проект « Фантом » — операционная система , созданная и развиваемая компанией Digital Zone .
ОС базируется на концепции персистентной виртуальной памяти .
Она ориентирована на управляемый ( managed ) код и нацелена на применение в носимых и встроенных компьютерах .
« Фантом » — одна из немноги х ОС , не опирающихся на классические концепции Unix - подобных систем .
В отличие от их концепции « все есть файл » , « Фантом » базируется на принципе « все есть объект » .
Для полноценного использования ресурсов компьютера ОС « Фантом » требуе т
64 - разрядного адресного пространства , но возможна работа и в 32 - разрядном .
Ключевая особенность ОС
Ключевая особенность ОС Фантом - персистентность .
Прикладной код « не видит » перезагрузок ОС и может « жить вечно » — отсюда отсутствие потребности в понятии « файл » — любая переменная или структура данных может храниться произвольное время и при этом быть доступна напрямую по указателю .
В отличие от гибернации в други х ОС , персистентность памяти заложена в основополагающих принципах построения ядра ОС Фантом , производится прозрачно для приложений , не требует доработки прикладног о ПО .
Персистентность сохраняется даже при аварийной остановке компьютера , ОС Фантом гарантированно восстанавливает состояние системы на момент последнего снимка памяти .
Главные преимущества модел и
Удешевление разработк и
Основное ноу-хау « Фантома » состоит в умении дешево создавать мгновенные снимки состояния системы , не останавливая ее и не внося серьезных изменений в работу .
Тонкость в том , что « фотографирование » должно запечатлеть всю систему на один момент времени — без исключений .
До сих пор считалось , что это требует паузы в работе всех программ .
Мы нашли способ распределить во времени создание такой « фотографии » , при этом оставив ее синхронной с точки зрения « внутренностей » системы .
Это дает несколько преимуществ .
Важнейшее из них — это существенное удешевление разработк и ПО .
Отказоустойчивость
« Фантом » базируется на простой модели программирования : ОС представляет собой персистентную объектную среду .
Это аналогичную тому , как если бы был запущен и гарантированно никогда не останавливался сервер приложений для объектного языка программирования .
При этом саму ОС можно останавливать и перезапускать , внезапно выключать компьютер – с точки зрения программы , это будут всего лишь паузы в работе .
А это значит , что система может обслуживать критичные процессы , которые требуют моментального включения при перебоях , например , в электропитании .
Высокая производительность
« Фантом » — система без переключений контекста между ядром и приложением .
Обычная система имеет два режима — « всемогущий » , в котором работает ядро , и « прикладной » , в котором работают приложения .
На этом основаны классические системы защиты в ОС типа Unix / Linux и Windows .
Переключения между режимами весьма дорогостоящие и снижают производительность прикладного ПО .
Особенно сильно это проявляется в серверных приложениях .
Защита в « Фантоме » построена по менее затратной технологии , и переключения режимов ( « колец защиты » ) не требуются .
Прикладное значение ОС
Операционная система « Фантом » имеет не только академическое , но и прикладное значение .
Она обеспечивает низкую стоимость разработки приложений и высокую надежность при эксплуатации .
Модель ОС гарантирует софту сохранение состояния и его восстановление при рестарте системы , а это означает , что после отказа питания компьютер , во - первых , очень быстро загрузится , а во-вторых , продолжит работу с момента последнего « снимка » .
Для критичных областей применения снимок можно делать достаточно часто .
Несколько примеров ситуаций , в которых это свойство весьма полезно :
банковские системы — отказ аппаратуры не приводит к длительным операциям по восстановлению базы данных , операторы продолжают прерванные сеансы с того же самого места ;
медицинское оборудование — краткий сбой в питании системы искусственного дыхания в случае традиционно й ОС требует двухминутного процесса перезагрузки и перезапуска программ , что может привести к смерти пациента ;
системы пожарной безопасности и сигнализации после отказа электропитания начинают длительный опрос датчиков и процедуру реинициализации , а « Фантом » позволяет обойтись без нее , и , кроме того , сохранить « знания » прикладной программы об актуальном состоянии системы .
Текущий статус проект а
Операционная система « Фантом » в настоящее время представляет собой полностью самостоятельную ( без использования какого - либо стороннего кода ) разработку .
Уровень готовности кода — proof of concept ( работоспособны й код , но стабильность и полнота недостаточны для промышленного использования ) .
Система « Фантом » — post Unix OS , концепции на которых она базируется рассматриваются как новый базис , более адекватный современному состоянию отрасли , нежели традиционные POSIX системы .
Тем не менее , для « Фантом » продуманы пути миграции в нее традиционного , наработанного под существующи е ОС программного обеспечени я

Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 20/2/2009 ( 4239 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
Opinion
They called themselves Chekists -- the sword and shield of the Soviet Union .
They were proud of what they were .
Some served as concentration camp guards .
Others were executioners .
Many were just clerks or cooks or those ordinary guys who mop up the mess after the torturers are done .
Over the years they had different names -- Cheka , OGPU , NKVD , SMERSH and , most notoriously , KGB .
Yet their job description did n't change .
They were killers .
They murdered whomever their masters wanted dead .
Their victims numbered in the many millions .
There were decades when they were more active , years when they were less so , but they were always there .
Some of their leaders were sadists , like Nikolai Yezhov , a bisexual dwarf who told Nikita Khrushchev during a Kremlin meeting that his shirtsleeves were speckled because he had spent the night torturing an " enemy of the people . "
Yezhov was later shot , at Stalin 's command .
In Yalta , chatting with President Roosevelt , Stalin described Lavrentii Beria , Yezhov 's successor , as " our Himmler . "
Beria was later executed on Khrushchev 's orders .
Those who live by the sword die by the sword is a sharp saying .
Unfortunately , it 's not always true .
Not only are some veterans of Stalin 's secret police alive , but they are in Canada .
One could be your neighbour .
Their presence among us is not news .
It has been known for years .
How many there are is not certain .
Probably not hundreds .
Yet even one is one too many .
Remarkably , they have n't been hiding .
A few have boasted publicly about what they did .
One wrote a book , obligingly including a photograph posing in his NKVD lieutenant 's uniform .
Another described her role in a SMERSH execution squad .
An intrepid journalist broke this story in a national Canadian newspaper in April 2005 .
Yet after that original exposé , all followup stories were spiked .
Even more intriguing is that the RCMP's war crimes unit , asked to investigate allegations about Communist collaborators in Canada , responded with the rather limp finding that they had insufficient evidence upon which to act .
That reply took more than three years to draft .
Apparently when a man admits he was in the NKVD and brags about the people he did in and provides his memoirs in English in a book available in libraries across the land , the Mounties do n't define that as proof of any wrongdoing .
Maybe they 're waiting for Hollywood to turn the manuscript into a movie .
After the Second World War , screening procedures were supposed to exclude Nazis and Communists from Canada , with no exceptions .
So if a man declares he was in the NKVD and broadcasts that fact from Toronto , either he is a liar or else he lied to get into Canada , probably disguising his own complicity in war crimes by pretending to be a victim .
The only other explanation for him being here is that Ottawa allowed such ruffians to immigrate .
In any case , we know some Communist killers are here .
Legally , they should n't be .
All of Stalin 's minions are now elderly .
Yet it 's not too late to see justice done .
They deserve no more mercy than they meted out .
And remember , they were not forced to serve -- they volunteered .
Since they have no right to be here , they should be expelled to whence they came .
They can then finish out their lives as burdens upon those they served .
I 'd bet they wo n't find Moscow or Minsk as comfortable as Montreal .
Canadians are a compassionate people .
Not only do we strive to do what 's right , we also honour the righteous .
We did in 1985 , when Canada conferred honourary citizenship on Raoul Wallenberg , the Swedish diplomat who saved Hungarian Jews during the Holocaust .
Yet it was not the Nazis who did him in .
SMERSH agents abducted Wallenberg in Budapest in January 1945 , then carted him off to the notorious Lubyanka prison .
Probably no one now here was directly involved , yet all who served Stalin in those days are complicit .
Whatever they did elsewhere indirectly made it possible for their comrades to kidnap and kill Wallenberg .
No one wants such scoundrels here .
You 'd think a Conservative government would get that .
Apparently they do n't .
They will .

MUSIC NEWS - The US District Court for the Central District of California has denied the motions of Senator John McCain and the Republican National Committee to stop the lawsuit filed by singer / songwriter Jackson Browne for the unauthorized use of Browne 's voice and song Running On Empty in a presidential campaign commercial !
A legal victory for Mr Browne , who filed his suit in August , 2008 for copyright infringement , false endorsement and violation of his right of publicity .
In a series of rulings on February 20 , 2009 , Judge Gary Klausner , rejected McCain's / RNC arguments that the First Amendment or copyright 's fair use doctrine allows their unauthorized use of Browne 's voice and song because the use occurred in a political campaign commercial .
Browne 's attorney , Lawrence Iser , said ; " The Court 's decision is a solid victory for songwriters and performers and reflects an affirmation of their intellectual property rights and their freedom from being conscripted as involuntary endorsers of political candidates and campaign messages .
We are happy that the Court recognized that persons and parties running for office are not entitled to violate an individual 's intellectual property and publicity rights simply because they are engaged in political campaigns .
We look forward to presenting Jackson Browne 's case to the jury . "
You can read the Court ’s Orders denying the RNC 's motions here , here , here and here .
We wonder if Ann & Nancy Wilson , HEART , will now consider action against McCain for his use of their music and classic rock hit , Barracuda ??
In other Jackson Browne news , he 's about to embark on a tour ; February thru May taking his music to Australia , NZ , the UK and Europe ( see itinerary below ) in support of his latest album , Time the Conqueror ( buy CD here ) .

Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime , unless you 're a conservative radio host .
Then it 's an illness and you need our prayers for your recovery .
The United States should get out of the United Nations , and our highest national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq .
Government should relax regulation of Big Business and Big Money but crack down on individuals who use marijuana to relieve the pain of illness .
" Standing Tall for America " means firing your workers and moving their jobs to India .
A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body , but multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation .
Jesus loves you , and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton .
The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans ' benefits and combat pay .
Group sex and drug use are degenerate sins unless you someday run for governor of California as a Republican .
If condoms are kept out of schools , adolescents wo n't have sex .
A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long - time allies , then demand their cooperation and money .
HMOs and insurance companies have the interest of the public at heart .
Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy .
Providing health care to all Americans is socialism .
Global warming and tobacco 's link to cancer are junk science , but creationism should be taught in schools .
Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him , a bad guy when Bush 's daddy made war on him , a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a " we ca n't find Bin Laden " diversion .
A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense .
A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy .
Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution , which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet .
The public has a right to know about Hillary 's cattle trades , but George Bush 's driving record is none of our business .
You support states ' rights , which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have a right to adopt .
What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest , but what Bush did in the ' 80s is irrelevant .
Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist , but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony .
Abolishing patent and copyright law sounds radical , but two economists at Washington University in St. Louis say it ’s an idea whose time has come .
Michele Boldrin and David K. Levine see innovation as a key to reviving the economy .
They believe the current patent / copyright system discourages and prevents inventions from entering the marketplace .
The two professors have published their views in a new book , Against Intellectual Monopoly , from Cambridge University Press .
8sC9e1gZxag
“ From a public policy view , we ’d ideally like to eliminate patent and copyright laws altogether , ” says Levine , John H. Biggs Distinguished Professor of Economics .
“ There ’s plenty of protection for inventors and plenty of protection and opportunities to make money for creators .
It ’s not that we see this as some sort of charitable act that people are going to invent and create things without earning money .
Evidence shows very strongly there are lots of ways to make money without patents and copyright . ”
Levine and Boldrin point to students being sued for ‘ pirating ’ music on the internet and AIDS patients in Africa dying because they cannot afford expensive drugs produced by patent holders as examples of the failure of the current system .
Boldrin , the Joseph Gibson Hoyt Distinguished Professor in Arts & Sciences and Chair of the economics department says , “ Intellectual property is in fact an intellectual monopoly that hinders rather than helps the competitive free market regime that has delivered wealth and innovation to our doorsteps . ”
The authors argue that license fees , regulations and patents are now so misused that they drive up the cost of creation and slow down the rate of diffusion of new ideas .
Levine explains , “ Most patents are not acquired by innovators hoping to protect their innovations from competitors in order to get a short term edge over the rest of the market .
Most patents are obtained by large corporations who have built portfolios of patents for defense purposes , to prevent other people from suing them over patent violations . ”
Boldrin and Levine promote a drastic reform of the patent system in their book .
They propose the law should be restored to match the intent of the U.S. Constitution which states : Congress may “ promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writing and discoveries . ”
They call on Congress to reverse the burden of the proof on patent seekers by granting patents only to those capable of proving that :
• their invention has social value
• a patent is not likely to block even more valuable innovations
• the innovation would not be cost - effective absent a patent
The authors acknowledge that such drastic reform is unlikely and outline an incremental approach for Congress to gradually reduce the scope of patents , regulation and licensing .
Nevertheless , their call for changing the system is urgent .
The economists compare intellectual monopoly ( patents ) to medieval trade monopolies which were proven to be economically detrimental .
They write , “ For centuries , the cause of economic progress has identified with that of free trade .
In the decades to come , sustaining economic progress will depend , more and more , on our ability to progressively reduce and eventually eliminate intellectual monopoly . ”
Professors Boldrin and Levine maintain a blog on this topic : www.Againstmonopoly.org.

vampires hands down , though it depends on the age of the vampire .
A new blood ( just been converted to darkness ) would probably be an even battle .
New bloods will burn once the sun comes out too , so thats a disadvantage they have .
But if you take a more powerful vampire such as Vlad Drakula ( as an extreme example ) , there 's no way a werewolf could win in theory , since the only way to kill drakula is cut off his head and put a stake through his heart .
Werewolves according to legend have no control of their abilities in their transformed state , so they wouldnt be able to perform that specific action .
Booting Ubuntu To RAM
Version
Unnecessary on 11.04 LiveCD .
Casper now includes a functioning toram option , which even works with the iso - scan / filename= option .
Last update for 9.10 compability .
Latest update for 2.6.31 - 16 upgrade
Preface
This article aims to document the process of creating a customized Ubuntu that loads an image from the hard disk to RAM , then boots an entire Ubuntu session out of RAM .
It is intended for intermediate to advanced Ubuntu users who are familiar with the shell , and may have limited experience customizing the livecd ( LiveCDCustomization ) and shell scripting .
We will customize a LiveCD and copy it to the hard drive , and make a few modifications to bootup scripts so that it copies to RAM via our good friend tmpfs .
WARNING : The author asserts that this procedure works for him , but cannot guarantee that this procedure works for anyone else .
Although this procedure is meant to be 100 % safe , it is feasible that there may be mistakes , or a chance of misunderstanding the instructions in a manner that causes loss of data .
Please make a backup and do not attempt on mission critical systems .
Read through this article thoroughly , and do not attempt if you do not comprehend or feel comfortable about any of the instructions !
CAUTION : I hope this is intuitively obvious , but I 'll humor you and state it bluntly : Changes you make under the live session are NOT saved and WILL BE LOST when you reboot or shut down .
Do n't save anything important to the " home directory " and expect it to still be around !
If you want to save data permanently , mount a permanent medium ( such as your hard drive ) , plug in a thumbdrive , or use some network functionality built into Ubuntu to save your data to a non-volatile destination .
Use Cases
There are many cases where one would like to boot Ubuntu to RAM :
Performance :
The desktop performance is dramatically improved .
A 400 MB squashed filesystem in RAM , that holds 1200 MB of data , is read back on a 1.6GHz Core Duo in about 3 seconds , including decompression time .
Power , Noise , Durability : Although modern hard disks do n't use much power compared to other system components , this may still be important for some .
In laptops , hard disks are often the noisiest components , so this setup can reduce system noise .
With the hard disk spun down , a laptop can potentially withstand greater shocks without damage .
Abrupt poweroff :
Since the hard disk is only momentarily used in read - only mode during boot , then never touched again , there are few or no negative consequences of an abrupt poweroff .
If a system is used where power is inconsistent , or the system is regularly used in a context where fast shutoffs are required , this is very handy .
Privacy : Anything you do in this session are lost when you reboot or power off .
This is great for kiosks or other systems where permanent modification are not desired .
( Note that by default the livecd user has full sudo access , so potentially a malicious user can still make permanent changes by mounting the hard drive and following this HOWTO )
Requirements
The most obvious increased requirement is RAM .
For best performance , I recommend having 256MB RAM + enough RAM to hold a customized image .
Stripping Openoffice and some fonts and documentation from a stock Ubuntu LiveCD results in a 400 MB compressed image , which fits in RAM comfortably on a system with 1GB RAM .
Tmpfs can fall back on swap ( Ubuntu LiveCD scripts will mount any swap it finds ) , which is excellent for a bit of overflow , but if you regularly need to fall back on swap , performance will naturally suffer .
I have not investigated CPU requirements , but squashfs is compressed and decompressing takes some CPU power , so this is probably not a great idea on systems older than the Pentium III era .
As far as setting this system up , the requirements would be :
Having an Ubuntu LiveCD ISO or CD handy .
I used a Ubuntu LiveCD , but I see no reason why Xubuntu , Kubuntu , etc would n't work ( they do n't have differing casper boot scripts , as far as I know ) .
This procedure should work on all LiveCD's Dapper and later , with appropriate minor adaptations .
About 2 - 4GB of free space A combined 1GB or so of RAM and swap available .
The Process
Unpack LiveCD
First , we need to unpack the LiveCD for customization .
For this article , I am going to make the following assumptions about paths .
You can of course reject my choices and substitute your own .
The compressed root image is at / casper/filesystem .
squashfs
The kernel is at / casper / vmlinuz
The initramfs is at / casper / initrd.gz
We will make a temporary directory / casper / chroot where we edit this root filesystem .
For the first 3 files are located in / casper on the LiveCD .
Please copy these files from the LiveCD to / casper on your hard disk .
You may use the GNOME archive manager ( file - roller ) as root , bind - mounting , or a physical CD .
I will assume you know how to do this .
Customize Live Environment
This procedure is almost identical to customizing a LiveCD ( up to the generation of the .squashfs image ) .
Please see LiveCDCustomization for detailed instructions on customizing the LiveCD .
I will only be providing a basic rundown on the process .
Extract / casper / filesystem.squashfs to / casper / chroot /
sudo mount -o loop -t squashfs / casper / filesystem .
squashfs / mnt sudo mkdir / casper / chroot sudo rsync - ax / mnt /. / casper / chroot /. sudo umount / mnt
Patch boot scripts
The stock casper " toram " functionality is broken in Feisty .
In addition , even when it worked , it would completely decompress the filesystem into RAM , which requires 3 - 4 x more RAM , and is hence undesired .
As a result , we will be providing some nasty hacks on casper to make it copy to RAM the way we want it to .
Casper developers , please look away .
gksu gedit / casper / chroot/usr/ share/initramfs-tools / scripts/casper
Around line 35 , find :
export SHOWMOUNTS =' Yes ' ;; persistent )
Between them add extra two lines , so it looks like :
export SHOWMOUNTS =' Yes ' ; ; toram ) export TORAM =' Yes ' ;; persistent )
Around line 573 , find :
if [ " $ { TORAM} " ] ; then live_dest = " ram " elif [ " $ { TODISK} " ] ; then
Between them add some extra lines , like this :
if [ " $ { TORAM} " ] ; then # live_dest = " ram " echo " Copying CD contents to ram " mkdir / store # TODO : add a test for amount of ram here mount -t tmpfs -o size=1G none / store mkdir / store / casper cp / cdrom / casper /*. squashfs / store / casper / echo " CD - Rom has been unmounted , it 's safe to eject ! " umount / cdrom mount -o bind / store / cdrom elif [ " $ { TODISK} " ] ; then
You need to comment or delete live_dest= " ram " .
Replace " - o size =1G " with a larger ( or smaller ) size if your customized image is not 1GB ( for example , 2G , 1500 M , or 350M ) .
Look at the size of your squashfs image to determine the required size .
Save this file , and quit the editor .
Regenerate initrd.gz
Since we edited bootup scripts , we need to regenerate the file we know as / casper / initrd.gz to incorporate these changes :
sudo cp - L /etc/resolv.conf /casper/chroot /etc/ sudo mount -t proc none / casper / chroot / proc sudo mount -o bind / dev / casper / chroot / dev sudo chroot / casper / chroot / bin / bash
At this point , you are " in " the live environment 's filesystem .
We will be doing this a few more times before the day is over .
Remember that our Live environment is at / casper / chroot , not at edit / ( adjust customization commands accordingly ) .
Optional : Customize Live Environment Further
It would be a great idea to add or remove some packages , or add some default user settings , etc , to make the live environment friendlier .
The previously linked LiveCD customization article provides full details on how to do a wide variety of customizations .
Follow those instructions , up to : " Putting the CD together " ( do n't do that step ) .
Instead , replace it with
Ideas for customizations specific to this howto include :
Removing behemoth packages like OpenOffice .
Adding proprietary 3D video drivers by default ( TODO : expand on this idea )
Removing shutdown scripts ( TODO : expand )
Customizing user default settings in /etc / skel , including importing a firefox profile , etc .
The LiveCD howto roughly states how to do this .
( TODO : expand )
Suppress the eject notice at shutdown .
rm /etc/rc?.d/*casper*
Install something like sshfs so you can easily use SSH - able systems as permanent storage ( TODO : Expand )
Upgrade the whole system and regenerate initrd.gz
apt - get update apt - get dist - upgrade apt - get autoclean apt - get autoremove apt - get clean mkinitramfs -o /new - initrd.gz 2.6.31 - 16 - generic exit umount - l / casper / chroot / dev umount -l / casper / chroot / proc
The mkinitramfs command may take 30 seconds to a few minutes , depending on your CPU speed .
The exit command will take you back to your original shell , that 's not within with live environment .
Now we will move this initrd to the right spot :
sudo mv / casper / chroot/new- initrd.gz /casper/initrd.gz sudo mksquashfs / casper / chroot / casper/filesystem.squashfs - noappend -always-use - fragments
The always - use - fragments argument allows space to be used more efficiently , at the cost of more seeking .
Since our image is to be loaded into RAM , seeking is costless and not a concern as opposed to on a mechanical medium .
Make a GRUB Entry
Ok , the last thing we need to do is tell GRUB how to boot this system .
Read Making a GRUB bootable CD - ROM first .
Edit / boot / grub / menu.lst to include an entry like this at the bottom :
title Jaunty RAM
Session kernel / casper / vmlinuz boot =casper toram splash initrd / casper/ initrd.gz
Reboot and Enjoy
Now , it 's time to reboot and select Jaunty RAM Session , and see if it works out .
If the system does not boot , then double - check you followed all the instructions properly .
It took me about 10 or 11 customization cycles to get my live system JUST the way I like it , so be patient !
Remember , the possibilities are endless !
Enjoy , and share any cool things you do with this HOWTO !
Why do n't you work on bug # 25496 : toRam or copy2 Ram ( run ubuntu live from ram ) , to make this feature in the default Ubuntu livecd ?
https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/casper/+bug/25496
Any idea on how to get this to work with " iso- scan / filename= " option ?
It loads everything to RAM fine , but wo n't let me unmount / isodevice ( probably because a loopback device needs to be killed ) .
I can't seem to find which script creates the loopback nor where to destroy it and unmount the / isodevice folder .
For trying this out in Lucid , it 's easier to just go into edit mode in grub2 having booted the live cd/usb and change the options to
kernel / casper / vmlinuz boot =casper toram splash initrd / casper/initrd.gz
Else you 'll need to get grub legacy packages and use that to create the grub install cd stage2_eltorito can be extracted from http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/i386/grub/download
When making the iso use - J option to Generate Joliet directory information so that you can use usb - creator - gtk ( Startup disk creator ) and not waste CDs !
mkisofs - R - J - b boot / grub / stage2_eltorito - no-emul - boot \ - boot - load - size 4 - boot - info - table -o grub.iso iso
Pitfalls :
remember to set permissions on all the files before you create the iso as these will be honored when imaged
Make sure your chroot does n't end up on the iso
Variations :
loading the squashfs from a cheap usb stick or cd can be slow , so if you do have a hard drive use that instead e.g .
if [ " $ { TORAM} " ] ; then # live_dest = " ram " echo " Copying contents to ram . . " mkdir / store mount -t tmpfs -o size =2G none / store mkdir / store / casper mkdir / mnt # A use for my old windows recovery partition !
mount / dev/sda3 /mnt / cp /mnt/casper/*.squashfs / store / casper / echo " Copy done .. safe to eject boot medium " umount / cdrom umount / mnt mount -o bin / store / cdrom elif [ " $ { TODISK} " ] ; then
A DVD rental from Netflix is seen in Medford , Massachusetts July 25 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Brian Snyder
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Netflix Inc Chief Financial Officer Barry McCarthy said on Wednesday it plans to offer its online streaming service on a stand - alone basis .
“ We ’re likely to do that in the foreseeable future , ” McCarthy said at the Jefferies 5th annual Internet and Media conference in New York .
Netflix customers currently pay a fixed monthly subscription fee for access to the company ’s popular by - mail DVD service , with about 100,000 titles , as well as its online streaming service , with more than 12,000 titles available for viewing .
Netflix recently said it had hit 10 million subscribers , and said last month its stronger - than - expected quarterly results were propelled by growth in its Web video streaming service .
The Watch Instantly streaming service was first available only on personal computers , but is now offered through various devices , including the Roku set - top boxes , Microsoft Corp ’s Xbox , and LG Electronics Inc products .
McCarthy stressed the company still remains focused on providing a bundled offering , but said he understands that some viewers will find a stand - alone streaming service to be compelling , particularly as more compatible devices become prevalent .
For our latest mission , Agent Lathan gave out 2,000 high fives by standing next to a subway escalator during the morning rush .
Five additional agents spread out along the adjacent stairs , holding signs that prepared commuters for the upcoming high five fun .
Enjoy the video first and then check out the mission report and photos below .
The subway station at 53rd Street and Lexington Avenue can be a nightmare in the morning .
Thousands of commuters make a daily transfer from the E or V train to the 6 train .
The first part of the transfer involves taking one of two giant escalators , which both run up in the morning to accommodate the huge crowd .
Packed escalators at 8:30 AM
To the left of the escalators is a staircase .
Hardly anyone goes up it , and it ’s against the rules to go down it during rush hour ( you use another escalator further down to get to the platform ) .
Everyone is generally in a pretty crappy mood when they ’re making this transfer with a herd of other people at the crack of dawn .
It was definitely a location in need of a bit of fun .
Our agents take to the stairs
Agent Eppink made four signs that together said , “ Rob wants to give you a high five !
Get Ready ! ”
There was a fifth sign that just read “ Rob ” and had an arrow pointing downward .
Our agents grabbed their assigned signs and spread out along the stairs a little after 8:30 AM .
The staircase had platforms every 10 steps or so , which made it easy for the agents to divide up evenly .
The view looking down
I made two animated gifs to show what the signs looked like from the perspective of someone on the escalator .
The first looks straight ahead , and the second looks to the side , following one woman ’s ride up .
Our agents stood as close to the escalator as they could in order to leave plenty of room for the few folks who chose to take the stairs .
We picked Agent Lathan to be the high five man for a few reasons .
First , he ’s really tall .
The stairs are a little lower than the escalator , so we needed someone tall enough to reach the riders .
Second , Rob ’s a comedian and one his of characters is a parody of a life coach whose mantra is “ get psyched ! ”
In other words , Rob has lots of experience being positive and pumping people up .
I knew if anyone could keep his energy up during 2,000 high fives , it was Rob .
I have to admit , I was somewhat concerned that he would get separated from the rest of us
Rob high fives as Agent Eppink holds the sign behind him
It was awesome watching the reactions of people before , during , and after the high fives .
I ’d say around 75 % of the riders gave Rob a high five .
There were some people who were both listening to music and reading a book who did n’t look up to notice what was going on .
A small percentage seemed suspicious of us and elected to keep their hands to themselves .
Most people smiled and high fived .
Some people kept a straight face during the high five , but then privately smiled to themselves a few moments later .
Watching people after they gave a high five was almost more fun .
Almost everyone was left with a smile .
Agent Sokoler took hundreds of reaction shots , peering from behind columns at the top of the escalator .
Here are some of our favorites .
People on the further escalator watch the high fives
Lots of people wanted to know if Rob had washed his hands .
“ You bet I have ! ”
Rob executed a few “ double high fives ” when people passed up the steps
“ Show me some skin ! ”
Smiling post high five
“ Give me some love ! ”
Post high five glow
Looking up towards Rob
Making the decision to high five or not
A wise choice !
Playing it cool
Smiling afterwards
These girls were upset that they were on the wrong escalator for the high fives .
Rob gave them some “ air fives ” to their delight .
Leaving the escalator with a smile
We lasted for about 45 minutes in total , staying through the bulk of the morning rush .
My guess is that people passed Rob at a rate of one per second .
So that would be 2,700 people over 45 minutes who passed by and probably around 75 % of them played along .
I wonder if 2,000 consecutive high fives from strangers is a world record ?
After the crowds thinned out , we quietly disappeared .
We got some funny looks from MTA employees throughout the mission , but no one ever said anything to us .
Agent Lathan
It was tons of fun to do .
Most people were into it .
I was kind of worried that people would not be into it or angry , but just about everyone was down .
Some people were stone faced , but still gave me a high five .
It was 8:30 in the morning so people were tired and not in a good mood , but once people connected with my hand , they almost all laughed and smiled .
Everyone should start their day with high fives .
My hand was a little sore , but it made it through .
I think 2,000 high fives is probably the maximum a hand can take .
Agent Lindquist
I was the “ Rob wants ” sign , the very first sign in the chain .
At first I could n’t tell if it was going well .
I was n’t getting any reactions at all in the beginning , but then I started to hear people interacting with Rob , and I realized it was working .
Since I was first I got a lot of people looking confused .
They would just see my one sign saying “ Rob wants ” and would n’t get it .
Lots of people thought I was Rob and would say , “ What do you want ? ”
Then they ’d look past me and see the other signs and realize something bigger was going on .
Agent Small
I was the second person people saw .
By the time they got to me they were asking who Rob was and how far away he was .
My sign read “ to give you , ” so it introduced the expectation that people were going to get something .
Lots of people asked if he was going to give them money .
That was a big thing .
“ Is Rob going to give me $ 5 ? ”
As soon as people made eye contact with me I would smile , and then they would smile , and that made me smile bigger for the next person .
It was a fun chain of smiling .
Agent Wimpy
By the time they got to me they were asking , “ Where ’s Rob ?
What ’s Rob going to give us ? ”
Then they ’d see my sign and realize it was a “ high five . ”
They were really into it but were getting impatient because the escalator was going so slow and they wanted to see Rob .
One woman asked me , “ Why is Rob giving high fives out , is it his birthday ? ” I told her , “ No , he ’s just trying to do a nice thing for you . ”
A lot of people on the further escalator were laughing more than the ones on our escalator .
I think they liked that they were going to get to be in on the gag without having to commit themselves .
Agent Thomas
I was the “ get ready ” sign which was right before people got to Rob .
I saw a lot of people look around me and see Rob for the first time .
Seeing that process of people deciding to give him a high five was great .
Usually they were smiling by the time they got to me .
I would see in their eyes the moment they decided they were going to do it , which would make them smile even more .
People started talking to each other , “ Are you going to give Rob a high five ?
I am .
Let ’s give him a high five .
We should move over to this side . ”
I also got to hear the litany of things Rob was saying behind me , “ Way up high !
Down low !
Give me some skin ! ”
That caused me to laugh most of the mission , and at one point someone on the escalator told me I had a great smile and asked for my phone number !
I did not give it to him because I was focused on the mission .
Agent Eppink
My job was to hold the “ Rob ” sign above his head to indicate who Rob was .
I got to witness all the high five magic .
Two people were so into the high fiving they tried to give me a high five as well .
I told them that I was n’t Rob , but I could n’t let them down .
Mostly the focus was all on Rob .
I was his sidekick .
He ’d say “ Up high , ” and I ’d say , “ yeah , up high ! ”
One guy was so into it that he gave Rob like 10 high fives right in a row .
It seemed like people wanted to be given a light moment like this in the morning ; they wanted to connect with someone else .
One funny thing was that there were lots of people who were really ready to go , but because of the speed of the escalator they could n’t get there any faster .
They would just have to wait a few extra seconds with their hand up .
It was a really great awkward pause .
Agent Whines
My favorites were the people who would n’t crack a smile the whole time , but still gave a high five .
Other people were into it early and smiled the whole ride up .
I guess it ’s a pretty corporate neighborhood , so to see all of the people dressed up in suits cracking a smile was pretty great .
Mission Accomplished .

Phone <-> Computer integration is one of my most sought after features for phones .
When my phone is at my desk , let me use it via my computer .
It 'll prevent a lot of cluster .... mini-keyboard designs .
My phone is sitting literally inches away from my hands , but why can't I just call up it 's applications ( bluetooth signaling ? ) and start typing away on my fully fledged laptop keyboard that I 'm so used too ?
Of course , my phone is n't the G1 , so I 'm at the whim of the Apple Overlords , unlike you .
And it just happened now , I just picked up and replied to an SMS taking way too long to type it out .
I can go so much further than this , but I 'll stick to the topic and say that phones need to do what you did , natively .

OpenMoko ?
I 'm still sad that the openmoko does n't get more press .
If it got the attention that android has ( from a company like Google ) then it would surely be doing a bit better by now .
Even still ...
Yes , x11vnc runs fantastically , as does xvncviewer .
And you can drop Android on it without having to jailbreak anything :)

Do you have problems enabling / disabling wifi with Debian unioned in to the root filesystem ?
Is so , any solutions ?
I have n't had a chance to poke at it too much , so I was wondering if you have had a chance to run into and fix this problem .

It is my new toy I 'm about to have fun with Android phone too .
It 's on the way to me .
I 'll post what I do with it when the time comes .

/dev/input/event2 vs. event3
Thanks a lot , this is awesome !
On my device ( ADP 1 running CyanogenMod v3.6.8.1 , which is based on Android 1.5r3 ) , the / dev/ input directory did n't exist inside of the Debian directory hierarchy ( which I put at / system / sd ) , and also the right device turned out to be event3 ( 13,67 ) instead of event2 ( 13 , 66 ) , so outside the Debian chroot I did
mkdir / system/sd/mnt
mkdir / system/sd/mnt/dev
busybox mount -- bind / dev / system/sd/mnt/dev
in addition to the other binds , and I changed the relevant line in that script from
my $ keyboard = " / dev/input/event2 " ;
to
my $ keyboard = " /mnt/dev/input/event3 " ;
and changed
system ( " mknod " , $ filename , " c " , 13 , 66 ) and die " mknod failed . " ;
to
system ( " mknod " , $ filename , " c " , 13 , 67 ) and die " mknod failed . " ;
I 'm not suggesting that you change the script , I just wanted to note this here so that others could find it .
Thanks again !

Bluetooth keyboard ?
I want to use a bluetooth keyboard for data entry into my Android .
If I install Debian on it will I be able to use a bluetooth keyboard ?

Inject keys I wrote my own solution , which uses uinput .
It also works on android phones without hardware keyboards , and also supports special keys .

Lyn Evans says the magnet incident was a real setback for Cern
Europe 's particle physics lab , Cern , is losing ground rapidly in the race to discover the elusive Higgs boson , or " God particle " , its US rival claims .
The particle , whose existence has been predicted by theoreticians , would help to explain why matter has mass .
Finding the Higgs is a major goal of Cern 's Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) .
But the US Fermilab says the odds of its Tevatron accelerator detecting the famed particle first are now 50 - 50 at worst , and up to 96 % at best .
Both machines hope to see evidence of the Higgs by colliding sub-atomic matter at very high speeds .
If it exists , the Higgs should emerge from the debris .
The LHC has been out of action since last September when an accident damaged some of the magnets that make up its giant colliding ring .
Project leader Lyn Evans conceded the enforced downtime might cost the European lab one of the biggest prizes in physics .
Cern and Fermilab officials squared up at the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) annual meeting in Chicago .
Grand prix
Identifying the so - called God Particle has been a target for the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( Cern ) ever since the LHC was first conceived in the early 1980s .
We are increasing data set very quickly .
And they [ Cern ] are feeling the heat
Dmitri Denisov , Fermilab
At the launch of the LHC near Geneva in September , some scientists predicted the Higgs would be revealed as soon as summer 2009 .
But just one week later , an accident occurred which will halt experiments at the accelerator for at least 12 months .
Fermilab has taken advantage , cranking up the intensity of research at their Tevatron accelerator in Illinois .
Director Pier Oddone presented the Tevatron 's latest data at the AAAS meeting .
" We now have a very , very good chance that we will see hints of the Higgs before the LHC will , " said his Fermilab colleague , Dr Dmitri Denisov .
" I think we have the next two years to find it , based on the start date Lyn Evans has told us .
" And by that time we expect to say something very strong .
" The probability of our discovering the Higgs is very good - 90 % if it is in the high mass range .
" And the chances are even higher - 96 % - if its mass is around 170GeV ( giga- electron volts ) .
" In that case we would be talking about seeing hints of the Higgs by this summer . "
Treasure hunt
The smaller the mass of the particle , the more difficult and time - consuming it will be for Fermilab to detect .
The Tevatron is located at Fermilab near Chicago But even at the lowest end of the range , the chances are " 50 % or above " , according to Mr Oddone .
" Tevatron is running extremely well .
We are in the peak of our shape , " added Dr Denisov .
" We are increasing our data - set very quickly .
And they are feeling the heat .
" Instead of having their usual Christmas break - of two months - [ LHC scientists ] are planning to run all the way through .
" It 's a race .
Whoever is first is first . "
Fermilab estimates that the Tevatron has already picked out about eight collision events which may be hints of the Higgs .
But until the number crunching is done , it is not possible to distinguish these from " background noise " .
Fired up Sitting shoulder - to - shoulder with Dr Denisov was his counterpart Professor Lyn Evans , LHC project leader .
" The race is on , " he told BBC News .
" The Tevatron is working better than I ever imagined it could .
They are accumulating data like mad .
" The setback with the LHC has given them an extra time window .
And they certainly will make the most of it .
" If they do find the Higgs , good luck to them .
But I think it 's unlikely they will find it before the LHC comes online .
They may well be in a position to get a hint of the Higgs but I do n't think they 'll be in a position to discover it .
" And of course , if it 's not in the mass range they think it is , they have no chance of discovering it at all .
Pier Oddone put the odds at 50 - 50 but I think it 's less than that .
" In one year , we will be competitive .
After that , we will swamp them . "
The competition was healthy for " both parties " , added Professor Evans .
Though missing out on the Higgs would be a " sour consolation " , he admitted .
" The trouble is , the LHC has been sold on being built for the Higgs .
" But do n't forget , there is also a whole spectrum of physics to be investigated at the LHC which the Tevatron can never do . "

More than 80 people were arrested during the five - hour rioting
Passengers and masked demonstrators set fire to their train after being told it would not leave Haedo station , about 15 km ( nine miles ) west of Buenos Aires .
Six police officers were among those injured during the five - hour rioting .
More than 80 people were arrested .
The clashes come as the country prepares for the Americas summit , to be attended by George Bush among others .
The Argentine authorities said they believed the incident had been instigated by members of the railway unions and leftist groups .
' Planned '
Violence broke out after officials of private rail company TBA announced to the nearly 2,000 travellers on board the train that it would not leave the station due to technical problems .
This was planned , these were armed groups
Anibal Fernandez
Argentina Interior Minister
In pictures : ' Commuter fury '
Witnesses said that the passengers got off the train and , joined by dozens of people wearing masks , began to hurl rocks at the train , breaking windows .
The masked demonstrators also set fire to several train carriages and a police vehicle .
Nearby stores were destroyed by the flames .
Police officers used rubber bullets to contain the violence .
" This was planned , these were armed groups , " said Interior Minister Anibal Fernandez .
Correspondents say the incident was one of the worst in the country since the street rioting seen during Argentina 's economic collapse four years ago .
