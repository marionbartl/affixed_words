It 's an intriguing idea , but even a staunch advocate of honey for this use acknowledges that there 's virtually no published , scientific evidence to support his view .
Tom Ogren , a California horticulturalist and botanist ( tloallergyfree@earthlink.net ) who advocates local honey ( meaning honey harvested within a few miles of where you live ) , said that bees in any given area " will visit all the flowers that produce pollen " in that area and that this honey will therefore contain pollen from the plants you frequently encounter and may be allergic to .
" If you take small amounts daily , it 's like getting allergy shots " because you may become desensitized to the pollens , he said .
" I hear from people who are crazy about the results they get " from this , he added .
But as for real data ?
Zilch .
" You ca n't get a big bee company to do research because it [ the honey ] has to be local , " he said .
Ogren acknowledged that any pollen in local honey could also trigger the very allergies a person is hoping to ward off .
Dr. Leonard Bielory , an allergist and immunologist at UMDNJ - New Jersey Medical School , said that while " there are no controlled studies of a clinical effect " of local honey to combat allergies , " I do believe there is something to it . "
There have been reports in the medical literature of people who have gotten contact dermatitis from eating honey that came from bees that had pollinated nearby poison ivy plants .
" This is exactly the point .
You can get positive and negative effects .
" However , the plural of anecdote is anecdotes - not evidence , " he said .
All of which is not to say that honey is without potential medical benefits .
It does have small antimicrobial effects when put on the skin , said Bielory , as well as natural substances that prevent mold growth .
After all , sugar and water left out on the counter will eventually get moldy , but honey wo n't .
And it 's great for coughs .
Honey has been shown to be " safer and more effective than cough medicines for calming cough in young children , " said Dr. Frank Twarog , an allergist and clinical professor at Harvard Medical School .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Hollywood uber - producer Jerry Bruckheimer is famous for his almost uncanny ability to recognize a potential hit movie .
Sixth sense : Hollywood action king Jerry Bruckheimer is famous for his uncanny ability to recognize a potential hit movie .
Once described as " the man with the golden gut , " Bruckheimer 's movies have earned more than $ 15 billion in box office , fueled by a potent mix of fast - moving action , big bangs and even bigger stars .
Over the span of almost four decades , Tinseltown 's reigning king of action has credits including , 1980s classics " Top Gun " and " Flashdance , " high - octane action movies " The Rock " and " Con Air " in the 1990s , and most - famously the wildly successful " Pirates of the Caribbean " franchise starring Johnny Depp .
That " Confessions of a Shopaholic , " Bruckheimer 's latest movie , which stars Isla Fisher , has absolutely no explosions , not a car chase in sight and includes gratuitous references shopping and designer high heels should signal to everyone that chick flicks have well and truly arrived .
" The Screening Room " caught up with Bruckheimer to ask him about the growing power of the female cinema audience , taking risks and his ability to spot movie gold .
TSR : You 're thought of as the Hollywood action king .
Do you think the fact that you 're moving into chick flicks with " Confessions of a Shopaholic " is a sign that Hollywood is taking the female audience more seriously ?
Jerry Bruckheimer : I think we 've always taken the female audience very seriously , but with the success of " Sex and the City " and a number of other movies ... we know that there 's a big female audience out there , we just need to figure out the films that they really want to go see .
Which is hard , you do n't really know .
Hopefully , they 'd want to go and see " Confessions of a Shopaholic . "
Watch Jerry Bruckheimer , director P.J. Hogan and star Isla Fisher talk about " Confessions of a Shopaholic "
TSR : How do you know that a film is going to be a hit ?
With films like , " Pirates of the Caribbean " and " Top Gun " you resurrected genres that were dead .
Is it instinct or experience ?
JB : I think it 's just films that I really want to go and see .
I really do n't know what 's going to make a picture successful .
I know what a good drama is , and what good characters are , and that you should populate your film with good characters .
It 's all about what audiences will be captivated by .
I really do n't know .
I just know what I like .
TSR : You 're one of the most successful producers in Hollywood .
What does it take to be a great producer ?
JB : I love movies and I love making movies .
It 's not about the money , it 's about can you make a good film ?
can you entertain an audience and do you have good taste in casting and are you a good storyteller ?
It 's all about story - telling .
The better the story , the more popular the characters , the bigger your chance is of having a successful film .
TSR : And how about taking risks ?
Do you need to take risks ?
JB : Well , I do take enormous risks .
Making a pirate movie and movies like " Top Gun , " and " Beverly Hills Cop " with African - American actors in it when that was n't in vogue .
You know , I do it everyday .
TSR : How does it affect you ?
JB : When they are a success , it makes you feel good .
But not all films can be successes , so you 've to roll with the punches and just get back up and start all over again .
TSR : How has the current economic crisis affected your work ?
JB : Well , it affects everybody .
You know , budgets are tighter and stocks are down a lot for companies .
But box - office fortunately for the movie business has been up .
Advertisers are n't spending as much on TV , which is not good for television products , but movies are still cheap entertainment .
When people can't go away and take vacations , they always can spend a few bucks and go to a movie .
TSR : Remakes of 1980s films seem to be becoming more popular -- especially horror remakes .
Any thoughts on remaking some of your old films from that era like , maybe , " Top Gun " ?
JB : Not yet , but you never know .
I mean " Top Gun " was one that was a one - off it 's hard to remake that or make it a different way .
TSR : Do you think long - form TV , shows like " The Sopranos " or " The Wire " with hour - long episodes and high production values have stolen audiences from the movies ?
JB : Not at all .
I think people still want to get out of their house .
I mean you have a kitchen in your house I assume and you do go out to eat , right ?
It 's the same thing .
We have TVs in our homes and we watch television and we go on computers and if there 's something we want to see [ at the movies ] we are still going to go out because it's an experience .
TSR : And finally , I have to ask you , are there any plans with Johnny Depp to make another " Pirates of the Caribbean " ?
JB : Yeah , we are talking about making another one .
We have Johnny certainly interested and we have him interested in another one of our projects called " The Lone Ranger " so that 's two films that we hope to make with him .

Although Mr. Turner ’s remarks focused on Britain , in recent weeks a small group of senior regulators , central bankers and government officials working under the framework of the Financial Stability Forum have been preparing a proposal that they hope will be endorsed by political leaders at the coming Group of 20 summit meeting in early April .
Image Adair Turner , head of the Financial Services Authority in Britain , released a report Wednesday on responses to the global banking crisis .
He has also outlined plans for overseeing bankers pay .
Credit ... Alastair Grant / Associated Press
Prepared by a panel headed by Philipp Hildebrand , the vice chairman of the Swiss National Bank , the report will effectively back the financial authority ’s approach to pay .
It proposes that national regulators ensure that compensation awards at financial institutions are based not just on profitability but also on the extent to which a trader or banker did not take excessive risk in order to generate high returns .
Deferred payout plans and clawback measures would also be proposed .
“ The system is dysfunctional now , so you need something to break the pattern , ” said Gary Lutin , an investment banker and public critic of executive compensation levels .
Still , he said , it is one thing for regulators to promise to crack down on pay and quite another for them to actually do it .
Traditionally , the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States and the Financial Services Authority in Britain  both of which contributed to the report  have supervised areas like capital adequacy and broad compliance with securities law .
They have limited their involvement in pay issues to trying to restrain bonuses at financial institutions receiving public funds , and even there they have generally moved cautiously and on an ad hoc basis .
But there are signs that governments are going to play a much more active role even after the good times return .
There are many different kinds of abuse , some subtle and some not so subtle .
It 's the not so subtle kinds of abuse that we are most familiar with and more easily able to identify .
We have seen the movies , where Jennifer Lopez gets beaten black and blue in ' Enough ' and heard people verbally abusing others around us .
The signs of that kind of abuse is so obvious , we can't miss it , and we feel sorry for those people who have to put up with it .
However , it 's the subtle kinds of abuse that is far more damaging .
Many of us face it every day - by our children , partners , bosses , people at work , and we do n't even realise it is happening to us until it is too late and our self - esteem has taken a large knock .
Remember , nothing but nothing excuses selfish , disrespectful behaviour towards another human being .
To show disrespect for another is to show disrespect for one 's self .
So , what exactly is abuse and how do we know we are being abused ?
It does n't matter whether you are being physically , emotionally or verbally abused , the bottom line is that abuse is always about control .
It is about one partner using strategies and techniques to control the other .
It is about your partner 's behaviours changing your personality , and you losing your self - esteem and your feeling of self - worth .
It is about someone using your fears to manipulate you to do what they want and be what they want .
They make you afraid to be yourself , afraid to control yourself , so therefore you will be available to be controlled by them .
Some red flags to look out for .
If you are faced with any of these red flags , you could be in an abusive relationship of some kind .
I am not going to list the obvious signs of abuse as we 're all familiar with those already .
Your partner controls your time by making you wait - it could be waiting for them to do something after they 've watched just one more TV programme or played just one more game , or even by not giving you a direct answer to your question and replying with a “ We 'll have to wait and see ” or “ We 'll talk about it later ” , and later never comes .
If the person who has to wait complains , they are criticised for not having enough patience , or of trying to start a fight .
Either way , they are being manipulated .
This type of control is two - fold :
Their time is controlled and then they are blamed for it !
Your partner controls your time by timing you whenever you go out somewhere without them .
If you take longer than they mentally calculated you 'd take , they lay a guilt trip on you to make you feel bad .
Your partner withholds information from you , and you either have to beg for it , or are forced to try to act on your own .
This means that you 'll either take longer or will have a greater chance of failure .
This form of control makes the abuser feel superior as they know more than you do .
Your partner withholds needed money , and you are forced to beg , plead or do without .
The situation is then turned around that it was your ' trying to be a martyr ' or your begging which forced them to withhold the money .
Your partner controls all the finances , gives you an allowance that is n't enough and deprives you of necessities , while they buy whatever they want and spend money like there 's no tomorrow .
They do n't ask your permission before they buy something , but because they control your finances , you have to ask their permission if you want to buy something .
Your partner controls your emotions by using body language and gestures .
These can be - sulking , giving you the silent treatment , turning their back on you and walking away while you 're still talking to them , stomping out of the room and hitting or kicking something as they leave , rolling their eyes in disgust while you are talking or doing something , sighing deeply , refusing to look you in the eye , making a big show of crossing their arms with a bored look on their faces , withholding affection or sex , ignoring you in company and talking animatedly to others .
Your partner controls you by defining your reality .
They discount your experiences and replace it with their truth and reality which is actually a lie .
For example , “ That 's not what happened , ” “ That 's not what I said , ” “ That 's not what you saw or felt , ” or the best one of all “ I know you better than you know yourself ! ”
Your partner controls you by making you responsible for their behaviour , and in doing this avoids all accountability .
It will be your fault because you did n't remind them , or set a good example , or stop them soon enough when you saw they were doing the wrong thing .
You might ask your partner for their input , they reply , “ Whatever , ” and then when you go ahead and do it , it 's all your fault if it does n't work .
Your partner controls you by putting you down all the time , in public and in private .
They play down your successes and talents , belittle you and then praise you for trivial things you do , thus saying that you are best suited for doing trivial things .
They might make offensive jokes about you in public , mimic you , laugh or smirk at you , patronise you , insult you or make rude sounds while you talk .
Your partner controls you by talking about you in company in front of you as if you were n't there .
They can bring up private moments that you might not want to be general knowledge , and turn it around so that you come out as the fool and they come out as the hero .
This way they can make you the brunt of jokes and a laughingstock among your friends .
A healthy relationship is a partnership and consists of giving and taking .
Each partner knows that sacrifices and concessions they make will eventually be returned .
They are also able to accept themselves for who they are with all warts and imperfections , and also to accept their partner for who they are and with all their blemishes and imperfections .
Unfortunately , an abusive relationship is one - sided .
The abusive partner can't give and take , and takes any criticism personally as a personal assault on their character .
The abusive partner needs to win in order to feel in control .
That 's all that makes them feel okay and there is intense pressure for them to hold onto control and thereby preserve that ' winning feeling ' .
It is unacceptable and never crosses their minds to be wrong , give in , or place another 's needs above their own .
The terrible reality , is that you can't change an abusive partner .
I once thought , if I loved my ex-husband enough I could change him , but I was wrong .
You can't change another person , unless you use abusive tactics .
Change has to come from within .

I cannot independently confirm this , but the beleaguered Iraqi gay group based in London believes that several gay men are slated for execution by the Shiite government of Iraq soon :
According to Ali Hili of Iraqi-LGBT , the Iraqi authorities plan to start executing them in batches of 20 from this week .
There is , said Mr. Hili , at least one member of Iraqi - LGBT who are among those to be put to death ...
“ We have information and reports on members of our community whom been arrested and waiting for execution for the crimes of homosexuality , ” Mr Hili told UK Gay News .
“ Iraqi -LGBT has been banned from running activities on Iraqi soil , ” he revealed .
“ Raids by the Iraqi police and Ministry of Interior forces cost our group [ to the extent of ] disappearing and killing of 17 members working for Iraqi - LGBT since 2005 .
“ The death penalty has been increasing at an alarming rate in Iraq since the new Iraqi regime reintroduced it in August 2004 .
“ In 2008 , at least 285 people were sentenced to death , and at least 34 executed . "
I 'll try to bring more solid reports if I can find them .
But , yes , your tax dollars helped pay for this .
And thousands of American soldiers gave their lives .

The Marine Fisheries Agency was certainly onto a winner when it enlisted the aid of the Assets Recovery Agency in its ruthless war against our fishermen .
In December 2007 Charles McBride and his son Charles , from Kilkeel in Northern Ireland , were fined £ 385,000 for under - declaring catches of whitefish and prawns in the Irish Sea , threatening the loss of their homes and boat .
But the Assets Recovery Agency , using powers designed to recover money from drug dealers , also froze all their assets .
To pay the fines , the McBrides tried to borrow against their assets .
Now , for this effort to pay the fines , Liverpool Crown Court has sentenced the two men to two and three months in gaol for “ contempt of court ” .
Editorial note :
If you ’ve been following my tweets in the past 12 hours you ’d have seen me hinting at something very cool for web developers coming out of Microsoft ’s MIX09 event today .
Well , it ’s still at least 3 hours until MIX but it appears Microsoft ’s own Expression Web team blog has let the dogs out early ( their server is set to to New York time , not Las Vegas time ) , so consider the NDA broken 🙂
“ Expression Web SuperPreview ” , the name is typical of Microsoft products , it ’s technically self - explanatory but mind - numbingly bland and ridiculously long .
To make matters worse , the beta being released today – a subset of the full release coming with Expression Web 3 – is called “ Expression Web SuperPreview for Windows Internet Explorer ” .
Granted the name is not that important for a developer tool , a kickass one at that .
Every web developer today faces the challenge of checking website compatibility across a large pool of browsers and browser versions in the marketplace .
Up and until now , either you could install every browser , verify the website via a visual inspection and debug with tools specialized to that browser , or you could send a URL to a third - party screenshotting service like BrowserShots for an all - in - one visual inspection .
The former is messy and tedious but gives you more control and an opportunity to diagnose problems , whilst the latter is simple but slow and useless to fix the problem .
Needless to say , SuperPreview is the best of both worlds .
Note :
The following screenshots come from a newer unreleased internal build of the application and does not reflect accurately what you can do in Expression Web SuperPreview today .
Please do n’t hurt me .
I like kittens .
SuperPreview as a tool allows you to compare different rendering engines in a single unified interface .
Simple clicks gives you comparisons between Internet Explorer 6 , the native version of Internet Explorer installed , other browsers you may have installed locally – Firefox 3.5 , Safari 3 , Safari 4 – and even an bitmap images of website prototypes .
Pushing the envelopes a little , Microsoft is also building in support for remote rendering , such as those on different operating systems even .
Details about this feature is not entirely clear at the moment , but I would expect this to be more advanced than just an image rendering .
On top of just a visual inspection , you have a standard set of modern HTML debugging tools like a DOM inspector , CSS inspector , element highlighting , pixel rulers and guides .
And perhaps what I think is the coolest feature , an overlay mode to compare exactly what ’s different for pixel - perfect alignment .
Or if you cross your eyes , the web in 3D .
Finally , how you can get your dirty web developer paws on this awesome tool , and it ’s a little complicated to say the least .
The beta of this software available right now is downloadable from Microsoft.com ( 250 MB ) .
The catch being it only supports renderings between IE6 and versions of IE installed on your computer already , but it should ease the pain of testing for IE6 / 7/ 8 compatibility for a lot of devs .
The full and final version of this product will be bundled together with Expression Web 3 , sometime later this year and will run as a separate standalone application .
Unfortunately for the many Mac web developers out there , because Expression Web is not an application part of the Expression Mac suite , SuperPreview will not be available .
You can watch this announcement and more from MIX09 from the livestream website starting at 9 AM PST ( Las Vegas time ) , and not EDT ( New York time ) .

THE CityRail network has insufficient electric power to run the biggest order of new trains in Australia and has been forced to spend more than $ 1 billion to fix the problem and to pay for other essential upgrades .
The first of more than 600 rail carriages due to begin testing in October will be restricted to one section of the rail network until a program of capital improvements is completed , some of which are running years late and over budget .
Although RailCorp was aware more power was needed for the trains , the budget for the overhaul has blown out almost seven - fold .
If too many of the trains are put into circulation at once , sections of the network will short - circuit , sources have confirmed .
In a tender last year the State Government revealed " RailCorp does not currently have an enterprise - wide change strategy for achieving business readiness to accept [ public - private partnership ] implementation , and this represents a major risk " .
WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama 's climate czar said the Environmental Protection Agency will soon determine that carbon - dioxide emissions represent a danger to the public and propose new rules to regulate emissions of the greenhouse gas from a range of industries .
Carol Browner , special adviser to the president on climate change and energy , said in an interview Sunday that the EPA is looking at a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that requires the agency to determine whether carbon dioxide endangers public health or welfare ....
Antiabortion Groups Applaud Palin Revelation
By Garance Franke - Ruta
Antiabortion groups reacted warmly to Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's surprising admission last night that she had considered having an abortion after learning that her son Trig would have Down syndrome .
Speaking before the Vanderburgh County Right to Life banquet in Evansville , Ind. , Palin delved deep into personal matters she has shied away from .
She avoided using the word " abortion " in her speech , preferring to use the phrase " change the circumstances . "
When she learned of Trig 's diagnosis while on an out - of - state trip , Palin said she thought , " Wow , it is easy .
It could be easy to think maybe of trying to change the circumstances .
And no one would know .
No one would ever know . "
Ultimately , Palin said she decided she was going to have to " walk the walk " and remain faithful to her long - standing opposition to abortion .
But she said that the experience had helped give her an " understanding for ... why someone might believe it would be possible to change those circumstances .
Just make it all go away . "
" I had just enough faith to know that trying to change the circumstances was n't any answer , " she said .
Palin used her own " moment of doubt " to illustrate her support for carrying pregnancies to term , regardless of the circumstances .
She prayed during her pregnancy for the strength and compassion to love a baby with an extra chromosome , she said .
" The moment he was born , I knew that moment my prayers had been answered , " Palin said .
" Trig is a miracle , and he has brought amazing and surprising happiness and great great perspective , " she said .
" He is the best thing that has ever happened to me . "
Palin 's frank remarks were greeted warmly by attendees of the dinner and could bind her even more tightly to those who oppose abortion , the executive director of the National Right to Life Committee said today .
" I think everyone of us , every human being , has had it go through their mind , the possibility of an act they know is wrong -- and then rejected , " said David O'Steen , adding , " I 'm not surprised that a woman unexpectedly pregnant with a child that would have disabilities -- and of course the pressure in our society today is to kill that child .... so that had to have gone through her mind . "
Her remarks underscore , he said , " that she is very forthright , very honest .
It also shows she 's a person who , when tried and tempted , will make the right decisions . "
Steven Ertelt , editor of a news service for opponents of abortion and president of Right to Life of Wyoming , said in an e-mail , " Sarah Palin excites the pro-life community because she understands , unlike President Obama , that human life should be protected and that a pregnancy is not a ' mistake . ' "
Kim Lehman of Iowa Right to Life , an influential player in the conservative activist circles so important to Republicans looking to win the state 's first - in - the - nation caucuses , said that she was impressed by Palin 's remarks .
" She was tested , tried and chose life .
It goes to show her character , " said Lehman , who had tried to book Palin for her organization 's banquet .
" I 'm encouraged by Governor Palin 's response . "
Palin 's dinner appearance before an audience of between 2,000 and 3,000 was her first major public appearance this year .
She was accompanied to the banquet by her husband , Todd Palin .
The Alaska governor 's office referred calls to SarahPAC , her political action committee , which did not immediately return calls .

LAHORE , Pakistan —
The Pakistani government agreed early on Monday to reinstate the independent - minded former chief justice of the Supreme Court , a stunning concession to the opposition leader Nawaz Sharif , who had been heading toward the capital in a convoy threatening to stage a mass protest over the issue after he broke free from house arrest at his residence near here .
The concession , broadcast on national television by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani , came after a tumultuous weekend in Pakistani politics in which a dispute between President Asif Ali Zardari and Mr. Sharif escalated into a crisis that was destabilizing nuclear - armed Pakistan , already under pressure from a growing Islamic insurgency and severe economic troubles .
The decision to restore the chief justice , Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , came after calls to Mr. Zardari and Mr. Sharif , including from Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , asking them to ease their differences .
The Obama administration ’s special envoy to Pakistan , Richard C. Holbrooke , said the United States applauded “ the statesmanlike act by President Zardari and hope that it will help defuse a dangerous confrontation so that Pakistan , with the help of its many friends , can address the nation ’s pressing and urgent needs . ”
It ’s Sunday afternoon and my house is full of kids today .
Three are my own , the rest are from the neighborhood .
Teenagers all , I ’m fairly certain they gather in our home because fruit juice , snacks , and video games are in ample supply .
Hiding behind my computer , I play the discreet chaperone , secretly relishing the chaos and the energy they bring to my middle - aged world .
I embrace them warmly , remembering the loneliness I felt at their age , an only child whose weekend socializing consisted of following my parents from mansion to mansion , hiding in the dens and libraries to avoid the punctilious owners of these enshrined abodes .
Trying to pass the time , I managed to miss reading Revolutionary Road , though I did peruse Appointment in Samarra , How to Make Friends and Influence People , and the Ordeal of Change , in between dusty volumes that betrayed the secrets of Jung and Freud .
Barely out of my teens , as my own gesture of suburban bohemianism perhaps , I ran off and married the oldest of six siblings ; whose tiny ramshackle bungalow , 4 bunk beds per bedroom , ever open front door , and down - to - earth Mom personified the realization of my long - suppressed dreams of a welcoming extended family .
Like many starter marriages , mine soon collapsed under the weight of graduate school and my ex’s well - intentioned serial monogamy .
On my own for 12 years , I built the professional and personal life I desired , a moderate balance of enjoyable company and solitude and reflection .
My second marriage and my rewarding family life have made balance a goal that my husband and I hope to achieve as empty nesters in a few years -- but without regrets .
Pulling my thoughts away from the space battles on the family room big - screen , though , I do start to muse about the theme of my next book .
A friend had suggested that I focus on the story of an infertile woman and her unresolved hunger and pain .
I passed on that excellent idea — the story was hers , and , I thought she should write it .
It has been almost twenty years since she learned biological children were beyond her reach , and , thinking of her , I look at mine , enjoying their leisure hours , with a mixture of gratitude and guilt .
I am , all of a sudden , reminded of the Octomom , however , who , after struggling with her own loneliness and the pain of miscarriages , moved to assisted reproduction and will now be raising a brood of 14 children , age 7 and under .
I ’ve written on these pages about the narcissism that can drive people to make unwise choices in fervent attempts to meet psychological needs , to fill the emptiness inside .
But there is more than narcissism that can lead to desperation — deprivation can be as forceful a trigger .
I ’ve had the misfortune to be on many diets in my life , most of them only temporarily successful .
Needing to be slim for my television work , I dabbled in liquids , protein powders , juices , Atkins , lo-carb , no - carb , South Beach , grapefruit , etc , …-- everything but nicotine and drugs .
Unable to indulge my lust for chocolate and fresh bread , I could think of nothing else .
After the show or assignment , I ’d head out to the local bakery and binge on what I had denied myself for weeks , ruing the pounds that would creep back on in a fraction of the time I had labored to lose them .
Learning to avoid the cycle of deprivation and gluttony took years — moderation required giving up the comforting obsession of fasting and the serotonin and dopamine high of the binge .
Individuals with bulimia often struggle with this roller coaster of psychological and physical symptoms .
Burdened with low self - esteem , and often suffering from depression , they may binge eat to fill their internal emptiness , until they are overwhelmed with guilt and pain from overeating and turn to purging behaviors such as vomiting , laxatives , and overexercising .
Eating disorders are increasingly prevalent in our society , which bombards even children with Madison Avenue pressure for unnatural thinness and beauty , and sparks cycles of disordered eating in kids as young as 6 or 7 years old .
Looking at Octomom ’s choices and behavior , it seemed almost as if she was demonstrating a similar pattern of “ bulimic breeding ” .
Deprived of her dream to have children in her now dissolved marriage , was she binging on the opportunity to reproduce through IVF ?

It makes sense that ecological changes caused by humans affect natural biodiversity and , in some cases , can even cause permanent displacement of a species .
Unless science revives it .
Researchers from Eawag and from two German universities ( Frankfurt and Konstanz ) , analyzed genetic material from Daphnia eggs up to 100 years old and say the eutrophication of Greifensee and Lake Constance in the 1970s and 1980s led to genetic changes in a species of water flea which was ultimately displaced .
Despite the fact that water quality has since been significantly improved , this species has not been re-established .
Naturally , anyway .
Daphnia Galeata .
Photo : Eaweg UniversityEvolutionary biologist Nora Brede said , “ In the laboratory , we were able to revive resting eggs over 40 years old isolated from Greifensee sediment .
” For Eawag , this Jurassic Park - style method has a serious purpose : it makes it possible to determine retrospectively which Daphnia species was dominant in the lake around 1960 , and whether the species that prevailed in the 1970s and 1980s became more tolerant of pollutants .
Daphnia , which are crustaceans , can produce diapausing ( resting ) eggs – e.g. when food supplies are inadequate – which develop into a living organism when environmental conditions subsequently become more favourable .
As these eggs are deposited in datable layers of anoxic sediments , their DNA can be analysed even after the passage of 100 years or more .
What makes this biological archive particularly interesting is the fact that conditions in the lake have undergone dramatic changes since 1960 .
In the 1970s and 1980s , inputs of phosphate detergents and fertilizer runoff led to eutrophication , with the development of algal blooms , including toxic cyanobacteria ( blue - green algae ) .
Fish died as a result of oxygen depletion .
The results of the genetic analysis of Daphnia eggs indicate that genetic diversity was also affected by the excessive nutrient levels .
At the beginning of the 20th century , only one species of water flea ( Daphnia hyalina ) occurred abundantly in the two lakes studied .
As eutrophication developed , this was displaced by another species ( Daphnia galeata ) .
In the transitional periods before and after peak nutrient inputs , hybrids also developed .
However , although the lakes are now once again much cleaner ( thanks to major efforts in the urban wastewater management sector ) , the original species has yet to recover .
According to Nora Brede , “ This demonstrates that anthropogenic changes , such as eutrophication , can have major and not fully reversible effects on animal species . ”
In addition , the research project also showed how rapidly evolutionary processes can unfold in the animal kingdom .
Brede comments : “ In a mere 50 years , there have been measurable changes in the genome structure of a species , which is amazing , given that this is an extremely short period on the timescale of the Earth ’s history .
” Biological archives such as the resting eggs of Daphnia in lake sediments are a valuable tool for investigating how organisms respond to changes in the ecosystem .
Together with its partners , Eawag is therefore making the most of these opportunities to study and gain a better understanding of evolutionary processes .
Research is focusing in particular on the question of how quickly plants and animals adapt genetically to the alterations in temperature associated with global climate change .

DETROIT --
Authorities are trying to determine who dumped more than a ton of frozen chicken outside an old auto factory in Detroit .
The Detroit News reports at least 30 boxes containing the more than 2,000 pounds of sealed chicken breasts were found Sunday afternoon at the former Fisher Body plant on the city 's southwest side .
Public works and city health officials are to begin removing the poultry Monday .
The city 's Department of Health and Wellness Promotion is expected to use packaging and box labels to determine the source of the chicken .
Charges could include illegal dumping .
Michigan 's Department of Agriculture also will investigate the dumping .
PCLinuxOS 2009.1 - A lovely distro
Updated : March 20 , 2009
PCLinuxOS is dubbed the " distro hopper - stopper " by its fans .
Not without a good reason , I must say , because PCLinuxOS aims and succeeds at being radically simple [ sic ] , friendly to new users as well as Linux geeks , easy to configure and manage , and packaging all you might need from your computer .
At least , that was my impression the last time I tested PCLinuxOS , version 2007 in the back then days .
The distro was soft and sweet and forgiving to the newbie , well made when it came to looks and usability , and loaded with a lot of goodies .
Hindered by no ill memories , I downloaded PCLinuxOS and gave it a big try .
I first wanted to test the KDE version , but then a fellow member at one of the forums asked me to try the Gnome version instead .
So I decided to something else entirely and try them both !
Still , considering my last review was about the KDE version , this review is mostly about the Gnome edition .
But KDE users , despair not !
At the end of this article , you will find a short sub - review of the KDE version .
What are we going to do ?
Everything !
The usual share of tests - and then some : Check everything from multimedia codecs via Wireless , Web cameras , and Flash to Compiz , desktop recording and digital cameras .
We will also review the range of unique applications that PCLinuxOS ships with , including stuff like remastering , iPod support , Master Boot Record ( MBR ) restore , Checkgmail , Bleachbit , and many others .
We will also install PCLinuxOS .
Then , let us not forget the uber - friendly Configuration Center , Samba sharing , proxy usage , and a whole load more .
After me !
Live CD -
Tad shy of perfect
I spent more than 6 hours playing with the live CD experience ; it was that much fascinating .
Starting the PCLinuxOS desktop was more than I could expect .
Unfortunately , it started with a little snag .
My T42 would not boot the CD .
I tried burning several CDs on several computers , using different burn speeds , to no avail .
I even re-downloaded the image and checked the hash to make sure there were no errors .
Still , T42 refused to get into the desktop .
The boot progress bar would fill up to approx .
one quarter and halt forever .
I also tried the safe graphic mode , no luck .
KDE edition , same results ...
This was the first time a Linux distro refused to actually boot from this old machine , so it makes me wonder what could be wrong .
I left the issue rest for now and booted from the newer T61 .
No problems .
This means that there 's something about my old Thinkpad that PCLinuxOS 2009 does not like .
If you are a member of the PCLinuxOS dev team and happen to be reading this , I 'd appreciate if you could contact me so we can try to solve this together .
Now , T61 ...
PCLinuxOS 2007 used to ask quite a few questions before it let you get into the live desktop , configuring the keyboard , language , time zone , network , and whatnot .
PCLinuxOS 2009.1 is far less picky , asking you only to choose your keyboard .
The desktop is well made , with an interesting choice of soothing gray and blacks .
The theme has a rounded , expensive look that puts you at ease .
Although Gnome tends to look minimalistic , the feeling is completely avoided in PCLinuxOS .
Instead , you are immersed into a calm , solid desktop .
Apprehensive about my T42 fiasco , I made a quick check of what hardware on my laptop PCLinuxOS supported .
Everything , it turned out - except Wireless .
I had the same problem with Linux Mint Felicia .
But then , I could demonstrate Wireless on T42 , which had no issues with that particular distro image .
It seemed Wireless was not going to be a part of this review , at least when it comes to Gnome edition .
For now , PCLinuxOS was at - 2 points , one for T42 and one for Wireless .
That was a bold start .
Luckily for the distro , there was the 2007 love affair that would not let me give up .
Plugging in the wired connection , I started exploring the distro .
3D effects
I decided this was going to be the first test .
If this one failed , then I would be sorely disappointed .
I knew where to start : the PCLinuxOS Control Center .
This is the heart of simplicity that PCLinuxOS boasts , the one centralized management menu where you will find all system configurations you may need to set or change , arranged neatly in a clean and orderly and , most importantly , intuitive fashion , with big , well - designed icons .
While I thought the Control Center to look well in the 2007 edition , the developers have made it even better .
So I went went searching for the 3D effects thingymajiggy ...
Under Hardware , I found my 3D effects .
The live CD session informed me I had to download several packages .
I let the wizard continue .
After the packages were downloaded , the wizard informed me I had to log out and log in back into the session for the changes to take effect and even initiated the log out itself .
Once back into the desktop , the fun began .
I had Compiz . +1 point .
PCLinuxOS lets you place the Compiz icon into the systray and then allows you to manage all aspects of the windows decorations and 3D effects from there .
So I started playing :
I also changed the default windows decorations manager with Emerald Theme Manager and began changing decorations , marveling like a little boy at the lovely displays of colors dancing before me .
Here 's a few screenshots demonstrating some juicy themes :
3D effects were great fun on PCLinuxOS .
They worked like charm .
I was very much pleased .
Next , I tried multimedia , another hard nut .
Multimedia
I launched Youtube .
Lo and behold , PCLinuxOS was playing my favorite musical piece without any issues .
The quality of both the video and sound were great .
+1 for the distro .
Next , MP3 :
Then , my crazy Windows video :
Another +2 points .
PCLinuxOS has recovered and was not speeding ahead .
But it hardly ends there !
PCLinuxOS 2009 has lots more video & sound tricks up its sleeves .
To keep the suspense up , I will show them a little later , when I review the Applications .
For now , I was ... pleased .
Not being able to boot a laptop is a manslaughter , not having Wireless on a laptop is a killer .
However , everything else worked splendidly .
The distro was also very good looking , far beyond my expectations .
Daring to stake a claim on aesthetics , being a geek and thus , naturally , fashion challenged , I 'd say PCLinuxOS 2009.1 has the nicest default , out - of - the - box Gnome desktop I 've seen in a while .
My live session was not over yet .
Let 's see what else PCLinuxOS offers .
Web camera
It worked flawlessly .
Like Fedora 10 Cambridge , which I reviewed a while ago , PCLinuxOS comes with the incredibly friendly , can 't - get - simpler Cheese Webcam Booth , which works like charm with laptop cameras .
Here we go :
Digital camera
No problems here either .
PCLinuxOS supports a broad range of devices and it picked my Canon camera without a hitch .
The distro uses a gtcam frontend utility to communicate with the hardware .
The score just keep rising and rising .
One last thing about Wireless ...
To be fair , I must say that PCLinuxOS tries to resolve the wireless issues the best it can .
It offers a broad range of Windows ndiswrapper drivers for you , although you do need a wired connection to download them .
My problem was that the physical network device itself was not detected , not the lack of drivers .
Now , applications .
Take a deep breath .
Applications - Almost everything you will ever want
I know I probably sound like a semi-retarded fanboy for claiming this , but it 's the truth .
Of course , you will not have EVERY single program you may need , but the default choice made by the developers is extremely well balanced and rich , including some fairly exotic and unique yet highly useful utilities .
Let 's take a peek .
Have patience , this section is LONG .
Sound & video applications
You may be a fan of Last . fm , so why not use Vagalume ?
Or maybe record a video of your desktop - with recordMyDesktop ?
How about iPods , the Apple stuff ?
You use Floola .
I do n't have an iPod , so I will have to wait until I can pilfer one from one of my ( nonexistent ) friends .
Seriously , I 'll try to get hold of one and then test this utility .
But it exists and comes with the distro , by default .
Let 's not forget the good ole Kino :
And if you want to convert media formats , you can use Mobile Media Converter .
Just take a look at the available , supported formats :
Fancy stuff
You might want to remaster your distro .
PCLinuxOS comes with a handy utility called remaster - on - the - fly .
In just a few quick steps , you can have a distributable , custom - made version of your PCLinuxOS ready for deployment .
Or you may want to check Gmail from your desktop ?
That 's what Checkgmail is for .
Or you may want to monitor the power usage of your system with Power History :
Privacy applications
PCLinuxOS is also friendly when it comes to your privacy .
That 's why you have BleachBit , to scrub away unneeded data safely .
BleachBit works with almost every single aspect of your system .
Cleaning up the distro
With time , your operating system may get cluttered with old , unused configurations .
PCLinuxOS offers you to clean the excess away with Gconf Cleaner .
The word keys here smells like registry , so this is a bit like a registry cleaner , only it works against the hidden configuration files in your home directory .
Restore the Master Boot Record ( MBR )
Yes , you even get this !
When you think more profoundly about this , Linux distros do not usually support MBR restore .
At most , you 'll get GRUB restore , but if you happen to remove Linux from your system or resize / delete partitions on a machine dual - booting with a flavor of Windows , you will end up with an unbootable Windows .
This is highly commendable , as this is a way to " properly " support Linux uninstall , if needed , or help stranded Windows friends .
However , be careful when using the utility , especially if you run as root in the live session , as you may inadvertently ruin your bootloader .
Then , you also have printer utilities for both HP and Epson , something you do n't usually find in every distro .
What is missing ?
Well , something had to give .
PCLinuxOS did have to lose something - office programs .
This is one section that PCLinuxOS is quite lacking .
There is no OpenOffice , although you do have AbiWord and Thunderbird .
Considering the fact the distro was packaged to fit on a CD , some compromises had to be made regarding the choices on the menu , but I believe that PCLinuxOS comes as close as possible to offering an optimal image for the average computer user .
Everything to do with sound and video is just excellent .
Alongside Dreamlinux , PCLinuxOS has the richest multimedia support out of the box of any distros that I have tested .
You have full codec / plugin functionality from the very start in the live session , including Flash , Windows video , MP3 , web camera , digital camera , and more .
Let 's not forget the ability to record your desktop or batch resize images .
Simply marvelous .
Finally , having Synaptic & apt - get as your package manager of choice , getting the missing stuff is a matter of seconds .
We 'll talk a little more about Synaptic soon .
Other stuff
There 's quite a bit to cover here , too .
Let 's talk a bit about the default theme and what it offers .
In a nutshell , it 's the familiar , friendly Gnome looks , soft and round , with smooth gradients of color that do not feel old or outdated .
The contrast is good , including different monitor sizes , resolutions and lighting settings .
You also get a handy right - click context menu , allowing you to easily manipulate your icons .
Synaptic
The last time I tested PCLinuxOS , the repositories were a little slow .
It 's time to see how well the current edition fares .
Synaptic was fast and responsive this time .
It will do anything you want - fast .
I 'm very pleased by the improvement .
Furthermore , Samba sharing worked without any problems , both ways .
My FAT32 and NTFS USB drives were recognized without any problems and automatically mounted for writing .
Proxy configuration ( including auto - proxy scripts ) also worked without a hitch .
Finally , the installation
Ah yes , let 's see how well PCLinuxOS 2009.1 fares here .
There should be no unpleasant surprises .
The 2007 edition was simple and friendly , so it should be even better today .
The installation is a simple affair .
It 's similar to Mandriva , with the partitioning being the " hardest " part , if still quite simple .
In this regard , Ubuntu - like partitioning still remains the simplest of all and should be embraced by other distros .
Still , it 's not a tragedy nor a catastrophe .
You 're advised to take a look at my Mandriva and PCLinuxOS tutorials , which explain in fine detail the delicate ups and downs of partitioning , as well as check out the Mandriva 2009 review ( linked above ) , just for reference .
The installation itself begins shortly thereafter and lasts for about 10 minutes .
Once this stage is done , you will have to configure the bootloader .
Then , a restart and some user configurations .
And you 're done !
It takes about 15 minutes total .
That 's it !
Last but not the least , KDE version
Something for the KDE fans .
The KDE edition is also well done .
The choice of colors leans toward shares of blue rather than black and grays .
An interesting bit of nostalgia is the history - roll splash just before the logging , showing you the past releases of PCLinuxOS .
The desktop :
Take a look at the window border decorations .
The windows are transparent by default and reflect the desktop wallpaper .
The rounded rectangular window buttons look rather nice , although I must admit they remind me a bit of Vista .
Personally , I found the Gnome to be more visually pleasing , including a more professional feel .
But this is entirely a personal choice , so feel free to explore and make your own decision .
BTW , PCLinuxOS KDE is configured for double - click , so it 's friendlier for new users .
Now , let 's take a look at some of the things I 've observed during my ( shorter ) KDE tour .
Proxy issues
While the Gnome version has no problem working with proxy and auto - proxy scripts , the KDE edition was not having the same success .
I tried configuring the options through the KDE Control Panel , without any luck .
Then , I tried using the PCLinuxOS Control Panel , and this time , it worked !
PCLinuxOS 2009.1 KDE has two control panels , which is a bit confusing , especially since the proper , classic KDE one does not function as expected and somewhat clashes a bit with the overall visual style of the distro .
Here we have the standard KDE Control Center :
And here 's the PCLinuxOS Control Center , which is much better looking and works as expected :
I think this duality is a bit confusing and should be avoided , especially since shortcut buttons for both are located on the bottom K - panel .
Applications
The KDE version has a drastically different repertoire of programs .
For one , you have the full OpenOffice suite and a whole range of K- applications .
On the other hand , the multimedia section is somewhat thin , although you get Amarok , MPlayer and DeVeDe .
We 'll talk about DeVeDe separately , in a dedicated tutorial .
Overall , if you 're more Web - inclined , the Gnome edition is the right one for you .
If you like lots of dedicated , single - task programs and require office applications , try the KDE version .
However , in both cases , you can easily get everything you want or need .
Conclusion
PCLinuxOS 2009.1 is a superb distro .
It 's very well made .
In particular , the Gnome edition is the crown jewel of this release , with great stability , fresh looks , and tons of excellent programs across a broad range of sections .
Everything worked flawlessly , out of the box , even in the live session , including any conceivable audio - video related topic you can think of : Flash , MP3 , Windows video media , Last.fm , video recording , digital camera , Web camera , hell , you even get iPod support !
Let 's not forget Compiz and Emerald , either , which make everything even more dazzling .
PCLinuxOS also had no quarrels with my USB disks , Samba sharing or NTFS support .
Then , you get a range of unique programs that really up the ante : remastering , restore MBR , Gmail compatibility , privacy applications , and lots more .
Truly phenomenal .
On the negative side , PCLinuxOS 2009.1 would not boot my old laptop , which is a shame , and there was the Wireless issue on T61 .
This is something that should be fixed .
I 'll gladly work with the developers to get this sorted .
I must say PCLinuxOS is on par with Ubuntu and Linux Mint , when it comes to being friendly and usable and rich .
Hardware support needs some massaging .
But having a few obstacles to clear only makes the development challenge more interesting .
I must say the Gnome version is the top choice here .
The KDE is also great , but feels less modern .
However , either way you choose , you wo n't make a mistake .
PCLinuxOS claims to be a radically simple distro hopper - stopper - and for many , this will indeed be the truth and the whole truth .
PCLinuxOS 2009.1 has been long in baking - but the wait has been worthwhile .
This is a great distro and you wo n't be disappointed .
Do yourself a favor and try it .
Cheers .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In Mesa , Ariz. , President Obama picked an appropriate place to talk about the mortgage - default crisis :
More than half the homes for sale in this sprawling suburban town are distressed properties .
In choosing Arizona as the backdrop for Wednesday 's housing rescue announcement , Obama ventured to a state suffering from high foreclosure numbers .
Arizona had the third - highest rate of foreclosure filings in the nation during 2008 , according to RealtyTrac , which compiles foreclosure statistics .
Mesa itself , as Mayor Scott Smith often remarks , is the biggest city in the country that nobody knows .
It 's a young , sprawling bedroom community of Phoenix that has grown explosively since the end of World War II .
With 452,933 residents as of July 1 , 2007 , it's now the 38th largest city in the nation : bigger than Cleveland , St. Louis or Oakland .
" Mesa is the largest suburban city in the country , " said Scott Butler , the city 's director of government relations , " and it 's symbolic of how the suburbs have been impacted by foreclosures . "
Founded originally by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , the city lies on mostly flat land with some rolling hills in the Valley of the Sun .
Most of it consists of a grid of streets and cul - de - sacs filled with well - kept single - family homes .
The main drags look like nearly every other American suburb , lined with fast food restaurants , gas stations and strip malls .
There are a few blighted areas .
There 's not much industry , but Boeing manufactures the Apache helicopter here .
And it 's the winter home of the Chicago Cubs .
Foreclosure has hit Mesa hard .
" For the first time in our history , we probably have n't grown the past two years , " said Butler .
According to Lynn Murtagh , a real estate broker with Coldwell Banker Residential in Mesa , of the 3,149 current active home - for - sale listings on the market , 25 % are bank - owned properties taken back from homeowners in repossessions or given back by borrowers unable to keep up with their mortgage payments .
Another 27 % are short sales , in which lenders agree to accept a repayment amount less than what is owed on the mortgage and forgive the difference .
That means more than half the homes on the market are so - called " distressed properties . "
Foreclosure growth
The foreclosure problem has accelerated in the Phoenix metro area , which includes Mesa .
More than 6 % of Phoenix housing units received a foreclosure filing during the year , according to RealtyTrac .
That 's the fifth highest foreclosure rate in the nation .
There were 1,079 foreclosure filings issued in Mesa during January 2009 , up 33 % from 12 months earlier - and a whopping 318 % from January 2007 .
The entire Phoenix area was a fiercely expanding bubble market earlier in the decade as the population exploded and flocks of real estate investors from high - priced areas such as California looked to expand .
In those days investors grew rich as home prices crisply appreciated .
The median home price for homes sold during the fourth quarter of 2005 was nearly 50 % higher than 12 months earlier , according to the National Association of Realtors .
Mesa home prices have crashed since then ; they fell 8.2 % during the last three months of 2008 to a median price of $ 164,869 , according to Zillow.com ; they 've declined 22.9 % for the year .
Peak to trough , they 've fallen more than 37 % .
In many neighborhoods price declines are much , much worse .
" You have the situation with many people where they bought a home for maybe $ 225,000 in 2005 and they have it listed now for $ 75,000 , " Murtagh said .
The steep price drops have put many recent homebuyers " upside down " in their mortgages - meaning they owe more than their homes are worth - which makes them very vulnerable to foreclosure .
More than 60 % of the homes bought with mortgages in the past five years in the Phoenix metro area are now upside down , according to Zillow .
According to Murtagh , many Mesa borrowers used exotic mortgage products during the boom .
Those option adjustable rate mortgage ( ARMs ) , hybrid ARMs , no -doc loans and interest only loans are now failing at high rates .
Foreclosures there stem more from these unmanageable mortgages - and falling home prices - than from fundamental economic problems .
The area 's unemployment rate , while it has risen to 6.1 % from 2.7 % in May 2007 , still trails the national average of 7.6 % .
And median household income in Mesa is nearly $ 50,000 , close to the nation as a whole .
But the housing crisis has hit hard .
Many local residents worked in the housing industry : 21 % of male workers were employed in construction during 2007 , the last year statistics were available .
Many others worked in sales , lending , retail and other fields dependent on home sales .
" If we could stop the job losses and find ways to keep people in their homes - maybe by lining up loans with current values - that would be a big help , " said Murtagh .
The housing bust seems to have shaken up Mesa a bit .
But it still has many strengths , including its aerospace industry and its lovely climate , which attract many people there .
" The city has experienced nothing but growth in its entire history , " said Butler .
" We hope to get things turned back around . "
GAZA CITY
UN Children ’s Fund ( UNICEF ) Executive Director Ann M. Veneman recently paid a visit to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory to assess the humanitarian crisis in Gaza , with special focus on children .
As of 5 February , 431 Palestinian children had died and 1,872 had been wounded in the 22 - day Israeli offensive which ended on 18 January , according to the Gaza health ministry .
Veneman spoke to IRIN in Gaza City during her visit .
IRIN : After visiting Gaza , what are your first impressions and priorities ?
Veneman :
We focused on the impact of the conflict on children .
So often children are the ones that are hurt by the wars of adults .
The total population of Gaza is about 1.4 million , of which 56 percent - approximately 793,520 - are children , according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics .
Humanitarian access to all , especially to the most vulnerable , must be unhampered .
IRIN : How are the health and nutrition standards for Gaza ’s children since the recent war ?
Veneman : UNICEF remains concerned that the nutritional status and general health of children in Gaza is likely to deteriorate given the dependency of Gazan families on food aid and cash assistance , as well as the lack of access to clean tap water .
From mid-January , UNICEF has provided basic essential supplements of vitamin A and D , and iron - folate , to 50,000 infants and children under five through health ministry centres and UNRWA [ UN agency for Palestinian refugees ] clinics .
We saw lines of people [ in Gaza ] queuing for gas , fuel and food aid .
Right now many families are living in tents and with relatives .
Certainly a lack of adequate housing can lead to a lack of clean water .
At the end of February , an UNRWA assessment indicated that 2,350 families need to have their homes reconstructed ; 10 , 500 families have homes needing repair , and these figures are likely to rise .
I visited Al - Nasser Children ’s Hospital in Gaza City [ one of two paediatric hospitals in Gaza ] , where UNICEF is providing training and supplies , including incubators , monitoring equipment , and essential drugs .
The hospital is lacking equipment and medical supplies , mostly due to the 18 - month blockade ...
The neonatal unit lacks spare parts that are needed to repair equipment .
Education
Slideshow of Gaza children
Veneman : I visited Jabaliya Co-educational School in north Gaza , under the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) , where UNICEF is providing educational and recreational supplies .
It was surprising how many schools were hit - directly and indirectly , including UNRWA and PA schools and even the American International School was destroyed .
Classrooms were devastated by the attacks and UNICEF has provided tents to facilitate continued learning .
Education is very important to children , creating a sense of normalcy and routine .
Due to the severe damage to six PA schools in northern Gaza , 4,711 students were relocated to seven other PA schools , leading to overcrowding and double shifts .
Prior to the hostilities , 151 schools out of 351 were already working in double shifts due to restrictions imposed on construction materials needed to build additional schools .
Concrete , cement and other construction materials have not been allowed into Gaza since 5 November , hindering major repairs to damaged schools , hospitals and houses , according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) .
School repairs , education supplies and psychosocial support for children remain a priority in the education sector .
In the past week , 50 Early Childhood Development Kits and 57 boxes of children ’s toys from UNICEF were prevented from being transported to Gaza by the Israeli authorities .
According to COGAT , the Israeli civil - military liaison body , the toys were not a humanitarian priority .
Veneman :
It varies within the children themselves - but clearly it has had an impact .
I visited psychological support programmes in northern Gaza run by UNICEF in partnership with the Palestinian Red Crescent Society [ PRCS ] which include art therapy , singing , and stress relieving activities .
In the centre today the children were drawing missiles that were aimed at their houses .
One little girl drew a black area at the bottom of her picture , saying ‘ This is where the dead people are ’ - perhaps indicating a cemetery .
Children must have trained professionals available to help them deal with the trauma and time is of the essence .
Veneman : Palestinian and Israeli children ’s psychosocial well - being and mental health has been severely affected by the recent violence .
The children in Israeli towns and cities neighbouring Gaza have been affected by the conflict and are in need of psychosocial assistance and support .
Children on both sides of the conflict have borne the brunt of the violence for far too long .

For more than a month , Norm Coleman stressed flaws in Minnesota 's election system .
And on Monday , Coleman lawyer Jim Langdon wrote the three - judge panel to suggest the problems are so serious they may not be able to declare a winner .
" Some courts have held that when the number of illegal votes exceeds the margin between the candidates -- and it cannot be determined for which candidate those illegal votes were cast -- the most appropriate remedy is to set aside the election , " Langdon wrote in a letter to the court .
Coleman 's team rested most of his case Monday in the U.S. Senate election trial after more testimony underscoring problems with the election system .
Under questioning from the Republican 's lawyers , Minnesota 's elections director acknowledged inaccurate data in the registration system that could exclude otherwise qualified people from voting .
Now Al Franken 's team will try to convince judges that things are n't so bad after all .
Franken lawyer Marc Elias said the team will begin a case today that will include evidence " about the good job that the state of Minnesota did ... that the hardworking auditors and election night officials did .
How the system worked , by and large . "
But Franken lawyers will walk a tightrope with that strategy , because they also plan to call on voters to testify that their absentee ballots were wrongly rejected .
While Coleman seeks to count 2,000 rejected ballots , the DFLer has a list of 804 rejected ballots he wants reconsidered .
Elias said more than 100 voters could be called to testify , including more than a dozen today .
Coleman rested the bulk of his case as the trial entered its sixth week .
Franken 's side of the trial is likely to last two to three weeks , Elias said .
Franken holds a 225 - vote lead that he gained after the state Canvassing Board , on Jan. 5 , certified the results of a recount .
Penalty imposed
One of the more contentious episodes in the trial so far ended Monday when the judges slapped Coleman with a $ 7,500 fine for failing to disclose a document from a Republican election judge who claimed votes were double - counted in Minneapolis .
But they allowed her testimony to become evidence .
" In the event this sanction fails to deter future conduct on the part of [ Coleman 's ] counsel , the court will not hesitate to impose harsher sanctions , up to and including dismissal [ of the case ] , " the judges wrote .
The dustup involved Republican election judge Pamela Howell , who had appeared briefly twice last week before being dismissed because of the undisclosed documents she had provided the Coleman team .
Howell spoke about hearing a judge at her south Minneapolis precinct announce that some duplicate absentee ballots had been mistakenly fed into a vote tabulator without being labeled , raising the possibility that some votes may have been counted twice .
During an aggressive cross-examination by Franken attorney David Lillehaug , Howell said she was " haunted " by her belief that votes may have been double - counted .
But while she shared her concerns with Coleman lawyers , she did n't speak to a Franken lawyer who tried to contact her .
" I did n't feel it was necessary , " Howell said .
Lillehaug also brought in an e-mail message to Howell from a Coleman lawyer in January telling her they did n't want to file her affidavit detailing her concerns because they wanted to avoid disclosing her statement .
Howell told Lillehaug she did n't make a public statement earlier because , " I did not want the press at my door ... a target on my back . "
She said she felt vulnerable as a Republican living in largely DFL south Minneapolis .
The Coleman lawyers also asked the judges Monday to subtract extra votes that they claim were tallied in Minneapolis precincts during the recount .
They claim votes were counted twice after damaged ballots were copied to fit into tabulating machines on Election Day and the originals were added to the total in the recount .

When creating a User Interface , it ’s important to make it engaging for the user not only from a visual standpoint , but also with interactivity .
With so many JavaScript frameworks readily available , web designers and developers have many tools at their disposal to add slick effects to their UI’s .
Last week , I showed you what could be done with jQuery .
Now let ’s take a look at these 11 tutorials and see what kinds of things MooTools can do for a User Interface .
If you are not familiar with MooTools , it is a popular JavaScript framework designed for the intermediate to advanced JavaScript developer .
We have little to guide us on the question of the existence intelligent life elsewhere in the universe .
But the physicist Enrico Fermi came up with the most obvious question : if the universe is teeming with advanced civilizations , where are they ?
The so - called Fermi Paradox has haunted SETI researchers ever since .
Not least because the famous Drake equation , which attempts put a figure on the number intelligent civilisations out there now , implies that if the number of intelligent civilisations capable of communication in our galaxy is greater than 1 , then we should eventually hear from them .
That overlooks one small factor , says Reginald Smith from the Bouchet - Franklin Institute in Rochester , New York state .
He says that there is a limit to how far a signal from ET can travel before it becomes too faint to hear .
And when you factor that in , everything changes .
Smith uses this idea to derive a minimum density of civilizations below which contact is improbable within a given volume of space .
The calculation depends on factors such as the lifetime of a civilization and the distance that it might be possible to communicate over and it produces some interesting scenarios :
“ Assuming the average communicating civilization has a lifetime of 1,000 years , ten times longer than Earth has been broadcasting , and has a signal horizon of 1,000 light - years , you need a minimum of over 300 communicating civilization in the galactic neighborhood to reach a minimum density . ”
So if there are only 200 advanced civilizations in our galaxy , the chances are that they ’ll never notice each other .
Of course , we ’ve no way of knowing how many advanced civilizations are out there .
But this kind of thinking could , for the first time , put a limit on the number that could be out there : less than 200 perhaps ?
It also has significant implications for Fermi ’s line of thinking .
Would it be too early to say the paradox has been solved ?

Britain 's cyclists reacted in uproar yesterday to a High Court ruling that they can be blamed for their injuries if they do n't wear a helmet – even if the accident itself was caused by someone else .
" There can be no doubt that the failure to wear a helmet may expose the cyclist to the risk of greater injury , " Mr Justice Williams said , making the unprecedented ruling on an accident involving a motorbike and a cycle in Brightlingsea , Essex in June 2005 .
" A cyclist is free to choose whether or not to wear one , " he said in the legal ruling .
But not doing so means " any injury sustained may be the cyclist 's own fault and ' He has only himself to thank for the consequences ' . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The national cyclists ' organisation , CTC , said yesterday that it was considering taking legal action to overturn the " wrong and ill - informed " decision ; other advocates of cycling described it as " absolute rubbish " and " sad " .
The case involved cyclist Robert Smith , then a 51 - year - old NHS manager , who was riding without a helmet to an opera group rehearsal when he was hit by Michael Finch 's motorbike .
He suffered serious brain injuries .
The judge decided that the motorcyclist was " entirely " to blame for the crash because he had been going too fast and had ridden too close to Mr Smith 's bicycle .
He also dismissed Mr Finch 's suggestion that Mr Smith 's injuries were caused by his failure to wear a helmet .
But the judge established the principle of " contributory negligence " for cyclists who ride without a helmet , citing a 1976 court ruling by Lord Denning in relation to seatbelts and advice in the Highway Code .
Roger Geffen , campaigns and policy manager for the CTC , said there was significant doubt about whether helmets increased cyclists ' safety .
After a law requiring helmets to be worn was introduced in Western Australia , the number of cyclists dropped by a third but head injuries fell by just 10 per cent .
Mr Geffen said CTC was investigating ways of overturning the ruling .
" The judge did n't have any evidence before him about the effectiveness of cycle helmets , " he said .
" It just seems he has exceeded his remit .
" It 's a kind of creeping compulsion by the back door and it leaves cyclists in a state of uncertainty .
There 's a feeling you might have to wear a helmet because you are legally at risk .
" What we know overall is that wherever helmet - wearing has increased , it has n't improved cycle safety .
We certainly feel the ruling is wrong and ill - informed .
We need legal advice . "
A spokesman for the Department for Transport said the Government had commissioned research on cycle safety , which would look at the effectiveness of helmets and report back in September 2010 .
The former shadow transport secretary , Bernard Jenkin MP , whose North Essex constituency includes Brightlingsea , said he would raise the High Court ruling – which was made in January but only came to light yesterday – with the Government .
Mr Jenkin , deputy chairman of the all - party cycling group , said : " The judge is clearly not a cyclist and he 's exhibiting all the prejudices of someone who does not regularly use a bicycle . "
Dr Ian Walker , a Bath University psychologist , carried out a study which found passing motorists tended to give a cyclist without a helmet a wider berth than one wearing one .
He said it was " quite strange " that the judge had set a precedent for a situation which did not apply to the accident he was considering .
In the Keynesian heydays of the 1950s and 1960s , most economists and policy makers believed in the  Phillips Curve ,  which was the ( alleged ) tradeoff between unemployment and price inflation .
The idea was that the Federal Reserve could cure a recession by printing money , or that the Fed could cure runaway inflation by jacking up interest rates .
Each of these moves had its downside , of course , but the point was that the Fed could choose one poison or the other .
This Keynesian orthodoxy was shattered in the 1970s when the United States suffered through stagflation ,  which was high unemployment and high inflation .
This outcome was not supposed to be possible , according to the popular macroeconomics models , and it left policy makers with no clear choice .
If the Fed raised rates to stem the inflation , it would hurt the economy even more , but if the Fed cut rates ( through printing more money ) the inflation problem would worsen .
The vacuum created by this crisis in both theory and policy was filled by the Reagan Revolution and supply - side economics .
At this stage nothing is certain , but the country is currently headed straight into a period of very rapid price hikes and a very bad recession .
It would not surprise me at all if the national unemployment rate and the annualized rate of consumer price inflation both broke through into double digits by the end of 2009 .
Moreover , regardless of when it actually starts , I predict that things will get much worse before they get better , and that the United States will be mired in a malfunctioning economy for at least a decade , with price inflation in the double - digits ( possibly higher ) the entire time .
We can call this condition hyper - depression . 
As with stagflation during the 1970s , hyper - depression will blow up the prevailing cutting edge models of the macroeconomy .
Back when he was an academic , Fed Chair Ben Bernanke was actually an expert on the Great Depression .
Bernanke adheres to the ( alleged ) lesson taught by Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz in their classic A Monetary History of the United States .
F&S argued that Fed officials bore a large share of the blame for the Great Depression , because they did not pump in enough liquidity .
The quantity of money actually declined by about a third from 1929 — 1933 , as panicked customers withdrew cash from the banks .
( In a fractional reserve banking system , when people withdraw deposits , the banks have to shrink their outstanding checking balances because of reserve requirements . )
As the following chart illustrates , Bernanke has taken Friedman ’s warning to heart :
The Fed has more than doubled its balance sheet since the financial crisis began , leading to an unprecedented jump in the monetary base :
Thus far , this enormous injection of new reserves into the banking system has n’t caused the CPI to explode , but that is because ( a ) the banks are mostly sitting on the new reserves because they are all terrified , and ( b ) the public ’s demand for cash balances has risen sharply .
But using very back - of - the - envelope calculations , there is now enough slack in the system so that if banks calmed down and lent out the maximum amount of reserves , the public ’s total money stock could increase by a factor of 10 .
There is no way that the public will simply add that new money to its checking accounts or home safes without increasing their spending .
Eventually , prices quoted in U.S. dollars will start shooting upward .
All of the financial analysts are aware of this threat , but they foolishly reassure us ,  Bernanke will unwind the Fed ’s holdings once the economy improves . 
But this commits the same mistake as the Keynesians during the 1970s :
What happens when the CPI begins rising several percentage points per month , and unemployment is still in the double digits ?
What would Bernanke do at that point ?
Expecting the Fed chief to relinquish his new role of buying hundreds of billions in assets at whim , in the midst of a severe recession , would be akin to hoping that a dictator would end his declaration of emergency  martial law in the middle of a civil war .
There are even many free market economists who are predicting that the Fed ’s massive money - pumping will fix the economy , at least for a while , but at the cost of high price inflation .
Yet these analysts do n’t realize that they are buying into — what we all thought was — the discredited Phillips Curve .
The 1970s proved that the Fed cannot fix structural problems with the economy by showering it with new money .
Hyper - depression is simply stagflation squared .
People need to stop wondering ,  When will the market find its bottom ?
This month ?
Next ?
The federal government has already done an incalculable amount of damage to the American financial sector , and the insults keep growing .
Think of it : Besides the unpredictable sometimes we seize you , sometimes we take billions of bad assets off your books , sometimes we let you fail strategy with respect to major financial institutions , the government has also done childish things such as ban short - selling of financial stocks .
No one knows what the rules will be next week in these markets .
Only a fool would expose new capital to the American financial sector at this point — and the politicians have the gall to wonder ,  Why are the laissez - faire credit markets frozen ? 
Market interest rates are prices and as such they communicate important information about real , underlying scarcity .
When the central banks of the world decided to drive interest rates down to practically zero , they crippled the ability of the world economy to heal itself after the overconsumption of the housing boom .
People all over the world need to be saving right now , and yet governments are doing everything they can to squander what ’s left of the capital stock .
I had resisted predicting that we are now living through the early period of the Great Depression II .
After all , the conventional statistics today are nowhere near as bad as they were in the 1930s .
However , the recent tussle over AIG bonus payments convinced me that we are in this one for the long haul .
In particular , Senator Charles Schumer ’s comments — and the proposed legislation to back them up — show that we no longer have property rights in this country :
 My colleagues and I are sending a letter to [ AIG CEO ] Mr. Liddy informing him that he can go right ahead and tell these employees that are scheduled to get bonuses that they should voluntarily return them , because if they do n’t , we plan to virtually tax all of it .
He should tell these employees if they do n’t give the money back , we ’ll put in place a new law , that will allow us to [ tax ] these bonuses at a very high rate , so that it ’s returned to its rightful owners , the taxpayers .
So for those of you who are getting these bonuses , be forewarned :
You will not be getting to keep them . 
This is an extremely dangerous precedent .
It ’s true — as many outraged callers to the AM talk shows explain — AIG received billions in government handouts , and so there is a plausible case to be made that those contractual arrangements with its executives should have been amended .
But if that ’s the case , then the government should have made that a condition of the original loan ,  or at the very least the government should now exercise its power as the de facto owner of AIG .
Liddy was handpicked by the government to run the company , so if the politicians do n’t like his decisions , they should fire him .
In contrast , look what Schumer & Co. have done .
They are establishing the precedent that if a particular group of rich people does something that angers the government , and if this group happens to be wildly unpopular with the general public , then it is noble for the government to implement ex post facto changes to the tax code , singling these people out and basically robbing them .
Schumer ’s speech against AIG executives is not much different from him declaring ,  So I say to Rush Limbaugh and other talk show hosts :
Go ahead and continue preaching your hatred and pessimism about the U.S. economy ; this is a free country and you have the right to do that .
But be forewarned that we are crafting new legislation that will tax 90 percent of your ad revenues from doing so . 
What people need to realize is that the government is going to keep making this worse .
In other words , it is not enough to step back and say ,  Well , the feds have already partially nationalized the entire banking system , and brought politics into all major business decisions — including how executives choose to travel to business meetings .
What are the effects ?
On the contrary , we need to realize that as things continue to deteriorate — and they will — the Obama Administration will keep upping the ante .
 What ?
The first stimulus did n’t work ?
OK let ’s borrow and spend another $ 1 trillion ; maybe that will ‘ take . ’
The American people need to prepare themselves for hyper - depression .
The future is still uncertain , and if the folks in Washington suddenly found free market religion , that terrible outcome could be avoided .
But I ’m not holding my breath .

Despite what a lot of people seem to think , I do not use these pages here to argue for or against the existence of God .
As most skeptics will agree , it 's not possible to prove God exists , and you certainly can't prove a negative .
However , what I can argue against are some claims on this topic .
Do people see God in a pattern of wood grain , or is that just our eyes and brains interpreting random patterns after hundreds of millennia of evolutionary pressure to do so ?
Does a statue really weep milk , or is it fraud ?
Does intercessory prayer actually work , or does study after study show it does not ?
I hope you see the difference .
It 's important .
I 'll also note that I have but one single commenting policy on this blog : do n't be a jerk .
It has broad ramifications , of course , but it does really cover the rules I enforce .
So I 'll admit that I should delete this comment that was made on my post last week about creationism , since it obviously violates the rule .
But sometimes it 's important that we see just how breathtakingly inane some arguments are , yet they never seem to die .
Here is the comment , in its entirety :
You people are idiots : March 22nd , 2009 at 2:57 am Just some quick questions :
How was the Universe created ?
The Big Bang ?
Oh .
So where did the material that caused the Big Bang come from ?
Where did the “ spark ” that ignited the Big Bang come from ?
There is the flaw in your theory that it all happened by “ accident ” and not by design .
No matter how you answer , the next question will be :
And where did THAT come from ?
Eventually , you will have to answer : I do n’t know .
And God will be there saying : I do .
Now , ignoring the stunning hypocrisy of someone preaching the word of God and calling us all idiots , there is an obvious , gaping flaw in this commenter 's logic , well - known to skeptics for years : if you ask where the Big Bang came from , why can't you ask the same thing of God ?
When a person like this is asked who or what created God , the standard answer is that God always existed .
But why can't we say the same about the Universe itself ?
It 's entirely possible the Universe is a part of a larger structure , a metaverse , if you will , that always existed and always will .
Our understanding of the nature of time is still incomplete , so something like this is not out of the question .
But the details of this are n't terribly important ; the key thing here is the pot calling the kettle black .
This so - called flaw in the Big Bang theory , if it is a flaw , is also a flaw in the supposition that God always existed as well .
As such , it 's a terrible argument for the existence of God .
My favorite part of the comment , though , is the statement , " Eventually , you will have to answer : I do n’t know . "
As usual , someone like this has it exactly backwards : we can say that right now we do n't know .
But the thing is , science learns .
The greatest mysteries of today are undergraduate homework problems in 20 years .
That 's the strength of science .
Dogma , however , is unswerving , unbending , unyielding , and unable to learn .
What the commenter has done is used a fallacy called " the God of the gaps " , inserting God into the gaps in your knowledge .
But as we learn more , the gaps narrow .
And when the gap is filled , what of God ?
This is the trap of the zealot : when new evidence comes along contradicting their position , they have to either ignore it or lie about it .
New evidence is coming in all the time , too .
I hope the commenter keeps up with modern cosmology .
And finally , I will simply ask : if there is evidence of design , where is it ?
I 've seen many claims , but they always fall short .
Remember , the claimants come here , so if they want to persuade me then I need to see the evidence on my own terms .
And I will not count a book that makes claims from revelation , because that 's not evidence .
Look , if you want to believe in God with no evidence , or even despite evidence , that is your right ; it 's everyone 's right .
But if you want to persuade others using a scientific basis , or show that our current scientific ideas are wrong , then you 'd better have something more than " Because I say so . "
Obviously , coming into this argument armed only with that ... well , there 's only one way to win using that .
After taking a look at this AJAX tutorial and a couple others , I was disappointed at the quality of the code so here ’s a quick tutorial to get you jump started with AJAX ( Asynchronous JavaScript + XML ) .
I am using object detection and explain some of the caveats for doing what I am doing .
Simply put , AJAX allows you to make a call to an http server ( typically an RSS feed or a webpage ) , get its content and load them into your existing page without having to refresh the whole page .
This means that services like email do n’t have to reload the whole page every time you click a message , saving on bandwidth ( loading the header / footer all over again ) and making things more efficient .
On to the AJAX code :
function loadurl ( dest ) { try { // Moz supports XMLHttpRequest .
IE uses ActiveX . // browser detction is bad .
object detection works for any browser xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest?new XMLHttpRequest ( ) : new ActiveXObject ( " Microsoft.XMLHTTP " ) ; } catch ( e ) { // browser does n't support ajax .
handle however you want } // the xmlhttp object triggers an event everytime the status changes // triggered ( ) function handles the events xmlhttp.
onreadystatechange = triggered ; // open takes in the HTTP method and url . xmlhttp.open ( " GET " , dest ) ; // send the request .
if this is a POST request we would have // sent post variables : send ( " name=aleem&gender=male ) //
Moz is fine with just send ( ) ; but // IE expects a value here , hence we do send ( null ) ; xmlhttp.send ( null ) ; } function triggered ( ) { // if the readyState code is 4 ( Completed ) // and http status is 200 ( OK ) we go ahead and get the responseText // other readyState codes : // 0 = Uninitialised 1 =Loading 2 =Loaded 3 =Interactive if ( ( xmlhttp.readyState == 4 ) && ( xmlhttp.status == 200 ) ) { // xmlhttp.responseText object contains the response .
document.getElementById(" output " ) .innerHTML
= xmlhttp.responseText ; } }
The above code goes between the html < head ></ head > tags .
The corresponding html body would be :
< body > < div id =" output " onclick = " loadurl ( '/resume/resume.txt ' ) " > click here to load my resume into this div</div > </ body >
The destination URL for an AJAX request has to be in the same domain or a security error might be thrown depending on your security settings .
Here ’s a working example ( it loads my resume ) :

Rove agrees to be deposed under oath after three subpoenas John Byrne
Published : Wednesday March 4 , 2009
Print This Email This Update at bottom : Obama White House reportedly pushed deal , Bush conversations off the table
The House Judiciary Committee announced late Wednesday afternoon that they had secured the agreement of former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers to testify in transcribed depositions under threat of perjury .
The Committee did not immediately announce what terms , if any , had been reached with Rove , but said the agreement had been made with representatives of the former Bush Administration .
They did say that they would get access to Administration documents , and that Rove and Miers had agreed to testify publicly if called .
But the announcement left open the possibility that Rove and Miers could testify in private .
" The Committee has also reserved the right to have public testimony from Rove and Miers , " House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) said in a statement .
Rove 's attorney , Robert Luskin , said the agreement was " good news . "
The " agreement is good news , " Luksin said in an emailed statement .
" Mr. Rove looks forward to addressing the Committee 's concerns " and is " pleased that the Committee and President Bush were able to resolve their differences . "
" Mr. Rove has consistently maintained that he would not assert any personal privileges to refuse to appear or testify , but was required to follow the direction of the President on matters of executive privilege , " Luskin added .
Conyers subpoenaed
Rove once in 2008 and twice this year .
In his statement , he appeared to be open to some claims of executive privilege during the depositions .
The Bush Administration had claimed that Rove and Miers were prohibited from testifying by presidential privilege when they were subpoenaed regarding the firings of nine US Attorneys .
" It was agreed that invocations of official privileges would be significantly limited , " the release said .
Conyers said he believed the developments are a breakthrough .
" I have long said that I would see this matter through to the end and am encouraged that we have finally broken through the Bush Administration 's claims of absolute immunity , " he said in a statement .
" This is a victory for the separation of powers and congressional oversight .
It is also a vindication of the search for truth .
I am determined to have it known whether US Attorneys in the Department of Justice were fired for political reasons , and if so , by whom . "
The Committee also released other information about the agreement .
" If the Committee uncovers information necessitating his testimony , the Committee will also have the right to depose William Kelley , a former White House lawyer who played a role in the U.S. Attorney firings , " the Committee said .
" The Committee will also receive Bush White House documents relevant to this inquiry , " they continued .
" Under the agreement , the landmark ruling by Judge John Bates rejecting key Bush White House claims of executive immunity and privilege will be preserved .
If the agreement is breached , the Committee can resume the litigation . "
The House Judiciary Committee Chairman has subpoenaed Rove three times regarding his role in the firings of US Attorneys and his alleged involvement in the prosecution of a former Alabama governor .
He failed to show up all three times for scheduled depositions .
Rove has denied any involvement in the Alabama governor 's case .
He was also subpoenaed by the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007 , and did not appear .
The House Judiciary Committee 's full statement follows .
House Judiciary Committee Secures Rove and Miers Testimony in U.S. Attorney Firings
In an agreement reached today between the former Bush Administration and Congressman John Conyers , Jr. ( D - Mich . ) , Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , Karl Rove and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers will testify before the House Judiciary Committee in transcribed depositions under penalty of perjury .
The Committee has also reserved the right to have public testimony from Rove and Miers .
It was agreed that invocations of official privileges would be significantly limited .
In addition , if the Committee uncovers information necessitating his testimony , the Committee will also have the right to depose William Kelley , a former White House lawyer who played a role in the U.S. Attorney firings .
The Committee will also receive Bush White House documents relevant to this inquiry .
Under the agreement , the landmark ruling by Judge John Bates rejecting key Bush White House claims of executive immunity and privilege will be preserved .
If the agreement is breached , the Committee can resume the litigation .
Chairman Conyers issued the following statement :
" I have long said that I would see this matter through to the end and am encouraged that we have finally broken through the Bush Administration 's claims of absolute immunity .
This is a victory for the separation of powers and congressional oversight .
It is also a vindication of the search for truth .
I am determined to have it known whether U.S. Attorneys in the Department of Justice were fired for political reasons , and if so , by whom . "

Obama White House reportedly pushed deal , Bush conversations off the table
A copy of the deal posted by TPMMuckraker Thursday morning reveals that Rove 's conversations with Bush are off the table .
" The scope of the interviews will be limited to : ( 1 ) facts relating to the evaluation of , decision to dismiss , or decision to replace the former U.S. Attorneys in question ; the alleged decisions to retain certain U.S. Attorneys ; and any allegations of selective prosecution related thereto ; and ( 2 ) testimony or representations made by Department of Justice officials to Congress on the U.S. Attorneys matter , " the ' Agreement Concerning Accomodation ' reads .
" For the period beginning on March 9 , 2007 ( the date of the Committee 's first written demand for information from the White House ) , interviews will not include the content of conversations involving : ( i ) Mr. Rove and members of the White House Counsel 's office ; or ( ii ) Ms. Miers and members of the White House Counsel 's office .
In the case of Mr. Rove , the interview also will include facts relating to the prosecution of Alabama governor Don Siegelman . "
TPM asks ,
" And when can Rove and Miers claim executive privilege ? "
" As to official privileges , counsel will direct witnesses not to respond to questions only when questions relate to communications to or from the President or when questions are outside the scope of questioning set forth above , " the brokered arrangement states .
Reporting for Newsweek , Michael Isikoff reveals , " President Obama 's White House lawyers played a critical behind - the - scenes role in brokering an agreement that requires George W. Bush 's former aides Karl Rove and Harriet Miers to testify before Congress about the mass firings of U.S. attorneys , according to congressional and White House sources . "
" Obama 's aides were anxious to put a stop to an ongoing court battle over executive privilege that could have backfired on them , said the sources , who asked not to be identified talking about sensitive matters , " Isikoff continues .
Excerpts from Isikoff 's Newsweek report :

The active involvement of Obama White House counsel Gregory Craig and his associates in pushing for a settlement shows how stark positions taken during the campaign often look different when a new president has taken office .
As a candidate last year , Obama sharply criticized the Bush administration for making sweeping claims of executive privilege to shield testimony about the U.S. attorney firings .
" This blanket notion that you can't subpoena White House aides where there 's evidence of genuine wrongdoing I think is completely misguided , " he said last year .
But if the dispute over executive privilege had n't been settled by Wednesday night , Obama 's lawyers would have been put in the uncomfortable position of having to defend Rove and Miers in court .
The alternative would have been to accept the possibility of a judicial ruling that might have impinged on the confidentiality of their own discussions about sensitive issues should those discussions later become the subject of congressional investigations .
Craig even faced the politically embarrassing prospect of being named ( along with Miers and possibly Rove ) as a defendant in the court case , given that five boxes of documents about the U.S. attorney firings have been sitting in his office for the past six weeks .
Craig became the official custodian of the documents , which have never been made public , after Jan. 20 .

For one whose place in history is not so much secure as gloriously , unquestionably assured , Paul McCartney behaves as though there is some doubt .
He is , lest we forget , not just any old ex-Beatle , but the Beatle .
At least since John departed .
That insecurity is why he decided to rewrite history by bowdlerising Let It Be when he removed Phil Spector 's production - rescue job , the one thing that made the album listenable .
And it 's surely why he engineered that silly hullaballoo about having some Beatles songs credited to McCartney / Lennon rather than Lennon / McCartney .
And , as if he were Gary Lightbody rather than Paul McCartney , he so desperately wants to be taken seriously .
Hence the Fireman , the Liverpool Oratorio and that time he played celery with Super Furry Animals .
Now , he 's picked over the Beatles ' carcass again and unearthed Carnival of Light , apparently an improvised 14 - minute , vaguely avant - garde jam session recorded during the Penny Lane sessions .
And he wants to release it .
If he could n't let Let It Be be - and in fairness , for all the pointless carnage he wrought , he 'd always hated Spector 's contribution - could n't he at least show some decorum here ?
If Carnival of Light sees the light of day , is it going to enhance the Beatles ' standing ?
That 's the very same Beatles who changed the world and whose influence and reputation remains undimmed .
Of course it is n't .
Is it going to make us think slightly less of them ?
In all probability , yes , and I 'm inclined to trust the judgment of Ringo Starr , George Harrison and Yoko Ono , who vetoed its inclusion on Anthology and who ( with Olivia Harrison standing in for George ) will hopefully do their duty again this time .
Carnival of Light may be the greatest 14 minutes in Beatledom and some people ( ie me ) are going to look pretty foolish if that 's the case .
Even so , I 'd bet my sub - prime mortgage that it is n't and that phrase " 14 - minute jam session " strikes fear into the hearts of stouter men than myself .
It 's a soundcheck - esque rehearsal at best .
At worst , it 's Phish .
McCartney says it 's the Beatles going " off - piste " , or in other words , messing about .
Frankly , I 'd much rather hear them on - piste , crafting moments of genius such as Penny Lane .
If Carnival of Light was n't good enough to be released nearly 40 years ago ( or on Anthology ) then it 's not now .
We 've got the Beatles ' body of work .
It changed everything .
Is n't that enough ?

Advertisement A couple who were caught on CCTV cameras simulating sex to torment their neighbours have both been given two - year restraining orders .
Gary Jarman , 41 , and Sandra French , 50 , of Bull Drove in Wrangle , Lincolnshire , also verbally abused their neighbours during a three - year campaign .
They were convicted of causing harassment without violence last month .
The couple were also ordered to pay £ 250 each in costs during sentencing at Boston Magistrates ' Court .
' Bizarre behaviour '
The court had heard that Jarman verbally abused his neighbours while the pair also pretended to have sex in their car in view of CCTV cameras set up to record their antics .
The couple , who are both unemployed , were told they could not contact the four neighbours they harassed .
The court heard Sandra French wrote " pervert " on her jumper Deputy District Judge Alan Fowler said the CCTV cameras , which had been pointed into the couple 's back garden by the four neighbours , did invade their privacy but they were entitled to do this by law as they were detecting a crime .
He said : " The response of Mr Jarman and Miss French to the cameras was entirely unnecessary and bizarre in the extreme , with Miss French holding up her jumper and walking up and down with a sign saying ' pervert ' on it .
" Behaving in the way they did was very odd . "
He added : " What happened , from what I saw on the CCTV and I heard in evidence , was that the behaviour of Miss French and Mr Jarman , which they cannot deny because there is visible evidence , was bizarre behaviour which amounted to harassment . "
Jarman was also ordered to do 40 hours unpaid community service and French will have to be supervised by probation officers for six months .

In 1807 , Thomas Jefferson , the founding father and amateur paleontologist , sent William Clark to dig for fossils at a place in Kentucky called Big Bone Lick .
Exactly 200 years later I ’m stopping to see the fossils at Big Bone Lick , which is now a state park commemorating the birthplace of American vertebrate paleontology .
It ’s a hot , white - sky day and the park is full of picnickers , fishermen , and campers .
There used to be mineral springs here and , before they dried up , Big Bone Lick was a destination for those seeking their medicinal value .
Today , the parking lot is full of minivans .
A dad is angry because someone spilled soda in the back seat ; another one yells at everyone to stop fooling around and get back inside the car already .
The park ’s small visitor center is lined with fossils of the animals that roamed the area during the last Ice Age ; behind it is an outdoor diorama with a full - size , plastic mastodon , mammoth , and giant sloth stuck in a small grassy pit , just as they may have looked thousands of years ago .
Many years after Clark sent fossils from Big Bone Lick back to Jefferson , scientists proved that they were more than 15,000 years old .
This knowledge would likely have satisfied Jefferson who — though he died believing the mastodon still existed — would ’ve been pleased , at least , to be proven wrong by true scientific inquiry .
If he were alive today , Jefferson would surely agree with the long - established scientific fact that the earth is billions of years old .
And the founding father might be displeased that so many of his compatriots — about half of all Americans , in fact — do not accept this scientific fact .
I ’m standing in Big Bone Lick ’s crowded visitor center , idly trying to figure out which half of this crowd believes in evolution , and which half are creationists .
It ’s a question that ’s on my mind .
In an hour or so , I will drive 15 minutes north to Petersburg , where I will visit the brand new $ 27 - million Creation Museum , built to educate nonbelievers in the creationists ’ notion that , among other things , the earth is only 6,000 years old , that dinosaurs walked with humans , and that the universe was literally made in six days .
A woman working the front desk tells a disappointed family that , no , there are n’t any more reservations available for the season , but that other parks nearby should have some .
I ask her what she thinks of the new Creation Museum .
She throws up her hands .
“ Hey , I work here , we dig , things happen , ” she says as she trades places with a co-worker to take a break .
“ I believe in God , he believes in me .
And other than that , I do n’t know . ”
Leah Cridlin , who ’s camping in the park , overhears us talking about the Creation Museum and tells me about a small road I can take to Petersburg to get a great view of the Ohio River , and about how I should stop in Rabbit Hash , where the general store sells “ Coke , in glass bottles ! ”
Leah is from Hebron , just beyond the Cincinnati / Northern Kentucky International Airport , and is here with her husband and children and an aunt , Gayle .
We all walk together down a dry dirt road to see the buffalo kept here as a nod to their long ( though diminished ) presence in the area .
We look at the newest buffalo , just a few days old , and Gayle shows me how to pull the nectar from a honeysuckle flower .
As we walk back , I ask Gayle what she thinks of the Creation Museum .
She tells me that she has n’t been , but as a Christian who believes in a literal Genesis , she ’s interested .
I ask her what , then , she makes of the information on display here at Big Bone Lick .
She shrugs .
“ Man can come up with almost anything .
If you have faith , you do n’t have to worry about these things , about evidence . ”
We part in the parking lot after she makes sure I know how to get to Rabbit Hash .
As I walk away she calls after me .
“ God bless you in your writings . ”

Petersburg is a small , unassuming town just a few miles off an interstate that leaves Cincinnati and continues into the quiet , rolling countryside of Kentucky ’s northwestern corner .
Not all that much happens here .
There ’s a Vacation Bible Camp and some church picnics .
There ’s a concrete boat ramp at the bank of the Ohio River , and a few picnic tables that overlook the water .
The population of Boone County has more than doubled to 110,000 in just over 15 years .
But Petersburg , tucked in a bridgeless stretch of the river , has n’t changed much at all .
Here , at a bend on Bullittsburg Church Road , the entrance to the Creation Museum is marked by a black gate and creamy stone columns topped with sculptures of Stegosaurus .
You might think the museum ’s proximity to Big Bone Lick would have been a problem for Answers in Genesis ( AiG ) , the evangelical ministry that constructed it .
But rather than shy away from the presence of a landmark in the history of science and evolution , AiG embraces it .
In fact , the group ’s original plan was to build across from Big Bone Lick in an attempt to more strongly contrast what the ministry calls its “ science ” with that of the park’s .
There was local opposition , as there inevitably is whenever creationists push for a change in school curriculum or , say , propose a 60,000 - square foot Biblical interpretation of the fossil record , and the county refused to rezone that property .
But in the ongoing battle between creationists and evolutionists , it turns out that there is one practical concern more important than winning the debate :
If you ’re trying to create a creationism museum , you first need a site to build one .
So AiG shrugged its collective shoulders and shifted focus from Big Bone Lick to Petersburg .
The museum here is n’t the first devoted to a literal interpretation of the Bible ’s opening book .
There ’s also the 7 Wonders Creation Museum near Mt. St. Helens , the Museum of Earth History in Eureka Springs , Arkansas , and the Institute for Creation Research ’s Museum of Creation and Earth History in Santee , California .
This summer , the Big Valley Creation Science Museum opened to less fanfare in a small , vinyl - sided building in Alberta , Canada .
AiG ’s museum in Petersburg , however , is the biggest creationist museum in the country and , AiG boasts , the most “ professional . ”
The ministry brought in Patrick Marsh , the designer behind Universal Studios ’ Jaws and King Kong attractions .
At Universal , Marsh used special effects to build a fear of killer sharks and giant gorillas .
In Petersburg , he ’s used the same tools to build a fear of God .
The Creation Museum also draws the most on the conventions of traditional natural history museums , including the rush for interactivity and entertainment as a means of reaching young minds .
Qualities like these led believers to pony up the entire $ 27 million in construction costs , leaving the museum debt - free , according to its builders .
They ’re also what AiG hopes will attract 250,000 people every year to this sleepy corner of Kentucky .
There is a planetarium here , and just like those in science museums it has padded seats that recline and provide a simulated view of the cosmos .
Unlike other planetariums , this one displays outer space and the scale of solar bodies as proof of a Creator : Life as we know it exists on Earth because of the planet ’s distance from the sun ; move it a smidge either way , and life dies .
This simply ca n’t be due to chance , the museum asserts .
There are traditional , somewhat creepy wax figures .
They ’re used in a walk - through scene that demonstrates the scale of Noah ’s Ark .
Miniature dioramas tell the story of the flood .
One shows pairs of animals marching to the ark , dinosaurs among the giraffes and elephants .
Another shows half - inch high humans clinging to the last bit of dry land as floodwaters raise the Ark but sweep away most of mankind .
Here , the big flood question — where ’d all that water come from ? — is answered :
There ’s more than enough water to cover the Earth , so long as it ’s completely flat .
This is complemented by a video that shows water rushing from the hidden side of the planet to the front , the land unchanging .
In another hall there ’s an animatronic dinosaur crouched just feet away from a smiling , dark - skinned animatronic girl who holds a carrot .
One room is lined with black and white photos depicting the world ’s pain : a growling wolf , a starving child , a mushroom cloud , piles of bones , and a woman suffering the agony of birth .
Culture in Crisis is a dark alley , trash - filled and graffiti-covered ; on the walls are magazine stories on the Terry Shiavo case , gay teens , Columbine , Muslim suicide bombers and the Atlanta Olympics attack — examples of what happens when society turns from Christianity .
Further down the hall , videos show scenes of a young man looking at pornography online , a young girl discussing abortion with a friend , and what seems to be a teenager popping pills in church .
This hall also has traditional museum signs that , instead of explaining a scientific point , suggest additional pitfalls .
One says that over half of all women have sex outside of marriage , and that one in three pregnancies will end in abortion .
Another says that “ the Christian Church in this country will be dead and buried within 40 years , ” according to an unnamed 2003 British report on church attendance .
The rest of the museum is based on a model AiG calls “ The Seven C’s of History . ”
There ’s creation , corruption , catastrophe , confusion , Christ , cross , and consummation .
But despite billing itself as a “ museum of natural and spiritual history , ” the only real natural history ( AiG ’s version of natural history , that is ) , comes in the first C , creation .
There ’s a diorama of two paleontologists working at one dig site .
A video says that they ’re looking at the same evidence from two different perspectives :
One is using the Bible , the other is n’t .
Another video questions whether years of river erosion are required for canyons to form , or if the process could n’t have happened much faster .
One room , Wonders of Creation , is simply a collection of nature photography with basic labels that read , “ Bacteria : Magical Complexity , ” “ Eyes : Exquisitely Designed Windows to the World , ” and “ Creatures of the Sea : Designed to Swim . ”
The purpose or meaning of all this is not entirely clear .
•
“ First rate ! ” and “ world class ! ” and “ so high quality ! ” and “ so state - of - the - art ! ” That ’s how the Creation Museum ’s creators and supporters describe it .
“ The response has been , ‘ Wow , this place is so professional , so first - class , ’ ” said Ken Ham , the bearded , thin - eyed Australian who founded Answers in Genesis in 1994 .
“ Christians are stereotyped as having second - rate quality in the things they do .
I hope we ’re setting a new standard . ”
It ’s hard to say whether the Biblical exhibits are actually “ first rate ” and “ world class , ” since there is n’t a whole lot to compare them to .
But they do n’t look cheap .
The wax figures are as professional as those in Madame Tussaud’s .
Adam and Eve are the most represented .
The real Adam , ashamed as he ’s said to have been , would probably be mortified by the muscled yet strangely round belly designers gave him .
Eve , however , is spared : Though Genesis says they were created nude , no delicate areas are visible .
Still , there ’s something strangely erotic in the two canoodling under the trees as a dinosaur watches with what looks like a knowing half - smile .
When they ’re bathing together in a pool , the sound of a waterfall strong in the background , lily pads cover their lower halves .
The water level is as low as it can be , though .
Suggestion makes the scene more titillating than if AiG had gone ahead and shown everything .
After all , traditional museums show penises and breasts , and nobody walks away from Neanderthal exhibits hot under the collar .
The museum ’s gift shop is the Dragon Hall Bookstore .
The name might surprise anyone who ’s heard Christian protests of Harry Potter and Dungeons & Dragons .
But it makes sense if you see the film Dinosaurs and Dragons in the museum ’s basement .
Ancient dragon myths , it claims , are proof that dinosaurs walked the Earth with humans .
They only died out after Noah ’s flood , when the limited number of plants diminished their numbers to the point at which humans could finish them off .
Further creationism education is available in Dragon Hall .
Its book titles include Grand Canyon : Monument to Catastrophe , One Small Speck to Man : The Evolution Myth , and Darwin ’s Demise : Why Evolution Ca n’t Take the Heat .
DVDs include Inherently Wind : A Hollywood History of the Scopes Trial , It Does n’t Take a Ph.D. and Lucy : She ’s no Lady .
A museum centerpiece is the special effects theater .
When I ’m waiting for the show to begin I meet a couple , Michael and Judy Call , who ’ve driven up from Tampa for the opening .
Michael uses AiG ’s materials in his Sunday School classes .
They have n’t seen much yet , but are already impressed by the museum .
They both concur : “ High quality . ”
“ In order to capture the attention of young people , you ’ve got to be whiz - bang , ” Michael tells me .
Judy nods .
“ We know how important the whiz - bang is — we ’re from Florida and Disney . ”
The show we see is called Men in White .
In the theater , we watch as Wendy , an animatronic girl , stares at a desolate , nighttime Western landscape projected across three screens , contemplating life and its meaning .
“ Does anyone even know I ’m here ?
Is there any kind of meaning ?
Did God create all this or did we just invent God ? ”
Wendy asks .
She ’s not addressing anyone , but two angels appear to answer .
These are not the harp - playing angels of yesterday .
They ’re dressed in white , sure , but seem to have sprung from a middle - aged adult ’s idea of what is young , hip , and now .
In this case , that ’s dark sunglasses and a dated surfer accent .
The angels , Gabe and Mike , tell Wendy that , no , we did n’t create God ; God , instead , created everything .
One scene takes place in a school , Enlightenment High .
The science teacher here is the enemy , his students the victims .
Unlike Gabe and Mike , he ’s a bookish square who supports evolution unquestionably , even though he lacks proof .
The teacher is flustered when Gabe and Mike question his science with hazy arguments that say scientific dating methods are inaccurate ; that Noah ’s flood created the Grand Canyon ; that single cell organisms are just way too complex to have simply developed on their own .
“ Your chair did n’t just glue itself together ! ” one says — all that ’s missing is a long “ Duuuuuuuh ! ”
As if Gabe and Mike ’s coolness was n’t enough to win visitors over , the show ’s interactified with seats that vibrate whenever a dinosaur walks by on the screen and jets of water that spray faces during the story of the Ark — a feature not popular with the older set in the row behind me , who use their hands to cover the nozzles in front of them .
I studied science in college , but I still leave a little confused .
Not by whether or not I agree with the show ’s points , but by what those points actually were .
A lot of scientific - sounding facts are thrown out , followed by general statements of how this , then , proves that evolution ca n’t be true .
Murky claims included :
If the Earth is really billions of years old , there should be a heck of a lot more helium in the atmosphere !
Single - cell organisms ?
They ’re not as simple as everyone says they are !
And those rocks from Mt. St. Helen’s ?
They prove that the Earth does n’t have to be billions of years old !
The Calls , however , are impressed .
As we walk out , I hear more “ first - rate ” and “ world class . ”
I ask Michael and Judy why they think scientists , like the teacher in the show , are so resistant to the idea of creationism .
“ It ’s as simple as , if there is a creator , then somehow they are accountable , ” Michael tells me .
“ It removes the question of who makes laws — God or humans . ”
They do n’t talk much about the science in the show , but say that they plan on coming back soon with their children .
They ’ve donated to the museum ; it was not much , they say , but enough to feel that they have a part in sharing the message .
Like Men in
White , most of the museum ’s attempts to present a scientific basis for the creationist argument are n’t all that scientific .
But that does n’t seem to matter much to the visitors , some of whom have come wearing T - shirts with witty Crucifixion puns like “ A blood donor saved my life , ” “ I owe my life to body piercing , ” and “ Jesus loves you ( and I ’m trying ) . ”
Later , I ’m looking in a glass case at finches , birds that have become the iconic animal representatives of evolution .
Darwin ’s observations of their variety on the Galapagos Islands , specifically the specialization of each species ’ beak , helped him develop the theory AiG is trying to debunk .
The museum , though , has its own explanation for speciation , as signs next to the case reveal : “ In spite of all their variety , many species of finches can still breed with each other .
This can be possible only if all finches are related . ”
It continues , “ Scientists are puzzled how so many finch species could arise , displaying such a vast array of traits .
The Bible provides explanation .
In the beginning of the earth , 6,000 years ago , God created every kind of bird , including the finch kind , and He gave them the ability to ‘ multiply upon the earth ’ . ”
As I read this , a woman standing next to me points out an animatronic dinosaur looming over our heads to her daughter , who ’s sitting in a stroller .
Her name ’s Ann Posey ; she ’s from Hebron , just a few miles away , and she ’s come with a friend from Memphis .
I ask her what she thinks of the museum .
“ It ’s so state - of - the - art , ” she tells me .
Posey waited in line to be among the first in .
“ I came because of the idea that this could be for Christ , a place to see and learn , ” she says .
That does n’t mean she wo n’t visit traditional natural history museums , like the one just a few miles away in Cincinnati .
“ We ’re actually members of the Cincinnati museum , ” she tells me .
I ask her what she makes , then , of the scientific facts put forth there .
“ Oh , we just do n’t agree with it .
We just look at the things , but do n’t agree with the dating . ”

After my first visit to the Creation Museum , I drive 20 miles back to Cincinnati to visit the city ’s natural history museum .
Despite overwhelming scientific evidence that the Earth is billions of years old and that species evolve , almost half of the country ’s population believes a designer created humans and other animals in their current forms just thousands of years ago .
But natural history museums remain popular , symbols of so many grade school field trips and rainy weekend afternoons .
These institutions also remain steadfast in their defense of evolution , and are perhaps more so now as creationists like the ones in Petersburg increasingly co-opt their conventions .
The American Museum of Natural History in New York opened a new Hall of Human of Human Origins in April .
( It ’s located on the museum ’s first floor , about as far as possible from the dinosaur hall on the fourth floor . )
“ Dinosaurs : Ancient Fossils , New Discoveries ” is open at Chicago ’s Field Museum through September , the traveling “ Darwin ” until January .
Cincinnati’s Art Deco Union Terminal is home to the Cincinnati Museum of Natural History and Science .
Five lines once came through here , but now the only trains come at 1:00 and 3:00 in the morning .
Along with the natural history museum , an IMAX theater , a history museum , and a children ’s museum have taken the place of ticket offices and porters .
Cincinnati ’s museum is much smaller than its big -city cousins , the kind of place to spend an enjoyable but ultimately forgettable afternoon .
In fact , it ’s a hot early - summer Sunday and attendance is light .
But even here , evolution — or at least an understanding that the world is more than 6,000 years old — pervades almost every exhibit .
The museum ’s official line , one employee tells me , is , “ We teach evolution . ”
One hall explores the five mass extinctions that occurred over 550 million years .
Images of cave paintings date the originals to somewhere between 10,000 and 25,000 years ago .
One area is a tour of Ice Age animal models .
An exhibit of photos from Walden Woods begins with a video on Thoreau and how Darwin ’s thinking influenced the transcendentalist ’s work on forest succession and seed dispersion .
A sculpted , walk - through cave meant to simulate the real thing — with live bats , dripping water , and a few passages too narrow for an adult to pass through — contains a jaguar skeleton 10,000 years old .
At the cave ’s entrance is a small tank holding two blind cavefish , snow white and fast as they circle their tiny home .
A single photocopied article from Seed magazine is taped next to the tank , exploring how things like eyeless fish or flightless birds evolve .
I sit in on a bat demonstration just outside the cave .
The bat ’s handler tells those of us gathered how bats fly , hunt , and mate .
She describes the bat ’s body as “ remarkably like a human , ” with four fingers and a thumb , and knuckles , just like us .
“ Because we all come from , you know , the same ancestor with the five - finger plan , ” she says .
When the others leave , I stay behind .
She ca n’t give her name ; she says that the opening of AiG ’s museum has raised media interest in this museum as well , and the staff is n’t really supposed to be talking to reporters .
She has a cousin who ’s a charter member of the Creation Museum , and considers herself to be a person “ of faith , ” but does n’t understand why evolution and religion need to be opposed .
“ It bothers scientists and educators if you take a bunch of kids and tell them the earth ’s 6,000 years old , instead of the theory of evolution , and by theory , I mean fact , ” she says .
But even in a science museum , it ’s difficult to see how much science actually matters to visitors .
I follow two couples and their four children as they rush though the hall of dinosaurs , looking at the skeletons .
They stop to take a picture in front of the skeleton of a giant fish .
They do n’t really linger until the end , where the parents can sit on benches while the kids ignore a video on fossil hunting and jump on pillows .
There ’s a Q&A display with questions printed on wood blocks that can be flipped to reveal the answer .
“ Did humans hunt the dinosaurs to extinction ? ” one asks .
“ No , dinosaurs were extinct for more than 64 million years before humans appeared , ” reads the answer .
But nobody ’s looking .
The parents sit silently .
The children play with models of a brontosaurus and T. rex .
I ’m guilty of this myself .
I want this to be a place to celebrate science , and to celebrate it myself .
But these days , I ’m as superficial in my interest as I was when I settled on my college major .
At that time , I thought that , well , since I enjoyed the outdoors , I ’d also enjoy biology .
At an interactive display where visitors push buttons corresponding to those animals they think survived the Permian extinction , I hit every button until I “ win ” with the cockroach .
I know this because , instead of a loud buzz , “ La Cucaracha ” plays .
At a model of Jefferson ’s ground sloth , I spend more time noting just how dusty the thing is than I do reading about its diet or habitat .
I wonder how one actually goes about dusting a dinosaur .
In a room exploring glacial formations , my first stop is a small pool in the center .
Here I can spin dials to control the flow of water and learn how different flows form different geologic features .
But I just spin one after the other , captivated .
A boy about 10 years old is on the other side , doing the same .
“ This water smells like pretzels , ” he says .
“ It smells like moldy pretzels . ” I agree , and we both continue to spin the dials .

At a bend in Bullittsburg Church Road in Petersburg , in front of the Creation Museum , stands a patch of weeds that , until today , were knee - high .
Stuck between a farmer ’s field and a narrow , dead - end access road , there are only a few uses for a small plot like this .
A protest is one of them , and that ’s happening today .
The area ’s been mown and roped off with caution tape , and opponents of the Creation Museum have gathered on opening day as part of what they ’re calling the Rally for Reason .
I ’m standing by the side of the road with Carly Nichols , one of the event ’s organizers , as cars pass , most driven by the museum ’s supporters .
Nichols and those with her are holding signs with messages like , “ Support Science Not Superstition , ” “ Religion Is the Root Cause of All Terrorism / All Terrorists Are Religious People , None Are Atheists , ” and “ Creationism is one of the Vilest Forms of Child Abuse . ”
Carly has been an atheist for about 10 years now .
She considered herself a Christian for a long time before that but never really questioned the faith .
It was n’t until she actually read the Bible that she began to doubt it .
“ If God is all - powerful , why create temptation ? ” she says .
“ It does n’t seem like a loving thing to do . ”
As we talk , a van drives by with a sign in its rear window that says , “ Why go APE over a museum ?
History is HIS story . ”
A few minutes later , a Corvette drives past and a passenger shouts out of his window : “ Why do n’t you all go home and leave these people alone ? ”
A few kids in backseats flip the protestors off , but beyond that there have n’t been any real confrontations .
Carly has four daughters , ages one through nine , and is here because she ’s afraid of what this museum could mean for their education .
“ We do n’t want a repeat of Kansas , ” she says , referring to that state ’s board of education .
It has in the past attempted to remove evolution from the curriculum .
It ’s also tried to replace it with a teaching of intelligent design — the relatively new form of creationism that suggests life ’s complexity is evidence of an unnamed designer .
Like most of the other protesters , Carly says she ’s here to oppose what they see as a threat to the science and , through that , to the proper education of children .
“ We do n’t have the power or the right to try to shut it down , ” Carly says .
“ We ’re not silly enough to think we could . ”
But as much as they want to focus on science , religion is never far from their minds .
At a meeting held the night before the rally , supporters gathered in a conference room of the Hilton Cincinnati Airport for a pep talk .
The speakers included American Atheist ’s national legal director , as well as American Atheist ’s directors for Michigan and Alabama , the president of the Secular Coalition for America , and the pastor of the United Church of Christ in Cincinnati .
Frank Zindler , editor of the American Atheist Press , gave the keynote speech , “ Do n’t Let the Dark Ages Come Again , ” in which he railed ( for close to 20 minutes ) against the spread of religion into what this group considers secular areas of society .
He criticized the very existence of the Creation Museum .
“ Today another shadow falls across the path of science , ” he said , “ as another attempt is made to shutter shut a window to the world , as once again benighted minions of an evil god seek to bring to naught three centuries of progress , discovery , and learning . ”
He later read an original poem that described the protestors as “ guardians of the torch of learning , ” and compared their world with that of the museum ’s supporters : “ Though bought with brains and blood , it rivals not the fantasies of Faith — that specter which , when sense submits , draws shut thick curtains o’er the mind and lets an inner play proceed . ”
A physician , Dr. Gretchen Mann , spoke later .
“ My name is Gretchen Mann , and I ’m coming out today .
I ’m an atheist ! ” she said .
“ To be silent any longer would be to be complacent in the ruination of our country . ”
During the Rally for Reason , I walk around the protest site on Bullittsburg Church Road with Fran Welte , a plump , middle - aged woman with a kind face .
Fran , who ’s from the Cincinnati suburb of Loveland , says she ’s always been an atheist .
Her father was raised Catholic but , after fighting in World War II , asked his priest how he could justify having killed someone .
The priest told Fran ’s father that the act was justifiable since it was done for his country ; the conversation marked the end of her father ’s relationship with religion .
I ask Fran if it is n’t dangerous to be protesting a private creationism museum under the banner of atheism .
Do n’t they risk pitting the religious against the non-religious ?
She admits that yes , some of her fellow atheists have confused the issue by simply equating an opposition to creationism with atheism .
I also wonder whether being here today , either as atheists or not , will in any way validate the museum .
Fran says she knows that any kind of protest is going to draw more attention to the museum but is n’t worried .
“ I ’d rather give them business so that in the long run it ’ll be better for scientific thinking , for critical thinking , ” she says .
A van full of protesters arrives and Fran directs them to where they should protest .
As she does , she tells me about a woman she met earlier that morning .
At a fast food restaurant , the drive - thru cashier saw Rally for Reason soaped on Fran ’s van window .
She told Fran that the two of them are opposites , that she ’s a Christian and ca n’t wait to go to heaven .
Fran stops directing for a moment and turns to me .
Her face tightens into an expression of both confusion and sympathy .
“ Why is it so clear for me , ” she says , “ and so hard for them ? ”
•
On the atheists ’ side of the road are dozens of protestors , two portable toilets , three tents , and a band .
They hold signs high while Fran Welte reminds everyone to “ smile and wave , smile and wave ” as cars pass .
Martha
Heil stands on the other side of the road , alone on the muddy , unmown shoulder .
Pale and with long , straight , reddish - brown hair , she ’s standing silently and unsmiling with a large manila enveloped clutched to her chest .
I walk over to see what she ’s doing by herself , to see if she ’s a museum supporter keeping an eye on the protesters , but she ’s not .
Heil is the media coordinator for the American Institute of Physicists , as well as a blogger on her own sporadically - updated site Intelligent Design Watch .
She ’s hoping desperately that some scientists will show up to stand with her .
There are several on the other side , protesting with the atheists , but she ’s hoping for those who will take a secular approach in their criticism .
One eventually does show up , but the lack of a turnout on her side does n’t come as a surprise , as she ’ll later note on her blog : “ The scientists who felt politically and were open to sharing their views were already across the road , and the shy ones who would rather get on with their science tended to stay at home . ”
The debate ’s political nature is what ’s keeping her on this side of the road , alone .
“ This is not the scene we want to be in , ” she says .
“ We do n’t want to engage in partisan politics because science is n’t partisan .
You can take atomic energy and build a nuclear power plant or a nuclear weapon . ”
As we look across the street where a reporter from NPR and crews from PBS and Russian television are interviewing protestors , I ask Heil what she thinks of the coverage of this event , as well as that of the larger debate over creationism .
“ The reason I ’m on this side of the road is because the media sees religion versus the non-religious , ” she says .
“ It ’s not one versus the other . ”
Heil tells me she respects the protesters , that with “ science under threat , there ’s a need to align yourself with anyone who will hold your hand . ”
“ But , ” she says , “ I do n’t think it ’s a service to science to link it to atheism . ”

Back inside the Creation Museum , I ’m sitting on a bench in the museum ’s final room .
I ’ve just seen The Last Adam , a dramatic video presentation of the last Cs — Christ , cross and consummation — and in a few minutes I ’ll leave for the airport .
A man comes up and sits down next to me .
His name is Wayne Caufield and he ’s a retired real estate broker who now raises sheep in South Carolina .
Wayne came here with members of his church during construction of the museum .
He ’s now back helping out at the tour ’s end , where anyone with questions about what they ’ve seen can speak to trained volunteers .
Volunteers here must fill out an application but also sign a contract that requires a written , personal Christian testimony of salvation , and a position statement on creation .
Volunteers must also agree with the Answers in Genesis Statement of Faith which says , among other things , that “ The days of Genesis do not correspond to geologic ages , but are six [ 6 ] consecutive twenty - four [ 24 ] hour days of Creation ” and “ Those who do not believe in Christ are subject to everlasting conscious punishment , but believers enjoy eternal life with God . ”
Wayne is a believer and here , among the evidence that ’s supposed to do the trick , he ’s trying to make me one , too .
“ Tell me , if you were to die today , are you 100 percent sure you ’d get into heaven ? ” he asks me .
I tell him the truth , that I do n’t really know what I think about heaven .
It ’s true , but something about the way Wayne smiles and nods makes me nervous , and I try to change the subject .
I ask him about the protesters ’ arguments that a literal read of Genesis means a literal read of everything in the Bible , including , say , a not - so - wholesome treatment of women .
“ Well , I believe that yes , woman is the help - mate , but that does n’t mean you can grab her by the hair , ” he says .
Wayne pauses , then leans quietly in to me .
“ You know what this museum is about , right ? ” he asks .
I tell him that I think it ’s about science and spirituality , or at least is trying to be .
He shakes his head no .
“ This is an evangelical ministry .
We hope to bring people to Jesus Christ . ”
Wayne takes me into a private room to share Bible verses that he believes will help me find God , including one on being reborn .
“ Now of course this is n’t a literal rebirth , ” he says .
“ It ’s a metaphor . ”
I ’m about to confront him on the paradox of this statement , made in a place that extols the literal word of the Bible .
But I do n’t .
I can see he ’s happy sharing this with me and , even if I do n’t agree with it , I ca n’t imagine giving someone ’s kind , old grandfather such a hard time .
Even though he says he ’s not supposed to , Wayne gives me his personal telephone number .
He hopes that I ’ll call to talk further .
He tells me how , after 9/11 , he traveled to New York and convinced 16 people to kneel down and say the Sinner ’s Prayer with him .
He ’s hoping he can do the same with me .
I tell him that I should be going , that I have a long drive ahead of me .
He pats me on the back before I get up .
As I ’m about to leave he stops me , telling me he has one more thing for me .
I think he ’ll give me a Bible , or at least some kind of religious pamphlet .
But Wayne reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out a coupon for a free soft drink in Noah ’s Café upstairs .
He seems proud to be able to do this and smiles , hoping not just that I ’ll be convinced , but that I ’ll be saved .

They 've called " white space " applications threats to public safety and even likened them to germs .
Now they 're calling them illegal .
The National Association of Broadcasters and Association for Maximum Service Television ( MSTV ) have sued the Federal Communications Commission over its decision to authorize unlicensed devices for sending and receiving broadband over unused television channels .
NAB represents hundreds of TV license owners .
MSTV speaks for the industry on spectrum / policy issues .
" As several engineering tests have shown , portable , unlicensed personal device operation in the same band as TV broadcasting continues to be a guaranteed recipe for producing interference , " NAB Media Relations director Kris Jones told Ars Tuesday morning .
" NAB will continue to advocate on behalf of the millions of American households who rely on broadcast television for entertainment , news and information . "
The suit was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on February 27 , but neither NAB nor MSTV appear to have been in a big rush to publicize the move .
The petition for review charges that the FCC 's decision " will have a direct adverse impact on MSTV's and NAB 's members because it will allow harmful interference with reception of their broadcast signals . "
It 's unclear from the document on exactly what legal grounds NAB / MSTV think the FCC 's decision is actionable .
The petition calls the Commission 's Second Report and Order , which gave the go - ahead to the manufacture and distribution of white space apps , " arbitrary , capricious , and otherwise not in accordance with law . "
That suggests that the complainers might invoke the Administrative Procedures
Act in this case .
In any event , they obviously want the courts to throw the decision out .
This suit does not seem to have shocked the pro-white space crowd .
Jake Ward , spokesperson for the Wireless Innovation Alliance , called the action " disappointing , but certainly not surprising . "
WIA represents various manufacturers , software companies , and public interest groups .
" For decades , [ the broadcasters ' ] policy has been to stifle innovation at all costs and ask questions later and this is no different , " Ward added .
" White Space technology works , it is safe , and the Federal Communications Commission knows better than anyone the steps that must be taken to ensure that continues to be the case .
A legal challenge to the process and the Commission 's expertise in this area is just another in a long list of ill advised and futile delay tactics . "
This legal action comes as the FCC was just starting to implement its white space order .
The agency finally published the decision in the Federal Register in mid-February , announcing that its rules would become effective on March 19 .
And the Commission has begun talking to parties about setting up the databases needed to protect TV channels and unlicensed microphones from interference .
On February 27 , a small boatload of public interest groups met with the agency to discuss , among other matters , " the possibility of the Commission issuing a Notice of Inquiry on allowing higher power levels for White Spaces devices in rural areas . "
No predictions from here on where all this is going now that a lawsuit has entered the picture .
According to the NAB / MSTV case docket , the trade groups have until April 1 to file their Statement of Issues with the court .
Ars contacted the FCC for a comment on the suit , but has yet to receive a reply .

Nicole Cooke hopes her Vision 1 team will develop British riders
While Nicole Cooke 's fourth place in the Tour of Flanders in early April may not have been the result that British cycling fans were hoping for , the race represented another step forward in the emergence of British women as a force at the top level .
Lining up alongside Cooke for her Vision 1 Racing team were Gabby Day and Dani King , while Cath Hare was in the Fenixs colours .
There was also a Great Britain team featuring several riders who could help spread the burden of success that Cooke has largely carried on her own since turning professional in 2002 .
Jessica Allen was the best placed of the GB team riders , coming home with the main bunch in 39th , a good result for a rider still shy of her 20th birthday , albeit one who has already ridden in a World Championship road race .
The next GB rider to cross the line was 19 - year - old Katie Colclough who , like Allen , rode alongside Cooke in the colours of the Halfords - Bikehut team last season .
Both are part of the transformation of British women in the top flight from objects of curiosity and anomaly to some of the most competitive in the sport .
606 : DEBATE
Cooke has been a one - woman vanguard , and is uniquely placed to comment on the change as she builds her season around defending her title at World Championships in September :
" When I was turning pro in 2002 there was no other rider in a pro-team , " said Cooke .
" Now we can actually say , yes , there are other riders in the top 20 of the world ranking .
Back in my day I was the only one in the top 150 .
" In the time that I 've been racing the British Championships , it 's gone from 30 or maybe 35 in 1999 to now close on around 80 - odd , so it 's really taken off at the higher level . "
Continuing this development was one of the key goals in the formation of Cooke 's Vision 1 Racing team , which includes King and Katie Curtis on its roster .
" Hopefully with Vision 1 now being a bridge for young girls from juniors to come up into elite and progress , I really hope that in a couple of years ' time Britain will be one of the strongest nations in road cycling , " said the 25 - year - old from Wick .
That process is aided by the structures being put in place by British Cycling in its development programmes that identify and nurture talent through the national set up .
While it may seem odd that nominally amateur national squads should be competing against professional teams , Cooke feels they still have value .
" At the moment there is n't enough depth to have two levels going on in women 's racing so the national teams are still needed . "
Olympic time trial silver medallist Emma Pooley finished eighth in the World Championships Emma Pooley is the other British woman who is making a big impact on the continent .
Now riding for the Cervelo Test Team , she won at the season - opening GP Etrusca , and is looking to shine at the Fleche Wallonne on 22 April , a race perfectly suited to her climbing skills .
Like Cooke , she has largely made her own way on the continent , and believes that it is a step that the younger riders will have to take sooner or later if they are to become successful .
" She [ Cooke ] did it independently , " said Pooley .
" I think at some point you have to stand up for yourself and do it yourself and find a team .
Having your hand held by British Cycling you have to make yourself a bit tougher than that .
" Nicole finished school , went out to Italy , learnt Italian , won the Giro .
She 's a good example to me in that I did n't think ' Oh I 've got to go back to British Cycling ' .
" British Cycling have been incredibly supportive , especially with the Olympic products , but behind it I had a Swiss team based where I lived who took me to races and gave me more opportunities . "
And it seems that the message is beginning to get through , with a number of young British riders , including Lizzie Armistead and Emma Trott , riding this season in Europe for professional teams in Belgium and Holland .
With the growth in the number of women participating in the sport on a domestic level , British riders could soon be the ones leading the way on the continent .
If nothing else , at least Cooke will no longer be the lone Brit at the front of races .

Jimmy Wales is best known for his role in founding Wikipedia , but he is also involved in Wikia , a startup focused on fostering online communities that take a wiki - like approach to community - driven content .
In that role , he has to balance his commitment to open information against profitability and the potential for growth , a balancing act made more difficult by the current economic downturn .
The hard economic realities hit home this week , as Wales announced the termination of a project , Wikia Search , that he has spent several years developing and promoting .
Wikia search was first announced back in 2006 ; the following year , it purchased a distributed search indexing service called Grub .
In keeping with the emphasis on open information , the Grub project was made open source , allowing anyone to look over the algorithms involved in generating search results .
After an extended test period , the site finally went live last year .
As with other sites that focus on user - contributed content , Wikia Search let anyone rate and filter its search results .
In an interview with Ars , Wales portrayed this as in keeping with his general sense that the wisdom of the crowd could help minimize the role of editorial bias in search results .
In Wales ' view , any search service plays an editorial role , because it tunes its algorithms based on some sense of whether the results of search results matched some sort of standard .
Wikia , he felt , was different because the source code for the search algorithm is available , and a crowd of fellow search users could refine things further .
Unfortunately , those crowds never materialized .
In the blog post in which he announces that Wikia Search has reached the end of the line , Wales proudly points to the rapid growth of Wikia in general , citing Nielsen figures that show it nearly doubling its traffic in the past year , placing it fifth on the list of user community sites .
Unfortunately for Wikia Search fans , that growth came from other Wikia - branded services .
( On the plus side , this presumably means that there are fewer such fans to be disappointed . )
Although Wales does n't provide any numbers , his focus on growth suggests that it was n't simply the lack of users , but the fact that the service was n't seeing the sort of momentum that other Wikia - branded properties were .
Wales also implied that he was still interested in search , but the current economy was n't going to allow him to continue this specific project .
" In a different economy , we would continue to fund Wikia Search indefinitely , " he wrote .
" Its something I care about deeply .
I will return to again and again in my career to search , either as an investor , a contributor , a donor , or a cheerleader . "
Below the fold is a TOD : Campfire post on Passive Solar , from longtime TOD reader Will Stewart .
Will is a Systems Engineer in the Energy industry - he will have a follow up post in the near future .
Please add your own experience and expertise with passive solar , including links and images in the comment section - the sun is as close as we get to a perpetual energy subsidy ..... how we best access and take advantage of it is the subject of tonights post .
Passive Solar Design Overview – Part 1
Passive solar refers to the design and placement of a building to enable solar heating without the need for sensors , actuators , and pumps , in contrast to , which utilizes pumps / blowers , sensors , and logic control units to manage collection , storage , and distribution of heat .
The two techniques are not exclusive , however , and can work together effectively .
As solar radiation ( insolation ) is a diffuse energy source , and not at the beck and call of a thermostat , passive solar design techniques are at their best when combined with other related methods , such as energy efficiency ( insulation , weatherization , building envelope minimization ) , daylighting , passive cooling , microclimate landscaping , and a conservation lifestyle ( i.e. , temperature settings , raising and lowering of insulated shades , etc ) .
Most of these topics will be covered in other articles , though passive cooling will be addressed in this series , which is intended as an overview , as a complete engineering treatment on passive solar design would require several dozens of articles .
Even though solar insolation is diffuse , and generally weaker the further away from the equator , it can be the basis for the majority of a building 's heat energy input even in high latitude places such as Canada , Norway , Germany , the Northern US ( Maine , New Hampshire , Michigan , Wisconsin , Minnesota , North Dakota , Montana , Idaho , Washington state , etc ) , Scotland , the Netherlands , etc .
Even the US Department of Defense has a passive solar design guide .
Design approaches such as Passivhaus have achieved up to 90 % reduction in energy use over traditional building methods .
In areas with reasonably consistent winter insolation , well insulated passive solar buildings with sufficient thermal mass storage can approach 100 % of their space heating needs with passive solar .
Enhancements can be added to existing buildings , through major or minor renovations , or through simple additions ( Part 4 of the series ) .
History
The Greeks faced severe fuel shortages in fifth century BC , resorting to arranging their houses so that each could make maximum use of the sun ’s warming rays .
A standard house plan emerged , with Socrates noting , “ In houses that look toward the south , the sun penetrates the portico in winter . ”
The great Greek playwright Aeschylus even proclaimed only primitives and barbarians " lacked knowledge of houses turned to face the winter sun ” .
The Romans picked up on this technique , and improved it by adding windows of mica or glass to better hold in the heat .
They passed laws to protect the solar access rights of owners of solar homes from shading by new buildings .
In the Americas , the Pueblo and Anazazi took advantage of solar insolation in their adobe and cave dwellings , respectively .
The Basics
Location and Orientation
In the 18th and early 19th centuries , solar greenhouses became popular for those of means to grow exotic tropical plantlife in temperate climes .
In the 20th century , German architects such as Hannes Meyer , director of the influential Bauhaus architectural school , urged the use of passive solar design techniques that began to flourish in the 1930s , only to be pushed aside by the Nazis and WWII .
Many German architects made their way to the US , and a small solar market developed .
Built in 1948 , Rosemont elementary school in Tuscon obtained over 80 % of its heat via solar means , but in 1958 , with cheap energy now available and an extensive addition planned , the school district chose to go with a gas - fired furnace .
The 1970s saw more emphasis on renewable energy , and passive solar became a household word , though still only penetrating a very tiny percentage of builders ’ visions for the new homes market .
More in - depth passive solar history details can be found at the California Solar Center
To assess whether passive solar is advantageous to a location , one must first find out the amount of winter sunlight that is available .
The simplest way is to find solar insolation data for the site under consideration , ideally collected over a series of decades ( noting that a changing climate can mean the data may need to be extrapolated ) .
The data can come in tabular or map form , with the latter providing a quick indicator of the amount of winter insolation in one 's area .
Tabular data , however , is more precise , giving one the best information available about trends in their area .
A note of caution : the data is usually an average of conditions , and does not necessarily take into consideration unusual weather years or how thein one 's area of consideration .
Most of the maps and tabular data measure solar insolation as kWh / m2 /day , which is roughly the number of kilowatt hours of energy striking a square meter of surface in a day .
This is also referred to as aon some maps , and we will refer to it as such throughout this series . :
Since virtually all modern passive solar design focuses on vertical windows , data must be specified or converted to a vertical orientation .
Some of the data currently available is for collectors tilted at an angle equal to the site 's ) or a ) , which would need to be converted to a ) .
The table below contains a partial list of solar maps and data , though make sure any source you use focuses on winter data , as other maps / data are used for year around solar photovoltaic projections .
The orientation of the building will determine how much solar insolation is captured during the desired period of the day .
For example , a passive solar house facing the equator will receive an equal amount of solar heat before and after noon .
The more a building is oriented away from true south ( or north in the southern hemisphere ) the less winter solar insolation it will be able to capture , and it becomes more susceptible to undesirable summer solar energy that is harder to shade with a properly sized overhang .
In addition to direct solar insolation beaming from the sun , there is also diffuse radiation from the sky , and reflected radiation from the ground .
Figure 1 - Types of solar input
Direct Gain : Sunlight shines into and warms the living space .
Indirect Gain : Sunlight warms thermal storage , which then warms the living space .
Isolated Gain : Sunlight warms another room ( sunroom ) and convection brings the warmed air into the living space .
Figure 2 - Direct solar gain
Figure 3 - Indirect solar gain
Figure 4 - Isolated Gain
Passive solar building design revolves around 5 main aspects ; :
The set of windows and overhangs that determine how much sun enters the building . :
The material that the sun ’s ray come into contact with . :
The material that stores the sun ’s thermal energy for re-release after sundown . :
The means by which the thermal energy is released to the living / working spaces . :
The techniques used to control the collection and distribution of the sun 's thermal energy .
These aspects can be configured by the designer / architect into roughly three main design themes ( with endless variations ) ;
In Part I of this series , we will cover the Aperature ;
The first step in passive solar design is determining how to collect the sun 's energy .
In most climates that passive solar is employed , this means windows of one form or another .
An important metric of a window is its Solar Heat Gain Coefficient ( SHGC ) that measures how much of the sun 's energy passes through the window without reflection or absorbtion and re-radiation .
The higher the SHGC , the more solar energy a window will allow through .
A plain single pane window normally has a SGHC of 0.86 while a plain dual pane window is about 0.72 .
In order to reduce heat loss in cool and cold climates , windows are normally at least dual pane , if not triple pane .
The dead air space between window panes helps to increase the insulation factor , call the R - value ( or its inverse , the U - value ) .
One single pane of ordinary glass has an approximate R - Value of 0.85 .
A dual pane window with 3/8 inch of air space typically has an R - value of 2.1 .
The substitution of less viscous gases such as argon and krypton allow greater distances between panes before the gas begins to convect ( tranferring heat at a much higher rate ) , increasing their insulating effect .
Each pane added , however , blocks / absorbs / reflects more solar energy , which effectively reduces the window unit 's SHGC .
Additionally , low - E coatings that help to reduce the amount of infrared heat radiated out of a room through a window also reduces SHGC ( amount dependent on the type of low - E coating ) .
So a balance must be struck by the designer / architect between the amount of energy received during winter sunlight hours vs. the amount of energy lost 24 hours a day .
There are windows available that have been designed for passive solar applications to provide sufficient SGHC while still providing adequate insulation ( e.g. , one such window has a SHGC = 0.56 and an R - value = 5 ) .
There is ongoing research to bring aerogel windows to commercial production , as these windows provide extremely high R- values ( approximately R - 10 per inch ) while having SHGCs of .52 or greater .
The orientation of the window is just as important ; windows facing the equator receive the greatest amount of sunlight .
And this orientation also greatly reduces unwanted solar collection during the warmer days of the year , as windows facing East and West are difficult to shade effectively with simple overhangs , requiring larger and / or view blocking awnings .
The opportunity to conserve a one million hectare tract of rainforest in Cameroon is fast dwindling due financial pressures in the Central African country , reports a bulletin from the Ngoyla Mintom Foundation .
In 2002 the government of Cameroon suspended logging rights and extended an offer to protect Ngoyla Mintom — a forest reserve that houses 4,000 lowland gorillas , 1,500 endangered chimpanzees , 3,000 forest elephants and an important population of vulnerable Mandrills — provided someone step forward to pay for it .
To date there have been no takers .
Now facing a mounting economic crisis , the government of Cameroon says it will soon concession Ngoyla Mintom for logging .
Conservationists say the move would have a “ devastating ” impact on wildlife and the environment .
Ngoyla Mintom , together with bordering Nki National Park and Dja Wildlife Reserve in Cameroon , Minkébé National Park in Gabon and Odzala National Park in Congo , form part of a 15 million hectare continuous forest area , that supports Mandrills ( above ) as well as other charismatic species of wildlife .

“ Many areas of Cameroon have been extensively logged in recent decades , and the effect has been devastating , both for the important species that lived there , and the local environment .
In particular , logging typically involves : the unselective removal of trees ; the burning of understorey , and ; the construction of many new roads , which open up and expose the rainforest to agricultural and other development , ” said the Ngoyla Mintom Foundation in its February 2009 issue of Ngoyla Mintom News ( www.NgoylaMintom.blogspot.com).
“ Moreover , it is expected that a similar fate would befall Ngoyla Mintom should logging concessions be granted there as currently planned . ”
To stave off this fate the Ngoyla Mintom Foundation is urging the public to write Joseph Roland Matta , the Cameroon Vice Minister of Forestry and Wildlife , asking him to reverse his government ’s recent decision .
The organization is also calling upon conservation groups to provide funding to preserve Ngoyla Mintom .
The Economist reported last year that the Cameroon government is seeking around $ 1.6 million per year — less than $ 2 per hectare — for the area .
Ultimate funding for Ngoyla Mintom could come from an unlikely source : its trees .
Under Reducing Deforestation and Degradation ( REDD ) , a proposed mechanism for fighting climate change by protecting tropical forests , Ngoyla Mintom could see tens of millions of dollars for keeping its trees standing .
But REDD is only possible with upfront funding to finance project design and development .
Without it , Ngoyla Mintom may well fall to the axe .
In the REDD ?
A look at the potential carbon value of Ngoyla Mintom Presented last February by mongabay.com Between 2000 and 2005 Cameroon lost an average of 1 percent of its forest cover each year .
For calculating the potential revenue generated from REDD , this figure is applied to the 830,000 ha of Ngoyla - Mintom forest cover , amounting to a forecast annual loss of 8,300 ha .
Assuming emissions of 160 tons of carbon per hectare from logging , at $ 3 per ton of CO2 , REDD would generate credits worth $ 64 million ( net present value over 30 years using a 5 percent discount rate ) , well in excess of the $ 26 million in concession fees ( NPV over 30 years at a 5 percent discount rate ) .
The $ 38 million difference seems likely to more than make up the opportunity costs of forgoing the jobs and local development from timber harvesting .
These calculations err on the side of caution .
Carbon emissions from the logging or deforestation of Ngoyla - Mintom would likely be considerably higher than the figures used , especially if the land was later converted for agriculture .
Further , REDD credits are presently higher than $ 3 and European ETS credits currently trade for more than $ 30 per ton .
Even so , the current model suggests that at a price point of $ 1.21 , REDD credits would break - even with revenue from logging concessions .
Ngoyla Mintom Foundation
How to Help
In particular it is important that
the government of Cameroon realize the strength of opinion
regarding the need to conserve Ngoyla Mintom and to avoid
the granting of logging concessions in the area .
Individuals and
organizations interested in the fate of this globally important
rainforest are thus called upon to write to the Cameroon Vice
Minister of Forestry and Wildlife , urging him to reverse his
government ’s recent decision , and to support the work of the
new foundation , using the contact details provided below .
A
model letter is also provided , but it would have more force if
you added your own words and thoughts , and please be sure to
add your own name and address .
Please email or write to :

A SAMPLE LETTER TO Vice Minister Matta
[ Your Address Here ]
Dear Vice Minister Matta
I am writing to you concerning the Ngoyla Mintom rainforest
in the south of Cameroon and your government ’s recent
decision to begin selling logging concessions for this area .
I understand that Ngoyla Mintom is a globally important
rainforest , incredibly rich in biodiversity – including
Mandrills , Gorillas , Chimpanzees and Elephants – and it also
forms a vital link between neighbouring protected areas in
Cameroon , Gabon and Congo , which will likely become
fragmented and degraded should Ngoyla Mintom be logged .
I thus call upon you to work to reverse your government ’s
recent decision , and to support the work of the new Ngoyla
Mintom Foundation and others in their aims to financially
support the conservation and sustainable development of
Ngoyla Mintom as a viable economic alternative to logging .
Yours sincerely ,
[ Your name ]
Sun is bringing its JavaFX development framework to mobile devices .
The latest release of the JavaFX SDK , version 1.1 , offers full support for mobile JavaFX development and includes an emulator for testing mobile device compatibility .
The move could help Java retain its relevance on handhelds as rival Adobe works to boost the popularity of Flash and AIR for mobile development .
JavaFX , which was first announced in 2007 and rolled out to the public in December 2008 , is a framework for building rich Internet applications on top of Java .
It includes a scene graph library and a unique scripting language that provides a declarative syntax for constructing sophisticated graphical user interfaces .
Its graphics capabilities include support for animation , visual effects , gradients , and translucency .
JavaFX content integrates well with existing Java code , which means that developers can use it to bring better user interfaces to legacy Java applications and to build new Java software that can rival Flash programs in rich interactivity .
JavaFX Mobile is designed to run on devices that support Java ME .
A number of carriers and handset makers — including Orange , Sprint , Sony Ericsson , and LG — have already committed to bundling it on upcoming products .
" By delivering JavaFX Mobile on top of the wireless Java platform , Sun is now bringing expressiveness to the most pervasive and powerful platform in the mobile industry , " said Sun client software group VP Jeet Kaul in a statement .
" We are thrilled with the excitement and interest we 're seeing for JavaFX from many of the world 's top handset manufacturers , service providers and ISVs , which will help us bring this new technology to market and to the world very quickly . "
JavaFX common and desktop API profiles
One of Sun 's goals is to make JavaFX work seamlessly across desktop and mobile targets with support for a wide range of devices .
JavaFX Mobile supports the " core " API profile , which includes a subset of the JavaFX APIs that are supported on the desktop .
The APIs that are not available in the core set include the visual effects packages ( shadows , blurring , lighting , and reflection ) , the Swing user interface components , and support for introspection .
You can see specifically which parts of the API are missing from the common set by toggling between the " desktop " and " common " lists at the JavaFX API index page in the reference documentation .
In theory , developers should be able to make JavaFX applications that run on both desktop and mobile devices by sticking to just the common API elements .
In practice , it seems like a lot of existing JavaFX code and demos already depend on features that are not supported in the common API profile .
Fortunately , the difference between the desktop and common API profiles is slim enough to make porting relatively easy .
Developers can test applications with JavaFX Mobile by installing version 1.1 of the SDK and configuring the project in the NetBeans IDE to run in the mobile emulator .
To do this , simply open the project properties dialog , navigate to the " Run " page , and select the " Run in Mobile Emulator " option .
After setting that preference , NetBeans will automatically launch the emulator when you run the program in the IDE .
My own simple demo application , which I developed for my hands - on review of the initial JavaFX release , requires features from the desktop API profile and consequently is n't compatible out of the box with JavaFX Mobile .
This is also true of most of the demo applications that Sun provides with the SDK .
Sun provides a mobile variation of the Display Shelf demo which does work out of the box , so it 's a pretty good place to start if you just want to see the emulator in action .
The Display Shelf Mobile demo also provides some useful insight into the process of porting desktop JavaFX applications to work with the common API profile .
If you run a diff to compare the Display Shelf and Display Shelf Mobile demos , you can see that Sun did n't have to change much to get it to work .
JavaFX
Mobile is intended to work on everything from high - end smartphone products to basic handsets .
Although this will allow JavaFX Mobile applications to reach a broad audience , it creates some challenges for developers .
Runtime performance and screen resolution will not be consistent across that entire product spectrum and developers will have to build their JavaFX software accordingly .
Other features
JavaFX 1.1 includes a number of other improvements in addition to mobile support .
The JavaFX media production suite got an update , performance and stability have been improved , and several new features — such as full - screen support — have been added for desktop applications .
JavaFX is still not supported on the Linux platform , but Sun says that it is fully committed to achieving Linux compatibility .
Sun wants the Linux port to use platform components like GStreamer and integrate well with native services .
Java ME has traditionally been one of the most popular vehicles for delivering third - party software on mobile devices .
This is changing rapidly as developers turn to native mobile frameworks in order to get more advanced functionality and broader support for accessing underlying phone features .
Flash is also beginning to displace Java in the mobile space in much the same way that it already has on the Web .
JavaFX Mobile could infuse Java with new life on handheld devices and give it a much - needed edge against Flash and other emerging technologies .
The past eight years have been so catastrophic for the United States that it is sometimes difficult to put things in perspective , but certain patterns do emerge .
Starting in the summer of 2007 , when Iraq was still in total chaos , Gen. Ray " Greater Than Napoleon " Odierno gave a series of press conferences in which he stated that Iran was providing weapons and training to both Shi’ite and Sunni insurgents .
Charges that Iran was also supporting al - Qaeda soon followed , and both congressional and media critics were soon in full cry , leading to the Kyl - Lieberman amendment of September 2007 , which all but declared war on Tehran .
The absurdity of Iran supporting Sunni terrorists who would sooner shoot a Shi’ite than a U.S. soldier did not in any way inhibit the spread of the story of Persian perfidy , which quickly spread throughout the mainstream media , confirming the carefully cultivated , widely held view that Tehran was killing Americans through its involvement in Iraq .
Now Iraq has calmed down , at least for the time being , and it is Afghanistan ’s turn to become the new " central front in the war against terrorism . "
And Iran is reported to be meddling again .
If that sounds familiar , it should , because it is the same story being told all over again by pretty much the same journalists and talking heads .
Iran is being portrayed as the evil force that is supporting the Taliban insurgency .
That history would suggest the contrary , that Tehran is unlikely to forget that the Taliban murdered 11 Iranian diplomats in Mazar - e - Sharif in 1998 and that Taliban doctrine considers Shi’ites heretics who should be killed , apparently is not enough to ruin a good story .
The latest tale of Iranian evil intent surfaced in the Rupert Murdoch - owned Times of London on March 1 reporting that Iran is supplying the Taliban in Afghanistan with surface - to - air missiles capable of destroying helicopters .
Journalist Michael Smith attributes his information to otherwise unidentified " American intelligence sources . "
But both the Pentagon and the British Defense Ministry claim to have no information confirming Smith ’s account , and the Times has in the past often served as a conduit for disinformation put out by the British and Israeli governments .
The report suggests , based on no evidence whatsoever , that the Taliban wants to use the Russian - made SA - 14 Gremlin missiles to launch a " spectacular " attack against ISAF forces .
U.S. and NATO helicopters operating in Afghanistan are equipped with defensive systems to deflect missiles , but the SA - 14 can apparently evade most counter - measures .
According to the Times story , the presence of SA - 14s was first noted several weeks ago when parts from two of them were found during an American operation in western Afghanistan .
If effective mobile ground to air missiles were to be given to the Taliban , it would mark a major shift in the Afghan fighting , similar to the provision of Stingers to the mujahedeen to bring down Russian helicopters in the 1980s .
But it is not all that simple .
The SA - 14 is not state - of - the - art weaponry .
It has been around since 1974 , and tens of thousands have been sold to countries all over the world , including every country in central Asia .
Numerous SA - 14s are also believed to be available in commercial arms markets .
The link to Iran is far from demonstrated even if parts were found , suggesting that the story is a fabrication intended to further blacken Tehran ’s image and put more pressure on its government .
The jump from finding some parts , if it is even true , to an active , state - supported Iranian program to provide a battlefield weapon that Tehran surely knows would trigger a devastating U.S. response is simply not credible .
And then there is the question of nuclear Iran , always a convenient fallback line if one wants to make a case for preemptive warfare .
Not surprisingly , Israeli politicians and media have been leading the charge .
In the recently completed election campaign , leaders of the four leading parties , ranging from Labor on the Left to Avigdor Lieberman ’s Yisrael Beiteinu on the far Right , all denounced the Iranian threat and pledged to deal with it by military means if necessary .
That Israel does not have the military wherewithal to attack Iran unilaterally and also has the sticky problem of requiring Iraq overflight means that the United States would have to be involved in any such mission .
So far , the Obama administration has not signaled its willingness to become engaged in yet another preemptive war , but rest assured that AIPAC and its friends are working to overcome that obstacle .
The truculent Israeli position was dutifully picked up by the American media and replayed widely in spite of the report by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency that Iran ’s stockpile of low - level enriched uranium is all accounted for and there is no indication of any weapons program .
President Obama ’s reticence notwithstanding , when Israel wants war , Washington generally follows Tel Aviv ’s line .
Negotiations with Iran promised by candidate Obama may already be politically dead , designed to fail if and when they start .
Hillary Clinton has clearly indicated that she believes that negotiating with Iran is unlikely to produce any positive results , a position reflective of a high level of officially expressed skepticism in the new administration .
She has also said the proposed missile shield in Eastern Europe is intended to defend against Iran , even though Tehran has neither long - range offensive missiles nor warheads , while Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm .
Mike Mullen has stated that Iran already has the fuel to make a nuclear weapon .
New CIA Director Leon Panetta has said that Tehran is intent on building a bomb , and President Obama is also on board , indicating his belief that Tehran is moving to acquire nuclear arms .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates strikes a somewhat more cautious note , commenting that Iran is still far away from having an atomic bomb , a view supported by intelligence analysts at the CIA , who report that there is absolutely no evidence that Iran has a nuclear weapons program .
The views of Clinton , Panetta , and Obama should not be surprising , because they are making a political judgment based on their own assessment of Tehran ’s intentions , which is admittedly a tricky business and highly speculative .
For them , Iran is a potential threat that has been demonized for years in the United States , and no one has ever lost votes by attacking the mullahs .
Quite the contrary .
To give Obama his due , he probably would like to see talks with Iran succeed , but he is assuming the worst and hedging his bets .
He wants to have the powerful Israeli lobby on his side whichever way he turns .
Clinton ’s unwillingness to negotiate is somewhat simpler .
She is a faithful disciple of the Israeli lobby who does her annual pilgrimage to the AIPAC convention and says all the right things .
She will not do anything that looks like accommodating the Iranians .
And then there is the baleful presence of Dennis Ross , now busily furnishing his grand new office on the seventh floor of the State Department .
Thomas Friedman in the New York Times hails Ross as a " super sub - secretary , " part of a " diplomatic A - team " that will coordinate policy to put pressure on Iran to end its weapons program .
Friedman , who has been wrong in his assessments more times than Bill Kristol , is clearly pleased at what Ross represents .
Ross had his move to State announced somewhat prematurely by his colleagues at the AIPAC - affiliated Washington Institute for Near East Policy ( WINEP ) , and opposition to him almost derailed the appointment .
In addition to WINEP , he has recently been on the Israeli government payroll , serving as chairman of the Jewish People Policy Planning Institute .
One assumes that he has severed that particular connection , but he is nevertheless a terrible choice for any senior diplomatic post dealing with Iran .
His appointment is a sign that AIPAC had to be appeased by the new administration .
Because of Ross ’ considerable baggage , his new position was announced quietly through a press release , naming him as a special adviser for the Gulf and Southwest Asia .
He is another Clinton - era legacy that America can do without , having served recently on a bipartisan commission advocating talking with Iran as a prelude to bombing it .
He has powerful supporters in Congress and the Israel lobby who will undoubtedly seek to leverage his position to make him the point man for confronting the Iranians .
So there you have it .
Iran is not going to go away , and campaign promises are easily forgotten as the Obama players line up to continue the Bush policy .
Tehran will be cited as the agent provocateur if things go south in Afghanistan , as is all too likely .
If there is one truth about Washington , it is that both Republicans and Democrats alike need someone to blame when things go wrong .
If there were no scapegoat , they would have to blame themselves , and we ca n’t have that , can we ?
Two California - based firms involved in pairing infertile couples with surrogate mothers have stopped paying surrogates , raising fears about the status of thousands of dollars in advance payments from prospective parents , according to clients and employees of the firms .
Some pregnant surrogates say they have been left with no assurance of payment .
One surrogate who recently had a caesarean section is owed nearly $ 14,000 and has not yet been cleared by her doctor to return to work , according to her case manager at one of the firms , SurroGenesis USA .
Families were warned earlier this month in e-mails from a high - ranking employee at SurroGenesis that the company had received numerous complaints about surrogates , egg donors and vendors not getting paid .
The money for those payments was supposed to have been placed into trust accounts .
“ We want you all to know that after failing to receive satisfactory answers regarding the holding companies ’ financial status , and in the interest of protecting those dependent on receipt of funds . . . we have contacted the authorities and requested an investigation , ” said the messages , which The Times reviewed .

Many families now fear the worst .
Some who sought help having children from SurroGenesis and its partner , Michael Charles Independent Financial Holdings Group , say the funds they deposited with the firms amount to their life savings .
At least one costly egg retrieval was canceled at the last minute after the doctor learned that money deposited to cover the fees was missing , according to Andrew Vorzimer , an attorney from Woodland Hills who was contacted by the doctor for advice .
Los Angeles resident Virginia Fout , 38 , said she and her husband , Michael Whetstone , had about $ 21,000 in an account with the Michael Charles group and now fear it is gone .
“ I ’m angry , to be quite honest , ” Fout said .
“ I feel completely duped . . . and blindsided . ”

The money that families are concerned about totals at least $ 2 million , according to attorneys working with couples and surrogates , who come from across California , elsewhere in the United States and Europe and China .
“ In this industry , it does n’t get any worse than this , ” said Vorzimer , who has been advising some of the families .
“ For some of these couples , it is just devastating . ”
Some couples said they had filed reports with local and federal authorities .
Several others said they had given information to Vorzimer and a second attorney , Sterling Johnson , who said he has been in contact with law enforcement officials .
FBI spokesman Steve Dupre confirmed Friday that the bureau ’s office in Modesto , where the companies are based , is evaluating several complaints that it received last week .
Dupre said the case is too new to declare it an official investigation .

Jack Kiserow , president of the Michael Charles group and one of SurroGenesis ’ directors , told The Times that he is cooperating fully with federal agents .
“ We know who the guilty party is , ” he said , adding that authorities need to be given time to do their jobs .
According to the payment schedule listed on the SurroGenesis website , prospective parents paid the company a $ 12,000 fee .
The company also required payment to surrogate mothers of at least $ 18,000 , as well as legal fees and money for maternity clothing , medical care and other expenses that add thousands to the bill .
Advertisement
To pay those costs , SurroGenesis recommended that prospective parents set up trust funds administered by the Michael Charles group , clients said Friday .
Two SurroGenesis employees , Cynthia Kiser , a case manager , and Ann Robinson , the firm ’s quality assurance officer , told The Times that they believe a substantial amount of money is missing .
Both women said they had been contacted by law enforcement agencies looking into the matter .
Robinson said she has provided investigators with company records .
Kiser said families have been frantically trying to find out what happened to that money .
“ We ’re all grasping at straws , ” said Kiser , who added later that she was laid off Friday and did not receive her scheduled paycheck .
She said she had called her boss , Tonya Collins , last week looking for answers .
Kiser said she asked Collins : “ Where ’s the money ? ”
Advertisement
She said Collins responded : “ All I can tell you is talk to my lawyer . ”
Collins is listed in company papers as president and chief executive of SurroGenesis and a director of the Michael Charles group .
Phone numbers given for Collins have been disconnected .
A call to Kevin Clancy , a Texas attorney who Kiserow said is representing Collins , was returned by someone in Clancy ’s office who said Clancy would have no comment on a pending case .
Clancy ’s website describes him as a criminal defense attorney .
By Friday , portions of the SurroGenesis website listing offices across the country were accessible only through Internet caches of the pages .
The website for the Michael Charles group , which was operational as recently as late Thursday , was listed as suspended by its host company .

One surrogate , Natash McDuffy , 33 , of Houston , is on doctor - ordered bed rest , eight months pregnant with twin girls .
She said that she waited for her $ 2,800 monthly check from SurroGenesis to arrive early this month but that it did n’t come .
The bills quickly started stacking up .
Her landlord sent her an eviction notice .
And her family ’s budget became tighter because she said her husband lost his postal service job in January and she had been unable to work since February .
A replacement check sent by the prospective parents arrived Friday , she said .
“ How dare they take a special moment like this ? ” McDuffy said , referring to the companies .
“ The parents are already stressed . ”
The couple who hired her told The Times that they had talked to the FBI in Modesto and police in Austin , Texas , where they live .
Advertisement
Prospective father Michael Materie , a SurroGenesis client , said that despite getting the company ’s e-mail , he was initially not too worried .
Materie , of Simi Valley , said he thought he and his wife would be protected by their contract .
But he grew concerned when he learned of more people saying payments to their surrogates had stopped .
He said he and his wife had already spent $ 30,000 at a La Jolla fertility clinic and paid SurroGenesis ’ $ 12,000 fee .
In addition , they had placed $ 50,750 in a Michael Charles holding account , money Materie now believes is gone .
Materie said they had been holding out hope that embryos already transferred to their surrogate would result in a baby .
But on Thursday , their fertility doctor told them the surrogate was not pregnant .
“ I was thinking that something positive could come from this , ” Materie said .
“ Now , we do n’t have the money to continue on . ”
Advertisement
For the last two weeks , his wife had been knitting a blanket for a baby , he said , that may never come .
“ Today she said to me , when we found out we wo n’t be having a baby , that we need to give this blanket to someone that can use it . ”

Clint Eastwoodâ€™s Top 3 Tips for Taking Charge of Your Life
â€ œIn school , I could hear the leaves rustle and go on a journey .â€ 
â€ œHollywood , as everyone knows , glamorizes physical courage .
. . . if I had to define courage myself , I would n't say it 's about shooting people .
I 'd say it 's the quality that stimulates people , that enables them to move ahead and look beyond themselves.â€ 
If you havenâ€™t been living under a rock for the last few decades you probably know who Clint Eastwood is .
At least a part of the real Clint Eastwood seems to be much like the people he has played throughout his career .
Determined and decisive .
Tough ( just watch Gran Torino for one badass 78 year old man ) .
Centered and not overcomplicating things .
Here are three of my favorite tips from Clint Eastwood for taking charge of your life .
1. Donâ€™t use self - fulfilling prophecies to bring yourself down .
â€ œI do n't believe in pessimism .
If something does n't come up the way you want , forge ahead .
If you think it 's going to rain , it will .â€ 
What you think will happen often does .
If you focus on and think that things will go badly you interpret things negatively and take actions â€ “ or no action at all â€ “ based on that .
You canâ€™t really see reality , you just have a perspective of it in your mind .
Now , whatever you perspective you use your mind will find proof that your current â€œrealityâ€ is â€ œthe right oneâ€ .
So you have to be smart about things .
Like Clint says , you have to let go of pessimism and choose a perspective that empowers you instead of making you feel like a victim and like things will always turn out in a negative way .
This can be hard because you are so used to your current perspective and feel like you are right about it since you have so much proof that it was right from past events .
Also , itâ€™s not that pleasant to admit to yourself that the negative perspective that you may have held for years or decades was a mistake that messed up your life instead of making it better .
When you take charge and choose for instance a more positive perspective things around you change .
Many of them may be the same things that were always there .
You just see them â€ “ and yourself – in a new light now .
And you can start using self - fulfilling prophecies to empower instead of disempower yourself .
Check out 8 Awesome Reasons to Blast Negativity Out of Your Life , and How to Do It for more practical tips on how I have gone from a negative attitude to a more positive one .
2 . Let go of the illusion of safety .
â€ œIf you want a guarantee , buy a toaster.â€ 
Why do people sit on their hands and get comfortable in their ease and quiet ?
Well , one big reason is because they think they are safe there .
But the truth is safety is mostly a superstition .
It is created in your mind to make you feel safe .
But there is no safety out there really .
Most things donâ€™t come with any guarantees .
Everything changes , for better or worse .
You may get layed off .
Someone may break up with you and leave .
Illness will probably strike .
Death will certainly strike in your surroundings and at some point come to visit you too .
This belief in safety is not just something negative .
Itâ€™s also created by your mind so you can function in life .
No point in going all paranoid about what could happen a minute from now day in and day out .
But there is also not that much point in clinging to an illusion of safety .
So you need to find balance where you donâ€™t obsessed by the uncertainty but also recognize that it is there and live accordingly .
As you stop clinging to your safety life also becomes a whole lot more exciting and interesting .
You are no longer as confined by an illusion and realize that you set your limits for what you can do and to a large extent create your own freedom in the world .
You are no longer building walls to keep yourself safe as those walls wouldnâ€™t protect you anyway .
3 . Take responsibility for your own life .
â€ œSometimes if you want to see a change for the better , you have to take things into your own hands.â€ 
You can look for the next big thing that will fix you .
Read more blog articles .
Read more personal development books .
Look for people to help .
And yes , some articles or books or people will give you insights that resonate deeply with you .
But in the end , if you are an adult then no one is coming .
No one is coming to save you .
You have to take responsibility for your own life and what happens in it .
Other things and people can certainly aid you quite a bit .
But you are responsible .
You can go around blaming society or some people for your problems in your life .
You can always find scapegoats to judge to feel better about yourself .
For a while .
You can look for people that will â€œfix youâ€ .
You can do this for the rest of your life if you like .
It wonâ €™t change much .
Whatever has to be done , itâ€™s you who have to take responsibility and do it .
Yeah , things might always not go your way and you will probably have bad luck from time to time .
But you still have to focus on yourself and doing what you can do in whatever situation may arise in the outside world .

RNC Loses Online Director
By Jose Antonio Vargas
The GOP 's top Internet official is leaving the Republican National Committee .
Arguably the most respected technocrat in the Republican Party , Cyrus Krohn is just the latest in a string of officials to resign from the RNC ; last week , the RNC 's finance director quit .
But because GOP Chairman Michael Steele made leveraging the Internet to attract voters to the Republican Party a top priority ina tech summit two weeks ago , Krohn 's departure comes as an especially heavy blow -- not just to the RNC , but to the conservative blogosphere .
A veteran of Microsoft and Yahoo , Krohn joined the RNC in July 2007 and started to reboot the party 's online infrastructure .
Immediately , he launched new sites within GOP.com ( such as GOPPlatform2008.com , which allowed visitors to help shape the party 's platform in advance of the Republican National Convention ) , created the RNC's Facebook group ( which now has roughly 7,000 more members than the Democratic National Committee ) and grew the RNC 's e-mail list from 1.8 to 12 million .
Krohn announced his resignation in a blog post on E - Voter Institute , a 10 - year - old , nonpartisan think - tank where he sits on the board of advisers .
In a posting titled " RNC - YA , " Krohn outlines the challenges facing the GOP on the Web .
The party does n't lack for bloggers and Twitterers who gets the message out , he said , but the GOP needs platforms and applications to allow more people to self - organize and become activists .
" Change comes quickly online and the tide will turn again in favor of the GOP , once we hone our message and harness emerging technologies .
To do that , we must match Democrats , programmer - for - programmer , " Krohn wrote .
" Regrettably , we 're in terribly short supply of professionals focused solely on building platforms and applications .
This is where we got dot bombed in 2006 and 2008 .
Maybe we should start providing computer science scholarships in exchange for a commitment to serve our party ? "
In an interview , Krohn said he 's moving back to Seattle with his family .
He has no job lined up at the moment , he told The Post , but he 's thinking of running for office .
And , true to form , he logged off from the RNC with his sense of humor intact :
In the blog post , Krohn hints at helping build applications for whoever runs for president in 2012 -- only to leave readers RickRolled .
This is one in a series of online columns on our growing " clickocracy , " in which we are one nation under Google , with e-mail and video for all .

Bob Chapman | March 25 , 2009
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner tells us we are in a recession that will last for some time .
Ben Bernanke , Federal Reserve Chairman says the economy would bottom this year .
We do not think Ben is right but even if he was right he did n’t tell us how long we would bump along the bottom .
If the bottom is in sight and Citigroup , GE , Hartford Insurance Lincoln Insurance , AIG , GM and Chrysler , etc. wo n’t need any more government funding .
In fact banks are telling us they are going to make money in the first quarter .
If all this is so , why is Mr. Bernanke monetizing $ 300 billion of Treasuries .
We notice he has made no statement regarding the secret monetization that has been going on for four months .
Needless to say , that is another state secret .
He might also explain why there was enormous call buying in bond futures options over the three days prior to the announcement on Wednesday .
Obviously there was a major leak to the anointed on Wall Street .
While Ben Bernanke buys $ 300 billion in Treasuries he is contemplating another $ 300 billion .
In fact there is an excellent chance that the $ 300 billion , or at least a large part of it , has already been spent .
Between you and we , and the fence post , Ben will need at least $ 5 trillion for monetization .
What is being done is to cover debt and save the financial system , not to revise the economy .
At the same time , as you have gotten a taste of this week , the dollar was hit very hard .
Also on the agenda is hyperinflation .
We predicted this in 9/04 and here it is .
These policies will continue to extend the time line for a collapse .
Even Alan Greenspan says $ 1 trillion is not enough to remedy the financial system and economic ills .
Here we are on the threshold of going Weimar , as free trade and globalization , collapses perpetual currency devaluations take place and virulent inflation stalks the world , a hyperinflation that will destroy all but the very rich , who will in the end beg for their lives .
Mr. Bernanke knows all about Weimar , Argentina and other Latin experiments that were disasters .
All similar to what we see in America today .
Trying to overcome deflation with inflation is like shoveling sand against the tide .
More and more holders of US Treasuries and new buyers are walking away just like they are walking away from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds .
The idiot builders are at it again .
Lots of condos will hit the market this year , as Fannie Mae has added new restrictions .
They wo n’t guarantee condo buildings where less than 70 % have been sold , up from 51 % .
They wo n’t back loans for sales where 15 % of current delinquencies on association fees or where more than 10 % of units are owned by single - entity .
Bill Gross , Chief Investment Officer at PIMCO says the Fed ’s purchase of Treasuries and toxic mortgage garbage will probably exceed $ 6 trillion .
As we have said before the so - called solutions are being performed by the same criminals who caused all these problems in the first place .
All we see is compounding problems .
It is incredible that the central bank has not been held accountable .
Washington ’s fiscal policy and the policies of the privately owned Fed are completely out of control .
The only real objective of Treasury and the Fed is to save the cabal that really controls our existence and that is Wall Street , banking and insurance .
Our money Masters tell us there is little inflation and they supply us with bogus statistics to prove it .
They tell us the trillions in guaranteed government debt will not cause inflation , which currently is 9 % to 10 % , and is headed toward Weimar proportions .
In three months it will be two years since the beginning of the collapse .
They talk about a short problem when it is already long term and it could last a score of years .
None of the problems we have cited in the past have been adequately dealt with .
It is all patch work and Rube Goldberg solutions .
There is no longer a standard .
The dollar is about to collapse and a basket of fiat currencies wo n’t do any better .
Low interest rates compound the problem .
Who wants to save ?
Inflation is 10 % and interest is 2 % or 3 % .
The whole marketplace is distorted by zero interest rates .
This is all Ponzi finance and it can come to no good end .
Manufacturing is and has been in decline for sometime now and it is going to deteriorate further .
Worldwide reductions are 30 % to 50 % .
The depth and speed of the plunge have been breathtaking and as we said on February 2 , 2009 , depression has begun .
In Europe , where manufacturing accounts for 20 % of GDP industrial production is down 12 % yoy .
Brazil has fallen 15 % and Taiwan 43 % .
In China exports have fallen and 30 million workers have been laid off .
This is the biggest , fastest decline since the great depression .
From 9/16/29 until WWII , everything except gold and gold shares fell in value .
At that time credit was tightened as consumer fears reduced demand for manufactured goods .
As a result unemployment will continue to rise worldwide .
Exports cannot be used to escape the problems created by the Fed , Wall Street and banking .
Germany is off 20 % yoy , Japan 40 % and in the US 23.6 % .
The second Great Depression is in progress .
This could last ten years or longer .
Manufacturing in the US is 14 % of GDP , 18 % worldwide and 33 % in China .
Manufacturing makes up 2/3 ’s of exports for the US .
What we are seeing is a race to the bottom .
In India , handicraft exports have fallen , which accounts for 16 % of GDP , some 55 % yoy .
Textile manufacturers have cut 500,000 jobs .
More cuts are coming for future years and with them revolutions in many countries .
Which would you rather have , a 2 - year Treasury bill that pays 0.87 % interest in a country with 10 % inflation or gold coins , bullion or shares ?
The answer is pretty easy – the gold related investments , which have been in a bull market since 2000 .
Inflation adds to gold ’s allure , but we are already seeing a flight to quality , as well as uncoupling from the dollar , other currencies and world stock markets .
We find it ludicrous that our government and Wall Street would have us believe that US Treasuries are as good as gold .
Even Queen Hillary tells us Treasuries are a safe bet .
What else would you expect from a member of the Illuminati ?
The result is a massive inflationary undertow building that is going to knock Americans right off their feet .
The dollar is headed back down and even though now decoupled from gold , its fall will tend to have a salutary effect on gold .
Having mega-inflation will give gold a big assist as well .
We predicted the recent announcement that the Fed was monetizing Treasury debt .
Not only had they been buying Treasury debt for four months secretly , but as we pointed out over the years they were secretly buying Treasuries via offshore location , something over $ 100 billion worth in just late 2008 .
We can imagine what first quarter purchases looked like .
Of course , you have no need to know what they are up too .
It is another state secret .
While this has been happening most other bonds , especially GSE , and toxic mortgage bonds find it hard to catch a bid and that is why hundreds of billions of dollars will be used by the Fed to buy them off the banks Wall Street and insurance companies , so American taxpayers can absorb their outrageous losses .
In addition , we saw a vast dollar outflow and January almost $ 150 billion .
We will soon find out if it was replicated in February .
China has been bailing out of Agencies and buying short term Treasuries , which is not reassuring .
Sooner or later some of those funds will find their way into gold .
It looks like the dollar has finally begun its decent versus other major currencies .
This puts the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve under additional pressure .
The US and world economy has been knocked for a loop and the worst is ahead of us .
All the manipulation they can muster will have little affect on where economies are headed .
The Fed has had to admit they have to do the unthinkable and monetize debt .
Before this is over the Fed will monetize more than $ 5 trillion as we follow - in the footsteps of Zimbabwe , where now only gold is accepted in payment .
We are entering un-chartered waters and there is a big hole in the bottom of the boat .
The first $ 1 trillion of Treasury purchases are underway and who knows how much has already secretly been placed in Washington and in hidden accounts in the Cayman Islands .
The only weapon the Fed has left is inflation , if you can really call that a weapon .
Falling asset prices have to be over come , along with a fall in consumer demand , foreclosures and rapidly rising unemployment .
Those policies will expedite a flight from the US dollar and Treasuries .
All buyers of dollar denominated assets know where this is headed and that is towards a depreciation of the dollar .
That means losses in the dollars they hold – big losses .
The question is who will break first and be a seller ?
As you know misery loves company and that is why the Bank of England is headed toward zero interest rates and as well is buying British long - term bonds .
Their economy is sinking faster than that of the US .
M4 money and credit is up 18.8 % .
Last week the Bank of Japan joined the party announcing quantum easing whatever that is .
All three want zero long - term bond rates , which means very little savings will be accumulated and the economy will continue to suffer a lack of capital , that does n’t come from a printing press .
Incidentally , there are no free capital markets left , TARP is not working and the Treasury is looked at with disbelieved .
The misnomer , known as quantum easing is not working and can only be thought of in terms of desperation , because the TARP and the bailouts are not working .
The government and the Fed cannot make house and commercial real estate prices go back up to capture all that lost equity .
The only way half of Americans can even make lower house payments is stop the payments , and give them the house , which we predicted five years ago would happen eventually .
Even at 4 % , 30 - year fixed rate loans , the payments mean nothing if you have lost your job .
Many people cannot even pay the interest on their debt .
The Geithner Treasury plan is a recycling of the Bush plan called trash for cash .
That is the program that was just abandoned six months ago , because it did n’t work .
Now we have another team of experts that are equally out of touch with things financial and economic .
Obama ’s judgment is few really get it and that is we have a dysfunctional financial system .
Both the Bush and Obama administrations want the easy way out and there is none .
Geithner is about to push the lie that bad assets on banks ’ books are really worth much , much more than anyone is currently willing to pay for them .
They think their true value is so high that if they were properly priced , banks and Wall Street would n’t be in trouble .
Someone should tell these crooks that because you say it is so , does n‘t make it so .
Subsidized purchases of bad assets with taxpayer funds to drive prices of toxic assets up stinks .
Geithner ’s plan will fail and Congress wo n’t supply any more subsidies .
In the Treasury ’s new 3 - part program to cleanse the US financial system of toxic assets that are clogging bank ’s balance sheets wo n’t work .
An entity will be set up that the FDIC will use to offer low - interest rate loans to private interests for buying up bank ’s soured assets , many of which are tied to mortgages that have fallen in value .
Treasury will hire outside investment managers to run public - private partnerships that could invest for potential profit for troubled mortgages , with government capital matching private capital contributions .
TALF , Team Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility , will buy so - called legacy assets , which we assume is purchases from New York ’s money center banks .
The program is a rehash of the Paulson program of six months ago that proved to be a failure .
Even Paul Krugman and James Galbraith have trashed the plan .
The Plan is a sweetheart deal for toxic mortgage buyers .
Government will supply 95 % of the funds from the taxpayers .
These buyers will be supplied non-recourse loans , loans secured only by the value of the mortgage assets being bought , worth up to 85 % of the portfolio .
Investors will supply as little as 20 % of the money .
In the final analysis government would fund 97 % and private investors 3 % .
The program is to enrich the rich on Wall Street and allow the public to pay for it .
The program is a fraud and it will end up a zombie .
After this the cries will be so loud that there will be no further giveaways .
Do n’t be fooled by the existing home sales numbers : 45 % of the sales were foreclosures and short sales , or banks dumping properties and speculators buying .
The big inventories signal much lower prices down the road from massive over supply .
GM and Chrysler that did n’t need any more money last week will need more than the $ 21.6 billion in aid they requested .
Where is the SEC ?
Mr. Bernanke says it will take a lot more taxpayer money to fix things just as political sentiment has shifted away from spending more money .
The chances of the Congress approving additional money right now for TARP is about nil .
Without trillions more we could end up with a 15 - year depression .
Whether the experts and the public know it or not the political system is in the process of being paralyzed .
No more Washington bailouts ; bankers and Wall Street screaming at Congress and the public screaming at Congress to stop giving money away .
Our conclusion is the system will fall further into depression and inflation will rage simultaneously .
The result will be higher gold and silver prices and a fall in Treasury prices and the dollar .
Keep in mind that the Fed can only monetize so much debt before we are Weimarized .
They cannot continue to buy fresh Treasury debt and buy existing debt from foreigners who are offloading .
The Fed will certainly be overwhelmed .
Debt levels are so high and so out of whack that we are really beyond re-flating and retaining a stable currency at the same time .
Dollar holders already see this and that is why the dollar has broken down from its recent highs – treasuries are next .
It is now only a matter of time before real interest rates rise strangling commerce and the government .
That will send banks reeling again as they have to foreclose on commercial real estate that is plunging in value .
Insolvency will reign .
You do n't .
Or else you wind up with ridiculous campaigns like these .
Advertisers have this problem : Kids today want things that are " dark " and " edgy " and " not retarded , " but some products just have nothing to do with any of those things at all .
So how in the world do you shape a marketing campaign for cereal or eye liner that somehow makes it badass ?
9 Sony's Lesson in Desperation
The strategy makes sense , on the surface .
Sony was competing with Nintendo's portable handhelds , and Nintendo has a kid- friendly image .
What better way to market the Sony PSP than by going " edgy " ?
So what 's the best way to do that ...

First , they tried vandalism , by hiring graffiti artists to tag various buildings with images of , well , little kids playing the PSP .
Somehow the hip underground was n't fooled , often vandalizing the Sony ads by spraying over them and ( accurately ) labeling it as " advertising directed at your counter culture . "
OK , that did n't go over so well .
So what else do kids like ?
Hey , how about racism ?
Like if we portrayed the introduction of the white PSP as some kind of interracial catfight ?
And then , finally , Sony went for the whole " fake viral fan video " thing when they set up a " fan " site called alliwantforxmasisapsp.com with a blog and a " it 's hilarious because it 's bad " amateur rap video :

After somethingawful.com formally called shenanigans , revealing the whole project not to be the product of an eccentric fan but , in fact , a giant room full of advertising executives , the site was reduced to this half - assed admission of guilt :
Busted .
Nailed .
Snagged .
As many of you have figured out ( maybe our speech was a little too funky fresh ? ?? ) ,
Peter is n't a real hip - hop maven and this site was actually developed by Sony .
Guess we were trying to be just a little too clever .
From this point forward , we will just stick to making cool products , and use this site to give you nothing but the facts on the PSP .

Meanwhile , some guy in a suit smacks his desk and says , " I knew we should have stuck with the racism thing ! "
I logged in to Facebook today to update a few fan pages I administer .
Right away , I noticed my list of fan pages seemed a bit longer than I remembered it being yesterday .
Interesting , considering I had deleted the fan page bearing my name months earlier .
Also , notice that I allegedly have 10 active fan pages .
I had 6 yesterday .
In fact , I am not sure I have had 10 pages total since creating my first Facebook fan page .
This clearly shows that Facebook does in fact keep information even after it is removed by the author of the content .
Interesting given the fact that Facebook ’s retention of information was a major focus in the ruckus surrounding the controversial TOS changes .
The reappearance of deleted content does n’t particularly concern me — I do n’t really have anything of major concern .
It does make me wonder , however , about users who do have some deleted skeletons in their closet ?
What are the implications for them ?
' There 's no honour in killing , ' top judge tells Muslim family in test case
Lord Justice
Wall said ' time had come to re-think the phrase " honour killing " '
A senior judge yesterday condemned the notion of honour killings as an affront to English law .
Lord Justice
Wall declared that ' they are acts of simply sordid criminal behaviour ' and ' had nothing to do with any concept of honour known to English law ' .
In an Appeal Court test case he ruled that the welfare of children should not be put at risk because of the ' honour ' idea held in some Muslim families .
The judge added : ' Arson , domestic violence and potential revenge likely to result in abduction or death are criminal acts which will be treated as such .
The case , involving three children of a Pakistani family who were removed by social workers and taken into care , is the first childcare case touching on honour issues to reach the level of the Appeal Court , which sets precedents to be followed in other courts .
The 41 - year - old father of the children asked for the right to have contact with them , but was refused .
He also asked that the children , who have been put in the care of white non-Muslim foster parents , should be sent to live with a Muslim family .
The children were removed from the family following the death of another child and violent incidents connected to the role of a woman in their extended family .
Their 32 - year - old mother is serving a five - year jail sentence for arson .
Violence in the family began when an uncle of the three children now in state care contracted a marriage to a woman from Pakistan , who was pregnant with her first child when she came to England in 2003 .
The child died at the age of 27 months after suffering multiple injuries .
The dead child was said in court to have shown injuries that may have been caused by sexual abuse .
The husband was convicted of murder .
However , senior members of the family made it clear that they took his side .
A grandfather described the death of the child as an accident and the will of God , and made it clear that the husband should return to live at the family home on his release .
The Royal Courts of Justice in London , where Lord Justice Wall handed down his decision in the case
The mother of the dead child was said by Lord Justice Wall to have been kept ' under virtual house arrest ' and to be unaware of the name of the city where she lived .
In May 2005 , with the help of police and social workers , she fled to a secret location with her second child .
She is said to remain in fear of her life .
The family 's campaign against the fleeing mother extended to involve the three children now in care and living with a foster family .
The mother of the three children - a sister of the husband convicted of murder - reported in 2005 that her sister - in - law had returned to the family home in the company of a friend and dressed in a burka and had assaulted the children .
She alleged that her sister - in - law had cut her hands and neck with a knife , poured white spirit over the clothes of one of the children , and had set fire to clothing .
The story was found to be untrue , and the three children were taken into care .
The foster parents of the three children - a girl of 11 and boys of nine and five - have since had to move several times because of fears for their safety .
Some Muslim women who refuse arranged marriages can face physical abuse for smearing their family 's ' honour '
Lord Justice
Wall said the woman who fled was regarded by the rest of the family as ' dispensable ' .
He added : ' Her flight and the disclosure of her treatment at their hands was seen by the rest of the family as being an insult to them .
They saw it , and continue to see it , as a disgrace . '
He banned publication of anything that could identify the three children but said it was ' important to an understanding of the case to note that the parents are both Muslims and that both the paternal and maternal families originate from Pakistan . '
The father was told he could not appeal against the decision to place the children with non-Muslim foster parents .
If they were placed with a Muslim family , it was likely their mother 's family would find out where they were , the court heard .
Lord Justice
Wall said : ' The message from this case , which must be sent out loud and clear , is that this court applies a tolerant and human rights - based rule of law : one which regards parents as equals and the welfare of the child as paramount .
' That is the law of England , and that is the law which applies in this case . '
HONOUR KILLINGS - THE FACTS :
The use of the term ' honour ' is a translation from the Punjabi and Urdu word ' izzat ' .
This word describes the concept of a family 's prestige and reputation within its community .
In many parts of the Indian sub - continent , a person 's entire life can be governed by a code of behaviour based on the need to maintain family honour at all times .
In most cases this involves observing a set of standards that , even to western eyes , is completely harmless and innocuous .
But in some families and some communities , the need to maintain honour is occasionally taken to extremes - and the need to recognise the law of the land ignored .
In such cases , the head of the family may decide that the only way to restore ' izzat ' is to remove the person who damaged it - hence a so - called ' honour killing ' .
Today 's case involved a Pathan family - a community that straddles both Pakistan and Afghanistan - said by expert witnesses to follow ' a prevalent tribal mentality ' .
The court was told that honour murders were ' not uncommon in Afghanistan and those areas where shame has been brought or people kill for precarious reasons . '
Victims of honour crime are usually women , but men who break family codes can also be punished for bringing their family into disrepute .
Fears that such crimes are frequent in Britain have come to the fore over the past decade .
A number of cases in which young women have died or disappeared have raised concerns that violent families have been able to put their own concepts of discipline and retribution above the law , and that such families are regularly protected by their friends , neighbours and communities .
There have also been concerns that police and prosecutors have been reluctant to investigate and act in such cases , possibly through unwillingness to provoke political or community trouble .
One notable murder was that of 20 - year - old Banaz Mahmod , who was raped , tortured and strangled at her South London home in 2006 .
Her body was later discovered in a suitcase in Birmingham .
Her father and uncle were later convicted of murdering her because she wished to marry a man who was not approved by the family - and had thus brought shame on them .
Miss Mahmod appealed to police for help before her death but was not taken seriously by officers .
One police officer , PC Angela Cornes , dismissed her as a melodramatic drunk three weeks before her death .
Miss Cornes was given only minor sanctions by the Metropolitan Police for her mistake and was last year promoted to sergeant .
The Appeal Court judgment is likely to concentrate minds on the occasional dangers of the honour system and how it sometimes becomes incompatible with the basic tenets of English law .

You have no images for now .
Mr Holbrooke pulled no punches with his comments on anti-narcotics efforts US efforts to eradicate opium poppy crops in Afghanistan have been " wasteful and ineffective " , the US envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan says .
Richard Holbrooke said the $ 800 m ( £ 550 m ) a year the US was spending on counter - narcotics would be better used in supporting Afghan farmers .
He said the US also wanted to see an increase in the numbers and capacity of Afghan police .
The US is currently conducting a review of policy on Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Efforts to eradicate poppy cultivation , Mr Holbrooke told a conference in Belgium - the Brussels Forum - had failed to make an impact on the Taleban insurgents ' ability to raise money from the drugs trade .
" It has n't hurt the Taleban one iota , " he said , " because whatever money they 're getting from the drugs trade , they get whatever they need whether we reduce the acreage or not . "
The US said last month that poppy cultivation had been reduced by 19 % last year .
Despite the drop , the UN estimates that Afghanistan accounts for 90 % of the world 's illicit heroin supply .
" The United States alone is spending over $ 800 m a year on counter - narcotics .
We have gotten nothing out of it , nothing , " he said .
" It is the most wasteful and ineffective programme I have seen in 40 years . "
' Corrupt police '
Mr Holbrooke said much of the money should be redirected to helping Afghanistan 's farmers .
He spoke of a " very significantly expanded agricultural sector job - creation set of programmes - irrigation , farmer to market roads , market places , seed . "
Opium trafficking provides the Taleban with much of its income The Obama administration is currently reviewing US policy towards Afghanistan and Pakistan .
President Barack Obama named Mr Holbrooke as his special envoy for the two countries shortly after taking office in January .
Mr Holbrooke also said the US had asked its allies in the Nato - led Isaf to help train thousands more Afghan police .
" The Afghan national police are an inadequate organisation riddled with corruption , " he said .
" We know they are the weak link in the security chain , so we have to figure out a way to increase the size and make them better at the same time . "
Senior Nato commanders have warned that there will be a further increase in violence this year .
President Obama has approved the deployment of 17,000 additional troops to fight the spreading insurgency .
Mr Holbrooke said , however , that the heart of the threat facing Nato in Afghanistan comes from western Pakistan , where the Taleban have much support .
But he made it clear that US and Nato forces would not chase insurgents across the border into Pakistan .
" There is a red line for the government of Pakistan and one which we must respect , " he said .

The agency that owns the space where the World Trade Center towers stood is freeing itself of the term " freedom " to describe the signature skyscraper replacing the buildings destroyed on September 11 , 2001 .
The One World Trade Center skyscraper is expected to be completed in late 2013 .
The change from Freedom Tower was revealed Thursday at a news conference where the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced the signing of the first commercial lease in the building to a Chinese company .
The building is expected to be completed in late 2013 .
" We 've referred to the primary building planned for the site as One World Trade Center -- its legal name and street address -- for almost two years now , as well as using the name the Freedom Tower , " said Stephen Sigmund , a spokesman for the Port Authority , in a statement released to CNN .
" Many will always refer to it as the Freedom Tower , but as the building moves out of the planning stage and into full construction and leasing , we believe that going forward it is most practical to market the building as One World Trade Center . "
Ten of the building 's planned 108 above - ground floors have been built .
" The fact is , more than $ 3 billion of public money is invested in that building , and , as a public agency , we have the responsibility to make sure it is completed and that we utilize the best strategy to make certain it is fully occupied , " Sigmund added .
He noted that the agency lost 84 colleagues in the September 11 attacks .
Mary Fetchet , founding director of Voices of September 11th , a group that commemorates the lives of those killed in the attack , said she was not familiar with the decision made by the Port Authority and was not willing to make a statement .
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , on the John Gambling radio show taped Friday morning , said he was not upset by the Port Authority 's decision .
" It 's up to the Port Authority , " he said .
" I have no idea what the commercial aspects are , and we can say , ' Oh , we should n't worry about that , ' but of course you have to , particularly now .
" I would like to see it stay the Freedom Tower , but it 's their building , and they do n't need me dumping on it .
If they could rent the whole thing by changing the name , I guess they 're going to do that , and they probably , from a responsible point of view , should .
From a patriotic point of view , is it going to make any difference ? "
He added , " one of the things is , we call things what we want to call them .
So , Avenue of the Americas is a good example , for it 's Sixth Avenue to most people .
Very few people use Avenue of the Americas .
If they name this One World Trade Center , people will still call it the Freedom Tower . "
The building was named the Freedom Tower in the first " ground zero " master plan .
Officials said at the time that the tallest , most symbolic of five planned towers at the site would demonstrate the country 's triumph over terrorism .
Representatives of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Vantone Industrial Co. announced Thursday the signing of a lease that will create the China Center , a 190,810 - square - foot business and cultural facility , to be on portions of the 64th floor and the entire 65th through 69th floors of One World Trade Center .
Hailing it as a great day for the Port Authority and its partners in the China center , Port Authority Executive Director Chris Ward added , " this is the first step in a long journey as downtown is finally rebuilt . "
The lease is for 20 years and nine months , beginning when the building is completed , with rents starting at $ 80 per square foot and escalating afterward .
The China Center also will have the right to lease up to two additional contiguous floors under the same terms , an option that expires at the end of 2009 .
The Port Authority also has commitments for more than a million square feet of leased office space in One World Trade Center from the U.S. General Services Administration and the New York State Office of General Services .
Leases for these two public agencies are being finalized .
These commitments , coupled with the China Center lease , represent nearly 50 percent of the office space in the building .
The China Center at One World Trade Center is expected to represent the elite of China 's business and cultural communities and serve as a hub for Chinese firms developing United States operations , as well as for U.S. companies that wish to conduct business in China or expand operations .
One World Trade Center will include 2.6 million gross square feet of office space on 70 office floors , a public lobby with a 50 - foot - high ceiling , an observation deck 1,265 feet above ground , a skyline restaurant , a wide array of shopping and parking .
The building itself will be 1,368 feet tall , and a spire at the top will bring the total height to 1,776 feet .
Beijing Vantone Industrial is one of the first private corporations established in China .
Today , the company is one of China 's largest private real estate investment companies with 13 subsidiaries , including one publicly traded company , Beijing Vantone Real Estate Co .

A landmark effort to transform Southern California ’s coastal waters into a network of havens for marine life has sparked a fierce debate over where to locate no-fishing zones that ecologists believe are needed to replenish the surrounding seas .
Divers , fishermen , conservationists , business owners and marine ecologists will toil over proposed maps for the next few months , deciding how much each is willing to sacrifice in the interest of saving plummeting populations of fish that are the cornerstone of recreational and commercial fishing and tourism .
“ Every square foot of the Southern California coastline is somebody ’s favorite fishing spot , ” said Steve Benavides , a tax attorney and diver of 40 years who is among the group of stakeholders hashing out their differences .
“ Reserves are insurance against our own well - intentioned mismanagement of marine resources . ”

Of particular concern is a swath of ocean off Santa Catalina Island where kelp beds are patrolled by sea bass , and submerged cracks and crevices bristle with spiny lobsters .
On the island ’s wind - swept western side , trawlers from Seattle , Portland , Ore. , and San Pedro haul up 400 tons of squid a night , leaving little left to eat for resident white sea bass prized by fishermen and marine ecologists alike .
The effort is being conducted under the California Marine Life Protection Act , which was adopted in 1999 to set aside a comprehensive , science - based network of marine parks and wilderness areas along the state ’s 1,100 - mile coast where fishing would be severely limited or banned .
The law was passed after scientists and fisheries managers determined that catches of many species , including bottom - dwelling rockfish and cod , had fallen as much as 95 % in recent decades .
Implementation was delayed for years by budget cuts , staffing shortages and fierce opposition from recreational and commercial fishing interests .
Southern California is the third region to be tackled under the program , which divided the state coastline into five parts .

Marine reserves have been created off the north - central and south - central portions of the state .
California has been leading the nation in establishing marine reserves , a relatively new approach to reviving habitats that have been overfished despite a complex array of traditional fishing regulations .
Extending the program to Southern California , one of the most heavily used stretches of ocean in the nation , has proved tricky .
Church Rock , a guano - covered outcropping pounded by surf just east of Avalon , is one of several areas being considered for a marine reserve .

On a recent sunny week - day morning , a group of supporters of the reserve led by Sara Sikich , coastal resources director for the nonprofit environmental group Heal the Bay , throttled down near the scenic site .
Strands of kelp nodded in the current .
Mackerel and blacksmith fish rounded the boat ’s hull .
White geysers on the horizon indicated a procession of migrating whales .
Bright orange and yellow buoys marked the locations of lobster traps .
Dozens of sea lions lounged on rocky reefs .
“ Environmentalists like good habitat for the same reasons fishermen do : bigger sea creatures and more of them , ” Sikich said .
“ Marine reserves , smartly placed , will ensure there are enough fish for everyone for generations to come , ” she said .

Not so fast , warn those whose livelihoods depend on the sea .
“ If they really want to restore local fisheries , they ought to push the squid boats off the island , ” said John King , who operates a commercial fishing boat , Afishionado , out of Avalon .
“ They come in at night by the dozens and pound this area with nets that drag along the bottom , ” he said .
Leslie Page , manager of the Redondo Beach Marina , whose clients fish the waters off Catalina and the Palos Verdes Peninsula , said the prospect of restrictions ranging from catch limits to outright bans “ scares me to death .
It ’s going to hurt all my lobster fishermen , pleasure fishermen , as well as hotels and restaurants . ”
Advertisement
But Bill Bushing , a marine ecologist who has been diving off Catalina for 40 years , believes reserves are the only hope of saving critical habitats and bringing back the kind of 400 - pounders that made scales creak a century ago .
“ The marine protection area selection process has become so tainted by politics and self - interests that it is losing sight of its original goal , ” said Bushing , who has proposed five no-fishing zones at Catalina .
“ That is to bring marine ecosystems back to life by setting aside a network of protected areas based on the best possible science .
“ It ’s not reserves that will ruin local economies , ” he added , “ it ’s overfishing . ”

DeLay defends Perry on secession
Former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay , looking tan and rested on MSNBC last night , offered his support to Texas Gov. Rick Perry — who suggested the Lone Star State could secede over the Obama administration 's tax policies .
The Hammer seemed sympathetic to the secession cause but dismissed the idea as , basically , a media - stoked lark .
" This is a governor standing up for his state , " DeLay told an incredulous Chris Mathews , who looked neither tan nor rested .
" Texas was republic when it joined the union by treaty " — adding that Texans could vote to nullify the treaty forcing the " U.S. Senate " to " kick us out " of the union .
When Mathews exploded — invoking 600,000 Americans killed in the Civil War — DeLay reassured him that " No , no they can't secede " but reiterated the legal argument for the state to assert its " sovereignty . "

Thrush is senior staff writer at Politico Magazine .
( CNN ) -- Senate Banking committee Chairman Christopher Dodd told CNN Wednesday that he was responsible for language added to the federal stimulus bill to make sure that already - existing contracts for bonuses at companies receiving federal bailout money were honored .
Sen . Chris Dodd , D - Connecticut , appears on CNN's " The Situation Room " on Wednesday .
Dodd acknowledged his role in the change after a Treasury Department official told CNN the administration pushed for the language .
Both Dodd and the official , who asked not to be named , said it was because administration officials were afraid the government would face numerous lawsuits without the new language .
Dodd , a Democrat , told CNN's Dana Bash and Wolf Blitzer that Obama administration officials pushed for the language to an amendment designed to limit bonuses and " golden parachutes " at those companies .
" The administration had expressed reservations , " Dodd said .
" They asked for modifications .
The alternative was losing the amendment entirely . "
On Tuesday , Dodd denied to CNN that he had anything to do with adding the language , which has been used by officials at bailed - out insurance giant AIG to justify paying millions of dollars in bonuses to executives after receiving federal money .
He said Wednesday that the " grandfather clause " language " seemed like innocent modifications " at the time .
Watch Dodd 's interview with CNN's Dana Bash »
" I agreed reluctantly , " Dodd said .
" I was changing the amendment because others were insistent . "
Dodd said he did not speak to high - ranking administration officials and the change came after his staff spoke with staffers from Treasury .
The White House did not immediately respond to CNN 's request for comment .
At a town hall meeting in Costa Mesa , California , about an hour after Dodd spoke , President Barack Obama did n't directly address the language change -- but said he 'll take responsibility for the bonuses being awarded .
" We did n't draft these contracts .
We 've got a lot on our plate .
But it is appropriate when you 're in charge to make sure stuff does n't happen like this , " he said .
" So we 're going to do everything that we can to fix it . "
Dodd said later Wednesday in a written statement that his amendment allows the Treasury Department to review bonus contracts like AIG's and seek ways to get the money back for taxpayers .
AIG 's derivatives branch is in Dodd 's home state .
Many of the bonuses in question were awarded to executives at that branch .
But in the written statement , Dodd said he had no idea the legislation would impact the company .
" Let me be clear -- I was completely unaware of these AIG bonuses until I learned of them last week , " he said .
Dodd also said in the statement that his comments on Tuesday and Wednesday to CNN did not conflict .
" I answered a question by CNN [ Tuesday ] night regarding whether or not [ an exemption before ] a specific date was aimed at protecting AIG , " he said .
" When I saw that my comments had been misconstrued , I felt it was important to set the record straight -- that this had nothing to do with AIG . "
According to a transcript of the Tuesday interview , Dodd was asked about an executive - compensation provision " that exempts everything prior to February 11 , 2009 -- any contracts prior to that date . "
He said that language was not in the version of the bill that left the Senate and that he was not one of the negotiators who hammered out a compromise between the House and Senate versions of the plan .
" I can't point a finger at someone who offered a change at all , " he said .
Asked whether he had later been able to figure out who added the language , he said , " I really do n't know . "
In Wednesday 's interview , Dodd never said his Tuesday comments had been misunderstood .
" Going back and looking , I apologize , " he said when questioned about his words from the day before .
On Capitol Hill Wednesday , AIG chief executive Edward Liddy called the roughly $ 165 million in bonuses " distasteful " but necessary because of legal obligations and competition .
" We have to continue managing our business as a business -- taking account of the cold realities of competition for customers , for revenues and for employees , " Liddy told a House Financial Services subcommittee .
" Because of this , and because of certain legal obligations , AIG has recently made a set of compensation payments , some of which I find distasteful . "
Pennsylvania Rep. Paul Kanjorski , the hearing 's chairman , responded to Liddy 's statement by arguing that AIG should have refused to pay all the bonuses -- regardless of its contractual obligations with the bonus recipients .
" Let them sue us , " said Kanjorski , a Democrat .
Liddy , who joined AIG after the bailout , said some employees have returned bonus money .
Senators and representatives have vowed to get the bonus money back , but questions have arisen about why Congress did n't act to prevent the bonuses in the first place .
" Well , the only lever we have in this is the fact that these corporations have come to the Congress of the United States and want a taxpayers ' bailout , " Sen .
Chuck Grassley , R - Iowa , said Wednesday on CNN's " American Morning . "
" If it were n't for that , we would not have any leverage on how any individual corporation is being run , and we do n't pretend to have any leverage on any corporation today in the United States that 's not seeking federal help , " said Grassley , the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee .

AIG , an ailing insurance giant , has received more than $ 170 billion in federal assistance .
Taxpayers now own nearly 80 percent of the company .
In a letter to Congress on Tuesday , New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo confirmed that AIG paid 73 employees bonuses of more than $ 1 million each this year after it received federal bailout money .
AIG will have to return the $ 165 million it paid in executive bonuses to the Treasury Department , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Tuesday .
Grassley and Sen. Max Baucus , D - Montana , on Tuesday introduced a plan that would impose a hefty tax on retention bonuses paid to executives of companies that received federal bailout money or in which the United States has an equity interest .
Watch Grassley describe how the tax would work »
Other lawmakers , such as Rep. Charlie Rangel , D - New York , said it would be unfair to use the tax code as punishment , but Grassley said it 's not a question of being fair .
" It 's unfair what they did to the taxpayers by paying bonuses when they do n't have the money to pay bonuses , " he said .
iReport.com : Sound off on AIG
Rep. Barney Frank , D - Massachusetts , said Wednesday that Congress can't just pass a law to abrogate any past contracts because that move would not hold up in court .
Instead , he argued the executives do n't deserve bonuses under the contract .
Watch what Frank says about the bonuses »
" We own this company in effect , and we 're not asking that these bonuses be rescinded because we have lent money to the company .
I believe we are saying as the owners of the company , we do not think ... we should have paid bonuses to people who made mistakes who were incompetent , " said Frank , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee .

It ’s raining , pouring economic fallacies by the hour , followed by a flood of horrible policy that is driving us ever further into economic depression .
The regime in charge has really gone nuts , revealing itself as both deeply ignorant and horribly evil .
We find ourselves facing the horror of what has always been the Achilles ’
Heel of the left wing : its abysmal ignorance of economic science .
The ideological tendency has gone from Keynesianism to outright socialism in a matter of a few weeks .
And the trajectory seems to be accelerated mainly by the logic of the interventionist cycle : bad policy leads to bad results that are addressed through bad policy , and so on , straight down the fast track to serfdom .
Obama ’s attachment to “ transparency ” — the buzzword of the day — allows all intelligent people to observe the sickening sight in real time , and to the cheers of the kept class of intellectual phonies like Ben Bernanke and Paul Krugman .
The encouraging thing — and perhaps this too was inevitable — is that the right wing is getting its act together .
It has suddenly discovered that economics matters .
You can cheer on the hot wars , fight the culture wars , and crack down on political dissidents all you want .
But in the end , what makes for the good society is a sound economy .
Without it , all the rest falls apart .
Thus all our favorite conservatives are starting to make sense .
The American Spectator is alarmed .
Rush Limbaugh sounds like LRC .
The American Conservative has temporarily dropped its love of protectionism to warn of dollar inflation .
The love of war has gone AWOL at National Review .
The Heritage Foundation is warning that government spending and taxation are driving us to ruin .
Pat Buchanan is defending the free market .
Where were these people during the last eight years of Bush ’s misrule ?
Asleep , or seeking preferment , or something .
It ’s not as if Obama caused this crisis ; he is only making it worse .
In any case , the right has begun to turn to the side of truth and justice , precisely as they did during Clinton ’s rule , and this is all to the good , in general .
But just in case we are again observing yet another expedient shift , it might be a good idea to understand precisely why socialism is a bad idea .
The Obama administration does n’t seem to get it .
And there is plenty to get .
Socialism crushes human rights , builds the state , impinges on the liberty of conscience , and breeds social , cultural , and economic degeneration .
People have made those points for hundreds of years .
Somehow , and for whatever reason , many people rejected these critics .
No , they said , all of this sounds plausible , but you do n’t understand how the sheer glory of the socialist ideal , with perfect equality and social justice , will bring about a new sense of things .
Mankind will be inspired to share , create , work , and obey by the astonishing emergence of a completely new form of social organization .
Ludwig von Mises in 1920 , however , added something special and new to the critique of socialism .
He said that socialism in all its forms cannot accommodate any economic development beyond the hunter - gatherer stage .
And the reason has to do with the socialist attack on the ownership and exchange of capital goods .
Without ownership , there is no exchange , and so prices do not emerge .
Here is his 1920 essay , which says it all .
Without market prices for capital goods , accounting is not possible .
You do n’t know if you are making money or losing money , saving resources or wasting them , doing the right thing or not doing the right thing .
Think of all the decisions that have to be made on the production end that require you to know whether you are wasting resources or not .
With steel , do you make more buildings or trains ?
Or do you make cutlery or computers ?
Or cars or cables ?
You ca n’t just rely on assessing consumer demand .
The demand for stuff is infinite .
What matters are choices in light of foregone alternatives .
These ca n’t be discerned with polls or intuition .
What matters here is the weighting of all alternative uses of resources .
They can only be worked out in real time , in light of the choices of consumers and the profitable production decisions of producers .
None of this is possible if you do n’t have real market prices providing the real stuff that makes cost accounting possible .
Collectivize property and you abolish the market for capital goods .
No prices emerge .
Every choice you make is arbitrary .
There is no more rationality remaining .
You just end up groping around in the dark .
No socialist has ever been able to provide an answer to Mises ’s devastating point .
And why ?
Because no socialist has seriously thought through how their cockamamie system would work .
Lenin used to say , oh whatever , just run the whole economy the same way the post office is run .
But notice : the post office has a problem with innovation , pricing , cost accounting , and making ends meet .
Its only source of life comes from the competition provided by private competitors .
The post - officeization of the entire economy would mean a return to barbarism .
Mises ’s illustration of the failure of socialism provides a fantastic means to discover what is right about markets and wrong about all forms of collectivized economic planning .
It shows what happens when you nationalize banks and credit .
But it also shows what is wrong with all bureaucracies .
Mises put all his criticism together in a single book , a book that remains the definitive refutation of the entire intellectual apparatus of socialism .
It is a classic , a must - read , a treasure for all ages .
To read it is to be amazed .
It has changed the minds of millions of people since it appeared in 1922 .
It is the one book that utterly crushes the economic agenda of the left , revealing what fools they really are .
Mises ’s point has also been a fruitful one for further theorizing about all forms of collectivism .
See , for example , Hans - Hermann Hoppe ’s Theory of Socialism and Capitalism .
And look : it ’s not as if socialism is a new idea .
It was tried in the 20th century .
It produced economic stagnation and despair .
In its purest form , it extinguished more than one hundred million people .
That ’s why The Black Book of Communism must be owned and read and understood by every thinking person .
It is the most terrifying book you will ever read .
It is a standing rebuke to any living soul who claims that economic understanding does n’t matter .
Take this seriously : it is where the Obama tendency is leading us .

CARACAS , Venezuela —
On a rooftop bar in Caracas , Venezuelans clad in Ralph Lauren shirts and Gucci shoes sip $ 16 cocktails and discuss their latest shopping trips to Miami .
These are the sort of people who would fit Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ’s description of the “ fetid oligarchy ” : families that , over generations , accumulated fortunes from the country ’s vast oil reserves at the expense , Chavez says , of the country ’s poor .
Standing shoulder - to - shoulder with those longtime members of Venezuela 's upper crust are one or two " boligarchs " — a new political class that has amassed its fortunes by backing Chavez 's Bolivarian revolution .
All became increasingly wealthy during an oil boom that saw the price of a barrel of Venezuelan oil rise from $ 8 when Chavez came to power to a high of $ 126 last year .
The country as a whole has also benefited :
The economy has been growing at an annual rate of 8 percent for the past five years , and Chavez has funneled money to social programs .
With little foreign investment to worry about , Chavez initially gloated over the fall of Lehman Brothers , blaming it on the failings of capitalism .
But Venezuela is no longer immune .
The sharp collapse in oil prices — the Venezuelan crude basket averaged $ 33.93 last week — has prompted the government to change its rhetoric .
“ If this carries on for two or three years , which is possible , one would think that it would lead to difficult consequences , ” Finance Minister Ali Rodriguz said on Tuesday .
Some analysts believe Venezuela could feel the pinch sooner — even within the next year .
“ We are heading towards a certain crisis next year , ” said Asdrubal Olivares , director of Ecoanalitica , a financial consultancy firm in Caracas .
“ What most worries us in 2009 is that we 're going to have an economy in stagflation — with a very strong stagnation of the economy and a very , very high level of inflation . ”
The government saved up large reserves during the boom years , believed to be in the range of $ 47 billion , which should see it through the year , said Olivares .
But beyond 2009 the outlook is bleak .
Inflation has already been hitting consumers hard .
While poverty fell in recent years from 51 percent to 28 percent — in part because of massive government spending on social programs — inflation is now eroding the gains Chavez has made in reducing poverty .
Prices rose by more than 30 percent last year , and by as much as 50 percent for essentials such as food .
“ In 52 years living here I ’ve never seen something like this , ” said Pascuale Giacinto , a retired carpenter from Italy now living in Los Simbolos , a middle - class area of the capital .
“ My pension goes on electricity , telephone bills , but not much else . ”
The government has set up food markets that sell basic food staples at controlled prices , but Giacinto said , “ I do n’t like going there because the things are awful . "
Meanwhile , a black market exchange rate for the dollar — almost three times the official price — has encouraged a flight of capital to the tune of $ 22 billion , Olivares said .
In the recent Stanford Bank scandal , it emerged that Venezuelans had invested about $ 3 billion out of the $ 9 billion that is believed to have been lost .
Venezuela 's economy is tied up in oil , so the decline in oil prices has hit the country hard .
Venezuela depends on oil for about 90 percent of its exports , and oil revenues make up almost 50 percent of its budget .
The government claims it is producing about 3.3 million barrels of oil a day , but independent analysts believe the figure is closer 2.7 million barrels a day , of which 700,000 are sold at subsidized prices on the domestic market .
Of the oil that is exported , 500,000 barrels are sold to countries on deferred payment deals under a scheme known as Petrocaribe , while 400,000 barrels that come from the heavy tar fields of the Orinoco Belt in the west of the country cost $ 15 to $ 20 a barrel to upgrade into conventional oil , which cuts into profits .
Signs that Petroleos de Venezuela ( PDVSA ) , the national oil company , is struggling with its finances emerged earlier this month :
It delayed payment of $ 8 billion to other companies .
“ Production is declining because regrettably Venezuela has not been a good steward with its windfalls — with the high price of oil for the last two years , ” said Jorge Pinon , an energy fellow at the University of Miami .
“ That money has gone into social programs instead of going back into PDVSA . ”
Pinon said that to make Chavez ’s popular social programs sustainable , PDVSA should be investing in the maintenance of existing oil wells – and even upping production .
He estimates that production fell by 11 percent last year .
Many speculate that the government may be forced to devalue the bolivar , the Venezuelan currency .
It has been fixed at a rate of 2.15 to the dollar since 2003 , in what was initially intended as a temporary measure to bolster Venezuela ’s foreign reserves .
But many economists believe a devaluation would provide the liquidity the government needs to maintain its significant public spending .
Rodriguez said Tuesday , however , that he feared a weak bolivar would curtail the government ’s ability to import essential commodities — Venezuela imports 70 percent of its food .
Chavez has ruled out cuts in spending on the popular " missions " — projects that have brought free health clinics and literacy classes the country ’s many barrios .
But he either needs the price of oil to dramatically increase , or he needs to figure out a way to bolster the economy so the programs can continue beyond 2009 .

Top 10 : Horrible Jobs
Page 1 of 3
Think your job sucks ?
You may appreciate it a little more once you read our top 10 list of horrible jobs .
There ’s no doubt you ’ve worked your share of horrible jobs , but we ’ve compiled a list of some of the riskiest , most dangerous , gut - churning jobs around .
These horrible jobs meet a combination of all the following requirements : they ’re low - paying , they have terrible working conditions and they put workers at a high risk for immediate and / or long - term injury .
If you spot your horrible job here , take a bow — you ’re part superhero for living through it .
For everyone else , put down any food you might be chewing on and check out what made the list of the top 10 most horrible jobs in existence .
Number 10
Restaurant dishwasher
Number 9
Slime line workers
Number 8
Barnyard masturbator
Called “ dish pigs ” because they have their hands in human leftovers all day , restaurant dishwashers have a horrible job .
They scrub burnt saucepans , dip their fingers into corrosive cleaning solutions , inhale chemical solvents and , worst of all , empty fryer grease into a “ grease pit ” that smells somewhere between vomit and rotten meat .
Dishwashers also work in high - stress conditions with wait staff and cooks putting constant demands on them for everything from cutlery to pans .
They can also be easily injured , cutting or nicking themselves with knives , and scalding themselves on hot pans .
But Band - Aids and gauze do n’t help because they have to plunge their hands right back into dish muck .
Of course , this guarantees their infection .
So , what do they get for their toil at this horrible job ?
They do n’t clean up at all , making around 17 K a year .
Slime line workers cut fish open , rip out their guts and throw them down the line in a fish - processing plant .
It sounds easy enough , but the conditions are pretty tough .
Hillary Clinton once worked this horrible job and said it was the worst she ’s ever had ( apart from trying to beat Obama ) .
Workers are in a cold plant where they stand all day , ankle - deep in fish blood and guts where they can easily cut themselves .
Since their hands are covered in slime , it ’s a certainty their cuts will get infected .
One of the biggest negatives , however , is the smell .
Unless workers date each other , their fishy scent wo n’t win them many outside admirers .
Plus the wage stinks , averaging $ 9.87 an hour .
This might be the funniest job title of all - time and it ’s sure to drop jaws when you tell people what you do for a living .
The barnyard masturbator , er , masturbates livestock to collect sperm samples .
They make their collection in three ways : electroejaculation — they jam an electric probe up a cow ’s rectum to buzz its bits ‘ til orgasm ; artificial vagina — they hold a latex tube over a bull ’s Johnson just before it mounts a cow ; manually — they do the tried - and - true wrist workout .
Apart from the danger this horrible job poses to its workers ’ social life , workers regularly get injured from bull kicks .
It ’s not clear how much they get paid , but they certainly earn every cent .
Be thankful you do n’t do any of these horrible jobs …

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Scientists have uncovered a group of 40 genes that appear to make North America ’s monarch butterflies fly thousands of miles south each autumn .
It is the first time that researchers have honed in on the exact genes driving migratory behavior in any animal .
Monarchs are famous for their epic 4,000 km ( 2,500 miles ) overland migrations from Canada to Mexico , but what drives them has been a mystery .
Now neurobiologist Steven Reppert at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and colleagues have found a suite of genes that are activated when the insects migrate .
“ Our data are the first to provide a link between gene expression profiles in the brain and migratory state in any animal that undergoes long - distance migration , ” they wrote on Tuesday in the British - based open access journal BMC Biology .
Hundreds of millions of monarchs fly to ancestral feeding grounds in Mexico every year in a journey which is unique in the butterfly world .
They use an internal clock and a “ sun compass , ” which senses the angle of the sun , to orientate themselves on the journey .

This case is not about just us .
It 's about justice .
My wife , Diane , and I will never say , " Please do n't divorce us . "
There is a very moving public service announcement all over the Internet in which same - sex couples are holding up a sign or saying , " Please do n't divorce us . "
The music in the background is compelling , and the announcement , which collects thousands of names for the organization that produced it , should have made Diane and me very happy , especially because there is a clip of our wedding in it .
But it did n't .
Once I got over the hearts and flowers of seeing other same - sex married couples , I became very angry .
Because that PSA is totally off message .
The upcoming March 5 California Supreme Court case is not about us .
If the court rules that only existing marriages of same - sex couples are valid , it will be a hollow victory , because we do not want to be the only ones on the Freedom Train .
The California Supreme Court needs to overturn Proposition 8 because what Prop. 8 does - for the first time in American history - is to take out of a constitution a group that has been declared equal by the Supreme Court .
This is dangerous , because it means 50 percent of the people plus a single vote can vote to take away protections for labor , for unions , to take women and minorities out of the Constitution , to take YOU out of the state Constitution .
The legal challenge to Prop. 8 is supported by hundreds of religious organizations , civil rights groups , women 's organizations and labor unions , along with numerous California municipal governments , bar associations and leading legal scholars .
What started out as a fight for loving same - sex couples wanting the fundamental right of marriage has exploded into one of the biggest civil - rights cases in American history , because now we , and all of the attorneys on our side , are standing up to defend the constitution for all of us .
Diane and I are optimistic .
Of course , we are not attorneys , which I 'm sure gives us a leg up on optimism .
But why would the California Supreme Court not overturn Prop. 8 , when the proposition would also give people the power to challenge all of the court 's decisions protecting minorities against the loss of fundamental rights ?
Would n't this make the court obsolete ?
Some people have said , " Well , you can always put your right to equality back on the ballot in 2010 . "
Excuse me ?
Since when was it OK for people to vote on a group 's rights to basic equality and civil rights ?
Equality is n't a popularity contest .
It 's the right of all California citizens .
Nobody 's rights should ever be put to a popular vote .
That 's why we have a court system .
And that 's why Diane and I are confident the court will show the courage it did when it not only ruled for marriage equality for same - sex couples but also declared that lesbians and gays were a suspect class , a legitimate minority entitled to all rights .
If the court does rule for us , tens of thousands of us will be on the streets that night celebrating a great victory , not just for us but for everyone .
But if we lose and Prop. 8 stands , even if the court rules to uphold existing same - sex marriages , hundreds of thousands of us will be on the streets , angrier than we have ever been .
The time for saying " please " is over .
Labour still has a slim chance of seeing off the Tories at the next general election if it can show that the economy is beginning to improve by polling day , a Guardian / ICM poll reveals today .
The Conservatives have maintained their 12 - point lead over Labour , and David Cameron has extended his advantage as the most popular potential prime minister of the three main party leaders , the poll shows .
But the survey offers a sliver of hope to Gordon Brown that Labour can become the largest party in parliament – if he can persuade wavering Tory and Liberal Democrat voters that he has started to reverse the recession in time for an election next year .
Two - thirds of the electorate , 65 % , say clear signs of a recovery in the economy by the expected date of the next election , May 2010 , would " make no difference " to their voting choice .
But 9 % of Tory voters and 22 % of Liberal Democrat voters say they are " more likely to consider voting Labour " if the economy shows clear signs of recovery by then .
That suggests roughly 8 % of those voters presently planning to vote Conservative or Lib Dem could be persuaded to switch to Labour .
The findings will reinforce some
Tory anxiety that their lead is " soft " , and confirm cabinet ministers ' view , expressed in the second part of the Guardian 's series on Labour tomorrow , that all is not yet lost for the governing party .
Analysts believe a dead heat between Labour and the Tories on share of the national vote is likely to make Labour the largest party in the Commons and possibly give Brown a workable majority , but the scale of the mountain facing him remains formidable .
The poll shows the Tory lead at 12 points for the third month in a row , with the Tories and Labour both unchanged on 42 % and 30 % respectively .
The Lib Dems are up two on 20 % , and others are on 8 % , including 3 % for nationalist parties and 2 % for the Greens .
David Cameron 's personal lead over Gordon Brown is even bigger : 45 % of those polled say he would make the best prime minister of the three main party leaders , compared with Brown 's 24 % .
Cameron 's 21 - point lead over Brown is an increase of 13 points since the Guardian and ICM posed the same question in April 2008 .
About one in six Labour voters , 17 % , say Cameron would be a better prime minister than Brown .
The poll shows that voters are weary of Labour .
ICM asked voters which of two opposing thoughts they were more likely to agree with .
Just one in four voters , 25 % , said that " continuity is important ; stick with Labour " was closer to their view than " time for a change " .
More than two in three , 69 % , plumped for " time for a change " .
Some 27 % of Labour voters chose " time for a change " .
While some voters are prepared to reconsider voting Labour if the economy improves , most do not expect it to .
Most voters think the economy is more likely to deteriorate under a Labour government ( 53 % ) than a Conservative one ( 30 % ) .
Overall , voters believe Britain will come out of the recession more quickly under the Tories ( 44 % ) than under Labour ( 35 % ) .
Those polled say big cuts in public services are more likely under the Tories ( 47 % ) than Labour ( 37 % ) .
But the state of the economy and the public mood suggests that this is not necessarily the kind of deciding issue that it was in the 2001 and 2005 elections .
Conservative voters themselves think cuts are more likely under their preferred government than under a Labour one ( 48 % to 40 % ) .
Conversely , while 46 % say taxes are more likely to go up under a Labour government , a sizeable minority , 39 % , think they are more likely to go up under the Tories .
There is overwhelming support for the view that the government should " take active steps to reduce the gap between rich and poor " .
Eighty - two per cent of those polled agreed with that view , and only 15 % did not .
This will encourage those on the left who believe that ministers can be bolder in reducing income disparities .
Disillusionment with Labour has spread to its own supporters .
Sixty - six per cent of voters agree that Labour has " run out of steam , out of ideas " , including 27 % of Labour voters .
Sixty - one per cent agree Labour does not deserve to win the next election , including 18 % of Labour voters .
Of all those polled , some 60 % disagree with the view that Labour is taking the country in the right direction .
And 54 % disagree that " they are still a safer bet with the economy " .
The chances of Labour receiving a drubbing at the EU elections in June appear high ; 68 % said that people they knew would vote primarily on domestic issues and 21 % on mainly European issues .
• ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,004 adults aged 18 + by telephone between 13 and 15 March 2009 .
Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults .
Percentages may not add to 100 because of rounding .
ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules .

Our data is everywhere !
There is the data on your PC , laptop , netbook , phone , PDA , Media Center , onlineâ€ ¦ you get the idea .
Just thinking about putting a backup system in place can cause a serious headache , but even worse is the prospect of losing that data .
This short guide is designed to help walk you through theÂ process of creating a backup system that you actually will use .
OVERALL STRATEGY
First , you need to answer the following question :
What would be the worst case scenario if I lost all of my digital data ?
If you donâ€™t like the answer , you now have the motivation you need to continue this exercise .
Now that you have determined the purpose and established some motivation , we next need to figure out where all the data you care about is located and what to do with it .
COLLECTION
Now , you will brain storm and discover all the places where you have data that is important to you .
Use a spreadsheet ( you will build on it later ) to capture this information and then use the following memory jog list to discover all the locations where your data lives .
Memory Jog List :
Emails :
All of the places where you check email .
Contacts : Both the contacts on your PIM ( e.g. Outlook ) and on mobile devices such as your phone or PDA .
Calendars : Every place where you store calendar information .
( I recommend you use one master calendar )
Tasks , Project Information : Both your own personal task lists and those where you collaborate with others .
Documents and Notes :
All of the documents that are stored locally , plus those that you may have saved online .
Bookmarks :
If you are using Firefox , check out www.foxmarks.com.
Online Services :
Do you use any online services where you have an account ?
( e.g. Google Docs , FaceBook , Live.com ) [ are these stored locally ? ]
Application Files :
If you use software applications , such as Photoshop , you may have files related to those programs on your computer .
You should also back up your application disks .
Video Games :
Any saved game data files and the game disks .
Multimedia :
All of your music , photos and videos .
NOW BACKUP
For mobile devices such as your PDA or phone , I suggest you backup to your PC .
Then your PDA and / or Phone data gets backed up with your PC .
For data at home such as on your PCâ€™s , iTunes Library and X - Box 360 , the solution is rather simple .
You can use a centralized backup solution that is automated .
This type of solution plugs into your home network independent of any computer and is a central place to store backed up data as well as other files you wish to share .
Western Digital has a home centralized backup solution that is able to take care of all your backup needs easily .
Plus , their software allows for remote access , so you can backup even when you are on the road .
As additional piece of mind I also suggest that you use an online backup solution like Mozy.com on a monthly basis .
By adding an automated monthly online backup you protect your data in case of a disaster at home .
SHARE WITH US YOUR BACKUP PLAN
I hope this post has motivated you to put together your own backup plan that makes it fairly painless to execute .
Have you already mastered the art of backup ?
Did you find any cases where you could not backup ?
Please share your backup stories with us in the comments .
By last count , the federal government employs 107 different categories of restricted information  one off - limits category zanily pronounces , “ sensitive but unclassified . ”
This muddle of mislabeling seems designed not to protect legitimate secrets but to empower bureaucrats .
The end result has been to greatly blunt the Freedom of Information
Act ’s mandate to let the public in on the business of government , plain and simple .
The House has just approved a measure to end this plague of pseudoclassification .
Its backers say it is not just a boon for the public , but an attempt to promote “ a common language within government . ”
There are so many taboos that agencies are even having trouble understanding one another ’s rubber - stamp restrictions .
“ Official use only ” has been slapped wholesale on documents , even though there ’s no common standard for what that means .
The House measure would correct that by having the national archivist prescribe how and what to classify , with particular emphasis on cutting back categories and ending the pro forma withholding of nonsensitive information requested by the public .
According to the bill ’s sponsor , Representative Steve Driehaus , Democrat of Ohio , there were 362,000 F.O.I.A. requests last year , and almost a third of them still remain to be processed because of overclassification .
The bill requires classifiers to be trained for the task and to put their IDs on what they deem out of bounds , subject to inspector general review .
With the massive backlash that took place following the Consumerist article about Facebook ’s temporarily modified terms of service ( which was eventually set back to the original terms ) , you would have thought more people cared about how the new terms would be written .
It ’s clear that the majority of users only care once Facebook crosses the line but until they do , most users could care less about the terms .
Facebook took the extra step of promoting the new “ Facebook Town Hall : Proposed Facebook Principles ” group on the homepage of the site yet less than 10,00 people have joined .
The other Facebook Town Hall for the “ Proposed Statement of Rights & Responsibilities ” has just over 9,000 members .
With over 180 million users , the current response to the new terms is not substantial by any means .
If the response continues to remain this low , there is a good chance that users will have very little of an effect on the new terms .
It ’s an unprecedented decision for Facebook to make the new terms open for public dialogue but at the end of the day maybe all users wanted to hear was clarification from Mark Zuckerberg about Facebook not owning our data .
The new policy may end up not receiving a lot of attention beyond the buzz that it received from the press over the last couple weeks but there is no doubt that this is part of a larger movement .
Mark Zuckerberg emphasized that the company is working toward a more open Facebook and that this is just another step along the way .
Whether or not users care about this continuing opening trend has yet to be seen but it ’s clear that Facebook will proceed to open while adapting as required through feedback from users .

RUNNING a diesel engine on a plant - based fuel is hardly a new idea .
One of the early demonstrations carried out by Rudolph Diesel , the German engineer who invented the engines at the end of the 19th century , operated on pure peanut oil .
Diesel fuel made from crude oil eventually won the day because it was easier to use and cheaper to produce .
But new forms of biodiesel are now starting to change the picture again .
One of them is derived from the remains of a drink enjoyed the world over : coffee .
Biodiesels are becoming increasingly popular .
In America , Minnesota has decreed that all diesel sold in the state must contain 2 % biodiesel ( much of it from the crops grown by the state 's soya farmers ) .
Biodiesel can also be found blended into the fuel used by public and commercial vehicles and by trains in a number of countries .
Aircraft - engine makers are testing biofuel blends .
As with other biofuels , the idea is that making fuel from plants , which absorb carbon dioxide as they grow , will produce fewer emissions than burning fossil fuels .
In the case of coffee , the biodiesel is made from the leftover grounds , which would otherwise be thrown away or used as compost .
Narasimharao Kondamudi , Susanta Mohapatra and Manoranjan Misra of the University of Nevada at Reno have found that coffee grounds can yield 10 - 15 % of biodiesel by weight relatively easily .
And when burned in an engine the fuel does not have an offensive smell — just a whiff of coffee .
( Some biodiesels made from used cooking - oil produce exhaust that smells like a fast - food joint . )
And after the diesel has been extracted , the coffee grounds can still be used for compost .
The researchers ' work began two years ago when Dr Misra , a heavy coffee drinker , left a cup unfinished and noticed the next day that the coffee was covered by a film of oil .
Since he was investigating biofuels , he enlisted his colleagues to look at coffee 's potential .
The nearby Starbucks was happy to oblige by supplying grounds .
The researchers found that coffee biodiesel is comparable to the best biodiesels on the market .
But unlike biodiesels based on soya or other plants , it does not divert crops or land from food production into fuel production .
A further advantage is that unmodified oils from plants , like the peanut oil used by Diesel in the 19th century , have high viscosity and require engine alterations .
Diesel derived from coffee is less thick and can usually be burned in an engine with little or no tinkering .
The diesel - extraction method for coffee grounds is similar to that used for other vegetable oils .
It employs a process called transesterification , in which the grounds react with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst .
The coffee grounds are dried overnight and common chemical solvents , such as hexane , ether and dichloromethane , are added to dissolve the oils .
The grounds are then filtered out and the solvents separated ( to be reused with the next batch of coffee grounds ) .
The remaining oil is treated with an alkali to remove free fatty acids ( which form a soap ) .
Then the crude biodiesel is heated to about 100 ºC to remove any water , and treated with methanol and a catalyst , so that transesterification takes place .
When cooled to room temperature and left to stand , the biodiesel floats up , leaving a layer of glycerine at the bottom .
These layers are separated and the biodiesel is cleaned to remove any residues .
Although some people make their own diesel at home from leftovers and recycled cooking oil , coffee - based biodiesel seems better suited to larger - scale processes .
Dr Misra says that a litre of biodiesel requires 5 - 7 kg of coffee grounds , depending on the oil content of the coffee in question .
In their laboratory his team has set up a one - gallon - a - day production facility , which uses between 19kg and 26kg of coffee grounds .
The biofuel should cost about $ 1 per gallon to make in a medium - sized installation , the researchers estimate .
Commercial production could be carried out by a company that collected coffee grounds from big coffee - chains and cafeterias .
There is plenty available : according to a report by the United States Department of Agriculture , more than 7 m tonnes of coffee are consumed every year , which the researchers estimate could produce some 340 m gallons of biodiesel .
Time , perhaps , to pour another cup before refilling the car .

Gay rights groups are complaining about the firing of a rural Oklahoma high school teacher who lost her job last week after assigning a play about the 1998 death of a gay college student .
But the tiny school district says the move came after the teacher held a mock " funeral " for a canceled film production of the play .
The episode began in January , when Debra Taylor showed students at Grandfield High School The Laramie Project , a 2002 film based on the play of the same name , about the murder of Matthew Shepard .
The students soon decided to film selected scenes themselves for an in - class project .
Taylor , 50 , knew the project was controversial with strong language , but got her principal 's permission .
A few weeks into it , the principal told her to stop production .
After students protested , she held a 20 - minute ceremony in a nearby park in which students wrote their thoughts and rolled them into helium balloons , then released them .
The next day , Taylor says , Superintendent Ed Turlington canceled the class .
After she complained to a school board member , Turlington put her on paid leave and recommended that she be fired .
The school board approved her resignation Friday .
Taylor says she was let go for complaining to the board member , but others say it was a result of the play 's subject : homophobia .
" They do n't want something like this addressed in our community , " says senior Matt Ebner , one of Taylor 's former students .
The Norman , Okla. , chapter of Parents , Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays ( PFLAG ) urged administrators to allow The Laramie Project as a way " to create a culture where everyone is welcomed , embraced and valued . "
John Moyer , an attorney representing the district , says Taylor was dismissed not because she wanted to put on a play or because of the subject matter .
" If someone is saying that adverse employment action is being taken against Ms. Taylor because of homosexuality , they 're wrong . "
Written by the New York - based Tectonic Theater Project , The Laramie Project consists of interviews with Laramie residents after Shepard 's death .
Taylor says she was trying to help students examine their own beliefs .
" I did n't ask them to change their belief systems , " she says , " but what I asked them was , ' Can you be tolerant of those that are different from you ? '
Many times the students came back and said , ' I do n't like gays . '
I said : ' I 'm not asking you to like gays .
But can you be tolerant ? ' " Guidelines :

When Words Can Kill : ' That 's So Gay ' Anti-gay taunts in school lead to 11 - year - old 's suicide and calls for change .
April 14 , 2009  -- Carl Joseph Walker - Hoover was 11 -- hardly old enough to know his sexuality and yet distraught enough to hang himself last week after school bullies repeatedly called him " gay . "
The Springfield , Mass. , football player and Boy Scout was ruthlessly teased , despite his mother 's pleas to the New Leadership Charter School to address the problem .
Sirdeaner L. Walker , 43 , found Carl hanging by an extension cord on the second floor of the family 's home April 6 , just minutes before she was going to a meeting to confront school authorities again .
" I am brokenhearted , " she told ABCNews.com .
" We worry about the economy and about Iraq , but we need to be worried about our schools . "
Walker , who works as a director of homeless programs , said Carl -- a slight child who loved his schoolwork -- had endured endless taunts since he started sixth grade in September .
School officials did not return numerous calls for comment from ABCNews.com .
The boy had been active in his church , taking communion on the recent Palm Sunday and playing a wise man in the Christmas play .
He helped the needy and a black history program .
" That 's the type of kid he was , " Walker said .
" You could rely and count on him . "
Bullies Worse Than Breast Cancer
Walker said her son's 11 - year - old tormentors were worse than the breast cancer she had survived four years ago .
In an ironic twist , the boy would have turned 12 on April 17 -- the same day students in thousands of schools across the country will participate in the annual Day of Silence to bring attention to anti-gay harassment in schools .
" There was no reason for the mother to believe he was gay , " said Gay , Lesbian and Straight Education Network spokesman Daryl Presgraves .
" It just happens he was someone his peers targeted , calling him , ' girlie , ' ' gay ' and ' fag . '
According to the mother , it was a daily occurrence . "
Middle School Suicides
Carl 's suicide comes about a year after California eighth - grader Lawrence King was shot and killed by a fellow student in his classroom for supposedly being gay .
In response , GLSEN has launched a multipronged education campaign to fight the use of anti-gay language and bullying .
Its annual Day of Silence , started at the University of Virginia in 1996 with 150 students , has now grown to more than 7,500 middle and high schools nationwide .
Participants draw attention to LGBT issues by not speaking for a day .
Since October , GLSEN has aired thousands of public service messages , " Think Before You Speak , " to reduce the use of the slur , " That 's so gay . "
" When you are in elementary school , one of the first things you learn is the feeling of hurt when you are called ' gay ' or ' fag , ' " said Presgraves .
" It does n't matter if you are gay or straight .
The term ' gay ' has become synonymous with " uncool . "
" The expression ' That 's so gay ' is one of the most heard in school , and students recognize it as derogatory , " he said .
Lawsuit Against School for Anti-Gay Bullying
Just last week Bill and Janis Mohat filed suit against Ohio's Mentor High School , alleging their son , who , like Carl , did not identify himself as gay , shot himself after being tortured with homophobic slurs .
In a 2005 survey -- " From Teasing to Torment : School Climate in America " -- students said their peers were most often bullied because of their appearance , but the next top reason was because of actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender expression .
In that report , by the GLSEN and Harris Interactive , students said teachers rarely interfered in cases of gay - related bullying , either because they are embarrassed or do n't know what to do .
" The truly unfortunate thing is because of the societal atmosphere surrounding gay and lesbian life in the U.S. , administrators are reluctant to act or fail to act , " said Eliza Byard , GLSEN 's executive director , who attended Carl 's memorial service .
" The key is absolute , direct , even - handed , no -nonsense approach to all aspects of bullying , " she told ABCNews.com .
" At this cultural moment , homophobic language is the ultimate weapon .
We have to address the use of that language like any other forms of name - calling and harassment . "
The National Youth Violence Prevention Resource Center estimated that nearly 30 percent of American youth are either a bully or a target of bullying .
In addition , researchers at the Yale School of Medicine , in a new review of studies from 13 countries , found signs of an apparent connection between bullying , being bullied and suicide .
GLSEN's own research indicates that LGB youth may be more likely to think about and attempt suicide than heterosexual teens .
According to a 2001 study published in the American Journal of Public Health , " The majority of the evidence is in favor of common causes for suicide that affect all youth , but which LGB youth are more likely than their heterosexual peers to experience . "
Suicide rates among children Carl 's age are very low , according to Ann Haas , director of the Suicide Prevention Project at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention , but they are anecdotally " creeping up . "
" It 's absolutely tragic , " Haas said of Carl 's suicide .
" The really disturbing thing is the degree to which ' gay , ' ' lesbian ' and all pejorative terms are a cover for the bullying itself .
The meaning of it is unclear . "
Bullies Render Kids Helpless
" Anecdotal data is increasingly strong that bullying is a major factor in kids ' lives , " she told ABCNews.com .
" The risk is very real and it underscores the fact that these kids are absolutely helpless in terms of having adults they can turn to and who can protect them . "
" We need a much more institutional rather than individual approach , " said Haas .
" We need an across - the - board change in the way sexual orientation is integrated in the schools .
This is not about teaching gay marriage .
There are ways more subtle that the school can convey the basic dignity of all groups . "
Gay students report that they are often scared to go to school because of the homophobic culture .
Such was the case with Conrad Honicker of Knoxville , Tenn. , who came out as gay just before his freshman year in high school .
" Naturally , I got a lot of teasing , mostly verbal , but it got threatening at one point , " Honicker told ABCNews.com .
" Someone threw a large rock at me .
They missed , but it landed in front of me . "
He has survived verbal abuse that he described as " very graphic " and " like you would treat a woman in a bad , sexualized gratuitous way . "
Bullies also physically attacked him , " squeezing me and kissing my neck . "
Honicker founded West High School 's first gay - straight alliance , as well as eight other groups around the district .
He believes these groups are a visible presence in schools that can thwart the bullying and encourage teachers to act .
" There 's a little bit of pressure and demonstration that you are there raising awareness , " said Honicker , who adds that he is lucky to have his parents ' support .
" It alleviates the pressure , " he said .
" You are dealing with homophobia from all directions -- your teachers , your peers , your administration , your church or family . "
For Carl Walker , whose short life was memorialized at a three - hour , standing - room only service on Monday , support came too late , but his mother hopes his story will help others .
" I am determined for the rest of my life to advocate on behalf of students who are voiceless and silent , " she said .
" I have been homeless , but Carl and I made it through , " said Walker .
" I was a victim of domestic violence , and we made it through .
The one thing we could n't get through was public school . "

The White House has gotten in on the act with senior figures like spokesperson Robert Gibbs and chief of staff Rahm Emanuel launching attacks on administration critics ranging from Limbaugh to CNBC personalities Rick Santelli and Jim Cramer .
The GOP 's burgeoning civil war
Watching the various spats among conservatives , it ’s difficult to tell whether one is witnessing a series of lively political disagreements or an episode of “ Monday Night Raw . ”
In one corner , there ’s former Bush administration speechwriter David Frum versus talk radio king Rush Limbaugh .
In another ring , Limbaugh is taking on former House speaker - turned - conservative guru Newt Gingrich .
And in the Royal Rumble , Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele is battling , well , pretty much everybody in the GOP .

Liberals have shown no small measure of delight in this fracas , and understandably so .
Taking political advantage of conservative fratricide makes perfect sense , as it ’s the strategic execution of Henry Kissinger ’s observation about the Iran - Iraq War : “ It ’s a pity both sides ca n’t lose . ”
Fueling the intra-party fire weakens the GOP from within .
Even the White House has gotten in on the act with senior figures like spokesperson Robert Gibbs and chief of staff Rahm Emanuel launching attacks on administration critics ranging from Limbaugh to CNBC personalities Rick Santelli and Jim Cramer .
But as liberals engage in multiple rounds of schadenfreude over conservative wrangling , what ’s noticeable is that the burgeoning civil war we ’re witnessing on the right could not play out on the left , at least not rise to the level of gravity that would attract front - page articles in Newsweek or the instigation of partisans on the other side .
And that ’s because liberals — unlike conservatives — do not have a “ movement ” over which to fight .
Given the Barack Obama phenomenon , the rise of the liberal blogosphere and overwhelming Democratic congressional majorities , the proposition that liberals lack a movement might sound strange .
But while the Republican Party comprises three steadfast pillars ( free marketers , defense hawks and the religious right ) , the Democratic Party remains a coalition of a vast and diverse assemblage of interest groups ( minorities , labor unions , academics , trial lawyers , etc. ) rather than an ideological enterprise .
As such , the Democrats , up until very recently , have long had more intense internal squabbling than the Republicans , whose various factions learned to reconcile .
The conservative movement began to take form in the 1950s as a reaction to the then - regnant statist consensus .
It was firmly anti-communist , opposed the New Deal and the further expansion of government programs , and later launched a harsh critique on many of the social changes that took place in the 1960s and 1970s .
What further distinguishes the conservative movement from the liberal coalition is that conservatives built an array of institutions to sustain their ideological apparatus .
In Washington and across the country , there exists a constellation of think tanks , like the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute .
In the 1980s , conservatives took to the airwaves and now attract tens of millions of listeners every day on talk radio .
Perhaps the most important feature of the movement was its recruitment of young people through organizations like Young America ’s Foundation , which identifies and trains conservative students on campuses across the country .
To see the vitality — if not reasonableness — of the movement , one only had to visit last month ’s Conservative Political Action Conference , an annual ritual that attracts conservative activists , politicians and celebrities from across the country .
There is no liberal equivalent of this confab .
Indeed , the relative influence of the conservative movement on the GOP versus any liberal parallel on the Democratic Party can be seen in the vast number of Republican politicians who proudly call themselves “ conservative . ”
By contrast , few Democrats publicly identify themselves as “ liberal , ” opting for the more vague and voguish “ progressive , ” if at all .
Liberals are belatedly constructing themselves a movement akin to the one crafted by their ideological adversaries .
In 2003 , John Podesta founded the Center for American Progress , a partisan think tank explicitly modeled on Heritage .
Media Matters aggressively attacks any perceived anti-liberal media bias in the same way that conservative watchdog groups have been monitoring the mainstream press since the 1980s .
POLITICO ’s Ben Smith has reported on the daily conference call in which the heads of more than 20 major liberal interest groups participate to shape a coherent message for the day , as well as Unity ’09 , a coalition of groups ranging from MoveOn.org to the American Civil Liberties Union “ aimed at helping President Obama push his agenda through Congress . ”
Never before have the disparate organizations of the American left been so well - coordinated .
Does the nascent liberal movement portend good or ill ?
Judging that question depends in part upon whether or not one agrees with the agenda .
If scaling back American commitments overseas , increasing the power of unions , and building a more left - leaning Supreme Court , among other goals , of course , are your thing , then the means by which these ends are achieved will presumably matter less than their attainment .
But the answer also lies in whether or not movement politics is itself a healthy feature of the American electoral system .
There is something ironic in the tendency of liberals to denounce the staleness and conformity of the conservative movement and relish in its apparent demise while constructing something of their own that is just as ideologically rigid .

Remarks of President George W. Bush at the unveiling of his portrait , Lincoln Hall , Union League of Philadelphia , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
Dec. 6 , 2008 .
THE PRESIDENT : Good morning .
Welcome to my hanging .
( Laughter and applause . )
Thank you for coming and thank you for your warm welcome .
First , I 'd like to compliment Mark Carder .
He did a really fine job with a challenging subject .
( Laughter . )
I was taken aback by how much gray paint you had to use .
( Laughter . )
It speaks more about my job than yours .
( Laughter . )
But thanks a lot , it 's been a joy to work with you and I 'm confident this portrait will stand the test of time .
I want to thank Fred and Frank for welcoming me here .
I thank you for the medal .
I 'm keeping pretty good company , which I will speak about in a minute .
First of all I do want to thank the board of directors of The Union League for taking time out of your Saturday to be here .
And I appreciate all the guests who have come , as well .
I particularly want to say thanks to my friend , Arlen Specter , for joining us .
( Applause . )
It 's been a joy working with you -- most of the time .
( Laughter . )
He 's a pretty independent - minded fellow -- ( laughter ) -- who is honest and decent .
( Applause . )
And like me , he married very well .
( Laughter . )
So Joan , thanks for being here , and I appreciate -- I appreciate you supporting this good man during some very difficult times .
( Applause . )
I thank the Hoopers , for paying for this work .
( Applause . )
I thank Jim Straw and the Abraham Lincoln Foundation and the Foundation members who are here today .
I appreciate you preserving the legacy of a -- of a good man .
I am -- it turns out this award had been given to folks I have had the honor of serving with : Vice President Dick Cheney , Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld , Secretary Tom Ridge -- three good men who are dedicated and patriot public servants .
I 'm especially proud to be a co-recipient with a guy I call " 41 . " ( Applause . )
The 1987 Gold Medal Award Winner -- a guy I call " dad , " you call him " President Bush . "
We owe our achievements to the same savvy political counselor and firm disciplinarian : Barbara .
( Laughter and applause . )
And they 're both doing well , by the way .
( Applause . )
Mother is coming out of the hospital .
I hope they do n't put this on TV , but she 's a tough old bird -- ( laughter ) -- whose spirits are soaring high .
The motto of The Union League is " Love of Country Leads . "
You obviously love our country because you continue to lead in ways that make Philadelphia a more compassionate place , and I want to thank you for that .
I appreciate the fact that you have mentoring programs and internships and scholarships .
That basically says the dream is for all who live in this country .
I thank you for your efforts to preserve historical treasures .
One can learn a lot from the past , and The Union League is doing its part to tell the true story of our great nation .
In short , I thank you for your service to your community and our country .
I also thank you for preserving the legacy of Abraham Lincoln .
I 'm about to be a member of the Ex - President 's Club , so I 'll just call him " Abe . " ( Laughter . )
If he were around I could say , you call me " W. " ( Laughter . )
I do n't know if you know this or not , but there 's a place in the Oval Office where the President puts the most influential President -- portrait of , I guess you 'd say " influential President . "
I 'm somewhat conflicted about the " influential President , " so I say , 41 's portrait hangs in my heart , 16 hangs on the wall .
( Applause . )
I found it interesting that the League was founded in 1862 , to support President Lincoln in a time when his leadership was deeply controversial .
( Laughter . )
I know how he felt .
( Laughter . )
But the principles on which he stood have stood the test of time :
All men are created equal under God , he said , unflinchingly throughout his presidency .
( Applause . )
Liberty is given to every man , woman and child on the face of the earth .
I
believe , like Lincoln , there is an Almighty - ( applause ) - and a gift of that Almighty to every man is freedom .
He has taught Presidents that you must act on your principles and make tough decisions , regardless of the political consequences .
( Applause . )
I have been a - I have drawn strength from his example .
I have learned lessons by reading about Abraham Lincoln .
And I want to thank you for preserving his legacy .
( Applause . )
And most importantly , I thank you for your kind words and your heartfelt prayers during the last eight years .
It has been -- somebody said , what 's it 's like to be President ?
I said , some days you 're happy , some days not so happy -- every day joyous to serve the United States .
God bless you , and God bless our country .
( Applause ) ###

" There 's no words to describe it , other than it 's mass murder . "
The country 's top law officer , attorney general Robert McClelland , said that people found to have deliberately set fires could face murder charges .
More than one dozen fires are still burning uncontrollably across Victoria , although conditions are much cooler than on Saturday , which saw record - high heat and winds of up to 60 mph .
At least 750 homes were destroyed and 850 square miles of land burned out .
Officials said both the death toll and destruction would almost certainly rise as they reached deeper into the disaster zone , and forecasters said temperatures would rise again later in the week , posing a risk of further flare - ups .
In a sign of the nationwide impact of the tragedy , Parliament suspended its normal sessions to hear condolence speeches from MPs .
The voices of many quavered with emotion .
Some called it Australia 's worst peacetime disaster .
More than 4,000 people registered with the Australian Red Cross , which posted lists of names at some 20 emergency relief centres .
At one centre in Wittlesea survivors scoured the lists looking for missing relatives .
Victoria Police Commissioner Christine Nixon said investigators had strong suspicions that at least one of the deadly blazes - known as the Churchill fire after a ruined town - was deliberately started .
And it could not be ruled out for other fires .
Australia 's previous deadliest fires were in 1983 , when blazes killed 75 people and destroyed more than 3,000 homes in Victoria .
State Department of Sustainability and Environment spokesman Geoff Russell said : " Hell in all its fury has visited the good people of Victoria , " Mr Rudd said .
" It 's an appalling tragedy for the nation . "
The town of Marysville and several hamlets in the Kinglake district , both about 50 miles north of Melbourne , were utterly devastated .
At Marysville , a winter tourism town that was home to about 800 people , up to 90 % of buildings were in ruins , witnesses said .
Police said two people died there .
Thousands of exhausted volunteer firefighters were still battling about 30 uncontrolled fires tonight in Victoria , officials said , though conditions had eased considerably .
It would be days before they were brought under control , even if temperatures stayed down , they said .
A Number 10 spokesman said : " The Prime Minister spoke to Kevin Rudd this morning to extend our sympathies to the Australian people , especially those families who have been affected by this tragedy .
" He praised Kevin Rudd 's leadership at this very difficult time , and said that the UK stood ready to provide any assistance that the Australian Government wanted . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Researchers said on Sunday they had found a safer way to transform ordinary skin cells into powerful stem cells in a move that could eventually remove the need to use human embryos .
It is the first time that scientists have turned skin cells into induced pluripotent stem cells or iPS cells -- which look and act like embryonic stem cells -- without having to use viruses in the process .
The new method also allows for genes that are inserted to trigger cell reprogramming to be removed afterwards .
Stem cells are the body ’s master cells , producing all the body ’s tissues and organs .
Embryonic stem cells are the most powerful kind , as they have the potential to give rise to any tissue type .
However , many people object to their use , making iPS cells an attractive alternative , provided they can be made safely .
Researchers have known for some time that ordinary skin cells can be transformed into iPS cells using a handful of genes .
But to get these genes into the cells they have had to use viruses , which integrate their own genetic material into the cells they infect .
This can cause cancer .
The alternative approach , described in the online edition of the journal Nature by two teams of researchers from Britain and Canada , appears to avoid the risk of such abnormalities .
“ PIGGYBAC ” RIDE
The researchers harnessed a little piece of DNA called a transposon -- sometimes known as a “ jumping gene ” because of its ability to move around inside the genetic code -- to carry four genes .
The version used is dubbed “ piggyBac ” and has been used by researchers to genetically modify a range of organisms .
“ It is a step toward the practical use of reprogrammed cells in medicine , perhaps even eliminating the need for human embryos as a source of stem cells , ” said Keisuke Kaji from the Medical Research Council ( MRC ) Center for Regenerative Medicine in Edinburgh .
He and Andras Nagy from the University of Toronto used the technique in both mouse and human skin cells and found the reprogrammed cells behaved just like embryonic stem cells .
Ian Wilmut , head of the MRC center and one of the scientists who cloned the first mammal , Dolly the sheep , said it would take time before the new iPS cells could be given to patients , but the new technique was an important step forward .
“ Combining this work with that of other scientists working on stem cell differentiation , there is hope that the promise of regenerative medicine could soon be met , ” he said .
Doctors hope one day to use stem cells to treat diseases such as Parkinson ’s , diabetes , cancer and spinal cord injuries .
Most of people end up paying hundreds of dollars per year too much in Federal Income Taxes because they are n’t aware of what deductions that they qualify for .
The Federal tax code has become so complicated that it ’s extremely difficult for individuals to figure out how to minimize their tax burden without paying hundreds of dollars to a CPA to navigate the tax code for them .
One deduction that almost everyone will qualify for , but very few people take advantage of , is the deduction for paid state and local sales taxes .
If your city , county , or state collects any sort of sales tax , you will qualify for this deduction .
You do n’t even need to keep receipts for the sales taxes that you pay .
The IRS provides a calculator which will determine a dollar amount based upon your locality ’s sales - tax rate of how much that you can deduct .
The city which I live in collects a 6 % sales tax ( 4 % state , 2 % local ) .
For my 2009 taxes , I was able to deduct $ 780.00 without collecting any receipts at all .
For most people , not collecting the receipts and taking the average based on the IRS ’s calculator is the way to go .
If you have made a few large purchases in the year , you can instead specify the sales taxes that you ’ve paid for the deduction instead .
For Example , if I bought a $ 20,000 item and had a receipt for that , I would have paid $ 1,200 in sales taxes on that item alone , meaning that I could deduct that much rather than the $ 780 average that the IRS will let me deduct without any receipts at all .
In order to qualify for this deduction , you do need to itemize your deductions .
Usually it ’s a good idea to calculate and determine if your itemized deductions are greater than what your standard deduction would be , and then itemize your deductions if it results in a greater refund .
If you ’re a college student , own a home or do a large amount of charitable giving you will almost certainly come out ahead by itemizing your deductions .
There are other types of taxes that you can deduct from your Federal income taxes as well .
You can deduct any local , state , or foreign income taxes that you paid in much the same manner .
You can also deduct any real estate taxes , such as property taxes , from your return .
The IRS has a publication on what taxes you can deduct .
If you go to their website , you ’ll want to look for “ Topic 503 .
– Deductible Taxes . ”
LONDON , March 22 ( UPI ) --
Disability activists say they 're backing a British mother given a $ 145 parking ticket when she stopped to revive her severely disabled son .
Penny Batkin , 40 , was taking her son , Freddie , 4 , to a hospice in Hampton when he began gasping for breath and turning blue , said Richmond Aid , a charity for people with disabilities .

Batkin incurred the ticket by illegally stopping her car on the pavement to resuscitate him .
To make matters worse , Batkin said , the Richmond Council 's parking office later refused to rescind the ticket even after she explained what had happened , The Daily Telegraph reported Sunday .
Richmond
Aid officials say they hope local authorities can find it " in their hearts to rescind a parking fine incurred by a desperate mother who had no choice if she was to save the life of her child . "
" We are so appalled we struggle to find words , " said one aid official .
Samoas , also known as Caramel de-Lites , have always been my favorite girl scout cookie ( although I do enjoy Do - Si - Dos , Tagalongs and Thin Mints ) .
I ’m not sure how they rank in the overall scheme of GS cookie popularity , but I will go so far as to say that I have never met someone who did n’t care for them at all – even people who say that they usually do n’t like coconut .
I think that the cookie is just a good and rather unique combination of flavors .
The Girl Scout bakeries describe Samoas as vanilla cookies dipped in caramel , topped with coconut and drizzled with chocolate .
All good flavors , though I have to admit that I never tasted much vanilla in the cookies themselves , and so I used this description as a jumping off point for my version .
I remember the cookies as being crisp and tender in the original , and selected a plain shortbread - like base for these .
The cookie dough is very rich – by which I mean that it has a lot of butter – and is very easy to work with .
The butter keeps it tender , so it wo n’t toughen up even after repeated rollings of the dough .
For the topping , I debated between using a from - scratch recipe like Chockylit ‘s or a semi- homemade recipe like Debbie‘s .
The from - scratch recipe sounded appealing , but I opted for the semi-homemade version because I had a ton of Werther ’s Chewy Caramels around already .
These particular caramels are nice because they ’re made with real butter , sugar and cream ( rather than using partially hydrogenated oils , as a number of other caramels do ) .
Of course , you can use any similar chewy caramel that ’s handy , I just recommend picking out one with the best ingredient list you can find .
Different types of caramel will be sticker / harder than others , so be patient as you work with it .
I did take Chockylit ’s suggestion of toasting the coconut for bit of extra texture .
I used dark chocolate for the dip and drizzle , and set each of the cookies on a piece of parchment paper after dunking them in the chocolate to let it set up in an even layer .
There are two ways to get the shape for these cookies .
The first is to roll the dough out between pieces of wax paper and use a cookie cutter to make rounds , cutting the smaller center hole later .
This technique works great and does n’t take too long , especially as the dough can be rerolled a couple of times .
The second technique calls for a special pan : a mini donut pan .
If you have a pan like this , simply press some cookie dough into the tube and bake .
The dough does n’t rise much , giving you a nice flat side and a perfectly rounded one .
Take your pick and go with what is convenient for you .
And since you ’re all probably wondering , these cookies were absolutely fabulous .
The cookies were tender and buttery , the topping was sweet with a delicious coconut flavor , and the dip of chocolate on the bottom of each cookie balanced all the flavors perfectly .
Better than I even remember the Girl Scout cookies being .
I could – but I wo n’t – probably eat an entire batch of these on my own .
Homemade Samoas ( a.k.a. Caramel de-Lites )
Cookies
1 cup butter , soft
1/2 cup sugar
2 cups all purpose flour
1/4 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
up to 2 tbsp milk
Preheat oven to 350F .
In a large mixing bowl , cream together butter and sugar .
Mix in flour , baking powder and salt at a low speed , followed by the vanilla and milk , adding in the milk as needed to make the dough come together without being sticky ( it ’s possible you might not need to add milk at all ) .
The dough should come together into a soft , not - too - sticky ball .
Add in a bit of extra flour if your dough is very sticky .
Roll the dough ( working in two or three batches ) out between pieces of wax paper to about 1/4 - inch thickness ( or slightly less ) and use a 1 1/2 - inch cookie cutter to make rounds .
Place on a parchment lined baking sheet and use a knife , or the end of a wide straw , to cut a smaller center hole .
Repeat with remaining dough .
Alternatively , use scant tablespoons of dough and press into an even layer in a mini donut pan to form the rounds .
Bake cookies for 10 - 12 minutes , until bottoms are lightly browned and cookies are set .
If using a mini donut pan , bake for only about 10 minutes , until edges are light gold .
Cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely .
Topping
3 cups shredded coconut ( sweetened or unsweetened )
12 - oz good - quality chewy caramels
1/4 tsp salt
3 tbsp milk
8 oz . dark or semisweet chocolate ( chocolate chips are ok )
Preheat oven to 300 .
Spread coconut evenly on a parchment - lined baking sheet ( preferably one with sides ) and toast 20 minutes , stirring every 5 minutes , until coconut is golden .
Cool on baking sheet , stirring occasionally .
Set aside .
Unwrap the caramels and place in a large microwave - safe bowl with milk and salt .
Cook on high for 3 - 4 minutes , stopping to stir a few times to help the caramel melt .
When smooth , fold in toasted coconut with a spatula .
Using the spatula or a small offset spatula , spread topping on cooled cookies , using about 2 - 3 tsp per cookie .
Reheat caramel for a few seconds in the microwave if it gets too firm to work with .
While topping sets up , melt chocolate in a small bowl .
Heat on high in the microwave in 45 second intervals , stirring thoroughly to prevent scorching .
Dip the base of each cookie into the chocolate and place on a clean piece of parchment paper .
Transfer all remaining chocolate ( or melt a bit of additional chocolate , if necessary ) into a piping bag or a ziplock bag with the corner snipped off and drizzle finished cookies with chocolate .
Let chocolate set completely before storing in an airtight container .
Makes about 3 1/2 - 4 dozen cookies .
Note :
These cookies are fairly time consuming to make , but if you take your time and have fun with them , the results will be worth it .
Â
That said , if you want something a little bit quicker , try baking a batch of Samoas Bars instead , which require no rolling and cutting of the dough !

Lying on Mervyn King 's Bank of England desk is the draft of a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer seeking authority to take the Bank into territory it has not visited before .
This week the Governor will sign and send it and Alistair Darling 's reply will give King permission to start a programme of quantitative easing .
It will be a licence for the Bank to print money .
Wednesday 's meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be shown the letters and then King will be allowed to take the Bank into the unknown .
Normally the nine members of the MPC discuss interest rates , but having cut them to just 1 per cent this month , they have almost reached the end of that road .
Now , instead of debating the price of money , the MPC will concentrate on the amount of it .
Quantitative easing allows the Bank to buy gilt - edged securities or corporate bonds from City institutions or through the market .
As the Bank will not itself borrow the £ 100bn or more necessary , it is in effect printing money .

The theory is that providing liquidity to the banks or insurance companies that sell the debt , will mean they have new funds to lend to businesses , homebuyers or consumers who are currently unable to borrow .
Yet the theory has never been tested in Britain and no one knows whether it will work , never mind how well .
Vicky Redwood , consumer and debt specialist at research consultancy Capital Economics , says : " It depends on how vigorously the Bank embraces it .
The main danger is doing too little . "
Japan 's central bank adopted quantitative easing in 1990 when it had cut interest rates to zero .
It bought bonds for five years , but the jury is still out on how effective the policy was .
Tokyo is considering repeating the exercise now , however , and the US is likely to follow Britain .
But just as interest rate changes take months to influence the economy , quantitative easing is not expected to have any immediate effect .
Whether that result comes sooner or later , or is bigger or smaller , than the interest rate changes is unknown .
The MPC might decide it is not working and increase the buying programme , only to find the delayed effect of the early buying is more powerful than expected .
But if the effect is slower or weaker than assumed , the committee could waste several months before it realises it needs to buy more stock .
" At least we have a past relationship to look at with interest rates , " says Redwood .
" With quantitative easing we can look at the Japanese experience , but the main practical difficulty is knowing what to do and how much . "
Money supply has been out of fashion since the Thatcher government , as inflation has become the economists ' lodestar .
But now with the prospect of quantitative easing , which boosts M4 , the broad money supply comes back into the limelight .

Normally the Bank uses its reserves to keep the base rate at the set level by buying or selling government securities .
However , by increasing the supply of central bank money , it can directly raise private - sector spending by giving funds to sellers of bonds , or indirectly do it by expanding the lending banks ' supply of credit .
The MPC has turned to this new tool because it fears any more interest rate reductions could be counter - productive .
At this month 's two - day meeting , it was told that rate cuts alone would probably not return inflation to the government - set target and that the stimulus from cheaper borrowing reduces when rates are very low .
" The short - term market interest rates that the base rate sought to influence could not go far , if at all , below zero , " the committee agreed .
" Indeed , there might even be a point at which further cuts could have an adverse impact on the economy . "
Many savings rates are already almost zero and cannot be negative .
Banks would either have to squeeze their profit margins to cut lending rates further or would not pass on new reductions .
But with lenders having to reduce rates on tracker mortgages , banks that do pass on cuts would reduce their profits and thus erode the capital that allows them to lend .
At its last meeting , the MPC thus unanimously agreed that King should write to Darling .
But while drafts of his letter and the response have been prepared , the terms and extent of the programme are not yet agreed .
King wants to be allowed to buy bonds from blue - chip companies as well as government stock , to get funds to the business sector more directly .
Japan went further in the 1990s by buying shares , and last week said it was considering doing so again .
A central bank could also buy illiquid assets such as property or lend to companies directly – but Darling and King are planning nothing so radical .
With a high budget deficit , Darling has plenty of gilts for the Bank to buy .
And if the buying pushes up bond prices , it reduces yields , making corporate and public borrowing cheaper .
But because quantitative easing is an unfunded economic stimulus , the Government issues less stock .
There are risks , however .
Corporate bonds could default .
Banks might hoard cash rather than lend it .
And printing money could weaken sterling while – as has happened spectacularly in Zimbabwe – inflation soars .
Philip Shaw , an economist at Investec , says : " The biggest danger is that it does not work " .
Darling gave the Bank a £ 50bn " asset purchase facility " last month to buy bonds .
That is credit easing , not quantitative easing , because it is funded by the Treasury .
However , the facility will be the framework for this week 's even larger unfunded programme .
" Numbers like £ 100bn and £ 150bn have been bandied around , " says Redwood .
" That might be enough .
I do n't think the MPC will do that much immediately , but it might end up costing more if we do n't do enough early on . "
And after spending its newly printed money , the Bank must at some point resell its bonds .
If it sells too soon , it risks dampening the economic recovery .
Shaw thinks it could unwind the quantitative easing next year ; others believe it could be four or five years before it is safe to sell the last stock .
LOS ANGELES — A tracking firm says the median home price in Southern California dropped 39 percent in February from a year ago .
MDA DataQuick also says in a report released Tuesday that home sales jumped more than 41 percent as bargain - hunting buyers descended on homes in the region ’s most affordable inland neighborhoods .
DataQuick says the median home price in a six - county region of Southern California plunged to $ 250,000 last month , compared to $ 408,000 in February of 2008 .
The median price for the area peaked at $ 505,000 in mid-2007 .
Foreclosures accounted for more than 56 percent of February sales in Southern California .
HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) -- A Chinese court has sentenced the former chairman of a state - owned holding company overseeing 30 airports , including Beijing International , to death for bribery and embezzlement amounting to more than 100 million yuan ( $ 14.6 million ) , according to a report late Tuesday by the state - run Xinhua News Agency .
The Jinan Intermediate People 's Court found Li Peiying , 59 , former chairman and general manager of Capital Airports Holding Co. , guilty of seeking or accepting bribes totaling 26.61 million yuan during an eight year period from 1995 , the report said .
Are there many high quality commercial games available for Linux ?
That ’s one of the frequently asked questions we receive in our mailbox every week .
It is true to say that the number of commercial games released for Linux each year remains small compared to other platforms .
Nevertheless , we faced lots of difficult choices compiling a list of 42 of the best commercial Linux games .
The selection we have finally chosen covers a wide range of different game genres , so hopefully there will be something here that will interest all .
To be eligible for inclusion in this list each game needed to be :
Released under a proprietary license with a fee required either to purchase the game , or a monthly charge
Not require Wine to run .
Wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows software
Probably the best known game developer in the industry supporting Linux is id Software .
They have ported many of their star titles to Linux , including Quake 4 and Doom 3 .
The other major innovator in the video game industry is Epic Games .
They produced one of the all time classics , Unreal Tournament 2004 , which we agonised over whether to include , but the list was already heavyweight in quality action games .
In any feature on Linux commercial games , there also deserves to be a special mention for Loki Entertainment Software .
Between 1998 and 2001 , they ported a number of games to Linux , almost all to an extremely high standard .
Classic titles that spring to mine include Heretic II , Quake III Arena ( featured below ) , Soldier of Fortune , Tribes 2 , Myth II : Soulblighter , and Heavy Gear II .
Following in Loki ’s footsteps , Linux Game Publishing was established in 2001 to port commercial games to Linux .
Their first port was Creatures : Internet Edition .
Advocates of free software may dislike the presence of commercial games .
However , having Linux games released commercially sometimes indirectly benefits gamers who prefer , or can only afford , to play freeware games .
The most notable example of an awesome commercial game that was subsequently released as freeware is Wolftenstein : Enemy Territory .
Please appreciate that the list below is constantly evolving , and only represents a snapshot in 2008 .
There are some very exciting games to be released shortly for Linux .
Watch out for Rage , Unreal Tournament 3 , Sacred Gold , Jack Keane , X3 : Reunion , and Celetania in particular .
It ’s highly probable all of these games will feature in a later ‘ Best of 42 ’ article .
Now , let ’s scrutinize the 42 games at hand .
For each game we have compiled its own portal page , providing screenshots of the game in action , a full description of the game , with an in - depth analysis of the features of the game , together with links to relevant resources and reviews .

Lahore is now the epicentre of a struggle between militants and the government
Lahore - Pakistan 's cultural capital - has been the scene of a string of brazen militant attacks this year .
Three simultaneous raids on law enforcement agencies across the city on 15 October underline the fact that the Punjab provincial capital remains a militant target .
It is a clear statement from the militants who are under threat from Pakistani troops massing on the Waziristan border - they are alive and well and can strike back .
In May the suicide bombing of the police emergency response headquarters on a heavily guarded section of Lahore 's Mall road made the city feel as if it were under siege .
Whoever wants to destabilise the country or the government , would go after Lahore
Pakistani security official
On 30 March 2009 , a raid on the Manawan police training centre near the city underlined the fact that Lahore is a new frontline in Pakistan 's struggle against militancy .
The attack on Sri Lanka cricketers in Lahore on 3 March had made headlines around the world .
According to security officials , part of the reason Lahore is now under threat may be because it has previously been seen as stable .
" Lahore is the only city in Pakistan which has remained relatively peaceful since the 9/11 attacks , " a security official said in May .
" It has been Pakistan 's saving grace , and whoever wants to destabilise the country or the government , would go after Lahore . "
Suspects
There are a number of reasons why Lahore could be the centre of such attacks .
Many people have suspected Taliban militants in Pakistan 's north - west .
Almost all major attacks inside Pakistan in recent years have been traced back to the tribal areas near the Afghan border , the authorities say .
The siege of the police academy in March lasted eight hours Taliban militants fighting the Pakistani army have openly admitted planning and carrying out many of the attacks .
Earlier this year , they issued a propaganda video claiming a number of suicide bombings on security forces over the past two years .
At least two of them were carried out in Lahore .
There are also growing fears that attacks are being carried out by militants based in Punjab itself - the Punjab Taliban - in co-ordination with their counterparts in the north - west .
Fingers have been pointed at Lashkar - e - Taiba , as they were after the attack on the Sri Lanka team .
Some experts say the attacks could be retaliation by elements within the group for the crackdown on it following the attacks in the Indian city of Mumbai ( Bombay ) last November .
Others , like Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik , accuse another militant group , Lashkar - e - Jhangvi , which the US believes has close ties with al - Qaeda .
" Almost all the recent major terror attacks have either been claimed or traced back to the Lashkar - e - Jhangvi , " he told reporters in Lahore in March .
Lashkar - e- Jhangvi is also implicated in the October 2009 attack on Pakistan 's army headquarters in Rawalpindi .
' Assault tactics '
Many analysts are quick to point out the change in tactics - but what many seem to have forgotten is how it all began .
Pakistani militants only started using suicide attacks in a co-ordinated manner in 2004 .
The first target was Karachi , where a series of bomb attack in May of that year left more than 100 people dead .
We will eventually start using assault tactics again , when we have regained our strength in men
Pakistani militant leader in 2006
Since then , they have become increasingly frequent , with suicide bombings almost a daily occurrence in the north - west .
While experts have suggested a number of theories for this change of tactics , the militants themselves say there was one clear reason .
" We started using the suicide bomber because we were under siege at the time , " a militant leader told me in 2006 .
" We were short of trained men as many had been arrested or killed in the crackdown following 9/11 .
The places where we could set - up training camps were also declared out of bounds .
" The easiest way to fight back was to use a bomb and the easiest way to ensure its success was to use someone to manually detonate the device .
Little training was needed , and the younger the bomber the easier it was to convince them , " the militant said .
But he added that the suicide bomber was not always effective , especially if the target was spread over a large area .
" We will eventually start using assault tactics again , when we have regained our strength in men , " he concluded .
That increasingly appears to be the case , as the militants deploy a variety of different tactics in the field .
Next Taliban state ?
More than anything , this means that whatever Pakistan 's government says , the power of the militants has increased substantially over the past two years .
There have been several setbacks for Pakistan 's Taliban - notably when their leader , Baitullah Mehsud , was killed in August 2009 - but the militants have struck back with renewed ferocity .
ATTACKS ON LAHORE THIS YEAR 15 October : Gunmen attack law - enforcement targets 12 June : Prominent anti-Taliban cleric killed by suicide bomber at his religious school 27 May : A car bomb attack on police buildings kills at least 23 30 March : Gunmen attack a police academy , killing eight people 3 March : Gunmen kill six police guards in an ambush on the Sri Lanka cricket team Political instability has given them encouragement , and they have thrived as they once did during the 1990s under state patronage .
Whether Pakistan 's current government is up to the task of defeating them remains to be seen .
President Asif Zardari's government certainly has the desire to go after the militants .
But whether it has the required backing from the military is an open question .
Pakistan 's military has always seen the country 's " strategic interests " through a different lens from the civilian governments .
In the past the military has acted as godfather to the militants .
But never has the country faced as great an internal threat as it does now .
Experts say the situation can still be remedied if both parties agree that eliminating the militants is in Pakistan 's best interests .
If that does not happen , fears will grow that Pakistan could become the next Taliban state .

With an arrest warrant looming over him for crimes against humanity and genocide in Darfur , Sudan ’s President Omar al - Bashir is on a last - minute bid to win friends and influence people .
In a Sunday visit with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak – one of the strongest voices in the Arab League – Mr. Bashir explained his concerns about what would happen to his country if the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) follows through on the chief prosecutor ’s request for an arrest warrant for Bashir .
The ICC said Monday that it will announce whether to issue the warrant on March 4 .
Bashir ’s backers argue that the ICC ’s pursuit of justice is undermining his leadership and the ability to strike a peace deal with Darfur rebels .
While Bashir has racked up a broad range of supporters – from members of the African Union to the Arab League to China – his time seems to be running out .
“ There is no exit , ” says John Prendergast , co-chair of the Enough Project , an Africa advocacy group in Washington .
" Of course Bashir is seeking all kinds of political support in order to make the ICC supporters uncomfortable .
But at the end of the day , if enough countries downgrade relations [ with Sudan ] over time because the head of state is an indicted war criminal , the Sudanese ruling party will be thinking very hard about how long it will rally around its leader . "
Those of Bashir 's party who do n't want to see Sudan 's legitimacy shrink further " will work for a peaceful change of leadership , " Mr. Prendergast adds .
Milosevic , Taylor ... and Bashir ?
Like Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Liberian President Charles Taylor before him , Sudan 's president is coming up against a relatively new international court system designed to ensure that national leaders and others cannot commit human rights crimes with impunity .
Bashir has a few more tools at his disposal than Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Taylor had , of course , since he is still the sitting leader of his country .
But while Bashir may actually have the numbers on his side , with much of the developing world voicing concern that the ICC has overreached its mandate , the ICC is showing no signs of relenting .
" The only alternative the judge can look at is to stagger or to postpone the decision to issue an arrest warrant , " says Godfrey Musila , a legal expert at the Institute for Security Studies in Tshwane , South Africa ( formerly known as Pretoria ) .
" What Sudan is doing is trying to get enough diplomatic voices on its side , but the idea is not to affect the decision of whether to issue an arrest warrant or not , but when to do it . "
Coming just a week after the Khartoum government signed a " confidence - building " agreement to start talks with the key Darfur rebel group , the Justice and Equality Movement , at a meeting in Doha , Qatar , Bashir 's diplomatic roadshow is a clear last - minute dash to stall the inevitable .
Critics of the ICC , and supporters of Bashir – and these two groups are not synonymous – argue that attempting to arrest Bashir now , in an election year , when relations with the former secessionist south and the rebellious Darfur region to the west , might simply make things worse for the Sudanese people .
A Comprehensive Peace Accord between Khartoum and South Sudan could crumble if Bashir is removed from leadership .
The Darfur conflict – which has entered its sixth year with no end in sight – might be given new energy if rebels feel that there is no point in negotiating with a weak Khartoum government .
A French aid organization in Darfur said Monday that two of its Sudanese staff were killed in a bandit attack .
Egypt 's concern : regional stability
Opponents of the Bashir regime see the possible indictment as a victory against genocide .
Any warrant is likely based on the Sudanese president 's role in the deaths of more than 300,000 and the displacement of more than 2.5 million in Sudan 's Darfur region .
But Egypt – which already hosts millions of Sudanese refugees in its borders – sees it as a potentially disastrous Pandora 's box and a profound threat to regional stability .
" Egypt supports Sudan on the question of the ICC because it is very dangerous to the state of Sudan itself , not just to the regime of President Bashir , " says Dr. Hani Raslan , an analyst at Cairo's Ahram Center and an expert in Sudan - Egypt relations .
" Now that there is peace between the North and the South , Egypt does not want to see a return to a larger civil war . "
Mr. Raslan says that Sudan is " in a very weak position in the region " and feels surrounded by threats , such as Chad , Eritrea , and Israel .
" Everyone has an agenda against Sudan , " he says .
While Mr. Mubarak is unwilling to come out too strongly in favor of a man many see as a war criminal , his government has nevertheless made it clear that it is strongly opposed to a possible indictment .
The Egyptian government has objected to what it calls the " politicization and selectivity " of the ICC allegations , in the words of presidential spokesman Suleiman Awwad .
Speaking to reporters before Sunday 's meeting , Mr. Awwad warned that an indictment could lead to wider instability .
" The repercussions will be dangerous in Darfur , in particular , and in Sudan in general , and on the UN - AU peacekeeping forces , " said Awwad , according to the Associated Press .
Egypt and Sudan have a long history of mutual entanglement .
From 1899 to 1956 , Sudan was jointly administered as a condominium of Egypt and the British Empire .
Cairo remains an important ally for Sudan .
It is a traditional leader of the Arab world , and as a strategic ally of Europe and the United States , it is an important bridge to the West .
" Egypt is important for Sudan , " says Abdel Malik al - Naiem , spokesman for the Sudanese Embassy in Cairo .
" On the issue of the ICC indictment , Mubarak has made a very good effort for us over the last two weeks , especially by telling [ French President Nicolas ]
Sarkozy that Egypt will support Sudan in this matter . "
Stability concerns a canard ?
Prendergast and other observers argue that Bashir 's day in court is just a matter of time , and that it will actually bring more stability to the region , not less .
" This will provide a major opening for peace efforts on Darfur , as the only real path to a deferred ICC case is if the government secures a peace deal with Darfur 's rebels , " says Prendergast .
" All the diplomatic sound and fury emanating from Bashir 's palace these days signifies nothing , " he says .
" The arrest warrant will have severe repercussions .
If he laughs in the face of international justice , he will join the likes of Milosevic and Taylor who similarly laughed at their indictments but who ultimately ended up in custody . "

By Kathy Fairfax
The popular image of the Russian Revolution is of a revolution made by men .
Ask the person in the street to name a figure from the Russian Revolution and most could come up with Lenin , Stalin , maybe Trotsky .
A few might have heard of Zinoviev , Kamenev or Bukharin .
But how many would name Kollontai , Armand or Krupskaya ?
How many know of the women who helped make revolution in Russia ?
How many know about the thousands of female Bolsheviks who marched through the streets of Petrograd in 1917 or shouted revolutionary speeches to cheering crowds or wrote and distributed pamphlets calling for revolution ?
In fact , women revolutionaries inspired the working class the world over and inaugurated a new era in world history .

These women worked alongside men in all the campaigns that ultimately brought state power .
For twenty years before the revolution in 1917 they sustained the underground Bolshevik party organisation and agitated for revolution by writing and distributing leaflets and newspapers .
After the fall of the tsar they became stump speakers , agitators and party recruiters .
During the civil war they fought alongside men to defend their revolution and after the war was over they worked with men to build the institutions of the new society .
This , at a time when women in the rest of Europe were still asking for the vote .
Who were these women ?
Like the male Bolsheviks , they were mostly Russian , from the cities and in early adulthood .
Unlike the men though , most women Bolsheviks came from the middle and upper classes .
It is not hard to work out why this should be so .
Working - class and peasant women had a daily struggle to survive that left time for little else , while more - affluent women had the leisure to read and think and discuss ideas .
As well , Russian society discouraged all women from participating in the male business of politics , and this prohibition was enforced particularly strongly within the working class and the peasantry .
Nevertheless in the first decades of this century so many thousands of women made the dangerous decision to become revolutionaries that Russia ended up with more radical women than any other country .
Not all joined the Bolsheviks ; some joined the Socialist Revolutionaries , others joined the Mensheviks .
There were anarchist women as well .
But a majority of women activists chose to join the Bolsheviks .
For many of these women the decision to join the revolutionary movement before 1917 came about because of the political situation in Russia and because the revolutionary movement had always welcomed women into its ranks .
For decades the oppression of women had been considered by social critics to be one of Russia 's great injustices .
Upper - and middle - class women had access to very limited education and employment while most peasant girls never went to school .
Women could not separate from their husbands , change their residence , leave the country , take a job or execute a bill of exchange without the permission of a male guardian .
Divorce was practically impossible and women had significantly less property and inheritance rights than men .
Underlying these legal restrictions was a patriarchal value system that granted all men power over the women in their families .
Whatever her class a woman was expected to marry a man of her parents ' choice and live her life as the dutiful wife of an authoritarian , if sometimes benevolent , husband .
She owed her husband complete obedience and was compelled by the state to live with him , take his name and assume his social status .
Social reformers and novelists such as Chernyshevsky and Turgenev deplored the situation and the small revolutionary organisations of the 1870s welcomed so many women into their ranks that by some estimates one third of their membership was female .
The position of women in Russia was complicated by the political situation .
Although reformers from many different quarters were calling for fundamental change in many areas , among them the position of women , the recalcitrant tsarist government refused all possibilities of change .
Not for them a constitutional monarchy with an independent parliament as in Western Europe .
The tsar maintained a strong autocratic government whose liberal opposition was weak .
And if the liberal opposition was weak , the feminists in the liberal intelligentsia were equally weak .
Here we must make a distinction between what we think of as feminism today and how it was viewed at the turn of the century .
Feminism is one of the main tenets of our party .
I consider myself a feminist .
Probably most of you do as well .
But early this century there was a real dividing line between feminism and socialism .
In Russia , liberal feminists called for the government to reform the laws relating to women on the Western European model , so that women would have a few more rights within marriage , could own property and perhaps vote .
They had no wish to challenge the capitalist system and the reforms they worked for benefited middle - class and aristocratic women , who were concerned with inheritance and property rights , far more than working - class or peasant women .
Like their Western European counterparts , the women 's organisations they built urged the opposition liberal parties to include these reforms in their platforms .
The women who joined the Bolsheviks did so because they rejected liberal feminism , condemning it as a bourgeois ideology that overrated the significance of legal gender inequality and ignored the fundamental roots of the oppression of women that sprang from the private ownership of the means of production .
For women
Bolsheviks , liberation could not be given by governments : it had to be seized by women and men acting together to create a new society of equals .
As Lenin put it in a 1920 discussion with Clara Zetkin :
The theses [ on communist work among women ] must emphasise strongly that true emancipation of women is not possible except through communism .
You must lay stress on the unbreakable connection between woman 's human and social position and the private ownership of the means of production .
This will draw a strong , ineradicable line against the bourgeois movement for the " emancipation of women " .
This will also give us a basis for examining the woman question as a part of the social , working - class question , and to bind it firmly with the proletarian class struggle and the revolution .
Although discontent with the government was widespread , very few people , and far fewer women than men , chose a perilous life on the run in pursuit of a popular upheaval that might never come .
Those who were willing to live that way were , by definition , exceptional .
Why did they join the Bolsheviks ?
What was it about this section of the international socialist movement that attracted so many women ?
To understand what the Bolsheviks offered women activists we have to look at the history of the Marxist movement and its attitudes to women .
Marxism and women 's liberation
The first Marxist work to consider the subject of women and the family was Engels ' The Condition of the Working Class of England written in 1844 .
The book dealt at length with the effects of capitalism on the family as women and children were increasingly substituted for male workers at a fraction of men's wages .
Capitalism , Engels noted at length , was destroying the traditional division of family labour , where woman was homemaker and man was breadwinner .
Within a year Marx and Engels had made a great advance in their thinking on women and the division of labour in The German Ideology .
They suggested that the family was not a set of natural or biological relations but a social institution that corresponded to the mode of production .
Further , they argued that a communal domestic economy was a necessary prerequisite for women 's liberation and that this would lead to the abolition or " supercession " of the family itself .
This was an enormous advance on the prevailing attitude that the family was a natural entity and that women 's inferior position was biologically determined .
In The German Ideology Marx and Engels also contrasted the loveless matches of the bourgeoisie with the affectionate matches of the proletariat and decided that property was the main obstacle to relations based on love , equality and mutual respect .
In Engels ' catechism of late 1847 , " The Principles of Communism " , he asks " What influence will the communistic order of society have upon the family ? " :
It will make the relations between the sexes a purely private affair which concerns only the persons involved , and calls for no interference by society .
It is able to do this because it abolishes private property and educates children communally , destroying thereby the two foundation stones of hitherto existing marriage -- the dependence of the wife upon her husband and of the children upon the parents conditioned by private property .
This commitment to the liberation of women and children and to the personal and sexual freedom of the individual was a strong current in late 19th century socialism and was part of the deeply felt heritage of the Bolsheviks as well .
Thus , by 1850 , Marx and Engels had formulated many of the ideas that would shape the Bolshevik vision .
Unlike earlier utopian social theorists -- such as Henri Saint - Simon , Charles Fourier and Robert Owen -- their vision of the future was based on their understanding of past modes of production and reproduction and their evolution .
Recognising the family as a social and not a natural construct , they began to challenge the gender division of labour .
In Volume I of Capital , Marx spends a lot of time discussing the factory system , the extensive employment of women and children and the effect this was having on the family system .
But even in the hellish crucible of capitalist industry he saw the germ of something better :
However terrible and disgusting the dissolution of the old family ties within the capitalist system may appear , large - scale industry , by assigning an important part in socially organised processes of production , outside the sphere of the domestic economy , to women , young persons and children of both sexes , does nevertheless create a new economic foundation for a higher form of the family and of relations between the sexes …
It is also obvious that the fact that the collective working group is composed of individuals of both sexes and all ages must under the appropriate conditions turn into a source of humane development , although in its spontaneously developed , brutal capitalist form , the system works in the opposite direction …
The reality of massive female employment in industry meant that it was imperative that women be incorporated as active participants in political work .
Furthermore , as Marx wrote to his friend Ludwig Kugelmann in late 1868 : " Everyone who knows anything of history , knows that great social revolutions are impossible without the feminine ferment . "
In 1871 , Marx was instrumental in having the International -- the International Working Men's Association or First International -- adopt a new rule recommending the establishment of female branches , without excluding the possibility of branches composed of both sexes .
The prospects for such a commitment were poor and in any case the International was nearing the end of its life , but Marx 's recommendation did leave an important legacy by establishing in principle the legitimacy of autonomous women 's organisations within the mass movement .
However this did not mean that the socialist workers ' movement in Europe accepted either female labour or equality of women and many early unions excluded women on the grounds that their presence lowered male wages and worsened the material condition of the working class as a whole .
Unions demanded a family wage that would enable women to return to their " proper " places in the home .
August Bebel 's famous work Women and Socialism , first published in 1879 , began the move away from " proletarian anti-feminism " and towards a more unifying strategy within the workers ' movement .
The book , which by 1910 had gone through 50 editions in Germany as well as numerous translations abroad , became the basis for subsequent social - democratic organising efforts among women .
Bebel 's thesis that only through the destruction of bourgeois society would all women be emancipated struck a chord with many women , as did his argument that women 's entry into industry and organisation into unions was a necessary step in the historical process which would terminate in socialism .
For decades Bebel 's work was the official line on the role of the socialist movement in women 's emancipation .
Later criticism of the book revealed its limitations but the central thesis remained valid : " There can be no emancipation of humanity without the social independence and equality of the sexes " ( emphasis in original ) .
It had an enormous effect on many of the future women leaders of the international socialist movement .
As Clara Zetkin , a leader of the German Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) noted :
The book must not be judged according to its positive aspects or its shortcomings .
Rather , it must be judged within the context of the times in which it was written .
It was more than a book , it was an event - a great deed .
The book pointed out for the first time the connection between the woman 's question and historical development .
For the first time , there sounded from this book the appeal :
We will only conquer the future if we persuade the women to become our co-fighters .
If the work of Bebel was crucial in combating proletarian anti-feminism in the workers ' movement , so were the practical efforts to implement those ideas by women socialists such as Clara Zetkin .
She was a tireless proponent of the rights of working women and her organisational work , speeches , writing , and lifelong commitment to women workers helped to chart a new direction within the European socialist movement .
Zetkin repeatedly clashed with the more conservative members of the labour movement who wanted women out of the workforce .
If employers insisted on female labour because it was cheaper , her answer was to fight for equal pay for equal work .
In a speech to the founding congress of the Second International in 1889 she argued , according to a report , that :
… it is not women 's work per se which in competition with men's work lowers wages , but rather the exploitation of female labour by the capitalists who appropriate it .
Zetkin not only defended women 's right to work , but said that women 's participation in the workforce was a prerequisite for women 's independence .
" The slave of the husband became the slave of the employer " but women still gained from this transformation .
While Marx and Engels made no distinction between the oppression suffered by women of different classes , Zetkin was the first social theorist to place women 's oppression within the different classes of society .
In essence she proposed a different " woman question " for every class in capitalist society .
Upper-class women wanted freedom to manage and inherit money and property ; middle - class women wanted education and job opportunities while proletarian women , compelled to work in the least paid jobs to supplement their families ' income , wanted better working conditions for all .
Zetkin's efforts on behalf of women workers received international recognition in 1907 at the first International Conference of Socialist Women where she was elected secretary of the International Women 's Bureau .
It was at this conference that Zetkin , together with Rosa Luxemburg , proposed to the international socialist movement that March 8 be celebrated annually in all countries as International Working Women 's Day .
Attending the Socialist Women 's Conference were many Russian women , among them Alexandra Kollontai , who left convinced of the need to begin organising women at home .
In the same year the congress of the Second International endorsed the principle of women 's right to work , the creation of special women 's organisations within all socialist parties and a position on active organising for women 's suffrage .
An active strategy for women 's full enfranchisement -- political , social and economic -- was finally in place .

A dash of science :
Now that 's change
President Barack Obama did a lot more than lift the ban on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research Monday .
He came to the startling conclusion that scientific research should be based on science .
This will be a change .
George W. Bush spent the past eight years making sure scientific research was based on conservative ideology , political manipulation and whim .
Advertisement
Global warming ?
Buncha baloney .
We ’ve got millions of years left .
Saw a polar bear the other day in a zoo .
Looked fine .
And if scientists disagree with that , we can always find new scientists .
Using embryonic stem cells to try to cure diseases like Parkinson ’s and diabetes or to repair spinal cord injuries ?
Hold your horses on that one .
Some religious conservatives do n’t like that one .
Some centuries ago , they did n’t like Galileo saying the Earth revolved around the sun , and they got him to recant ( and spend the rest of his life under house arrest ) .
That was n’t good for science , but it was just fine for the Inquisition .
Monday , Obama said , in effect , modern inquisitions were over .
He said scientists must be “ free from manipulation and coercion . ”
And he said he is going to make sure “ that scientific data is never distorted or concealed to serve a political agenda — and that we make scientific decisions based on facts , not ideology . ”
This was more than some could take .
House Republican leader John A. Boehner quickly issued a statement saying , “ This decision runs counter to President Obama ’s promise to be a president for all Americans . ”
And , I guess , if you are an American who believes scientists should be manipulated and coerced and have their results distorted by politics and ideology , you are very disappointed today .
Which is not to say all conservatives are disappointed by Obama ’s decision .
Nancy Reagan quickly endorsed it , saying that “ time is short and life is precious . ”
And during his presidential campaign , John McCain said , “ I ’ve prayed a lot about it , but I ’ve come down on the side of support for embryonic stem cell research . ”
According to Gallup , “ A solid majority of Americans ( typically 60 percent ) agree with using stem cells derived from human embryos for medical research , 61 percent considering such research morally acceptable . ”
Which is why some Republicans do n’t really want to talk about it that much .
Rep. Eric Cantor , the No. 2 Republican in the House , said on CNN ’s “ State of the Union ” Sunday : “ Let ’s take care of business first .
People are out of jobs . ”
They are .
And putting people back to work is Job 1 for the Obama administration .
But this president seems determined to prove that government can walk and chew gum at the same time .
Speaking of the need for painstaking and costly research , Obama said , “ When government fails to make these investments , opportunities are missed . ”
He went on by saying , “ In recent years , when it comes to stem cell research , rather than furthering discovery , our government has forced what I believe is a false choice between sound science and moral values .
In this case , I believe the two are not inconsistent . ”
So science will go forward .
But wait .
There is a potential problem with this .
Scientists can become mad .
We know this from watching many , many movies .
You give mad scientists money and leave them alone in a laboratory , and you know what they will do ?
Eric Cantor does .
He says Obama ’s decision on stem cell research could lead to “ human cloning . ”
Which Cantor is against .
Though I do n’t know why .
Human cloning might be the best way Republicans have to create more Republicans .
Physics kitties ahead .
Limited gimp skills .
Honestly , if you are n't a physics geek , I do n't see why you 'd enjoy these lovely kitties , except for the fact that every kitty , , is awesome .

World 's Largest Solar Deal Signed in California
February 12th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
In what is purported to be the world ’s largest solar deal , Southern California Edison and BrightSource Energy signed a series of contracts yesterday to give California 1,300 MW of solar energy — enough power for 845,000 homes .
The project will produce 3.7 billion KWH of power and avoid over two million tons of CO2 emissions each year .
>>
Want cheap solar ?
Join the most effective community solar purchasing program in the US .
As part of the proposal , BrightSource will install its Luz Power Tower 550 ( LPT 550 ) at each power plant .
The LPT uses thousands of small mirrors , or heliostats , to reflect sunlight onto a steam - producing boiler placed on top of a tower .
The steam is then sent to a conventional turbine to generate electricity .
Seven solar power plants will be built in order to generate the full 1,300 MW , with the first expected to be in operation by 2013 .
The rest of the projects will likely be completed six to seven years later .
SCE and BrightSource Energy are currently negotiating approval for the power plants with the California Public Utilities Commission .
Construction may begin as early as 2010 .

With so many gorgeous Banana Breads to choose from my Banana bread Bake Off , I have no shortage of great recipes .
One of them that caught my eye was Catherine from Clever Monkey Studio who made a Siamese Loaf aka a Curry Pineapple Banana Bread .
It was fortuitous that I had a small amount of pineapple left , which was exactly the amount I needed to make this intriguing bread with the rest of the items already in my pantry with bananas being plentiful and inexpensive at the moment .
Another advantage to this is how gorgeously easy it is .
Look at the method below and be delighted .
There 's nothing more to it that some mixing .
I do n't often push recipes on people but I do push this one only because I know that you might be weirded out by the addition of curry powder in a banana bread .
But you will be duly rewarded with this unusual but gorgeous loaf .
Curry Pineapple Banana Bread ( Siamese Loaf )
3 ripe bananas
1/2 cup melted butter
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 egg , beaten
2 tbsp coconut milk powder ( or unsweetened coconut )

IF YOU WATCH OR READ OR LISTEN TO BUSINESS NEWS , you must be getting very confused about whether the stock market is undervalued or overvalued .
The bulls who appear on the financial shows assert that the stock market is inexpensive : " This market is as cheap as it has been for the past two decades -- or the past 18 years . "
They also may state that the price - earnings ratio , at 13 to 16 estimated earnings for 2008 or 2009 , is below the long - term norm .
Their statements are correct .
At other times during the same day , you may hear a bearish market maven try to convince the interviewer that the market is substantially overvalued and has a long way to go on the downside before it gets to fair valuation .
The bearish interviewee will either discuss why the P/E ratio at over 21 times 2008 earnings estimates or 24 times the latest 12 - months earnings is closer to valuations found near market tops , rather than market bottoms .
Stuart Goldenberg
These analysts are also correct .
Interviewers seldom if ever question the disparities in the various market analysts ' approaches to valuation .
But we will try to clear it up .
Few stock - market research organizations are equipped to estimate the earnings of every company in the Standard and Poor 's 500 .
It would require having analysts in every sector to study each individual stock and come up with the best guess possible .
Virtually no institution or money - management firm does this .
We generally rely on organizations such as Standard & Poor 's to do the work for us .
Standard & Poor 's has done more than enough work .
Visit its Website and you will find a myriad of different earnings estimates from which you can choose .
S&P shows reported earnings , operating earnings , core earnings , earnings with pension - interest adjustment , and other formats .
There are two main earnings numbers that Wall Street uses when discussing valuations -- " reported earnings " or " operating earnings . "
Typically , the bulls use " operating earnings , " and the bears use " reported earnings " because operating earnings are higher and reported earnings are lower .
Also , it makes sense for the bears to use the past 12 months of earnings because they are usually lower , and for the bulls to use forward operating earnings to help make their case .
Using the last 12 months is much more consistent , since it avoids dependence on estimates of earnings .
Operating earnings exclude write - offs , while reported earnings include write - offs .
That is the only difference , but it 's a difference that is getting much more important .
As recently as the early 1990s , operating and reported earnings were virtually the same .
But then we entered the greatest financial mania of all time , and the earnings numbers diverged .
There were so many write - offs by companies making unwise investments and then undoing them that operating earnings grew much faster than reported earnings .
The write - offs that had been sporadic and unusual became common for many companies .
Using operating earnings is now like playing in a golf tournament that does n't count any penalty strokes for hitting the ball into a water hazard or out of bounds .
Look at the numbers .
Reported earnings for the S&P 500 for 2007 were just over $ 66 .
The operating earnings for 2007 were $ 84.54 .
The estimated numbers for 2008 are about $ 69 for reported earnings and about $ 90 for operating earnings .
By the way , these reported numbers have just recently been revised downward drastically , due to the slowdown in the U.S. economy .
Now you can see why there is such discrepancy in the market mavens ' points of view .
If you are a bull , you will say that the market is trading at a very reasonable 16 multiple on the $ 89.44 of earnings in 2008 and 13 times the 2009 estimate of $ 110.44 .
On the other hand , if you are a bear or just a reasonable person you can see the market is trading at 24 times trailing earnings and about 21 times the estimate of 2008 reported earnings .
Unless you believe that we will be trading at a " permanent plateau , " as did the noted economist Irving Fisher in 1929 , you might want to consider some more distant peak and trough multiples .
Over the past 75 years , most market peaks topped at around 20 times reported earnings , and the troughs occurred at around 10 times earnings .
The financial mania of the late 1990s pushed P / Es to over 40 times reported earnings , and the following bust never brought P / Es below 18 times reported earnings .
There 's more we can do to make sense of earnings :
The best way to measure present earnings and future earnings is to smooth them out over long periods .
Earnings can grow at only approximately 6 % a year over the long term .
The trend is limited by the growth in real GDP plus inflation .
And long term , real GDP cannot grow faster than the increase in the labor force plus the increase in productivity .
If you do n't accept this , look at a long - term chart and draw a 6 % growth line through the earnings .
It is clear that earnings sometimes rise above the line and sometimes fall below it , but earnings always revert to the 6 % mean .
Going back to 1950 , every instance where actual earnings rose above trend - line earnings was followed by a period where actual earnings went well below trend - line earnings .
Comstock Partners believes that we have entered such a period now , and that the market is trading at such a high multiple of trend - line earnings that it will be difficult to make money .
You could even lose a lot of money .

( CNN ) -- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev says he is ready to work with U.S. President Barack Obama to overcome a recent low point in U.S. - Russian relations .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , front , says he wants to work with Barack Obama .
The Russian leader , writing an op -ed in The Washington Post ahead of Thursday 's G - 20 summit in London , said he and Obama have exchanged letters this year that " showed mutual readiness to build mature bilateral relations in a pragmatic and business - like manner . "
Medvedev cited a number of possible areas of cooperation between the two countries , starting with nuclear disarmament .
He agreed with Obama that resuming the disarmament process should become an " immediate priority . "
" The wish to ensure absolute security in a unilateral way is a dangerous illusion , " Medvedev wrote .
" I am encouraged that our new partners in Washington realize this . "
Both countries see a need for " collective solutions " to the problems in Afghanistan .
Conferences on Afghanistan , organized by each country , should be part of a " mutually reinforcing rather than competitive " approach , he said .
Medvedev also said the two countries should help take the lead at the G - 20 summit to address the state of the global economy .
Russia and the United States should push for " universal rules and discipline " in the financial sector and discuss the introduction of a supranational reserve currency , potentially under the International Monetary Fund , Medvedev wrote .
But Medvedev and Obama 's first meeting -- scheduled for Wednesday , the day before the summit -- will offer the chance for a new start in their countries ' relationship , the Russian leader said .
" Unfortunately , relations soured because of the previous U.S. administration 's plans -- specifically , deployment of the U.S. global missile defense system in Eastern Europe , efforts to push NATO 's borders eastward and refusal to ratify the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe , " Medvedev wrote .
" All of these positions undermined Russia 's interests and , if implemented , would inevitably require a response on our part . "
He said neither country should allow " drift and indifference " in their relationship .
" We should agree that overcoming our common negative legacy is possible only by ensuring equality and mutual benefit and by taking into account our mutual interests , " he wrote .
" I am ready for such work with President Obama on the basis of these principles , and I hope to begin as early as tomorrow at our first meeting in London before the Group of 20 summit . "

Blue Castle , the developers of Dead Rising 2 , are hoping to fill the game with the most characters on - screen simultaneously in any game ever - a whopping 6,000 undead at once .
If you ever played Dead Rising , you know that one of the game 's claims to fame was the staggeringly huge horde of zombies that protagonist Frank West had to massacre his way through using everything at his disposal ( well , in the Xbox 360 version , anyway ) .
Dead Rising 2 aims to top the mark set by its predecessor , according to Blue Castle 's character art lead , Izmeth Siddeek .
" Dead Rising 2 deal [s ] with the rendering of the greatest number of characters ever seen in a video game , " Sideek said at last week 's Game Developer 's Conference .
" Everything else needed to be subordinated to this requirement . "
The massive zombie flood is made possible by software called Mental Mill , which allows Blue Castle to efficiently render tons and tons of zombies at once without sacrificing graphical fidelity ( no word on how it 'll affect frame rate , though ) .
In a sidenote to Siddeek 's presentation , Mental Mill 's product manager Laura Scholl told attendees that the Dead Rising 2 team was preparing to fill their casino of the damned with enough zombies to have 6,000 on screen at once .
That 's a lot of zombies .
An interesting side note - while writing this news post , I almost mistakenly called Frank West " Adam West . "
Upon reflection , a videogame featuring Adam West slaughtering zombies would potentially be the best game ever , no ?

Here you can see what Microsoft thinks the future holds , at least when it comes to computers and the internet .
This is part of a short film by Oh Hello made for the PC giant , which requested a glimpse of the " not so distant utopian future . "
I actually think this depiction of future interfaces is pretty accurate , with transparent wall monitors ( these already exist ) , gesture - controlled computing , multi-use devices that are location - aware , and best of all real - time translation between natural languages .
Plus , apparently , the " pinch " gesture from the iPhone has become ubitquitous on PCs in this happy world .
Advertisement
Possibly the translation scenes are the most utopian , however .
We see kids in the US communicating seamlessly with Indian kids ; and later , a woman meets a business colleague and her comments to him on the phone appear to get translated instantly into text he understands .
This is obviously supposed to be the refined version of Google translation , which today can get the job done but still leaves a lot of words weirdly translated .
Could instant , accurate translation lead to a utopian world ?
Or would it only make things easier for all these middle class types in this video who are jetting around to business meetings ?

Glenn Danzig to be on VH1 ’s Rock of Love : Bride of Satan with Glenn Danzig
I ’m not even joking .
Glenn Danzig , former Misfits singer , will be walking tall in the glam boots of Bret Michaels for a new Rock Of Love show aimed at finding him someone to bring home to “ Mother . ”
The show will be called “ Rock of Love : Bride of Satan with Glenn Danzig ” and will make it ’s premiere on VH1 in July .
At least they ’re getting a metal god to do the show now .
I just have to wonder what he ’s going to put those girls through , to win his affections .
Vh1 details some of the challenges , which include : “ goat entrail soup , chili cook - off , blindfolded nun deflowering contest , sexy seance strip - a- thon , virgin or family member : the sacrifice challenge , and name that heretic . ”
If nothing else is clear in our current crisis , it is that the only thing more bankrupt than the big banks is the debate over whether or not to nationalize them .
On This Week this morning , Sen. Richard Shelby ( R - AL ) said he opposed
nationalization but thought insolvent banks should be closed down .
Said Shelby : “ I do n’t want to nationalize them , I think we need to close them .
Close them down , get them out of business .
If they ’re dead , they ought to be buried .
We bury the small banks ; we ’ve got to bury some big ones and send a strong message to the market .
And I believe that people will start investing [ again ] in banks . ”
Something like this is both heartening and insanely distressing at the same time because what exactly does he think people are talking about when people talk about nationalization ?
They ’re talking about some form of FDIC - like takeover , though probably one that would take longer and be much more complicated since you simply can’t find another bank that is going to buy up most or all of Citi ’s assets at some knock - down price over the weekend — certainly not in the present climate .
You either clean the bank up ( which would require what amounts to a de facto bankruptcy proceeding ) and sell it back into private hands or break it up and sell it off in individual pieces — likely some combination of the two .
It would be one thing if Shelby were just one more Fox News robot .
But he ’s the ranking member of the friggin’ Banking Committee .
The death of a USC student and the critical injury of another in a violent hit - and - run accident left the urban campus reeling Monday as authorities and relatives called on the public for help in locating the driver and the badly damaged car .
“ We need to find the vehicle , ” said LAPD Deputy Chief Kirk Albanese .
“ We need to find it quickly . ”
The accident , which occurred at the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street at 3 a.m. Sunday , left Adrianna Bachan , 18 , dead and Marcus Garfinkle , 19 , clinging to life .
According to witnesses , Garfinkle was carried about 500 feet on the vehicle ’s windshield before the driver stopped and a passenger removed him from the car .
The vehicle then sped off .
At a Monday news conference , Bachan ’s mother , Carmen Bachan , held up pictures of her daughter and pleaded , “ If anybody knows anything , I want them to help me . ”

Police say the driver had run a red light before the accident .
Investigators and relatives said they were shocked by the cold behavior of the driver and passenger .
“ The passenger got out of the car and threw the young man on the street after they destroyed my baby , ” Carmen Bachan said .
Albanese said investigators were looking for a black sedan -- possibly a Lexus , a Honda Accord or a Toyota Corolla -- that sustained heavy damage to its front end and a cracked windshield .
Officers have already begun canvassing auto repair shops and have told employees to keep an eye out for the vehicle .
The intersection at Jefferson and Hoover is one of the busiest near USC .
Scores of students walk , ride bicycles or skateboard across it each day , to and from class .
It was far from deserted early Sunday morning when the two first - year students found themselves in the path of a speeding car .

Will Sturgeon , a 19 - year - old freshman in environmental studies , said he was walking back to campus from a party when he hard a loud crash .
“ We look over and we see this girl in the air and hitting the ground , ” he said .
Sturgeon and others called authorities while a friend blocked traffic .
Sturgeon and the friend flagged down a passing fire engine , he said .
Sturgeon said he thought the two students might have crossed the street outside of the crosswalk , because Bachan ’s body ended up about 15 yards away from it .
News of the accident quickly spread through the campus .
Advertisement
“ A lot of people were talking about it on campus .
It ’s in the Daily Trojan and it ’s all over people ’s Facebook ” pages , said freshman Gieselle Allen , 19 , who is studying screenwriting .
“ I just think it ’s sad . ”
Other students said it was difficult to fathom how the driver could speed off without helping the students .
“ Everybody is pretty shocked , ” said Robert Hooks , 21 , a senior who is studying political science .
“ How do you just leave somebody on the side of the road like that ? ”

The daughter of a Croatian father and a Cuban mother , Bachan was born in Los Angeles .
She grew up in Montecito and went to Santa Barbara High School , Carmen Bachan said .
She said her daughter was an honors student and played soccer at the school .
Before Monday ’s news conference began , Carmen Bachan squeezed Albanese ’s hand as the officer tried to console her .
“ Do you have children ? ” she asked .
“ Yes , ” he said .

“ Think if they died ! ” Carmen Bachan said .
“ Think if they died ! ”
Kelly Wirht , chapter president of Bachan ’s sorority , Pi Beta Phi , said a candlelight vigil had been planned for Monday night .
In a written statement , she said that everyone in the house “ is saddened at the tragic loss of its sister . ”
“ Adrianna was both an amazing woman and an outstanding member of our chapter , ” she said .
“ She will be greatly missed . ”
Michael Jackson , USC ’s vice president of student affairs , said university officials have been proactive in trying to cope with the heavy amount of pedestrian and vehicle traffic around campus and will install a light within the next few months at 28th and Hoover streets , where another student was struck and injured earlier this year .

Jackson said the Jefferson - Hoover intersection sees an enormous amount of pedestrian traffic because some 10,000 students live north of Jefferson Boulevard .
“ Just imagine , ” he said .
“ That ’s a lot of people going back and forth . ”
Jackson said university officials have worked with the city to improve the intersection and that a new system was implemented within the last couple of years that allows pedestrians to cross at several points while all traffic is stopped .
He said officials are planning to reexamine the spot after Sunday ’s fatality , but that it ’s difficult to stop someone from running a red light .

They buy them because they are " trendy . "

That said , I still use a PC .
I would n't mind a mac for purposes of learning more about them , but there is really no reason for me to have one since ubuntu and openbsd do all the jobs i request from my current PCs .
Tom Ammiano wants to effectively legalize -- and tax -- California 's trade in cannabis .
AB 390 " would remove all penalties in California law on cultivation , transportation , sale , purchase , possession , or use of marijuana , natural THC , or paraphernalia for persons over the age of 21 , " Ammiano 's press secretary Quintin Mecke told the San Francisco Weekly .
Ammiano , a rookie state legislator and former San Francisco supervisor , may have a unique opportunity to win support for the bill in the wake of the state 's budget debacle .
" California has the opportunity to be the first state in the nation to enact a smart , responsible public policy for the control and regulation of marijuana , " he said .
Mecke suggested taxes on the trade could amount to $ 1 billion according to advocates .
And I 'd bet that 's a conservative estimate .
" With the state in the midst of an historic economic crisis , the move towards regulating and taxing marijuana is simply common sense , " Ammiano said at a morning news conference at the state building on Golden Gate Avenue in San Francisco .
Estimates value the state 's crop of marijuana at $ 13.8 billion , double that of the vegetable and grape markets combined .
Nationwide , it may be the fourth largest cash crop , behind corn , soy and hay but ahead of wheat .
The proposed bill would allow Californians over the age of 21 to grow , transport , sell , possess and consume the plant , with state and local law enforcement professionals barred from enforcing the federal ban .
The tax would amount to $ 50 per ounce of marijuana , which retails on the black market for anywhere from $ 250 to $ 500 depending on the source and quality .
While it may sound like a pipe dream , with communities from the emerald triangle of Humboldt , Mendecino and Trinity Counties to liberal districts all along California 's cost all strapped for cash , other lawmakers and voters might just tune in and turn on .
Frankly , I think they should sign an endorsement deal with Olympic gold medal swimmer Michael Phelps .

West figures libertarian stoners will inevitably complain about the tax .
Scientists searching for extraterrestrial life might want to start digging under a Martian mountain three times as high as Mount Everest .
Liquid water likely once sloshed beneath the 15 - mile - high Olympus Mons , and may still be there today .
Because the mountain is volcanic , the water could be warm and friendly to life .
" Olympus Mons is a favored place to find ongoing life on Mars , " said geophysicist Patrick McGovern of Houston 's Lunar and Planetary Institute , lead author of a study in * Geology * in February .
" An environment that 's warm and wet , and protected from adverse surface conditions , is a great place to start looking . "
Other recent discoveries have hinted that life may exist — or may once have existed — on Mars .
Scientists have gathered many indications that liquid water once flowed on the planet .
And over the years , they have found tantalizing , but equivocal , evidence of life in Martian meteorites and on the Martian surface .
In January , researchers documented methane burps on Mars , which could indicate microbial activity .
But so far , it 's all about " if " and " could be . "
The new research suggests Olympus Mons could be a good place to hunt for more definitive evidence .
Using computer simulations , McGovern and Julia Morgan of Rice University determined that the volcano 's strange asymmetry — it has a gently sloped northwest flank and a much steeper southeast side — is the result of what lies beneath it : lava spread unevenly on a slippery surface such as clay , which is deposited by water .* *
" In order for the volcano to have that unusual shape , you need some sort of low - friction base , " McGovern said .
The same phenomenon happens in some Hawaiian volcanoes that have a clay foundation , McGovern said .
And the European Space Agency 's Mars Express spacecraft has already detected clay on Mars .
Olympus
Mons is about 340 miles wide , so clay beneath it " would correspond to a huge amount of water , " said geochemist Jennifer Blank of the SETI Institute , who was not involved in the study .
And unlike the long - suspected water ice that the Phoenix lander sampled for the first time , if water does exist under Olympus Mons , it could be piping hot .
Because the volcano does n't show impact craters on a planet that bears many such scars , it was probably actively coating its surface with fresh lava just 10 million or 20 million years ago .
" On our time scale , that 's pretty close to current , " McGovern said .
Despite a apparent lack of more - recent eruptions , the researchers speculate that the volcano could still be warm on the inside .
If they are right , and the environment beneath Olympus Mons is hot , wet and dark , it would mirror the conditions that many scientists believe gave rise to life on Earth .
" Some of the most primitive life forms on Earth are thermophiles , " Blank said .
" And they 're underground .
They do n't need light . "

What is Portrait Photography ?
A Definition
Portrait photography is capturing the photograph of a person or a group of people and can be one of the most challenging genres of photography .
Portrait photographs capture the personality , character and mood of the subject and they can be considered an artistic representation of a someone ’s character .
Portraits should be captured in a way that they tell a story about the subject and create a connection between the viewer and the subject .
Portrait photographs go beyond just photographing the people where the face , especially the eyes are always given more attention in a portrait as they speak the mood and portray the emotions of the person .
Posing also plays a major role in creating effective portraits as it contributes to the overall power and story of the image .

What Gear Do You Need for Portrait Photography ?
The Best Lens and Focal Length for Portrait Photography
Choosing a lens based on a genre or a purpose is the first step to a wise investment when it comes to photographic gear .
So , if we are talking about portrait lenses then we can narrow our choices down pretty fast .
Portraits photographers crave creamy bokehs , little distortion and fast focusing capabilities .
Normal angle of vision lenses or short telephotos will work near perfectly for you ; so let 's start talking about how to pick the best lens for you .
In general terms , the classic focal length for a portrait lens on a 35 mm camera is 85 mm .
But there are a few caveats so read on .
We 'll skip the budget too so you wo n't limit yourself ( at least not in the first stage of choosing the best lens for your portraits ) .
APS - C Sensor
This is the most common sensor in the market .
50 mm Lenses
There is no way of going wrong with this one , if you really are into portraits , then you need to invest in a good 50 mm lens .
When mounting a regular 50 mm lens into a camera with an APS - C sensor , the lens will tighten down due to the camera 's crop factor .
This will transform the lens ' angle of view to something similar to a telephoto lens sitting between 75 mm and 80 mm .
These lenses offer little distortion , and often come in fast apertures that span from f/1.8 to even f/0.95 .
Here is where your budget will come into play .
Higher quality and more powerful internal components will increase the lens value , and the fastest the aperture , the more it will thicken the price tag as well .
Most portrait photographers using a cropped sensor camera opt for a 50 mm f/1.8 ( and if they can afford it , a f / 1.4 ) .
Full frame sensors
Here options turn out to be broader , from 50 mm to 85 mm lenses .
50 mm Normal lenses on a full frame camera are the purest experience there is , it simply feels like you are watching with your eyes bare naked , and that 's enough reason for trusting 50 mm on a full frame .
Just like we said above , built quality and aperture capabilities will determine the price tag .
85 mm
If you want tighter shots without having any barrel distortion , then you can also consider 85 mm lenses , which are a little bit longer .
Longer lenses will produce even more blurred shallow depth of field , something highly desired when taking portraits .
This is the classic portrait focal length .
The Best Camera for Portrait Photography
Cameras are n't built for a single purpose but for several , nevertheless , there are some that are great value for certain genres like portrait photography .
All of these cameras are great , and your choice should be guided by lens options , ergonomics , and budget .
Glass before bodies !
The Best Portrait Camera with an APS - C Sensor
DSLR
Canon 80D
For a camera under $ 1,000 ( $ 999 ) , it offers really great value for portrait photography and other applications as well .
It is like going close to a full frame without going broke .
It has a 24.2 megapixels sensor , and is awesome for video as well .
Mirrorless
Fujifilm XT - 3
Despite the fact that it is indeed a very new camera , it has some solid legacy supporting it .
This camera has a new state of the art 26.1 megapixels X - Trans CMOS 4 sensor .
And comes with 16 film simulations , and they all are beautiful .
You can have this jewel of a body at only $ 1,499.00 .
Best Portrait Camera with a Full Frame Sensor
DSLR
Nikon D850
We have mentioned this camera in several posts , and it is simply because it is a great camera .
These guys really nailed it with this full frame DSLR , and is a wise investment if you are still shooting DSLR systems .
It has a 45.7 megapixels , full - frame sensor and can be bought at $ 3,299.95 .
Mirrorless
Sony A7R III
This is the almighty of mirrorless full frame cameras with a decent price tag .
It has a 42.4 megapixels , full - frame sensor with built in eye - tracking autofocus , and since it does n't have an optical low - pass filter , image quality is n't compromised .
You can get it for $ 1,999.99 .

What Are the Best Portrait Photography Camera Settings ?
With portraits , since you want to have sharp and clean images , there are certain settings that you need to use to make good portraits .
Since lighting and other conditions can vary with each shoot , it is best to know what to do with each specific portrait shoot .
We will look at the three basic settings that need to be taken care of , for all types of portraits .
Aperture : Depending on the type of portrait and the number of people in an image , you will need to carefully choose the aperture .
Remember , the wider the aperture , the blurrier the background will be .
If you are shooting portraits of a single subject , you can use apertures as wide as f1.4 , but remember , depending on the focal length and distance between you and the subject , other parts of your subject ’s body may go out of focus - even the nose .
So choose the aperture value according to what you are looking to create .
Make sure the eyes are in focus in the portrait as this gets a bit challenging when using very wide apertures .
If you are shooting from one side of your subject , make sure that the eye closer to the camera is in focus , but in order for the portrait to look better , you might consider using a narrower aperture between f/2.8 and f /4 to have both the eyes in focus .
For couple shoots or where there are two people in a portrait , it is good to play it safe by using aperture values between f/ 2 and f/ 4 so that both the people in the frame are in focus .
If you are sure that both the subjects are on the same focal plane , then you can get away with f/2 , but when there is doubt , it is better to use f/3.5 or f / 4 .
If you are shooting a bunch of people , then to have all the members of the group in focus , you will have to use narrower apertures in the range f/5.6 to f/11 depending on the size of the group you are photographing and along how many rows they are arranged .
Using a narrow aperture will ensure that every person in the frame is in sharp focus .
Shutter Speed : Shutter speed is an important factor when it comes to any genre of photography .
You need to have your subject in focus without any blur due to even the slightest movement .
In order to achieve this , instead of the general 1 / focal length rule , I am going to say that you will need to have a shutter speed , greater than 1 / twice the focal length of your lens so that your images turn out sharp .
It is safe to always stay greater than 1/250 of a second and if you are shooting using a crop sensor camera , you will need to take the crop factor into account .
For example , if you are shooting with an 85 mm lens , it is good to have shutter speed greater than 1 / ( 2 x 85 ) = 1/170 of a second for full frame camera and 1/( 1.5 x 2 x 85 ) = 1/255 s for a crop sensor .
If you have a lens or a camera body that has image stabilisation , and you are in a situation where you need to slow down the shutter speed , then , when using a full frame camera , your shutter speed needs to be greater than at least 1/85 s and on a crop sensor , it needs to be greater than 1/( 85 x 1.5 ) = 1/128 of a second .
Note that even the slightest movement of your subject can cause blur in images and render them useless .
ISO : Based on your aperture and shutter speed , you will need to set your iso to get the correct exposure .
Using very low iso values between 100 and 400 will yield noise free images and this is possible on bright sunny days .
But if you are in a situation where the light is too low , for example a dark cloudy day and / or you are using a narrow aperture maybe for a group photo , you can slightly increase the iso to between 400 to 800 get the correct exposure .
Indoor photo shoots in ambient light may require you to bump up the iso , but you can make use of external flash to compensate for the low light .
Remember , increasing the iso and having a slightly noisy image is better than having a blurred image with no noise .
So do not compromise on shutter speed .
Increase the iso if you need to in order to get the shot .
Portrait Photography Techniques and Tips for Beginners
The truth is that you can make some pretty significant strides in your portrait photography skills , even with rudimentary tips .
Here are some portrait photography tips for beginners that will get you better images , almost instantly .
Think Soft Light :
One of the key tips in portrait photography is that people look better in soft light without harsh shadows .
Examples of soft light might include the light coming in through a window , or the light of an overcast day ( where the sky is basically a big soft box ) .
In general , the larger the source of light ( in relative terms ) the softer the shadows cast by that light will be .
That also means you should try to avoid shooting people in harsh light conditions - midday sun , spotlights , direct flash .
Sometimes you will need to shoot in those conditions , but try to soften or diffuse the light by bouncing it ( wall , ceiling etc ) , reflecting ( reflector , umbrella etc ) it or diffusing it ( softbox , material etc ) .
Backgrounds Are Important :
An old trick of street photography is to choose the background before you choose the subject and the same holds broadly true in portrait photography .
If you ’re in a controlled setting with a cooperative model , you really want to consider what is in the background as it can be distracting or complimentary .
Focus on the Eyes -
And if you can only focus on one eye , make it the eye closest to the camera .
In almost all circumstances , the eyes are going to be the key to getting a good portrait photograph .
If they are out of focus , it is difficult to save the image .
So make sure you nail it .
There are a lot of other portrait photography tips for beginners that you should consider .

Understanding Portrait Photography Lighting
While planning your upcoming portrait session , you have to consider different lighting options and how they suit your creative ideas as well as your model ’s vibe .
No matter if you ’re shooting an outdoor session with natural light or a studio session with various artificial lights , you should know the basic rules of lighting in portraiture .
Natural Lighting for Portraiture
Natural lighting for portraiture is something that almost every photographer attempts to master .
If you ’re shooting outdoors , keep in mind that an overcast day can be the best day for portrait photographers who wish to shoot using natural light .
Clouds act as a giant light diffuser and make the sunlight very soft and the colors in your image richer .
You do not need to look for a shady place or a time when the sun will be low to avoid creating harsh shadows on your model as you would on a sunny day .
You should , however , try to keep the sun behind you so that your model is uniformly illuminated .
On the other hand , another great way to light a portrait when shooting outdoors is having the model backlit using the sun ( especially in the golden hours ) .
This kind of lighting can be truly splendid but it does require a certain amount of advanced technical knowledge .
If you ’re still a beginner when it comes to portraiture , backlit shots can help you take your skills to the next level .
You may have to use spot metering depending on how much light variation you have in the frame and learn to use your exposure settings correctly to compensate for the backlight .
You can create great portraits with natural lighting even indoors if you use diffused window light .
There ’s really no wrong time of day to use window light - it ’s a good idea to spend a few moments in the room where you will be shooting just observing the light and visualizing how you to use it to illuminate your subject .
This kind of lighting can be used to light up a subject and to create some dramatic portraits as the side light can illuminate one side of the subject leaving the other side in little or complete darkness depending on the strength of available light inside and outside .
This is a wonderful way to light your subject and if you wish to illuminate the darker side of your subject to create a different mood in the image .
Artificial Lighting for Portraiture
When it comes to artificial lighting in photography , there are two types of it – continuous and strobe lighting .
Continuous Lighting
Continuous lighting for portraits can be divided into three different groups – incandescent , fluorescent and LED lighting .
Incandescent lighting ranges from the common light bulb to large tungsten “ hot lights ” used in the studio and on movie sets .
This lighting is warm in colour temperature compared with natural daylight .
On the other hand , fluorescent lights come in many different colors - cool white , warm white , daylight balanced and traditional green .
It ’s hard to set correct white balance for fluorescent lighting , so do a custom white balance using a grey card .
LED studio lights can range from very stable in color temperature to very unstable .
The brightness can be varied with a built - in rheostat and some models have two color temperatures , or slide - in filter panels .
The quality of the light from LED lights can be somewhat harsh and it does n’t spread out much , so you might need to soften this light with light modifiers or bounce it off a wall .
Strobe Lighting
When it comes to strobe lighting , there are various flashes and studio strobes .
Strobe lighting is probably the most commonly used artificial lighting in photography but it ’s not suitable for video , as the duration of the flash is too short .
There are many manufacturers of strobe lighting systems and many light modifying accessories to go with them such as umbrellas and softboxes .
Strobe lighting is usually more powerful than continuous lighting but it ’s harder to control it and you might need to readjust frequently during your shoot .
You can use either a single artificial light or something more elaborate , such as a multi - light setup .
This kind of complex setup includes the main light ( key light ) and additional lights such as fill lights , hair lights and background lights .
Portrait Lighting Patterns
There are four common portrait lighting patterns that every portrait photographer should know and these are split lighting , loop lighting , Rembrandt lighting and butterfly lighting .
Split lighting
It is exactly as the name implies – it splits the face into equal halves with one side being in the light , and the other in shadow .
Loop lighting
It is made by creating a small shadow of the subject ’s nose on their cheek .
Rembrandt lighting
It is identified by the triangle of light on the cheek .
Butterfly lighting
It is named for the butterfly shaped shadow that is created under the nose by placing the main light source above and directly behind the camera .
Learning the correct light placement can be quite fun because there are many ways to create something quite unique .

A Guide to Using Flash in Portrait Photography
While Lighting is one of the fundamental requisites of good portrait photography , mastering flash for portraits is quite a challenge .
We can completely change the look of a subject purely by the way we sculpt the light on to their face .
Flash is both simple to use and complicated to master in portrait photography , so in this section we will take a look at types of flashguns you can use , which modes to use and how to get great lighting for your portrait shots .
Types of Flashguns
The most common flashguns most of us use are the built - in camera flash and the hotshoe mounted portable flash units .
If we are shooting in a studio environment we may possibly use larger mains powered flash heads .
The principle of using all of them are very similar .
The built in camera flash
It is the least flexible type .
It may get us out of a difficult lighting situation , however it ’s direct and very close to the lens axis .
This gives us harsh , unflattering portraits with the possibility of red eye .
Pop up camera flash can however be useful as a fill in light on outdoor portraits .
More of that later .
The external , battery - powered flashgun
It is a more controllable source of light for portrait photographers ..
These units have become increasingly sophisticated in recent years .
Many now have the ability to wirelessly sync with multiple other units giving you the possibilities of studio quality lighting for a minimal cost .
The best ones will allow you to both tilt and pan the flash head .
Panning the flash head is important as it allows you to bounce flash off of a ceiling in a portrait format .
The big studio mains flashes
They are also a popular lighting source with portrait photographers .
These will be high powered , allow for multiple attachments such as snoots , soft - boxes and reflecting umbrellas .
They are however expensive and not particularly portable .
Flash Modes For Portrait Photography
Portable flash is the most common type of flash that we will use in portrait photography .
As mentioned above these units are becoming very sophisticated in their capabilities but there is one mode that rules the roost when shooting people , manual mode .
The reasons for this are simple : Fine control of flash output
No variation in color or exposure
Best way to balance flash with ambient light Manual flash has two basic settings .
The first one regulates the power in increments .
They will range all the way from full power down to 1/64th or 1/128th power .
The second setting is lens focal length .
This will widen or narrow the angle of the flash output according to the lens used .
When shooting with flash it ’s important to remember that shutter speed ( with a couple of caveats ) has no effect on flash exposure .
Only the aperture will will have any effect on direct flash .
The caveats are that you will be limited to a maximum shutter speed , called the sync speed .
This is usually around 1/250th of a second but some more advanced dedicated units will sync at much higher speeds with specific cameras .
The other caveat is that the aperture will still affect any ambient light falling on our subject .
When using flash in manual mode , we can change the output setting to balance the flash with ambient light or to get the desired modelling in our subject ’s face .
The other main flash mode that we can use are TTL or Through The Lens metering .
This mode will cut of the flash once the camera sensor has received enough light giving us the correct exposure .
It can however cause variations in exposure depending on where the camera ’s sensor is reading .
EXTRA TIP :
For example if our portrait model changes position , the camera ’s sensor may read more of the background and change our exposure .
Shooting Portraits With a Single Flash
With a single hotshoe mounted flash , we can get great looking portraits .
The three main ways we can use a single flash are these :
Direct flash
It is the least flattering look when shooting a portrait .
The direct nature of the light gives little to no shadows or modelling on the subject ’s face .
They can make people look washed out and very pale , even if they have darker skin tones .
The flash light can also reflect off the subject ’s retina causing the common issue of red eye .
Where possible you should avoid using direct flash .
Bounced flash
It is an excellent way of getting a softer light onto the face of our subject .
To do so we place our subject near a wall or low ceiling then tilt or pan the flash head to around a 45 degree angle .
The light will bounce of of the surface and spread a diffused softer looking flash over the subject ’s face .
As the light will be directional we can also place a white reflector on the opposite side of the subject to gently fill any dark shadows .
You should be aware that when bouncing flash off of a non white surface , you will be reflecting that colour at the model .
Even a slightly off - white surface can change the colour of the subject ’s skin .
Fill
In flash
In this case we use flash to supplement the ambient light .
Most commonly used in combination with daylight , it ’s a great way to balance the background light with the light falling on the subject .
For example let ’s say we were shooting our model in front of a beautiful sunset .
If we expose for the background , our subject ’s face and front will be in complete shadow .
Here we can use our flashgun , either directly or bounced , to lift the subject ’s face out of the shadows .
By using the manual setting on our flash we can dictate the balance between foreground and background .
A higher flash output would require us to use a smaller aperture and would darken the background .
A lower flash output would see us using a wider aperture to capture more light in the background .
Dual or Multiple Flash
As mentioned above , many modern flashguns allow wireless connectivity between themselves .
This means we can trigger two , three or even more flashguns when we press the camera shutter .
More flashguns gives us more creative lighting possibilities .
For example with just two flashguns , we can use a standard portrait set up of setting both lights at 45 degrees to our model .
By changing the manual output of one we can change the lighting ratio between them and hence add levels of modelling on our subject .
We could also use one flash and a reflector to the front of our model and one flash low down behind them .
The rear flash will add a subtle backlight around our model ’s hair .
In order to position multiple flash units you can attach them to lighting stands using hotshoe adapters .
Light Modifiers and other Sundries
As with cameras , it is now possible to buy a multitude of accessories for our flash guns .
These range from very simple diffusers through gels to soft - boxes and snoots .
Using a combination of flashes and accessories we can get studio quality portrait lighting for the price of a mid level DSLR .
Also useful are the plethora of smartphone apps now available .
These can help us with lighting layouts as well as multiple flash exposure settings .
Using flash is , perhaps , the easiest route into creative portrait photography .
If you want to get great results , dispense with the on camera flash and invest in a good portable flashgun .
You can add to that at a later date to increase your portrait lighting creativity .
Portrait Photography Composition and Poses
In addition to proper lighting , interesting compositions and good knowledge of posing techniques are also essential factors in portrait photography .
Classic portraiture compositions can be divided into three categories - head and shoulder portrait , three quarter ( 3/4 ) portrait and full portrait .
In head and shoulder portrait , the subject is framed from the chest up , just to include their head and shoulder in the frame .
These kinds of portraits show the character and features of the subject in more detail .
When it comes to three quarter portrait , the subject is framed from knees up , which means the upper three fourth of the subject ’s body is in the frame .
These portraits let the viewer see a bit more of the character and features of the subject , compared to head and shoulder portraits .
Lastly , in full portrait the subject is framed from head to toe and it fills most of the frame .
Full portraits show the complete personality of the subject and they can be quite complex in terms of lighting and posing .
They can include various props as well .
While many photographers nowadays are being creative when it comes to posing techniques , it ’s good to know some classic rules of posing before doing something rather innovative .
You should also make sure to emphasize your model ’s best features and play down unattractive features .
There are 5 key points you need to remember when you shoot your models :
Posture Body posture can easily make or break the photo - it ’s best to practice good posture by keeping a straight back and the shoulders up .
Slouching will cause the stomach to appear larger and this can create rather negative and uncomfortable atmosphere .
Smile
You should never underestimate the power of an honest smile in portrait photography - this kind of smile can light up the entire photograph .
Because of this , you should try to get your model to smile with their eyes ( not only with their lips ) !
Arms and Legs Limbs that are n’t properly posed can create an awkward photo .
Have your models play around with their hands – they can wrap them around their face or head or hold something in their hands .
For tight shots , you can alleviate strain on the model by providing a posing table that allows for comfortable support of arms and elbows .
Body
If you ’re shooting a full portrait , always try a few shots with the model turning the whole body slightly or leaning against a wall .
This kind of pose can create more dynamic atmosphere which does n’t look stiff and unnatural .
You can use extremely high or low angles for a more creative portrait .
On the other hand , if your model is seated , this will enable you to use chairs or stools as an effective prop .
In the best case scenario , you should use a posing stool that adjusts in height and can rotate to capture different angles of your model ’s body .
Feeling at ease
You need to achieve a relaxed natural pose from your subject and in order to do this , you should develop a rapport with them to put them at ease .
Also , remember that holding poses for any length of time can create tension in the body – always make a short break between different poses .

What is Environmental Portrait Photography ?
Put simply , environmental portrait photography is taking photographs of people in their natural environment .
That might mean shooting a welder in a garage , a dancer in a studio or a fisherman on a boat .
There are a lot of attractions for both the photographer and subject in environmental portraits .
For starters , because the subject is in familiar surroundings , it is generally a lot easier to get them relaxed and looking more natural .
As you can probably guess , when you take somebody into a photography studio , the first thing they do is tense up and become nervous as they are in an unfamiliar environment .
Environmental portrait photography solves that problem .
Secondly , in general terms , photographing somebody in their own space generally throws up the opportunity for far more interesting photographs .
Backgrounds are more interesting , colours are richer and points of secondary interest are easier to come by .
If you are going down the path of becoming a portrait photographer , then improving your game in environmental portraiture is certainly something you should be doing .
Here are some further resources on environmental portrait photography :

Portrait Photography Post - Production with Photoshop and Lightroom
Mastering portraiture is not just about getting the shot perfect in camera .
Just as important is the work we do in post production .
Given the perfect model in the perfect lighting set up , we would still need to work on the images in post - production in order to get the “ look ” that we require .
Tone and lighting will need to be worked on as well as details in the models face .
Even on the very best day our subjects may have blemishes , look a little pale or lacking sparkle to their eyes .
Whilst there is an argument for more natural shots , if your subject is also you client , they are going to want to look the very best they can .
In this section we will look at some simple edits you can make to improve the look of your portraits in both Lightroom and Photoshop .
The Basic Edits for Portraits
The first thing we need to do is carry out the basic edits to the image , primarily exposure and colour balance .
We wo n’t go into detail here as there are many general articles on how to do basic editing in Lightroom and Photoshop .
What you are looking to do is get the overall image looking right .
You start with exposure .
In Lightroom this would involve moving the black and white sliders until you are happy with contrast then adjusting highlights and shadows to suit .
You would then set a general white balance to ensure you have the skin tones correct .
In Photoshop you would do similar corrections .
We assume that you would be shooting in RAW as this gives you the best flexibility .
Adobe Camera RAW offers similar exposure and colour controls as Lightroom .
Once edited you can further fine tune the basic edits using Levels or Curves .
After basic exposure edits we will look at the two most important aspects of editing a portrait .
Smoothing the skin and boosting the eyes .
Skin Smoothing in Lightroom
Our aim in skin smoothing is not to make our subjects skin to look like the surface of a ballon but to eliminate pimples , spots and where required , wrinkles .
First we need to zoom into 1:1 or 1:2 in order to get in close to the blemishes .
Next , in the Develop module we will pull up the Spot Removal tool setting to Heal not Clone .
Set a suitable brush size then set the feather to 15 - 20 % .
This will smooth the edges of our spot removal .
Now click on the blemish that you wish to remove .
You will see a second circle appear .
This is the area from which the blemish will be covered .
Move this second circle around to find the best match for skin color and tone .
Click Done with happy .
EXTRA TIP :
In order to remove a wrinkle , we can set the Spot Removal tool as before but in this case click and drag along the wrinkle and match the surrounding skin .
Skin Smoothing in Photoshop CC
We use a similar principle in Photoshop but using the spot healing tool .
Select the Spot Healing Brush tool from the tool box and make sure that Content Aware is is selected at the top .
Again set a brush size suitable for the blemish you are going to remove .
Usually its best to make the brush about 10 - 20 % larger than the blemish .
Unlike Lightroom the Spot Healing does not require feathering .
Instead the Content Aware algorithm automatically works out the best match from the surrounding skin to cover the blemish perfectly .
As with Lightroom , we can use the same technique of click and dragging the Spot Healing Brush to cover over wrinkles .
Brightening Eyes in Lightroom
Like skin smoothing our aim in brightening eyes is to create a subtle improvement to the look .
In Lightroom we can do this using the Radial Filter .
Select this in the Develop Module then draw out a circle over the iris of the eye .
Use the click points to drag the circle into shape and position so that it covers the iris completely .
Leave feathering set to 50 and invert the filter so that we are working purely on the eye .
Now we can raise exposure a little to lighten the iris .
We can also change the colour of the iris slightly by using the Color Temperature slider .
Adding clarity will boost the contrast and detail whilst boosting saturation will give the iris make it stand out against the white of the eye .
We can also make the whites of the eyes , whiter .
To do this we will use the Adjustment Brush .
Select a suitable brush size , and make sure Auto Mask is checked at the bottom .
From the bottom left of the main screen check Show Selected Mask Overlay .
This will show our brushed area as red .
Now brush in the white areas of the eye .
You can now boost the exposure slightly to brighten the eye and also reduce color temperature to remove any yellowness from the eye .
Brightening Eyes in Photoshop
In Photoshop there is a very quick and easy technique to boost the brightness of the eyes .
As always , zoom in to the area you wish to work on .
Create a new levels adjustment layer from the menu : Layer - New Adjustment Layer - Levels .
Now adjust the highlights on the levels to bring the eye whites and iris up to a level that you are happy with .
You will notice the entire portrait has become lighter .
With the adjustment layer selected go to Image - Adjustments - Invert .
The overall image will return to the default exposure .
From the Toolbox select the Brush Tool and set Opacity and Flow to 100 % .
Set a suitable brush size and set hardness to 0 % .
From the bottom of the toolbar make sure foreground color is set to white .
Now gently paint over the whites of the eyes and you will see them brighten up to the levels you set .
If we wish to boost or change the colour of the iris we can use a similar technique .
Go to Layer - New Adjustment Layer - Color Balance .
With tone set to Midtones , adjust the color sliders until the eye is the color you desire .
Again the entire image will take on the same color .
Now go to Image - Adjustments - Invert and this time paint out the iris area using the brush tool .
EXTRA TIP : Eyes and skin are the two most important elements in any portrait .
The eyes are what will pull the viewer into the image whilst any blemishes in the skin will detract from those eyes .
Using the techniques above , you can simply and quickly edit your portraits to a professional standard in either Lightroom or Photoshop .
Tips for Awesome Self - Portrait Photography
Self - portrait photography has become really popular nowadays due to Instagram and other apps , but it ’s really important to make a distinction between ’’ selfies ’ ’ and self portraits .
These two are not interchangeable terms , nor do they measure up to the same level in photography .
Self portraits , unlike selfies , follow the same rules that apply to standard portraiture .
Most people , especially when starting out in photography , find self - portraits to be a nerve - wracking venture .
Sometimes it ’s hard to get in front of the camera when we ’re so accustomed to being behind it .
Using the following tips can help you take better self - portraits :
Choose Proper Gear
If you ’re interested in taking self - portraits that can measure up ( technically and artistically ) to other portraits you take , there are a few items you should invest in if you do n’t already have them .
Tripod
You do n’t have to worry about some company ’s flagship tripod – it ’s enough to have something that can support the weight of your camera without tipping over .
Remote A remote shutter release will probably be your greatest friend in your conquest of self - portraiture .
You can opt for a wired or wireless remote .
Tethering Connecting your camera to a monitor will allow you to get a real time view of what your self - portrait is going to look like and you can make tweaks to the composition without having to get up and run back to the camera .
This can save you a lot of time .
Be Introspective Every self - portrait you make is a quick glimpse inside your mind , not just a representation of what you look like .
When you ’re planning a portrait shoot for yourself , be sure to convey who you really are .
This means that you can include things you like or dislike , wear your favorite articles of clothing , show off one of your hobbies or talents .
Worry less about what you look like and focus on presenting yourself to the world in the way that you want everyone to see you .
You can also do something entirely different and create abstract self - portraits that depict your state of mind more than your looks .
Use Unique Compositions
Self - portraits give you the opportunity to disregard everything you ’ve learned about traditional composition and go crazy if you want to .
Your self - portrait does n’t even have to include your face , you can frame your shots around various sections of your body .
Additionally , you can alter your perspective by deviating from the standard eye - level shot — get a shot from up high and from down low .
Do n’t be afraid to experiment and take some risks when it comes to composing your self - portraits .
Enhance The Mood In Post - Processing Post - processing can help you achieve a certain type of atmosphere by means of various alterations in color , contrast , clarity and so on .
This will depend largely on the type of self - portrait you shoot , but since you ’ll want to perfect the image , you will push yourself to learn more and more every day .
Post - processing images of yourself is , on a psychological - level , quite different from processing images of other people .
When the person on the screen is you , you ’ll take extra measures to show the character features and atmosphere exactly in a way you envisioned them .
The Most Popular Portrait Photography Styles
Portrait photography can be broken down into various categories or styles .
As photographers , we should be able to understand these different styles and compose the photograph to portray what we wish to show to the viewer .
Some of the most popular styles of portrait photography are :
Classic Portraits
These are portraits that represent the subject and the face is given more importance in the portrait with the subject facing the camera most of the time .
These can be shot as headshots , head and shoulder shots , two thirds , three fourths shot or as a full shot .
Candid Portraits
This is where the subject may not be aware of the photographer , and the photographer captures the spontaneous and natural emotions of the subjects .
These type of portraits are done in streets , events , travel , weddings , etc. Posed Portraits
Here the subject poses for the photographer and the location , lighting , poses , other props and costumes are chosen for the shoot .
In general , these portraits are planned and shot and are the opposite of candid portraits .
Conceptual Portraits
These are portraits that illustrate an idea or a concept .
The photographer plans the message that they want to deliver through the image and shoots it by setting up the idea .
These type of portraits are generally open to interpretation by the viewer because everyone perceives the concepts presented differently .
Environmental Portraits
These portraits are taken in the environment where the subject lives and / or works .
These portrait photographs show the relationship between the subject and their environment and examples of this could be people in their working area like a construction worker , a chef , a butcher , fruit seller , fishermen , etc. Lifestyle Portraits
These are portraits that show the subjects ’ style of living .
These could be a combination of environmental and candid portraits as the images are shot in the area where the subjects live to show their lifestyle and are candid shots so the photographer can show through the photographs how the subjects live .
Travel Portraits
Travel portraits are portraits that document the culture , tradition , lifestyle and history of people living in a particular geographical area .
These photographs can span across different styles like lifestyle , environmental , posed or candid portraits .
Depending on what story the photographer wishes to deliver , these portraits are made either indoors or in the great outdoors and using natural light .
Glamour Portraits
These are portraits where professional models are used for the shoot and importance is given to the bodily features , but this genre can be quite difficult to define as each photographer may perceive and portray it as what glamour means to them .
These photographs are mostly used for commercial purposes and hence artificial lighting and retouching are used to create the finished portrait .
Besides the above , the general styles of portraits are , single , couple , family and group portraits that are taken to suit the individual subjects ’ needs .
There are also few other styles like abstract portraits which is an art form and not necessarily a representation of the individual subject .
These could be manipulated portraits that are used to deliver an idea or concept , just like conceptual portraits .
Newborn , baby photography and family photography
Newborn and baby photography
Newborn photography is popular and attractive for many reasons .
The subject is amazing , proud moms are glad to have you , and the cuteness factor is practically immeasurable .
There are two types of newborn photography – posed ( studio ) and lifestyle and they are a little bit different when it comes to equipment and other requirements .
Posed / studio sessions :
These sessions are typically done within the first 2 weeks of birth when the baby is very sleepy and fragile .
Studio sessions tend to be demanding because they usually include many props and accessories , such as bean bags , blankets , wraps , hats and headbands .
Such sessions can last up to 4 hours and editing can also take quite a bit of time .
Lifestyle sessions :
This kind of session offers a more casual and spontaneous approach to newborn photography .
Lifestyle sessions can be done with babies up to 6 weeks old and they typically last 1 or 2 hours .
These sessions focus on capturing emotions of love , wonder and amazement between the family members and the newborn .
No matter if you ’re shooting a posed or a lifestyle newborn session , the following five tips can help you achieve better photos :
Have a consistent shot sequence
In order to avoid chaos and those bad images of baby crying and looking terrified , you need to be well - prepared for your newborn session .
You should set up ( and perhaps decorate ) space for shots with parents and child and do those shots first .
Only if the baby is asleep and looking comfortable , you may proceed to taking close - up photos of the newborn ’s face , hands or feet .
Encourage the baby to sleep Newborns usually sleep a lot but taking them to a different environment can keep them awake or even anxious .
This means that mom should feed the baby at the studio , just before the photo shoot .
Another great thing you can do to get the baby sleepy is to download an app of soothing sounds .
Keep it safe Bear in mind that babies are extremely fragile and vulnerable !
Make sure to use the camera strap and place the camera around your neck , especially when standing over the baby .
Also , keep mom close by on the set at all times , because this will makes the baby feel more comfortable .
Photograph siblings too
If your clients have more than one child , they will most probably ask if they can add their other children into the photographs .
Be sure to have a plan for this and to discuss your policies in advance .
Many photographers have different types of ‘’ packages ’ ’ when it comes to newborn photography .
Offer in - studio clothing options
Before the photo shoot , you can give a few clothing suggestions to your clients .
For instance , they can skip the bright and bold colors and instead go with light neutrals .
However , it ’s even better if you already have some baby clothing in your studio , so that your clients can switch between their own ideas and your suggestions .
Family photography
Family portraits matter a lot because they are treasured memories !
While family portraiture can be an incredibly rewarding area of photography , it can be a little daunting as well , especially for new photographers .
The following 4 tips can help you take great family portraits that even the most demanding clients will be satisfied with :
Key party leaders are worried that the GOP has made a costly mistake .
Steele trap ?
GOP fears grow
A month after Michael Steele became the first African - American chairman of the Republican National Committee , key party leaders are worried that the GOP has made a costly mistake — one that will make it even harder for them to take back power from the dominant Democratic Party .
Steadily becoming a dependable punch line , Steele has brushed back Rush Limbaugh , threatened moderate Republican senators , offered the “ friggin ’ awesome ” Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal some “ slum love , ” called civil unions “ crazy ” and promised more outreach to “ urban - suburban hip - hop settings ” via an “ off the hook ” public relations campaign .

He even threw a shout - out to “ one - armed midgets . ”
That ’s in just 30 days on the job — and that ’s just the PR part .
On the organizational side , Steele does not have a chief of staff , a political director , a finance director or a communications director .
Last week , one of the two men sharing the job of interim finance director was forced to resign .
For now , “ the fourth floor , ” as the RNC ’s executive suite is known , is being run by a pair of consultants .
“ There ’s frustration that there ’s no discipline , no planning , ” said a well - known Republican consultant .
“ He ’s risking being overexposed by accepting every interview , which makes gaffes more likely . ”
In a lengthy interview , Steele was unapologetic , referring to the high - level GOP critics and skeptics as “ nervous Nellies ” and saying that he actually has been tempering his public remarks .
“ If I told folks what I really thought , I ’d probably be in a lot more trouble , ” he said .
“ I think that ’s what I bring to this job , as a voice of the party : I think it ’s important to have that kind of newness and rawness to it that grabs folks ’ attention and hopefully ... take a look at what we ’re doing . ”
Steele said he would make the “ hip - hop ” comment again — and that when he told The Washington Times that the GOP needed to “ uptick our image with everyone , including one - armed midgets , ” it was a repetition of a question from the reporter .
Doug Heye , a Republican consultant who has worked for Steele , said the chairman uses “ common - sense , frank language ” that connects with an array of audiences .
“ He is unwilling to sugarcoat issues , ” Heye said .
Steele , who has been traveling aggressively since taking the job , says the vacancies at the top of his organization are by design .
He said he ’s re-examining the whole structure with an eye to streamlining it and will have most of his team in place by the end of March , after he begins implementing reports from transition teams that are planning the party ’s own first 100 days .
“ I know some folks in Washington feel that they ’re kind of on the outside of this — that they do n’t have the day - to - day blow by blow of what I ’m doing , ” he said .
“ And that ’s exactly how I like it .
I want to be about the business of putting in place a good infrastructure that will enable me to go out and build a better brand , stronger brand , for the GOP .
And I wo n’t get there by tattle - telling every day what I ’m doing . ”
Jim Dyke , a communications consultant to Steele , said : “ The public process has raised some eyebrows , and that has some people concerned .
But the internal process is actually unprecedented and right on schedule .
And when people find out about it , they are going to be very pleased . "
A 50 - year - old lawyer who likes to call himself a Lincoln Republican , Steele was lieutenant governor of Maryland from 2003 to 2007 , the first African - American elected to statewide office in the heavily Democratic state .
After leaving office , he became a Fox News contributor , and became chairman of GOPAC .
Born at Andrews Air Force Base , Steele attended a Catholic high school in Washington and graduated from Johns Hopkins , then spent three years in seminary preparing for the priesthood before switching to Georgetown Law .
At the urging of top Republicans , he ran for U.S. Senate race in Maryland in 2006 , garnering a respectable 44 percent of the vote .
During this winter 's nasty , tight contest for chairman , Steele promised that , if elected , he would be able to say to the party and to America : “ And now , for something completely different . ”
But this kind of “ different ” is making some party leaders extremely nervous .
“ I ’m worried that we need someone to manage the chairman , ” said one frustrated Republican National Committee member .
Other party leaders have voiced similar concerns in private conversations , but they ’re wary of taking on the chairman so early in his tenure .
In an embarrassing soap opera that unfolded this week , Steele took the bait from Democrats who were trying to make Limbaugh the face of the Republican Party .
Steele first seemed to criticize the radio host in comments aired Saturday night on CNN , referring to him as an " entertainer " and " incendiary . "
But when Limbaugh roared back about the “ sad - sack ” state of the party and said that Steele was “ off to a shaky start , ” Steele backpedaled , telling Politico he had been “ inarticulate ” and saying he had not been trying to undermine Limbaugh .
Steele offered an implicit apology during a phone conversation with Limbaugh Monday night and said afterward through a spokesman , “ We had a nice conversation .
...
We are all good . ”
That emboldened the opposition , with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine , the Virginia governor , calling the apology proof that Limbaugh is " he who must be obeyed " in the GOP .
Mark Hillman , a national committee member from Colorado who supported former Ohio secretary of state Ken Blackwell rather than Steele on the first ballot in the RNC chairman 's race , called Steele ’s Limbaugh comments “ a misstep ” and added : “ Probably the best advice for him in that regard is to get the lay of the land first .
...
The chairman does n’t have to pontificate on every issue that comes along . ”
In another incident that drew unwanted scrutiny to the chairman , Steele was asked by Fox News host Neil Cavuto if he would consider supporting primary challengers against the three Republican senators who voted in favor of President Obama ’s stimulus package , Steele seemed to threaten moderate Republican Sens.
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , Olympia Snowe of Maine and Susan Collins of Maine by responding : “ Oh , yes , I ’m always open to everything , baby , absolutely . ”
Snowe , who is not facing reelection in 2010 , told Roll Call that she approached Steele to ask : “ You did n’t really mean that , did you ? ”
Back at headquarters , Dyke said the transition teams are reviewing all the party 's big functions -- communications , political , administration , technology , strategy .
“ Their task has been to look at every line item in the budget , every organizational chart , every position , and recommend a structure and a mode of operating that reflects the necessary change to meet a new campaign environment and a minority status without control of the White House , House or Senate , ” he said .
“ People on the outside have n’t seen it done this way before , ” Dyke added .
“ The unknown is fearful .
...
It is not smoke and mirrors .
At the end of this process , we ’ll have a much more effective , more targeted , more focused , more efficient party . ”
Steele has begun his makeover of the bureaucracy , moving the “ coalitions ” operation — which helps mobilize interest groups such as small businesses , farmers and Hispanics — out of the political department and turning it into a department of its own .
The RNC ’s Member Relations department is now the Member Services department , Steele said , “ because I want to orient the thinking for those who work in that department that they ’re in the business of providing service to the members of the RNC — our state party leadership around the country . ”
Steele said he plans to build out GOP TV , the party ’s sophisticated basement television studio , which he said “ has really been kind of rather dormant over the past few years . ”
Steele said his formula for leading the party out of the wilderness is “ establishing our core conservative values on the economy , on the environment — on those issues that are touching people ’s lives . ”
Asked how he would win back swing voters with a frankly conservative message , Steele replied : “ How did Reagan do it ?
How did Obama do it the other way ?
You ’ve got to say what you stand for and then make it very clear to people that when it comes to those things that matter to them , what you stand for works for them . ”
And Steele had one last broadside for his critics : “ People who make judgments about something before it ’s completed generally do n’t know what they ’re talking about . ”

A few weeks ago we introduced Torrent Droid , an application for Android - based phones that allows users to take a photo of a barcode and lookup torrents for the associated product .
While Torrent Droid is still being developed , a similar app is now on the market and available for download .
The idea behind BarTor is simple but brilliant .
The application allows a user to scan the barcodes of products they come across , and use these to search for torrents that match the product .
If a corresponding torrent is found , it can be directly and remotely added to uTorrent or Vuze through the BitTorrent client ’s web interface .
BarTor uses the web interface of the BitTorrent client running on your computer , and it even supports multiple clients for people who have more than one BitTorrent client they need to send torrents to .
The torrents start downloading right away and when you arrive at home , the music , movie or software will be done downloading and ready to use .
It ca n’t get much easier .
BarTor ’s functionality is very similar to the Torrent Droid app we reported on before , but BarTor is the first to become available to the public .
The only downside is that the app is not available for free .
It ’s currently being sold in the Android Market for $ 2.99 .
Just like with most iPhone apps , however , it probably wont take long before it appears on BitTorrent sites itself .
Justin , the developer of the application told TorrentFreak that he is well aware of this threat to his business model and understands that his target audience is likely to pirate the application itself .
“ I am sure it will happen and although i’d like it not to , there is n’t a whole lot I can do about it .
I feel that there are a lot of people out there who will be willing to pay the nominal fee for this app , ” he told us .
For people who prefer to buy the product instead , BarTor also works with Google Base ’s product search .
For every search it will return a list of retailers that sell the product , including the location and the price .
Not free , but you might still save a few bucks .
‘ clinton park ’ by ten arquitectos image courtesy ten arquitectos
located at the western edge of midtown manhattan , is the clinton park mixed - use development designed by ten arquitectos .
it will occupy more than half of a city block with 1.3 million square feet of commercial and residential programs .
the project fills a void in the urban fabric by integrating multiple commercial uses at the base and providing needed housing in the 27 floors above .
the base building will include a 50,000 square - foot auto showroom fronting 11th avenue with 250,000 square feet of service floors below grade , a 30,000 square - foot horse stable for the nypd mounted police , a 7,500 square - foot neighborhood market , a 30,000 square - foot health club , and 200 parking spaces .
the residential form sitting atop this plinth creates more than 900 apartment units , including 20 percent inclusionary housing .
the overall massing of the project slopes up and away from clinton park , starting at 96 feet along 11th avenue and climbing up to 348 feet at the middle of the block ; this height transition negotiates two very dissimilar urban scales : the flat , horizontal one of the park located to the west of 11th avenue and the vertical , windowless structure of the telephone switching tower to the east of the site .
securing light and air for a great majority of apartment units , the double loaded corridor shifts diagonally across the site in a unique orientation to the manhattan grid , reducing the building ’s mass adjacent to the neighboring buildings .

each floor steps up from the one below , allowing for unobstructed views to the park and hudson river and providing private roof terraces with green roofs on every floor .
the building ’s mirrored structure introduces the creation of two garden terraces , a green feature among the city ’s urban grid .
the gardens and the green roofs on each floor introduce a refreshing sense of proximity to nature into the otherwise massive structure .
‘ clinton park ’ by ten arquitectos image courtesy ten arquitectosa varied treatment of street walls and interior facades creates a solid exterior with smaller openings along the street edges of the building , while lighter facades skin the building where the form pulls away from the street .
this language of interior and exterior makes reference to the historic court spaces of new york city housing .

The problem is not that House Republicans gave the stimulus bill zero votes last week .
That ’s transitory political symbolism , and it had no effect on the outcome .
Some of the naysayers will vote for the revised final bill anyway ( and claim , Kerry - style , that they were against it before they were for it ) .
The more disturbing problem is that the party has zero leaders and zero ideas .
It is as AWOL in this disaster as the Bush administration was during Katrina .
If the country was n’t suffering , the Republicans ’ behavior would be a laugh riot .
The House minority leader , John Boehner , from the economic wasteland of Ohio , declared on “ Meet the Press ” last Sunday that the G.O.P. did n’t want to be “ the party of ‘ No ’ ” but “ the party of better ideas , better solutions . ”
And what are those ideas , exactly ?
He said he ’ll get back to us “ over the coming months . ”
His deputy , the Virginia congressman Eric Cantor , has followed the same script , claiming that the G.O.P. will not be “ the party of ‘ No ’ ” but will someday offer unspecified “ solutions and alternatives . ”
Not to be left out , the party ’s great white hope , Sarah Palin , unveiled a new political action committee last week with a Web site also promising “ fresh ideas . ”
But as the liberal blogger Markos Moulitsas Zúniga observed , the site invites visitors to make donations and read Palin hagiography while offering no links to any ideas , fresh or otherwise .
For its own contribution to this intellectual void , the Republican National Committee convened last week under a new banner , “ Republican for a Reason . ”
Perhaps that unidentified reason will be determined by a panel of judges on a TV reality show .
It had better be brilliant given that only five states ( with 20 total electoral votes ) now lean red in party affiliation , according to Gallup .
At this rate the G.O.P. will be in Alf Landon territory by 2012 .
The Republicans do have one idea , of course , but it ’s hardly fresh : more and bigger tax cuts , particularly for business and the well - off .
That ’s the sum of their “ alternative ” stimulus plan .
Obama has tried to accommodate this panacea , perhaps to a fault .
Mainstream economists in both parties believe that tax cuts in the stimulus package will deliver far less bang for the buck than , say , infrastructure spending .
The tax - cut stimulus embraced a year ago by the G.O.P. induced next - to - no consumer spending as Americans merely banked the savings or paid down debt .

We also now know conclusively that the larger Bush tax cuts , besides running up record deficits and exacerbating income inequality , were also at best a placebo on our road to ruin .
In a January survey of economists , including former McCain advisers like Douglas Holtz - Eakin and Mark Zandi , The Washington Post determined that the job growth the Bush administration kept bragging about ( “ 52 straight months ! ” ) was a mirage inflated by the housing bubble .
Job growth  about 2 percent  was in fact the most tepid of any eight - year period “ since data collection began seven decades ago . ”
Gross domestic product grew at a slower pace than in any eight years since the Truman administration .
The five detainees at Guantánamo Bay charged with planning the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks have filed a document with the military commission at the United States naval base there expressing pride at their accomplishment and accepting full responsibility for the killing of nearly 3,000 people .
The document , which may be released publicly on Tuesday , uses the Arabic term for a consultative assembly in describing the five men as the “ 9/11 Shura Council , ” and it says their actions were an offering to God , according to excerpts of the document that were read to a reporter by a government official who was not authorized to discuss it publicly .
The document is titled “ The Islamic Response to the Government ’s Nine Accusations , ” the military judge at the Guantánamo Bay detention camp said in a separate filing , obtained by The New York Times , that describes the detainees ’ document .
The document was filed on behalf of the five men , including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , who has described himself as the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks .

The assault on Gaza marks the end of an era for Israel .
For the second time in two years its colonial ambition has floundered in the face of determined resistance .
It may persist for some time ; but the trajectory is clear – it is losing both legitimacy and power .
Support for it is dwindling in Washington ; its friends are alarmed .
Citizens are acting where governments have failed ; the movement for boycott , divestment and sanctions is snowballing .
Apologists are finding it more difficult to justify its persistent criminality .
Rifts have emerged in the transatlantic alliance over its recent actions ; EU leaders have broken with Israel and the US , questioning the wisdom of continuing to isolate Hamas .
Even the pliant Tony Blair will no longer toe the line .
This leviathan may yet be tamed , accountability restored ; but what part , if any , will International law have played in this ?
At one point in Errol Morris ’s 2004 documentary Fog of War , former US Secretary of Defence Robert McNamara recounts a conversation he had had with General Curtis Lemay of the USAF apropos the fire bombing of Japanese cities .
LeMay , according to McNamara , said that if the US ended up losing the war “ we would be hanged for this ” .
As it transpired , the US did not lose ; and far from being hanged , the allied command got to play hangman .
1
The trials that led to the execution of German and Japanese high command assumed a broader significance ; they became the founding documents of international law .
The conclusions from these trials served as the basis for the Genocide Convention ( 1948 ) , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( 1948 ) , the Nuremberg Principles ( 1950 ) , The Convention on the Abolition of the Statute of Limitations on War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity ( 1968 ) , the Geneva Convention on the Laws and Customs of War ( 1949 ) , its supplementary protocols ( 1977 ) , and the International Criminal Court ( 2002 ) .
As Kirsten Sellars details in her book The Rise and Rise of Human Rights , the Nuremberg trials and the subsequent Tokyo trials which would later provide the basis for international law were not themselves free of controversy .
At the end of the war , Western powers saw Germany and Japan as potential allies in the looming conflict against the Soviet Union .
However , the passions that had been mobilized against the Axis powers demanded blood sacrifice before Japan and Germany could be laundered back into the Free World .
It was to satisfy this purpose that the tribunals were reluctantly instituted .
While Justice Robert Jackson ’s eloquent pronouncements on the rule of law in international affairs have become de rigueur in discourses on the subject , his contemporaries took a less generous view .
US chief justice Harlan Stone called the whole Nuremberg exercise a “ sanctimonious … fraud ” accusing Jackson of conducting a “ high - grade lynching party ” .
Justice William Douglas of the US Supreme Court accused the allies of “ substituting power for principle ” and creating laws “ ex post facto to suit the passion and clamour of the time ” .
In his famous dissent at the Tokyo trials , Indian Justice Radhabinod Pal indicted the tribunal for its exclusion of European colonialism and the American use of the atomic bomb .
The trial , he argued , was nothing more than an “ opportunity for the victors to retaliate ” .
Antiwar US senator Robert Taft called it “ victors ’ justice ” .
Power asymmetry has defined the application of International Law since .
Gaza is a case in point .
Jus ad Bellum
Israel and its apologists have sought to justify its military assault on Gaza as an act of “ self - defence ” against Hamas rockets invoking Article 51 of the United Nations Charter .
2
So pervasive was this view that even putatively antiwar voices frequently worked the word “ disproportionate ” into their denunciations .
Israel , according to this view , has a right to defend itself but used more force than was necessary .
However , this argument relies on the inversion of cause and effect and a defective legal premise .
Israel ’s assault was not meant to protect its citizens against the Hamas rockets , it was to protect its colonial project and the right to continue the strangulation of Gaza .
Israel broke the truce on 4th November 2008 when under the cover of the US elections it launched an attack inside Gaza killing six Palestinians .
The attack , writes Middle East scholar Sara Roy , was “ no doubt designed finally to undermine the truce ” , 3 as even according to Israel ’s own intelligence agencies Hamas had implemented the ceasefire with remarkable effectiveness .
Though Hamas retaliated with rockets , it still offered to renew the truce provided Israel ended the siege .
Israel refused .4
Between the evacuation of its settlements from Gaza in 2005 and the beginning of its latest assault , Israel had killed a total of 1,250 Palestinians , including 222 children , and maimed many more .
This despite Hamas ’s 18 month unilateral ceasefire to which it strictly adhered .
The situation was so dismal before the siege that the late Israeli historian and author Tanya Reinhart described it as “ a process of slow and steady genocide ” .
5 Sara Roy saw in it a deliberate process of what she calls “ de- development ” .
The siege , in her view , had two objectives : to reduce the Palestinian issue to a humanitarian problem ; and to “ foist Gaza onto Egypt ” .
Israel ’s economic stranglehold over the territory , she said , was leading to the “ breakdown of an entire society ” .
6
The UN human rights rapporteur John Dugard , a South African legal scholar , has compared the situation in the Occupied Territories to Apartheid .
His successor Richard Falk , an American Jew and a leading authority on International law , called the situation a “ prelude to genocide ” .
Gaza , he said , was “ slouching towards a holocaust ” insofar as the situation expressed vividly “ a deliberate intention on the part of Israel and its allies to subject an entire human community to life - endangering conditions of utmost cruelty ” .
Falk accused Israel of bringing Gaza to the “ brink of collective starvation ” , imposing “ a sub- human existence ” on a people “ repeatedly and systematically ” victimized .
Poignantly , he added :
To persist with such an approach under present circumstances is indeed genocidal , and risks destroying an entire Palestinian community that is an integral part of an ethnic whole .
It is this prospect that makes appropriate the warning of a Palestinian holocaust in the making , and should remind the world of the famous post - Nazi pledge of ‘ never again ’.7
On 5th November , Israel sealed all entries and exits to Gaza and intensified the stranglehold .
For Gaza – a region whose unemployment rate is 49.1 percent , where the majority relies on food aid ( from the World Food Program and UNRWA , the latter alone feeding about 750,000 Gazans ) , and 50 percent of whose population comprises children – the consequences were devastating .
Roy reports that according to Oxfam , an average of 4.6 trucks per day entered Gaza in November 2008 as compared to 564 trucks a day in December 2005 .
There were three days where 20,000 went without food and on 18 December UNRWA had to suspend food distribution altogether .
On top of that , the WFP had to pay more than $ 300,000 to Israeli businesses in November and December for storage of the food being withheld from Gaza .
Thirty out of Gaza ’s forty - seven commercial bakeries had to close for the lack of cooking gas ; by April there will be no poultry on which 70 per cent of Gazans rely for their protein .
UNRWA ’s cash assistance to the most needy had to be suspended .
The embargo on paper , ink and glue needed for the production of textbooks would affect 200,000 students .
8
Gaza faces regular shortages of diesel , petrol and cooking gas .
On 13th November , Gaza ’s only power station suspended operations because it ran out of industrial diesel .
Spare parts for the power station were auctioned by Israel after being held in customs for eight months .
Gaza ’s hospitals have had to rely on diesel and gas smuggled from Egypt via the tunnels .
In an attempt to undermine Hamas , Israel ’s surrogates in the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) withheld World Bank funds from Gaza ’s Coastal Municipalities Water Utility ( CMWU ) to pay for fuel to run Gaza ’s sewage system .
Israel has allowed in only 18 of the 200 tons of chlorine requested by CMWU for water purification .
While medical supplies in Gaza have been running dangerously low , the collaborationist PA has been turning supply shipments away rather then send them to Gaza.9
It was within this context that on 19th December Hamas officially ended its truce .
All of this is significant , as in ’ 67 Israel used Nasser ’s blockade of the Gulf of Tiran as the casus belli for its pre-emptive attacks on Egypt , Syria and Jordan – the fateful war where it captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
Unlike Gaza , however , Israel faced no shortages of food , fuel or medicine – indeed , trade continued unimpeded all across its main air - and sea ports ( all of which are located on the Mediterranean coast ) .
Yet , in spite of the facts , ’ 67 has entered mainstream discourse as a legitimate case of pre-emptive self - defence under Article 51 of the Geneva Conventions .
The precedent was even invoked by Colin Powell when on February 5 , 2003 he made his case for invading Iraq at the UN Security Council .
If Israel was within its rights to launch a pre-emptive war in ‘ 67 – a highly tendentious proposition – then the Palestinians most definitely had a similar right .
It is not only enshrined in the Fourth Geneva Convention , it is also accorded them by virtue of Israel ’s denial of basic necessities .
But what of International law ?
The use of force is an act of last resort under international law subject to the customary rules of proportionality and necessity .
As a signatory to the Geneva Conventions , Israel has a right to defend itself against attacks ; but it has no right to do so by force .
In order to use force , it will have to show that other options were not available .
This was clearly not the case .
It had the option to end its occupation , withdraw from Palestinian land , and accept the international consensus on the two - state solution .
It also had more immediate options : it could have agreed to renew the truce and end the crippling siege of Gaza .
The Hamas government had made three separate peace offers over a period of two years through veteran Israeli peace activist Gershon Baskin , including one a mere two weeks before the assault .
Relayed through a family member of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert all of these overtures were rebuffed .
10
In spurning this opportunity Israel had forfeited any claims to self - defence .
Had Hamas attacked after Israel had tried all these options , writes political scientist Jerome Slater , “ then–and only then –would it have a true ‘ right of self defense ’ ” .
It is also the only condition under which the question of proportionality would arise .
The rocket attacks had not killed a single individual before Israel began its assault ; had they done so , they would still not entitle Israel to kill 1,300 Palestinians , mostly civilians , injure 5,000 and destroy schools , mosques , homes , UN compounds and government buildings .
As the occupying power Israel has no rights under the Fourth Geneva Convention , it has only obligations – including a responsibility to protect Palestinian civilians and infrastructure .
And as the occupied the Palestinians have a right to resist Israel ’s oppression .
Writes Slater : “ An oppressor is not engaged in ‘ self defense ’ when it uses force in order to annihilate resistance to its repression , and that holds true even if the form of resistance–attacks intended to kill civilians–is itself morally wrong ” .
The fact is lost on no one , except perhaps the BBC and CNN , that Israel ’s occupation predates both the rockets and Hamas .
“ Israel ’s actions amount to aggression , not self - defence , ” wrote distinguished lawyers and legal scholars in an 11th January 2009 letter to the Sunday Times , “ not least because its assault on Gaza was unnecessary ” .
They added :
As things stand , its invasion and bombardment of Gaza amounts to collective punishment of Gaza ’s 1.5 m inhabitants contrary to international humanitarian and human rights law .
In addition , the blockade of humanitarian relief , the destruction of civilian infrastructure , and preventing access to basic necessities such as food and fuel , are prima facie war crimes .
That the Palestinians also have a right to self - defence is not an issue the UN Security Council would even allow anyone to raise .
Instead , there are feeble pleas for ‘ restraint ’ .
In lieu of an investigation , in the initial phase of the massacre some UN officials dignified the Israeli claim that a mere 25 percent of the Palestinian casualties were civilians ( in fact the majority were police trainees killed at their graduation ) .
The notoriously undemocratic executive arm of the UN continued to treat the assault as a ‘ war ’ , even though Gaza is recognized as an Occupied Territory , according Israel the right to ‘ defend itself ’ itself , albeit ‘ proportionately ’ .
In reserving their condemnation exclusively for the targeting of ‘ women and children ’ , the UN was also declaring Gaza ’s male population fair game .
Despite the verdict of international law experts that Israel ’s murder spree in Gaza constitutes war crimes and crimes against humanity , writes Omar Barghouti ,
this UN discourse not only reduces close to half a million Palestinian men in that wretched , tormented and occupied coastal strip to “ militants , ” radical “ fighters , ” or whatever other nouns in currency nowadays in the astoundingly , but characteristically , biased western media coverage … it also treats them as already condemned criminals that deserve the capital punishment Israel has meted out on them .
( The Electronic Intifada , 1 January 2009 )
Jus in Bello
Israel made no bones about its attacks on civilian targets : one army spokeswoman declared that “ [ a ] nything affiliated with Hamas is a legitimate target ” ; another added that “ we are trying to hit the whole spectrum , because everything is connected and everything supports terrorism against Israel ” .
The government which had only a year earlier rejected the results of an election which had seen Hamas take the majority of the vote , was suddenly willing to acknowledge the party ’s popularity so it could hold it against the whole population of Gaza as evidence of their support for “ terrorism against Israel ” .
11
As the democratically elected government of the Palestinian people all of Gaza ’s civilian infrastructure was thus “ affiliated ” with Hamas and hence a legitimate target .
In the very first hour of its assault Israel bombed the Palestinian Legislative Council , the Ministries of Education and Justice , the Islamic University of Gaza , mosques , ambulances and many homes .
Palesitinian civilian infrastructure was subjected as a whole to Israeli terror .
By the end , Israel had destroyed 4,700 homes completely or partially , leaving tens of thousands of people homeless .
Sara Roy implored the world in the name of International law – and “ human decency ” – to protect the people of Gaza .
Perhaps the appeal to human decency is a tacit acknowledgment of the irrelevance of international law where it does n’t align with the interests of major powers .
As Conor Gearty notes , the assault on Gaza “ has laid bare the relative impotence of international law in the face of determined sovereign action ” .
12 Like Roy and Gearty , Falk also places little faith in International law for redress .
It would be unrealistic , he writes , “ to expect the UN to do anything in the face of this crisis , given the pattern of US support for Israel and taking into account the extent to which European governments have lent their weight to recent illicit efforts to crush Hamas as a Palestinian political force ” .
13
The impotence of the mechanisms for enforcing International law was exposed in Israel ’s refusal to heed the UN ’s calls for a ceasefire .
Israel blithely ignored the UN Security Council ’s call on 8th January 2009 for “ an immediate , durable and fully respected ceasefire ” .
Likewise , it ignored the strong statement by High Commissioner for Human Rights , Navi Pillay , the next day about the applicability of international human rights law “ in all circumstances and at all times ” .
Pillay stressed that the violations of these laws “ may constitute war crimes for which individual criminal responsibility may be invoked ” .
She urged the UN ’s Human Rights Council to “ consider authorizing a mission to assess violations ” in order to establish “ the relevant facts and ensure accountability ” .
The Council in its resolution said that it “ strongly condemns the ongoing military operation ” for its “ massive violations of human rights of Palestinian people and systematic destruction of the Palestinian infrastructure ” ; it was particularly outraged at the Israel ’s “ targeting ” of UN facilities .
At the conclusion of the assault , Ban Ki Moon , the UN Secretary General himself , visited Gaza .
He said he was “ appalled ” by the destruction , which he found “ outrageous and totally unacceptable ” and called for the perpetrators to be “ punished ” .
14 The UN has called for the attack to be investigated as a war crime .
Writes Gearty :
The anger evident in all this UN activity , and in particular the passion evident in the High Commissioner ’s choice of words , is founded upon the blatancy of the disregard of the law that has been evident in Gaza .
( The Tablet , January 2009 )
In a highly unusual move , the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) broke with convention to condemn the Israeli military for breaching international humanitarian law when it refused access for four days to a Zeitoun neighbourhood where four small children were later found starving among twelve corpses , including those of their mothers .
The incident also occasioned one of the most extraordinary moments in the history of British journalism when Alex Thomson of Channel 4 subjected the Israeli spokesperson Mark Regev to an unrelenting interrogation ending with the plea , “ In the name of humanity what is Israel doing ?
” 15
While Israel may have taken a hit in terms of its image – already the worst brand in the world , according to a 2006 poll16 – a wave of boycotts sweeping Europe also adds economic pressure .
“ But in the absence of any kind of enforcement mechanism , ” writes Gearty , “ the legal effect of all this international noise has been for all practical purposes zero ” .
Absent an international adjudicative body to which Israel is required to defer , he writes , the worse Israel has to fear is five minutes of interrogation on the media , which is itself a rare occurrence .
Israel ’s claim to self - defence “ might not be able to survive a few hours in a court of law ” , Gearty avers , but with a mostly pliant media already humming with a chorus of friendly ‘ academic terrorism experts ’ and ‘ defence analysts ’
Israel is all but immune from accountability .
17
It was Israel ’s ’ 67 pre-emptive attacks on neighbouring Arab states and Reagan ’s March 1986 bombing of Libya – both invoking Article 51 of the UN charter – that demonstrated that unilateral action was possible without eliciting any legal repercussions .
The US refusal to join the International Criminal Court , and Israel ’s repeated rejection of its jurisdiction , is transforming the whole concept of international law is revealed so far to be a farce .
The only people brought to trial in the Hague have all belonged to countries either on the short end of the unipolar world ’s stick , or to countries in which major powers have no vested interests .
The irony of the US supporting the ICC ’s prosecution of Sudanese president Omar al - Bashir while itself refusing to ratify its charter is lost on few in the outside world .
Under these circumstances , warnings about criminal responsibility are seen as little more than empty threats .
International law has hitherto served no purpose other than to lull the aggrieved into believing that verbal indictments are somehow a substitute for justice .
The End of Impunity ?
Concerns about prosecutions at the Hague led the Bush administration to repeal the US signature from the treaty enabling the ICC and in 2002 to pass the American Service Members Protection Act ( ASMPA ) , more commonly known as the Invasion of The Hague Act which permits the United States to unilaterally invade the Netherlands to liberate any military personnel and other elected and appointed officials held for war crimes .
The US also pressured weaker states around the world to sign ‘ bilateral immunity ’ policies that require them to sign a waiver stating that they will contravene the ICC in the case of Americans being arrested .
Those who do not comply risk losing US military assistance : Kenya and Trinidad - Tobago , for example , learned this the hard way .
According to the Observer , ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno - Ocampo is already pursuing seriously the legal instruments that would allow him to put Israelis on trial for war crimes .
18 Fear of prosecution has already caused the Israeli government to launch an international campaign to defend its legal position while and at the same time redacting names written reports and masking photographs of military personnel involved .
Director of the Israel Law Center , Nitsana Darshan - Leitner , has opted for bluster , urging the Knesset to legislate a law prohibiting cooperation with any war crimes tribunal and to pass an ASMPA - style Invasion of the Hague law .
“ Foreign countries should be made to understand we mean business ” , she added .
Obstacles remain , however , and precedents of the actual implementation of international law demand one to attenuate expectations .
It is this recognition that has led some to consider using the universal jurisdiction laws enshrined in the legal codes of several European countries to bring US and Israeli war criminals to the dock .
Several Israelis have already had close brushes with the law in Europe .
In 2001 prosecutors in Belgium filed a war crimes indictment against Ariel Sharon and Gen Amos Yaron for their responsibility in the massacre of Palestinians in Lebanon .
The case was later dismissed by an appeals court on a technicality .
On 10th September 2005 , Israeli general Doron Almog escaped arrest on arrival in London only through a last minute warning from someone at the foreign office ( one senior foreign office official Kim Howells is a former chairman of the Israel Lobby organization Labour Friends of Israel ) .
Had he disembarked , he would have faced arrest for violations of the Geneva Convention in carrying out house demolitions in Gaza .
Using the same laws that led to the 1998 arrest of the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet , Spanish judge Fernando Andreu has launched an investigation of Israeli officials over a 2002 bombing where a one - ton bomb dropped on a densely populated Gaza neighbourhood had killed fifteen , including nine children .
Those charged include former defense minister , Binyamin Ben-Eliezer ; former chief - of - staff , Moshe Ya’alon ; former airforce chief , Dan Halutz ; head of Southern command , Doron Almog ; head of National Security Council , Giora Eiland ; the defense minister ’s military secretary , Mike Herzog ; and head of Shin Bet , Avi Dichter .
The Israel lobby flexed its muscle , and foreign minister Tzipi Livni was soon claiming that she had been assured by her Spanish counterpart , Miguel Moratinos , that his government would amend its laws to diminish the possibility of investigating torture and war crimes committed outside Spain .
This however was immediately contradicted by Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega who stated defiantly that “ Spain is a country ruled by law ” whose justice system enjoys “ absolute independence ” ; this fact was “ made clear to Israel and we are sure they understand this ” .
19
The ground is also shrinking around leading US war criminals .
Henry Kissinger already can’t set foot in many European countries without risking arrest .
Rumsfeld likewise had to be spirited out of Paris a few years back in order to save him the embarrassment of being served a French subpoena .
Recently the renowned prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi has shown how criminal law can be used to prosecute George W. Bush for murder in any of the districts where a soldier has been killed as a result of a war sold on lies .
20 Until international law evolves a mechanism for enforcement that does not allow any state exemption from its purview , the potential of domestic laws to keep war criminals on their toes if not behind bars will remain indispensable .
In the wake of the 11th September 2001 attacks , Cheney and the cabal of neoconservatives around him had gone about dismantling the international legal framework which had been developed across several presidencies as a result of a growing preference for hegemony by consent rather than coercion .
Given the extreme unpopularity of the last regime , Obama feels compelled pragmatically to distance himself from its legacy .
The appointments of George Mitchell as Middle East envoy and Charles Freeman as the director of the National Intelligence Council have already occasioned tension between the Obama administration and the Israel lobby .
The growing unease over the ascension of Benjamin Netanyahu and Avigdor Lieberman to power in Israel is only likely to exacerbate matters .
Gestures towards Syria and Iran have caused alarm among Israel - firsters in Washington .
While many rightly criticized Obama for his silence in the face of the Israeli slaughter , the standard reflex of a US politician would have been to come out unconditionally in support of the attacks .
In a remarkable departure from her earlier stance where she opposed the impeachment of Bush administration officials , the house majority leader , Nancy Pelosi , has recently declared that “ no one is above the law ” .21 Maybe she only wants to one - up Senator Patrick Leahy who has proposed a Truth and Reconciliation Commission .
But for the first time talk of prosecutions has entered mainstream discourse .
What was dismissed as unthinkable only months ago appears now almost attainable .
Since Pelosi controls the assignment of hearings to relevant committees in the Congress , writes the veteran journalist Alexander Cockburn ,
this means that she could give the green light to House Justice Committee chairman John Conyers to organize hearings .
Equipped with a capable director and subpoena power – that is , the ability to compel testimony and documents under the threat of criminal sanction .
22
Pelosi may or may not be serious but for the left there is a rich opportunity in all this , writes Cockburn .
“ Obama ’s pledges in the campaign to run a lawful government were very explicit ” .
He clearly seeks a break with the image if not necessarily the policies of the Bush administration .
The closing of Guantanamo and the categorical ban on torture is part of this new trajectory ( even though unlawful detention and subcontracted torture would likely continue ) .
This attempt to re-engage with the world will not be effective until Obama affirms US commitment to international law , including a resigning of the ICC charter .
This would also have the effect of empowering the UN rapporteurs , special representatives , tribunals and so on , Gearty argues :
Since its application would be general , Obama could do all this without any mention of Israel , leaving the consequences to be worked through by various bureaucracies …
Were pressure from the lobbies to reach dangerous levels , the president might choose to take the issue to the American people , to discuss openly whether Israel should have an exemption from the system of values to which … the US itself will by then have signed up .23
While this is no doubt a scenario that the Israel lobby would want to avoid , Gearty ’s otherwise original and practical proposal overlooks the fact that the Israel lobby has long exploited an existing US disposition for unilateralism to generate hostility towards the UN .
The UN is undermined in general so it wo n’t have any legitimacy when it comes to the particular demands of making Israel abide by its resolutions .
The bulk of US vetoes in the Security Council have been cast in support of Israel .
Likewise , the precedent of appealing directly to the public has also failed to gain any cover for the last two presidents who tried it .
Both Gerald Ford and George Bush ( Snr. ) ended up as one - term presidents : the former balked after receiving a letter signed by the majority of the Senate ; the latter suffered a major electoral loss for which the Israel lobby claimed credit .
24 However , Obama is in a unique position : he has the tide of history with him .
He is also more susceptible to public pressure .
The Israel lobby is on the backfoot .
There has never been a time more propitious for groundbreaking change .
Gaza was the catalyst .
It is time demands were made of Obama to restore faith in international humanitarian law .
Until then , Europe ’s universal jurisdiction laws should suffice to keep the war criminals on their toes .

Many Italian clerics have given their backing to Monsignor Cocchi's appeal
The archbishop of the Italian city of Modena wants young Catholics to give up text messaging , social networking websites and computer games for Lent .
Monsignor Benito Cocchi said foregoing the activities would help them " cleanse themselves from the virtual world and get back into touch with themselves " ,
The average Italian sends 50 texts a month from their mobiles , the second highest rate in Europe , behind the UK .
Other Italian bishops have given their backing to the appeal .
In Trento , Archbishop Luigi Bressan has meanwhile suggested people use Lent to embrace recycling .
Venice 's bishop has said worshippers might want to give up mineral water and drink only tap water .
Father Gianni Fazzini of the Venice diocese told the newspaper , La Repubblica : " If people renounce things individually , it can produce a collective change .
" It 's a reaction to the economic crisis : in changing our consumer habits we can also meet our responsibility as Christians to safeguard God 's Creation , " he added .
Pope Benedict XVI warned in January that people who spent too much time in front of their computers risked isolation and depression .
Lent , which for most Christian congregations runs from Ash Wednesday to Easter , commemorates the 40 days that Jesus is said to have spent fasting in the desert and rejecting the temptations of Satan before beginning his ministry .

Is President Obama right to say stocks may be a good long - term investment ?
Yes , prices are low enough to buy
No , the market will be down for a long time or View results
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Americans already shouldering the cost of millions of people without health insurance should brace for a double - whammy : a surge in the number of the " underinsured , " or consumers who have some but not enough coverage .
The problem , according to health care industry experts , is that the government and those with employer - based plans will have to pick up the tab as more Americans are unable to pay their entire medical bill .
As the recession puts a bigger strain on consumers ' wallets , many underinsured Americans either can't or wo n't pay the high deductibles and co-pays for treatment they receive in hospitals and emergency rooms .
By one estimate , 25 million Americans can't afford to cover the gap between what their insurance covers and their medical bills demand .
The issue shows the steep challenge faced by President Obama and other Washington leaders vowing to put the health care system on a course for long - term fiscal viability .
On Thursday , the president is convening 150 experts , advocates and lawmakers for a " summit " to debate options .
Many people without adequate insurance are also delaying or forgoing medical care until it becomes an absolute emergency , said Dr. David Chin , managing partner of consulting firm PricewaterhouseCooper 's Global Healthcare Research Institute .
By law , hospitals have to treat all emergency admissions regardless of insurance .
" If the underinsured can't pay the bills , the hospital either writes it off as bad debt or shifts the cost to its charity care program , " said John Pickering , principal and consulting actuary with consulting firm Milliman Inc .
Increasingly , hospitals are shifting costs to " those who can pay , " said Wynn Bailey , partner and health care expert with consulting firm AT Kearney .
" That 's the government , private insurers and the self - insured . "
Bailey said hospitals are negotiating higher treatment rates with insurance companies to offset the bad debt .
In turn , commercial insurance providers are charging higher premiums to their clients , both businesses and individuals , to cover their cost increases .
As businesses struggle with their employee health care costs , they are shifting a higher percentage of overall premiums to their workers , charging higher deductibles , or encouraging greater use of generic drugs .
" It 's a vicious cycle , " said Pickering .
Bailey said he would n't be surprised if people with employer - based health insurance have to pay 5 % to 10 % more for their coverage over the next year or two .
Not tracked by government
One reason the exponential growth in underinsured Americans has n't made headlines is because this group is n't yet tracked by the government , explained Sara Collins , economist and assistant vice president with health policy research group The Commonwealth Fund .
" It 's harder to define the underinsured , " Collins said .
The Commonwealth Fund defines underinsured as those who incur high out - of - pocket costs - excluding premiums - relative to their income , despite having coverage all year .
Using that measure in consumer surveys , Collins ' firm estimates that 25 million adults under age 65 were underinsured in 2007 .
More importantly , Collins pointed out that the number of underinsured increased 60 % from 2003 to 2007 .
That compares with a 5.1 % increase in the number of uninsured Americans - to about 46 million - over the same period , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .
" The 25 million [ number ] can still be an underestimate , " Collins said .
What 's also troubling , she said , is that the ranks of the underinsured are spreading across income levels and have seen the most rapid increases lately in middle - income households earning between $ 40,000 to $ 60,000 .
Obama 's plans
Meanwhile , Obama has made health care reform a top priority , detailing a dramatic overhaul of the system in his budget outline last week .
Some of Obama 's initiatives will provide short - term relief to both the uninsured and underinsured .
Specifically , the government will provide a 65 % subsidy to businesses who continue Cobra premiums for laid off employees for a period of 9 months .
" But what happens after that period ? " said Bailey .
" Many people are wary about finding another job in a year in this economy . "
Longer term , Obama last month extended the Children 's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization
Act which renews and expands health coverage by an additional 3 million children , to 11 million children .
Investments in health care technology will eliminate unnecessary costs and prevent duplicative care , Bailey said .
Also , in his budget , Obama proposed a 10 - year health care reserve fund of $ 630 billion to " bring down costs and expand coverage . "
Bailey has reservations .
That $ 630 billion " sounds like a lot of money .
But total health care consumption this year is expected to be about $ 2 trillion , " he said .
" So is spending $ 63 billion a year enough to transform this gigantic beast ? "
" Obama 's proposals certainly are a start , but much more is needed , " said Bailey .
The San Mateo City Council on Monday unanimously decided to introduce an ordinance that would regulate the cultivation and storage of medical marijuana in the city .
Following city procedure , the council will vote on the ordinance again at its next meeting .
If approved then — and the process is largely a formality — the law will go into effect 30 days later .
Under the ordinance , collectives of patients and their caregivers who grow and store medical pot must register with the city and obtain a license from the police department , with all members providing their names , addresses and phone numbers .
Licensed collectives must be located only in the city ’s manufacturing and commercial zones at least 500 feet from schools , recreation and youth centers .
The ordinance states that collective members must grow marijuana indoors and provide adequate security .
San Mateo residents who grow marijuana at home for their own use , or for other people living at the house , are not subject to these rules .
“ The enforcement of our regulations become very difficult if we do n’t have registration to determine who we ’re dealing with and how much marijuana they need and that kind of thing , ” City Attorney Shawn Mason said in a phone interview Monday .
“ What the ordinance is doing is addressing the potential side effects that other communities have experienced with this type of activity so that we do n’t have problems . ”
Authorities raided and shut down three pot clubs in San Mateo in 2007 and a fourth in 2008 .
The city contends that those clubs were illegal because they charged more than the cost of producing the pot — making them for - profit businesses .
At Monday night ’s meeting Mayor Brandt Grotte criticized that kind of marijuana dispensary for overcharging desperate patients , particularly those on fixed incomes or with severe disabilities .
“ I have had a real problem with the idea of dispensaries charging what I think are exorbitant fees , ” Grotte said .
In 1996 , Californians passed an initiative allowing seriously ill people to grow and use marijuana with a doctor ’s recommendation .
Under the measure , the patients ’ caregivers could also cultivate and possess the substance .
A 2004 California Senate bill established a voluntary registration program with identification cards for patients and caregivers .
But the federal Controlled Substances
Act of 1970 , or CSA , says it is illegal to manufacture , distribute , dispense or possess any controlled substance .
The discrepancy between federal and state law has led to wide confusion and legal challenges , California Attorney General Jerry Brown wrote in a series of guidelines on medical marijuana published in August .
“ But no legal conflict exists merely because state law and federal law treat marijuana differently , ” Brown noted .
The 1996 and 2004 measures do n’t “ conflict with the CSA because , in adopting these laws , California did not ‘ legalize ’ medical marijuana , but instead exercised the state ’s reserved powers to not punish certain marijuana offenses , ” Brown said .
At a study session in October , council members and others expressed concern that if the city adopts a registration system , federal authorities could later compel local police to hand over names of collective members .
But because the California Public Records
Act regulates those types of privacy issues , the city could n’t put any language in the ordinance about how police would deal with a records request from federal authorities , Mason said .
“ We ca n’t pass an ordinance that says these things are confidential and not public records because the state decides that and not a city , ” Mason said .
“ We ’ll have to address that issue if and when it arises because it really is an issue of state law . ”
Americans for Safe Access spokesman Kris Hermes criticized the ordinance for requiring registration , which he said could imperil patients .
“ It is a function of self - incrimination to offer up your details pertaining to the cultivation since it ’s still illegal under federal law and local law enforcement has used information on patients to go to the federal government , ” Hermes said .
“ They ’re setting up , unfortunately , a situation where people will refuse to register and automatically become illegal as a result . ”
But San Mateo County resident Micheal Resendez , who grows and uses marijuana to treat severe injuries he sustained while serving in the military in 1993 , said he would register his collective garden and is already checking out potential buildings in San Mateo .
“ I ’m legit here in the state of California , being a legal California citizen , being a 100 percent disabled veteran , ” Resendez said .
“ I feel that I wo n’t be prosecuted . ”
Resendez , who said he was overjoyed about the ordinance , added that he prefers to grow pot in a city with clear rules .
“ San Mateo is just giving better guidelines , ” Resendez said .
“ For me , the legality of that is a lot better for what I do . ”

Valentine 's Day or Saint Valentine 's Day is a holiday celebrated on February 14 by many people throughout the world .
In the West , it is the traditional day on which lovers express their love for each other by sending Valentine 's cards , presenting flowers , or offering confectionery .
The holiday is named after two among the numerous Early Christian martyrs named Valentine .
The day became associated with romantic love in the circle of Geoffrey Chaucer in the High Middle Ages , when the tradition of courtly love flourished .
Saint Valentine ( in Latin , Valentinus ) is the name of several martyred saints of ancient Rome .
The name " Valentine " , derived from valens ( worthy ) , was popular in late antiquity .
Of the Saint Valentine whose feast is on February 14 , nothing is known except his name and that he was buried at the Via Flaminia north of Rome on February 14 .
It is even uncertain whether the feast of that day celebrates only one saint or more saints of the same name .
For this reason this liturgical commemoration was not kept in the Catholic calendar of saints for universal liturgical veneration as revised in 1969 .
But " Martyr Valentinus the Presbyter and those with him at Rome " remains in the list of saints proposed for veneration by all Catholics .
In the West , Valentine 's Day is heavily promoted as a means by which various merchandisers could sell products .
An author of TheSixthAxis recently posted up an article that questioned why Titan Studios , the developers behind Fat Princess , were doing a closed beta test for the PSN title .
Turning the closed beta into a fun , little contest was a neat idea on the developer ’s part , and does stand to create some positive buzz for the quirky , innovative title .
What better process to see if gamers respond well to the title than to let actual gamers become exposed to it for the first time ?
The SixthAxis , however , feels otherwise and asks :
“ … what kind of credentials would the general gamer have to provide valid , constructive criticism to a game clearly still very much in development ? ”
Well , let ’s see .
Anyone who ’s been playing games for the past few years generally has a pretty good grasp on what makes games fun .
You would n’t choose the games you did unless you found them enjoyable .
And it ’s not like the development team does n’t have access to Sony ’s internal QA testers ; this is simply a way of getting public feedback on the game .
The author continues to judge gamers , arguing that :
“ … they ’d download the game , get bored within the hour and write off the promising PSN title as a bug - ridden disaster . ”
Now this is just jumping the gun .
Unless you ’ve actually played the game , there ’s no way to know if the title has had the majority , or all , of its bugs and glitches removed .
Therefore , it ’s unprofessional for TheSixthAxis to make technical criticisms without having had any hands - on experience .
From the gameplay footage that ’s been shown , Fat Princess looks like a lot of fun , and definitely not something that gamers would suddenly get bored of .
Public betas are simply a good way to iron out any possible gameplay imbalances and squash any remaining bugs , some of which only occur in very specific scenarios .
Also , it ’s important to point out that only 5000 people will be allowed to participate in this Beta .
It ’s not a simple contest that anyone can win .
So what do you guys think ?
Are Public Betas a waste of everyone ’s time , or do you feel such Betas are a positive way of improving the final product ?

At least 179 people are dead as homes collapsed when a massive earthquake hit the historic city of L'Aquila in Italy , with 10,000 houses reportedly damaged .
The tragedy horror at the Houphouet - Boigny stadium in Abidjan comes just days before the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster which killed 96 people .
A crowd of 50,000 people had come to the game - more than had been expected - to see the likes of Drogba , his Chelsea teammate Salomon Kalou and Toure 's fellow Arsenal player Emmanuel Eboue , with tickets being sold at reduced prices .
Although the stadium had been recently renovated , the ministry of sport and the Ivorian Football Federation confirmed that a wall collapsed causing those already in the stadium to panic .
According to the AP , Interior Minister Desire Tagro told state television : " Lots of fans showed up .
They started pushing to get in because the match was about to start and each and every one of them wanted to get in . "
Officials have since blamed the tragedy on ticketless fans trying to get in , according to the BBC .
The incident took place before the match , but the game was allowed to proceed with the Ivory Coast claiming a 5 - 0 win .
And it was just the latest in a string of deadly disasters in African football , and sends out a worrying message ahead of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa .
Past incidents include :
• Just weeks ago , on February 10 , four people died from dehydration in Kumasi , Ghana during a game at the Baba Yara stadium .
• In September 2008 , 13 died and 54 were injured during a stampede in Butembo , D.R. Congo after accusations that the losing side ’s keeper had put a hex on the game .
• Nine people died in a World Cup qualifier between Liberia and Gambia in June 2008 .
Fans were either crushed against the fences or were trampled to death .
• In May 2001 , the worst ever disaster to hit African football took place when 130 were killed during a game in Accra , Ghana after police fired tear gas into the stands .

WASHINGTON 
With just 15 days left in office , President Bush announced Monday that he had ordered an immediate airlift to deliver vehicles and equipment to the war - torn Darfur region of Sudan to bolster a struggling international peacekeeping effort there .
Mr. Bush waived a requirement that he notify Congress 15 days before undertaking such a mission , because waiting would “ pose a substantial risk to human health and welfare , ” the White House national security adviser , Stephen J. Hadley , said in a statement .
The White House said the airlift had been in the planning stages for months .
But some human rights activists expressed puzzlement at the timing of the move , a little more than two weeks before the inauguration of Barack Obama .
Mr. Obama has vowed more aggressive action in Darfur , including imposition of a no- flight zone , a move Mr. Bush has declined to make .
“ It is certainly more than passing strange to have the national security adviser come out and say that this step is being taken and Congressional notification is being waived because of the urgency of the situation in the last two weeks of the administration , when Darfur has been on fire for five years , ” said John Norris , executive director of the Enough Project , a group here that campaigns against genocide .
( CNN ) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Wednesday he had ordered the nationalization of at least some of the operations of the U.S. - based food giant Cargill and threatened to do the same with the Caracas - based food maker Polar .
Venezuela President Hugo Chavez accused Cargill of growing specialized rice to evade price controls .
" Begin the expropriation process with Cargill , " he said in a nationally televised speech in which he accused the company of growing specialized forms of rice in an attempt to evade price controls .
The leftist president called the company 's practices " a flagrant violation of everything that we have been doing . "
Mark Klein , a spokesman for Cargill , said the Minneapolis , Minnesota - based company " is committed to the production of food in Venezuela that complies with all laws and regulations . "
He said a rice mill cited by Chavez " was designed exclusively to manufacture parboiled rice , which the company has done at this site for the last seven years and elsewhere in the country for 13 years . "
Klein added , " Cargill expects the opportunity to clarify the situation with the government and is respectful of the Venezuelan government decision . "
Cargill , which is privately owned , has been doing business since 1986 in Venezuela , where its operations include oilseed processing , grain and oilseeds trading , animal feed , salt , and financial and risk management .
It has 2,000 employees in 22 locations in Venezuela , according to its Web site .
About Polar , which is led by Lorenzo Mendoza , Chavez said , " We can expropriate all the plants of Polar .
Mr. Mendoza , be alert .
Because then you will go out and order your pricey lawyers and I do n't know what to say that this is a violation of the constitution .
Well , fine .
If you want to fight with the government , brother , there you go .
It 's not with the government , it 's with the law ! "
In August , Chavez also ordered the nationalization of the Banco de Venezuela " to put it at the service of Venezuela . "

Baard Energy withdrew an application for federal loans for a $ 6 billion coal - to - liquids plant in Illiinois last week .
The company cited lawsuits by the Sierra Club and National Resource Defense Council for blocking the project .
[ social_buttons ]
“ Baard keeps claiming this is a clean coal facility and nothing could be further from the truth , ” said Nachy Kanfer of Sierra Club .
“ There is nothing clean about a fuel that emits twice the global warming pollution of normal gasoline or a refinery that spits out huge amounts of dangerous air pollutants and heavy metals . ”
While Baard blames the groups for holding up its applications , environmentalists hail this as a win against the progression of coal - based energy , which ( despite claims ) will always have negative environmental affects .
“ This project cannot stand up to legitimate economic analysis — as Baard seems to have concluded by withdrawing it from consideration by the Department of Energy , ” said NRDC attorney Shannon Fisk .
“ Baard blames environmentalists for their financial problems , but an environmental review is no threat to a viable project . ”
The announcement came during the three - day World Coal - to - Liquids Conference , which activists stormed in protest .

It ’s a depressing spectacle : on both sides of the Atlantic , policy - makers just keep falling short — and the odds that this slump really will turn into Great Depression II keep rising .
In Europe , leaders rejected pleas for a comprehensive rescue plan for troubled East European economies , promising instead to provide “ case - by - case ” support .
That means a slow dribble of funds , with no chance of reversing the downward spiral .
Oh , and Jean - Claude Trichet says that there is no deflation threat in Europe .
What ’s the weather like on his planet ?
On this side of the Atlantic , Tim Geithner seems committed to the view that banks should stay private even if they ’re bankrupt , because — well , just because .
James Kwak is driven to exasperation :
To be blunt , it sounded like the “ private is better ” mantra we heard from the Bush administration , and ( to a slightly less extent ) the Clinton administration before them .
Sure , most people agree you do n’t want all individual lending decisions being made by bureaucrats in Washington , but that ’s just a straw man .
There are valid reasons to debate whether nationalization is the best solution ; in particular , if you were to take over Citigroup , even for a short period of time , would that immediately weaken Bank of America so much that you would be forced to take it over the next day ?
And what about JPMorgan Chase ?
But that ’s not what Geithner said .
He said “ private is better . ”
And so is the extremely moderate Tim Duy , over the insistence of policymakers that the “ true value ” of assets is higher than anything the market is actually willing to pay :
Policymakers are assuming that restoring proper functioning in credit markets – and confidence in general – is equivalent to a housing price rebound .
They seem incapable of envisioning a world in which this is not the case .
This tunnel vision prevents policymakers of trying to devise policy which assumes that the many of the assets in the banking system are simply “ bad . ” For Bernanke and Geithner , there are no bad assets .
Only misunderstood assets .
And we have the spectacle of James Baker — James Baker ! — attacking the Obama administration from the left , calling for temporary nationalization of zombie banks as part of the recapitalization process .
The sickening feeling of drift — the sense that policymakers are refusing to face hard facts , and are dithering while the world economy burns — just keeps getting stronger .

Jack Cafferty says America has to rethink its aspirations in light of the growing national debt .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
I think this time , it 's different .
I have this uneasy feeling our country is in the process of changing forever , and not necessarily for the better -- unless our perspective changes with it .
I have kicked around longer than most people : I 'm 66 years old .
I remember well the '50s and early ' 60s , which were times of unbridled enthusiasm , prosperity and opportunity .
The American dream was a job , a house , a car .
A modest , affordable house and a car that was most likely a Chevrolet , Ford or Plymouth .
People were n't in debt buying things they could n't afford , and neither was the government .
There were recessions along the way -- relatively mild downturns of short duration -- but nothing like this feels like it 's going to be .
The interest on the national debt will approach $ 500 billion a year this year or next .
Our country is sinking into the quicksand of insolvency as surely as the victims of subprime mortgages who have lost their jobs and their houses and watched their savings evaporate in the stock market decline .
The current national debt is soaring past $ 12 trillion .
The costs of the stimulus packages and bailouts ( and stimulus package is just another word for bailout ) are being tacked on and passed on because they are being paid for with money we do n't have .
We are staring at unfunded liabilities for Medicare and Social Security in the tens of trillions of dollars .
Where 's that money going to come from ?
We have to either raise taxes or cut benefits .
There are no other options .
The baby boomers are starting to retire and will consume an ever larger share of these entitlement programs .
They will also age in sufficient numbers to drive the political agenda for the foreseeable future .
Think they 're going to want less Social Security and less Medicare ?
Think again .
The generation coming along behind them that will be asked to pay for all this can't .
There are not enough good jobs left in this country to pay those kinds of bills .
At the end of the day , we are going to have to settle for less .
Less money , smaller houses , smaller cars and smaller dreams .
This is not your father 's country anymore .
And we had better all start getting used to it .
On the bright side , our history shows that times of shared national sacrifice have resulted in our greatest national achievements .
It 's been a very long time since we have been called upon to make any kind of serious sacrifice .
We were overdue until one day in September , when Lehman Brothers collapsed .
We 're not overdue anymore .

Discussing the Bush legacy yesterday , Chris Matthews on MSNBC 's Hardball came up with a good metaphor :
Matthews : I found it interesting that the president , who admitted he was wrong about WMDs as a justification for war , called it a " disappointment . "
If a police officer in the line of duty in the middle of the night shoots a fellow because he thinks he's got a gun , it turns out he 's got a wallet , your reaction if you 're a police officer is not that you 're disappointed he did n't have a gun , it 's shame that even if it was a technical mistake that you 've made , that you 've killed a guy without reason .
Why does the president use the word " disappointment " when he says they did n't have the WMD to justify us going in ?
I think it 's an odd use of the word .
It was fun watching Tony Blankley squirm as he mostly sought to evade Matthews ' point .
Tom Andrews of Win Without War , also on the program , clearly made him squirm even more , as he shot down Blankley 's GOP talking points like Annie Oakley in a penny arcade .
You could almost see him thinking : " Hey !
This usually works on Fox ! "
Later , in the segment following , Salon 's Joan Walsh backed up Matthews ' metaphor :
Walsh :
And finally ... the point that you made earlier , about a cop who shoots an unarmed man , does not then regret that the guy did not have a gun .
He regrets that he killed an innocent man .
And he regrets that he did n't take the extra 30 seconds maybe to ascertain whether the guy was armed .
Yeah , but George the Frog Killer Bush is not your ordinary cop .
If you thought that the Obama Administration would bring an end to the Bush Administration ’s domestic surveillance programs , you were wrong :
FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III urged lawmakers yesterday to renew intelligence - gathering measures in the USA Patriot
Act that are set to expire in December , calling them “ exceptional ” tools to help protect national security .
The law , passed shortly after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , created divisions between proponents , who said it was necessary to deter terrorism , and privacy advocates warning that it tramples on Americans ’ civil liberties .
Portions of the law are up for reauthorization this year .
Mueller told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee he hopes that the reauthorization of two provisions would be far less controversial than in previous years .
One of those provisions , which helps authorities secure access to business records , “ has been exceptionally helpful in our national security investigations , ” he said .
In response to a question from Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin ( D - Md. ) , Mueller said that his agents had used the provision about 220 times between 2004 and 2007 .
Data for last year were not yet available , he said .
The measure allows investigators probing terrorism to seek a suspect ’s records from third parties such as financial services and travel and telephone companies without notifying the suspect .
The American Civil Liberties Union has criticized the provision , saying it violates the First Amendment rights of U.S. citizens .
Another provision , permitting roving wiretaps of terrorism suspects , was used 147 times and has helped eliminate “ an awful lot of paperwork , ” Mueller said .
In the past , authorities had to seek court approval for each electronic device carried by a suspect , from a cellphone and a BlackBerry to a home computer .
But under the provision , one warrant can cover all of those machines .

This information is valid for all versions of XP x86 ( 32 - bit ) running Service Pack 3 . XP Pro x64 ( 64 - bit ) Service information and Configurations are also online .
Before adjusting your service settings , ensure that you or your system has already installed all updates by “ checking now ” for any available updates via Windows Update .
I cannot possibly test all configurations extensively ( meaning , each persons specific computer needs ) , but what I can offer is what “ works for me ” and the obstacles I have came across so you do not have to discover them on your own .
Please note , this information is no longer updated .
Please take that fact into consideration when reviewing this information .
Notes for a Happier Computer and User
Do not use “ msconfig ” to disable services , type “ services.msc ” in the Run box instead !
( Why ? )
Before disabling any service , check out the service information about each by selecting the service name links provided .
If you do not wish to select / change each service by hand , I offer up Service Registry files to adjust them with only a few clicks .
Currently , “ Default ” and “ Safe ” are available .
Service settings are global , meaning changes apply to all users .
All of these services are “ Standard ” with Windows XP after the installation of Service Pack 3 .
If you discover something other than these listed here running , another program installed them or they were installed with optional updates via Windows Update .
Examples of this include .NET services and WMP services .
View a listing of the more common ones .
Still unsure ?
Put your setting to “ Manual ” or the listing under “ Safe . ” Manual allows Windows XP to start the service when it needs to ( or when ever it feels like it ) , but not at boot up .
Depending on your configuration , not all services will start when required while in “ Manual ” mode .
If you find you need a service , place it in Automatic .
After adjusting your service settings , reboot your computer .
If you do not have some of these services listed , do not panic !
If your computer manufacture “ pre-installed ” your XP , they choose not to have certain services installed for you .
This is , in most cases , a fact with OEM versions of Windows XP Home .
Disabling all of the “ unneeded services ” reduces the footprint of the OS by up to 70 % , depending on system .

As UN Antiracism Day Is Marked , Racist Violence on the Rise
India will be holding elections over the course of one month from 16 April .
BBC
News asked people from all corners of the world 's largest democracy what they would do if they were prime minister .
GITA KUNDU , HOUSEMAID , 43 , DELHI
First of all , I will get rid of all the politicians and ministers and then I will work to improve the situation in the country .
Our country is in a right solid mess at the moment .
The biggest problem is corruption .
Everywhere you go , officials ask you for bribes .
I will work to weed out corruption .
Poverty is also a major problem here .
There are so many poor people who can't even afford to eat !
Some people have big families and they need support .
School fees are so high , something needs to be done about that too .
And India has been hit by terrorist violence so often .
If I were the prime minister of India , I would make sure that they are all caught and tried quickly .
And I would hang them in three months .
Return to top VENKATESH , FARMER , 30 , RAMPUR VILLAGE , KARNATAKA
If I become the prime minister , my first priority will be to ensure that all the farmers in this country get a fair price for their produce , whether it 's rice , wheat , sugarcane or some other crop .
If the government ensures that farmers get paid what 's their due , then it will not have to spend any more money on their wellbeing .
The farmers will use the money to improve their own lives .
Life in our villages can be tough - the roads are bad , there 's no electricity or proper schools and hospitals .
But the villagers are more than willing to take matters in their own hands .
So instead of having to depend on government handouts , I would make sure that they get the funds they need which they can administer directly .
Farmers make up more than half of our country , so it 's important to focus on their needs instead of only taking care of people who live in the cities .
Return to top PRADEEP RANA , ANIMATOR , 22 , GURGAON
If I were prime minister , my first act , my greatest priority would be to introduce a rule for all political candidates .
All candidates should be educated to degree level .
In certain backward Indian states candidates are not educated .
They do not know how to attract investment to their states , they can not serve well .
I admit that the railways minister , Laloo Prasad Yadav from Bihar is doing a good job for railways .
But an education gives you an additional advantage .
I would want to solve all of our electricity problems .
Even where I live we have long power cuts in the day of about six to seven hours .
That is intolerable in the summers .
It is a serious issue .
That 's why we need a nuclear deal and that 's where having an education counts .
Return to top MITA KAPUR , 43 , LITERARY CONSULTANT AND WRITER , JAIPUR
As prime minister , I 'd probably look at ways of separating religion from politics .
That will solve most of the problems that our country is facing right now whether it is the threat of terrorism or the insecurities that dwell in people 's minds .
Today a regular Indian does not have confidence when walking out of his house .
He does n't know if he is going to walk back in .
I would like to restore that confidence .
Seventy percent of Indians live under the poverty line .
But are we really looking at the villages where this happens ?
There is so much rich culture , heritage there are lots of economic opportunities as well
There is so much more we can do in terms of preserving , perpetuating and using all that as a means of livelihood .
We have wealth and we are ignoring it .
Return to top CHANDRA MISHRA , 26 , SOFTWARE ENGINEER , BHUBANESWAR , ORISSA
As prime minister my attention would be focused on education and infrastructure .
Both are key drivers of growth and will be much needed in the future to sustain growth .
For a vast country like India with its huge population , it is imperative that everybody is well educated and well connected .
There should be many super highways connecting major cities throughout the country .
Special economic zones would continue to generate employment while education will make them more competitive and marketable .
Corruption is the root of slow growth and I would eliminate it by bringing in more transparency and accountability .
As prime minister I would strive to set an example myself and this will serve as a beacon of hope to everybody in this country .
Return to top SWETHA RAMACHANDRAN , 23 , HEALTH WORKER , ANDHRA PRADESH India is a country with a lot of resources and potential .
But it does not have a proper leader who can tap the resources and present our case to the rest of the world .
As prime minister I would do what is necessary to get people more educated .
Literacy rates are very low .
I would set things right and increase literacy rates throughout the country so education is more available to people all over India .
We could make a lot of difference to the world if India could only use the power of its population .
And educating people about health is important .
If people can take care of themselves , our problems are reduced .
Return to top ALI HUSSAIN , STREET VENDOR , 40 , DELHI I am a poor man , I have no job .
Today I 'm selling tobacco pouches , candies and hot tea from the footpath here but this is not my shop .
It belongs to an acquaintance who has gone to his village and asked me to run it till he returns .
I would like to have a shop like this .
If I become the prime minister of India , I will make sure that all the poor people like me can have small permanent shops so that they can earn a living .
Poor in this country have no peace , no hope .
I will formulate schemes to help the poor , get the unemployed people jobs which pay well .
For people like me , rising food prices are a big worry .
Inflation is killing us .
The prices of wheat flour and lentils have hit the roof .
The two main political parties - the Congress and the BJP - are useless .
But where is the alternative ?
Return to top CHANDRA DEEP YERRA , CUSTOMER SERVICE , 26 , VISAKHAPATANAM
What would I do if I was the prime minister ?
There are a lot of things I could do if I were the prime minister even for a single day .
Instead of assigning ministries to my own party members , I would see who had performed well in that position in the previous term and hand it over to that person .
I would start a new division which would continuously monitor my ministers and other members and score them at the end of every week or month .
This division would also educate the ministers on where they went wrong and where they could improve .
India is primarily an agricultural country .
Since food is a basic commodity , first importance should be given to it .
I would once again bring back the slogan ' Be Indian , Buy Indian ' and make India a self - reliant country .
I would leave behind the ancient 20th Century India and would turn it into an advanced and modern 21st Century India .
Return to top RAM BAI , FRUIT SELLER , 50 , DELHI I have been selling fruits in Delhi's Connaught Place area for the last 35 years .
I have a license but sometime the authorities still come and seize my goods .
Some of the other people like me who used to put up stalls here have been forced to leave .
How are the poor supposed to live ?
If I were to become the prime minister , I would give shops to all the poor .
I will tell the police not to harass them .
I have five children .
I earn 100 to 150 rupees a day from sales .
If I were to work as a day labourer I would only make 50 to 60 rupees .
How will I feed my family then ?
The inflation is so high , wheat flour , rice and lentils are so expensive .
How can the poor pay for them ?
The prices must come down .
If I were the prime minister , I would work to bring down the food prices .
Return to top MANJUNATHA MV , 29 , SOFTWARE ENGINEER , BANGALORE
If I were prime minister I would promote the fast - paced economic development of our country through prudent economic policies .
This is necessary because there are many Indians still living under poverty .
I would have a vision for the country , a vision that stretches as far ahead as 2020 and 2050 .
I would also promote e-governance at all levels to introduce transparency so corruption is removed and the government comes closer the people .
I would make education a basic right for every citizen and provide free education to girls in rural areas living under poverty .

More must read financial analysis from DK Matai , Chairman of the ACTA Open .
The Invisible One Quadrillion Dollar Equation — Asymmetric Leverage and Systemic Risk
According to various distinguished sources including the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) in Basel , Switzerland — the central bankers ’ bank — the amount of outstanding derivatives worldwide as of December 2007 crossed USD 1.144 Quadrillion , ie , USD 1,144 Trillion .
The main categories of the USD 1.144 Quadrillion derivatives market were the following :
1. Listed credit derivatives stood at USD 548 trillion ;
2. The Over - The - Counter ( OTC ) derivatives stood in notional or face value at USD 596 trillion and included :
a. Interest Rate Derivatives at about USD 393 + trillion ;
b. Credit Default Swaps at about USD 58 + trillion ;
c. Foreign Exchange Derivatives at about USD 56 + trillion ;
d. Commodity Derivatives at about USD 9 trillion ;
e. Equity Linked Derivatives at about USD 8.5 trillion ; and
f. Unallocated Derivatives at about USD 71 + trillion .
Quadrillion ?
That is a number only super computing engineers and astronomers used to use , not economists and bankers !
For example , the North star is “ just ” a couple of quadrillion miles away , ie , a few thousand trillion miles .
The new “ Roadrunner ” supercomputer built by IBM for the US Department of Energy ’s Los Alamos National Laboratory has achieved a peak performance of 1.026 Peta Flop per second — becoming the first supercomputer ever to reach this milestone .
One Quadrillion Floating Point Operations ( Flops ) per second is 1 Peta Flop /s , ie , 1,000 Trillion Flops per second .
It is estimated that all the data found on all the websites and stored on computers across the world totals more than One Exa byte of memory , ie , 1,000 Quadrillion bytes of data .
Whilst outstanding derivatives are notional amounts until they are crystallised , actual exposure is measured by the net credit equivalent .
This is normally a lower figure unless many variables plot a locus in the wrong direction simultaneously .
This could be because of catastrophic unpredictable events , ie , “ Black Swans ” , such as cascades of bankruptcies and nationalisations , when the net exposure can balloon and become considerably larger or indeed because some extremely dislocating geo-political or geo-physical events take place simultaneously .
Also , the notional value becomes real value when either counterparty to the OTC derivative goes bankrupt .
This means that no large OTC derivative house can be allowed to go broke without falling into the arms of another .
Whatever funds within reason are required to rescue failing international investment banks , deposit banks and financial entities ought to be provided on a case by case basis .
This is the asymmetric nature of derivatives and here lies the potential for systemic risk to the global economic system and financial markets if nothing is done .
Let us think about the invisible USD 1.144 quadrillion equation with black swan variables — ie , 1,144 trillion dollars in terms of outstanding derivatives , global Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , real estate , world stock and bond markets coupled with unknown unknowns or “ Black Swans ” .
What would be the relative positioning of USD 1.144 quadrillion for outstanding derivatives , ie , what is their scale :
1 . The entire GDP of the US is about USD 14 trillion .
2 . The entire US money supply is also about USD 15 trillion .
3 . The GDP of the entire world is USD 50 trillion .
USD 1,144 trillion is 22 times the GDP of the whole world .
4 . The real estate of the entire world is valued at about USD 75 trillion .
5 . The world stock and bond markets are valued at about USD 100 trillion .
6 . The big banks alone own about USD 140 trillion in derivatives .
7. Bear Stearns had USD 13 + trillion in derivatives and went bankrupt in March .
Freddie Mac , Fannie Mae , Lehman Brothers and AIG have all ‘ collapsed ’ because of complex securities and derivatives exposures in September .
8 . The population of the whole planet is about 6 billion people .
So the derivatives market alone represents about USD 190,000 per person on the planet .

So I was on the Colbert Report , hosted by Stephen Colbert at Comedy Central , on Wednesday night , to promote my new book , Engaging the Muslim World .
The clip is up at the Colbert site now
Colbert has four Emmys for his comedy writing on the show , and also just won a Producers Guild Award for Television Producer of the Year Award in Live Entertainment / Competition ( i.e. he has the esteem of his peers ) .
A talented comedy writer who worked on the Saturday Night Live “ Saturday TV Funhouse ” cartoons ( and sometimes provided voices ) , and then as a writer and occasional “ correspondent ” on the Daily Show , like Tina Fey he made the move to performance ( and like her his greatest success came in parodying the political Right ) .
To be sure , he did it first .
Colbert ’s persona as a pompous , right - wing news anchor has a long genealogy in television comedy .
One thinks of Ted Knight ’s Ted Baxter character on the Mary Tyler Moore Show .
Colbert ’s special genius lay in recognizing the comedic potential of skewering the Fox Cable News anchors and commentators , the rightwing bullyboys such as Sean Hannity and Bill O’Reilly .
That he is a liberal playing a conservative to a young liberal audience introduces a hall - of - mirrors - like complexity into the comedy .
So after they set me , my wife and my editor and some staffers from Palgrave Macmillan up in the green room in a nondescript building on the edges of Manhattan ’s Theater District , the Colbert crew kindly gave me a tour of the studio ( I like studios , and sort of collect visits to them ) .
I impudently asked if I could sit at Mr. Colbert ’s anchor desk , and the staff kindly said yes :
As I was getting behind the desk I almost tripped on something , and looked down to find a . . . pitchfork .
Gee , I thought , this will be a tough interview .
But it turns out that the pitchfork was meant for another purpose , Colbert ’s populist proposal to lead the peasants with torches to the AIG headquarters ( i.e. the very thing Rush Limbaugh was inveighing against ) .
Colbert ’s persona is sometimes more populist than merely conservative .
In our interview , Colbert effectively skewered the Islamophobic schticks of rightwing American media , a la Glenn Beck and other hatemongers .
I do a lot of radio and am sometimes on with a shock jock interviewer .
In fact , on Wednesday morning I had the misfortune to encounter Chicago radio personality Mancow Muller in a telephone interview on my book .
At one point he started shouting , as I remember , “ is n’t it time to just start killing them ? ” and wanted to justify killing and half - starving Gazan children for the sins of Hamas .
I do n’t know if he believes this crap or he is not all there , but his employer , Talk Radio Network , appears to be among the biggest hatemongers in the United States .
A responsible American public would mount advertiser boycotts of this sewage .
I ’m all for free speech in media and love listening to responsible conservative voices such as those in The American Conservative .
But just shouting that it is time to start killing people is sick and actually may eventually get someone killed .
Anyway , after my distasteful encounter earlier that day , I found Colbert ’s parody of such individuals positively hilarious .
Interestingly , Colbert revealed that he is taking the show to the Persian Gulf , for a direct encounter with the Muslim world , himself .
He was hoping , he said , for an opulent experience in Dubai .
I had the sad duty of informing him that Dubai is n’t what it was before the real estate collapse .
The Colbert Report generously gave me a bag full of goodies .
These included a Colbert Report should bag ( which I will treasure ) , various flavored waters and snacks , a cosmetic kit that my wife thought well of , and a gift card that allows me to forward $ 100 to help public schools via DonorsChoose.org which was the best gift of all .
After the show was over , my wife and I had a very nice celebration dinner at Victor ’s Cuban Cafe in the Theater District , among my favorites in New York .
Afterwards , we wanted to go back to the hotel and catch the show , which airs at 11:30 pm ET .
But it then occurred to me that our hotel ’s basic cable package did not include Comedy Central .
So we asked the manager at Victor ’s if we could watch it at the bar as they were closing up , and they kindly agreed .
The manager had stories about visits to the restaurant of J - Lo , David Letterman , and other celebrities .
It was a wonderful experience to be on the Colbert Report .
Unlike some academics , I watch a lot of television , and do n’t think you can understand American society if you do n’t .
I really think that the Comedy Bloc from 11 - 12 ET on Comedy Central , of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert , is a little space of sanity and reality in American public life .
Comedy , satire and parody allow these two very intelligent and perceptive gentlemen to be brutally frank about the foibles of American society .
To any extent I could join in that enterprise , it was my privilege .

China will have a Short - Term Recession
China is pulling itself out of the worldwide recession by investing in itself .
For instance , their economic stimulus plan mostly involves infrastructure improvements , such as newer and bigger highways , railroads , ports , buildings , etc. just to name a few of their enhancements .
The basic idea is that China already needs these improvements to their antiquated and insufficient infrastructure .
These improvements will mean millions of new jobs throughout China for Chinese workers .
This is especially useful because of the millions of jobs that have already been lost because of the worldwide recession .
This will have the added benefit of also suppressing some of the civil unrest because of the downturn in the Chinese economy .
As a result , these new jobs should continue to support the growing Chinese economy and their new middle class .
The hope is that the Chinese economy will eventually be self sufficient in all of their needs .
This is probably completely impossible , since China does not have sufficient fuel resources and raw materials for themselves .
However , the actual goal is to develop the Chinese consumerism to be sufficient enough to make up for the loss in trade to other countries .
This is possible , since the Chinese market may eventually be larger than the rest of the developed world combined .
As a result , China will be the first country out of this worldwide recession .
Unfortunately , this will not help any other country .
Actually , it will probably hurt every other country , because of China 's growing demand for resources and fuel will increase the prices for these raw materials at a time when all the other countries of the world are still in a recession and can not afford an increase in prices or inflation .
Therefore , China being the first country out of their recession will make it much harder for other countries to get out of their recessions .
As a result , the world 's recession will last much longer than the Chinese recession .

Knowing what I know now , I wonder how I avoided depression for as long as I did :
Stress causes depression .
Perfectionists are more prone to depression .
Isolation reinforces depression .
As a software developer , those frequently go along with the job description .
Seasonal Affective Disorder has gotten the rap for at least some of the funk , because many software guys spend most of their time indoors , duty - bound to their office chairs .
But surely SAD ca n’t take all the blame .
Long hours of solitary work in front of a computer screen , the amateurish demands of tech - heads - turned - managers , the over - constrained projects , the intolerance we have toward bugs , the widespread myth that software is “ free , ” and ( most importantly ) how we as developers respond to these pressures , all these must take some share of the blame for developers ’ depression .
Several years ago , I experienced my first major bout of depression .
I had been working at a small company for umpteen years .
If you ’ve never worked at a small , tight - knit company , you may not understand the camaraderie that grows between its members , which keeps the company going , even through the lean times .
This is not just some abstract “ teamwork ” concept , but an inspiration and effectiveness that comes from years of solving problems together .
We literally loved our work environment , and we loved working together .
I loved working there so much , I had remained there all during the dot - com boom years , turning down headhunter after headhunter , even with the promise of exciting work and a higher salary .
In retrospect , if I have one big regret , it is that I did n’t pursue other jobs and higher salaries during the dot - com years .
Because just before the company was bought out and I finally got laid off , I was making about 25 % less than the going rate for engineers of my experience and skills .
Meanwhile , recent layoffs at the company had saddled those of us who remained with more work than ever .
And because of family demands , I was struggling to find enough hours in the day to get my job done .
As a family , we were stretching to make ends meet , and our credit - card debt was mounting .
My wife was also working part - time , and starting her own business the other part of the time .
The kids were in daycare , and each day I drove through rush - hour traffic to pick them up before 6 PM .
Then on the way home , I sat bumper - to - bumper with the other cars on the road , while the kids shouted and fought , much too loudly for the interior of our small family car .
Everyone at work was in the same boat .
Some of the most senior employees had even taken a pay - cut to keep the company afloat .
And we all wanted the situation to continue , because we all loved working together .
But I was still not earning enough to support my family , and there were too few hours in the day to accomplish what I needed to accomplish .
I should have been interviewing for other jobs .
But my current employer had been more than flexible with my schedule , to allow me to see to family demands , and I did n’t see how I was going to find another job that got anywhere close to what I needed .
That winter , I felt particularly down .
I was having trouble focusing on my work .
I found I loved to watch TV , and I often had the TV on in the background while I was working at home .
I suffered from frequent headaches , and I developed a nervous twitch in my left eye .
One late - winter day , I sat down in my cubicle at work , in front of my computer monitor , and I simply began to cry .
I blamed Seasonal Affective Disorder .
In a supreme twist of irony , I was laid off that April - fools day .
Getting laid off was the best thing that could have happened to me , because one of the most powerful weapons against depression is hope .
When they told me I was among those laid off , I remember feeling euphoria , because a great burden had lifted off me .
That day , my left eye stopped twitching .

How should anarchists relate to revolutionary or left - wing populist governments ?
Should they denounce them out of hand ?
Should they join in the movement ?
What are the traps to avoid ?
This is an important question as radicalized populations are creating movements which give rise to alleged progressive governments .
As capitalism goes into ever - deeper crisis we can expect more of these movements to develop .
Anarchism and Radical Governments
Anarchism is more influential and wide - spread than at any time in the last 70 years .
And the movement continues to grow and develop .
This does not necessarily mean that we will become the predominate tendency .
Even during anarchism 's previous zenith  the years immediately after World War One  we had to share the stage with other socialist currents .
The most important and far - reaching anarchist movement  that of Spain in 1936  saw the formation of a united front involving the CNT - FAI , the left - communist POUM and rank and file militants of the Socialist trade unions .
It is safe to claim that social change  let alone social revolution  will involve a number of different tendencies , of which anarchism will be one , and not always the predominant one .
Anarchists will work together with the other tendencies which promote self - government and self - management , in essence , all tendencies that in some manner or other support the popular struggle .
This notion is not a controversial issue among us .
We are already working along side other tendencies in the environmental , peace , anti-fascist and anti-capitalist movements .
The problem comes for anarchists when the pressure of social movements gives rise to populist , democratic socialist or revolutionary  governments .
Examples of these are to found in Bolivia , Venezuela and Ecuador .
How do we , as resolute anti-statists , relate to governments , which in some manner , reflect and act according to the needs and desires of the social movements and the working population ?
How we react to these situations can be fraught with danger to our movement .
In the past , anarchists have reacted in two opposing and erroneous ways .
One might be called liquidationalism .
Here anarchists give up their distinct program and dissolve themselves into the governing revolutionary  tendency .
During the Russian Revolution , thousands of anarchists joined the Bolsheviks or formed - Bolshevik inspired organizations in their respective nations .
Needless to say , the Bolsheviks did not enact our program !
After The 26 July Movement made its turn toward the Communist Party , and Cuban anarchists were suppressed , many anarchists outside Cuba tended to ignore the plight of their comrades out of solidarity with the Cuban Revolution .
Liquidationalism means giving up on anarchism entirely , in exchange for a bit of social progress , and sometimes not even that .
I think that liquidationalism comes about through anarchist weakness .
There had been few attempts at anarchist revolution prior to 1917 , and anarchism had growing pains . 
Bolshevism seemed to show the way .
The early 1960's were the nadir of the anarchist movement and a lot of anarchists looked for anything to be optimistic about , and Cuba seemed to fit the bill .
Since anarchism today is a growing force , I do not see liquidationalism as a major problem , though , of course , one never knows for sure .
Sectarianism is the other error .
Surprise , surprise , democratic socialists and populists are not anarchists !
We cannot expect them to carry out our program , but we can expect them to carry out the aspects of their own program that help the populace .
If they do this , should they be condemned as enemies as evil as the corporatists and oligarchs ?
What do the people think when anarchists damn these reformers ?
Sectarianism separates anarchists from the mass of the populace , who cannot understand why erstwhile revolutionaries are condemning the very actions which are improving their lives .
What is even worse , is when sectarianism leads to propaganda imitating the reactionaries .
According to the sectarian , the glass is never half - full , it is always empty .
Should reaction triumph , the sectarians will be tortured and killed along with the other tendencies , and their sectarianism will remain as a bitter taste in the mouths of a defeated people . ( 1 )
This is most particularly the case in Latin America where the mobilization of the populace immediately leads to polarization between the masses and the oligarchy and its supporters .
If the oligarchy gains the upper hand in this struggle the result is the suppression of popular movements , torture and massacre .
To think that one can stand aside during this polarization , or that it is " only a struggle between bourgeois factions and does n't concern us " is to live in a dream world .
One cause of sectarianism is fetishizing the alleged or actual lessons of the past .
The Bolsheviks turned on their anarchist allies , so too , Fidel Castro .
Wherever Stalinism took over , anarchists and other radical tendencies were eliminated .
From this tragic history comes an unspoken view that any revolution or government led by Marxists , real or alleged , will end up following this pattern .
But history does change not merely repeating itself like a rubber stamp .
Stalinism is not some Platonic Form , hovering in the cosmos , just waiting to manifest at the first outbreak of revolutionary change .
The alternatives to Stalinism  Trotskyism , democratic socialism and anarchism  were too weak in the 1940's and 50's .
Stalinism was hegemonic at this time .
But people learn what works and what does n't .
What was once seen as a viable model for revolutionary change  the one party state plus nationalization of productive wealth  is no longer seen as an answer .
It does not create the sort of society that anyone wants .
The movement away from the hegemony of the Stalinist model began in the late 1960's .
The Unidad Popular government of Chile attempted to create socialism , through a democratic process .
The Sandinista Revolution in Nicaragua did not go in a Stalinist direction .
Rather than suppressing all tendencies but their own , they favored a multi-tendency democracy  even for the right - wing , a kindness that was not acknowledged .
What then should anarchists do in the face of new revolutionary or progressive regimes that work to some measure in the interest of the population ?
First off ;
Our loyalty is to the people , not the government  or any government .
If the people support a progressive government it is because that government is responding to their wishes .
A direct frontal attack on such a government  until it truly begins to work against its supporters  is futile and creates a wedge between us and the people .
We should remain non-committal , as long as the government somehow acts in the popular interest .
When it deviates from that path , we criticize .
But there is also a way of criticizing that is not off - putting to the people .
That method is one of positive re-inforcement .
To never cease bringing up the need for direct democracy and self - management .
If the progressive government is reticent to go beyond words , our unending needling on these points will be a powerful criticism , yet will not be seen as a negative attack .
Our goal should be to push the progressive government , from below , to either the breaking point where it exposes its reactionary other face , or to where it begins to dissolve itself into popular power .
And if this process cannot be pushed to its libertarian fulfillment , we must win a strong base among the people , in the unions , neighborhoods and social organizations , to defend our gains and build a base for the next step in the struggle .
We must involve ourselves with the populace , if the people win some measure of self - government and decentralization , we should be there , pushing these measures to the full .
If the revolutionary government encourages coops , we should form them or join them , making sure they are autonomous and democratic .
Should reactionaries attempt to re-establish their rule through a coup , electoral fraud or invasion , we must be at the forefront of the resistance , not as government lackies , but as supporters of the popular movements the reactionaries will destroy if they regain power .
Our slogan should not be  Defend our Government , but  Defend the People ... our Neighborhoods , Trade Unions , Cooperatives etc. 
At no time must we ally with reaction , even verbally , no matter what our differences with the progressive government .
Personal Experiences
In 1972 a social democratic government ( NDP ) was elected in British Columbia for the first time .
At the same time , we were trying to build an anarchist movement .
There were maybe 25 or so people interested in anarchism , half of whom belonged to our group .
The NDP government introduced " green belts " to protect the environment and agricultural reserves to protect the farm land from developers .
They raised welfare from $ 95 a month to $ 160 and created a form of decentralized democratic control of the welfare system .
They abolished beating children in school and other repressive legislation .
Rather than denouncing them for supposedly co-opting the environmental movement and community control , which sectarians would have done , we said nothing .
To ourselves , we were pleased with what they did and were too busy trying to create an anarchist movement to spend time attacking them , which would have been the flea denouncing the elephant anyway .
What did happen was that half our group became so entranced with the progressive actions of the government they wanted to join the NDP as a bloc and push for further community control .
When we refused , the liquidationalist faction broke away and joined on their own .
We denounced them and for some time there was bitter hostility between the two groups .
The anarchists that remained went on to create the Vancouver anarchist milieu which exists to this day .
As for the " NDP anarchists " , we eventually became friends again and they remained sympathetic to anarchism , also to this very day .
In retrospect , liquidationalism arose because people did not have a full understanding of anarchism .
The experience of the sectarianism found in the left sects generated an over - reaction in the opposite direction .
We also had no older , more experienced comrades to help us .
We were re-inventing the wheel , so to speak .
We were correct not to attack the NDP , but erred in not educating our membership as to the differences between social democracy and anarchism .
1. During the campaign to overthrow Allende , the CIA funded a strike of truck drivers .
The sectarians of the day crowed about the strike as an example of " class struggle " against the wicked Allende reformists .
Anarchism is more influential and wide - spread than at any time in the last 70 years .
And the movement continues to grow and develop .
This does not necessarily mean that we will become the predominate tendency .
Even during anarchism 's previous zenith  the years immediately after World War One  we had to share the stage with other socialist currents .
The most important and far - reaching anarchist movement  that of Spain in 1936  saw the formation of a united front involving the CNT - FAI , the left - communist POUM and rank and file militants of the Socialist trade unions .

From WikiLeaks
March 9 , 2009
By Mike Masnick ( Techdirt ) [ 1 ]
For years we 've been writing about various abuses of the patent system , and how they damage innovation .
There are times when we hear about abuses of the patent system that actually put lives in danger -- often around the pharmaceutical industry .
At least in that case , you can sometimes understand the basic reasoning ( even if it 's actually incorrect ) .
However , we recently came across an example of the patent system being abused in such an egregious manner that it 's putting many lives at stake ...
Bob Austin , who for many years has worked in major metropolitan fire and EMS departments , had the idea of creating an open source medical dispatch system .
Such a system would have numerous benefits .
Beyond being a free system , it also would allow best practices to easily bubble up in a way that actively would help save lives .
If another EMS department could improve on the system , they easily could do so and contribute it back to the community .
One of the parts of the system was a project called Cards 911 , which was a useful document for use by emergency dispatchers .
Basically , it gave them a simple script to follow when an emergency call came in , asking where they were , the nature of the emergency , how many people injured , etc .
The answers to certain questions would lead the dispatcher to different parts of the document using hyperlinks .
The entire document ( and , yes , it was just a document ) was created in OpenOffice Writer and was offered either as a document file or a PDF file .
In other words , this was basically a script with hyperlinks in it , that helped an emergency dispatcher get the necessary information , and help the caller as quickly as possible -- and it was free and open .
Who could possibly complain about that ?
Apparently the lawyers for a company called Priority Dispatch Corporation , who sent a legal nastygram listing out ten patents that the company held , which the lawyers implied the Cards 911 project violated .
Remember , this is a script written as a document .
The lawyers were careful never to actually say which of the ten patents the cards violated , but simply listed them all out and said " Our investigation has revealed that the ...
Guide Cards may infringe on one or more of Priority Dispatch 's patents and / or copyrights . "
Not only that , but the lawyers then demanded that all physical and electronic copies of the documents be destroyed .
Given the position they were in , as open source developers doing this for the good of the public , rather than as any sort of business endeavor , the folks involved in the project complied with the demands of the lawyer .
They destroyed everything , both electronic and physical and agreed not to work on any emergency dispatch systems in the future .
The project is no longer available , and our emergency dispatch systems are that much worse off because of it .
Furthermore , in investigating this further , it appears that it would be impossible to craft any sort of competing product that lives up to NHTSA and ASTM official standards without violating Priority Dispatch 's patents , based on the what the company seems to believe they cover .
If you would like to see all ten patents for yourself , they 're listed here :
The whole situation is rather sickening , and I 'm really hoping that folks here might be able to help see if we can get this project back on track .
Priority Dispatch 's decision to scare these open source developers into submission for merely offering up a free project to help save lives is really a rather disgusting use of the patent system , and obviously goes against the very purpose of that system : " to promote the progress of science and the useful arts . "
Instead , such things are being actively stymied in a way that puts all of us at risk .
The folks working on this project have no money ( and no intention of making any money from the project ) , but they could use some help .
In my discussions with them , they simply wanted me to know about their story , and were n't asking for help per se , but it would be great if we could , as a community , come up with ways to get this project moving again , so that we can all be safer .
If anyone has thoughts or ideas on how to help Bob , please let us know in the comments , and let 's see what can be done .
At the very least , please help spread this story and let others know about it .
First seen on Techdirt .
Thanks to Mike Masnick and Techdirt for covering these documents .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A warning of more attacks on UK bankers was made on Wednesday after the home of former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin was vandalized .
A recovery vehicle removes a Mercedes from the Edinburgh home of Fred Goodwin .
Windows were smashed in Goodwin 's house in the Scottish capital Edinburgh and those of a Mercedes - Benz limousine parked outside .
It is not known if anyone was at home at the time .
Goodwin -- dubbed " Fred the Shred " by the media for his ruthless cost - cutting -- and his family have not been living in the house since it was revealed that the 50 - year - old Goodwin was receiving an annual pension of $ 1 million ( £ 700,000 ) for life .
A statement issued to media organizations including the Press Association after the attack said : " We are angry that rich people , like him , are paying themselves a huge amount of money and living in luxury , while ordinary people are made unemployed , destitute and homeless .
" Bank bosses should be jailed .
This is just the beginning . "
No group was named in the message and it did not explicitly claim responsibility for the attack .
Goodwin took early retirement after RBS nearly collapsed amid the economic crisis and was later part - nationalized .
Watch more on the attack »
On the same day as the size of his pension was revealed RBS announced a UK record loss of $ 34.6 billion ( £ 24.1 billion ) for 2008 .
Politicians and commentators have expressed fury about the deal and excessive bonuses being given by bailed - out banks .
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling , head of the Treasury , urged Goodwin to give up his pension .
He refused , saying he had already given up a number of contractual rights which had cost him a lot of money .
Watch consternation at Goodwin's £ 16 million pension fund »
The statement warning of more attacks on bankers came days after AIG sent a memo to employees giving them security advice as fury grows in the U.S. over millions paid out in bonuses by the bailed - out U.S. insurance giant .
Employees were warned not to wear the company logo , to travel in pairs and park in well - lit places , and to phone security if they notice anyone " spending an inordinate amount of time near an AIG facility . "
AIG employees have received death threats since the company handed out $ 165 million ( £ 115 million ) in bonuses and security at AIG offices has been increased .
And last month British police warned that officers were preparing for a " summer of rage " as protests mount across Europe against the economic crisis .
David Hartshorn , who heads the Metropolitan Police 's public order branch , said growing unemployment , failing companies and the recession could spark a " mass protest . "
Hartshorn said the G - 20 economic summit starting next week could lead to unrest as leaders of the world 's richest nations head to London .

CNN ’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta has let it be known that he will not be leaving the network to become the next Surgeon General of the United States of America .
Gupta ’s name had been floated about , but he came under criticism for his opposition to health care reform .
The logical choice for Surgeon General would be Howard Dean .
According to the Washington Post , Dr. Gupta did n’t give a reason why he would turn down the job , but my guess is that his views , and the administration ’s on health care are not a good match .
Gupta has been widely criticized by Democrats for having a very comfortable relationship with the same exact drug companies that are a target of the current Obama healthcare reform .
In fact , a bi-partisan bill was introduced in the Senate yesterday to allow the importation of cheaper drugs , which is something that the drug companies have long fought against .
Many critics on the right and left thought Gupta was under qualified , and it appeared that he would have faced a tough confirmation process in the Senate .
Gupta was an odd choice for the post , and he probably did Obama a favor by turning down the job .
Let ’s face it , the last thing this administration needs is another problem with a nominee .
I have no idea what the thought process was that led to Gupta being offered the job , but he was n’t a good pick .

In my mind the best choice for this position would be the former chairman of the DNC , Dr. Howard Dean .
I was critical of Dean ’s tenure as DNC chair , but he is in step with Obama when it comes to healthcare reform .
He would be a credible and outstanding healthcare advocate for the nation .
Dean would bring a high profile voice to yet another position that was minimized under the Bush administration .
Dean would sail through the confirmation process , and he seems like he should be a no - brainer pick for Obama .

STOCKHOLM —
Three entertainment lawyers and a Swedish prosecutor demanded jail time Monday for the four defendants in The Pirate Bay trial , though they could n't agree on how much .
The prosecution is seeking a year in prison for each , while Hollywood is leaning toward the maximum two - year terms .
Defendants Fredrik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg , Peter Sunde and Carl Lundström face prison and fines as high as $ 180,000 , for alleged contributory copyright infringement .
In addition , motion picture and record companies are demanding $ 13 million in damages for 30 movies and music tracks they claim have been shared by internet users with the help of The Pirate Bay .
Prosecutor Håkan Roswall summed up his version of events in closing arguments Monday : Four criminal conspirators built a website for the purpose of promoting copyright infringement , and earned big bucks selling ad revenue on the site .
Roswall acknowledged that no pirated material was technically stored on or passed through Pirate Bay servers , but he compared the case to past prosecutions of criminal accomplices .
In a Supreme Court decision from 1963 , he noted , a defendant who held a friend 's coat while the friend beat someone up was considered an accomplice .
He also cited a ruling from 1996 in a case where copyrighted material was stored on the servers of the BBS owner , who was found liable .
Finally , Roswall looked to a 2000 case involving mp3 files linked from a web page .
He argued the case showed that merely linking to a pirated work was enough to sustain a piracy conviction .
Roswall ended his argument by demanding one year in jail for each of the defendants — half of the maximum term .
He asked for fines amounting to The Pirate Bay 's gross income from advertising revenue on the site .
He was able to document the equivalent of $ 180,000 in income from ad sales on the site , but he argued that the actual numbers are likely quite higher .
Roswall claimed the site runs as many as 64 concurrent ads , which he said earned it some 10 million kronor — about $ 1.2 million .
" That is pure fiction , " defendant Fredrik Neij protested in the intermission .
" There are four banner spaces , not 64 .
They have counted different versions of the same ads . "
" I was startled to hear the nasty old man settling for one year only , " said co-defendant Gottfrid Svartholm Warg .
" I had expected two years .
Where are my 10 million kronor , please ?
I want them , where are they ? "
Monique Wadsted of the Motion Pictures Association took the most aggressive stance Monday , and demanded the maximum two years in jail .
The Pirate Bay defendants , she said , had created a " gigantic pirate copying factory " on the internet .
Recording industry lawyer Peter Danowsky asked for " the full market price " for each music download facilitated by The Pirate Bay , plus markups ranging from 100 percent to 20 times the retail price for
" market disturbances " and other injuries .
He mentioned alleged Pirate
Bay financier Carl Lundström , a wealthy businessman who provided ISP
hosting for the site , as a specific target for damages .
Henrik Pontén , representing the computer game industry and Swedish films , said he wanted an extra damage award to cover the loss of
" goodwill " sustained by his clients when their pirated content was featured alongside adult services ads on The Pirate Bay .
Pontén also argued for jail time , predicting that a conviction that resulted in just fines and damages would only be another trophy to The
Pirate Bay 's crew .
The judgment would wind up posted in same section as the years of takedown notices from corporate attorneys around the world , he said .
The trial concludes Tuesday with the defendants ' closing statements .
Our nation is in deep doodoo !
Bankrupt , the world 's largest debtor nation , and with our manufacturing ability lost to other countries , the economic outlook is not quite as rosy as the government would have you believe .
VOTE FRAUD AND THE BANKRUPTCY OF THE UNITED STATES .
Your portion of the federal debt is about $ 50,000 dollars , plus interest acrueing every single day .
Your permission for the government to borrow money and your agreement to pay that debt and interest is based on the assumption that you voted for the politicians who do the borrowing .
But in an age where vote fraud has hit epidemic levels , is that assumption really accurate ?
If elections are being stolen , if the future course of the country is decided not by voters but by the vote counters , are you really obligated to pay that huge debt ?
FAKE TERROR - THE ROAD TO DICTATORSHIP .
Originally posted on Free Republic , and copied from there to web sites around the world , this article describes the long history of government sponsored acts of terror against their own people for political purposes .
Canada 's twin --- the two were parted at birth --- is Australia .
Like all permanently separated twins , living very far apart , the differences between them are enormous .
In Australia 's night sky , you see the Southern Cross , which Canadians never see , while Canadians look up at the Great Dipper and the North Star , which is never visible to Australians .
In Australia , the sun always moves to the left in the sky and in Canada it always moves to the right .
That said , the twins share striking similarities .
Canada and Australia were established as settler colonies whose founding populations occupied territories that had been the homelands of aboriginal peoples for thousands of years , in the case of Australia for about forty thousand years , in the case of Canada for ten or twelve thousand years .
French settlement in what is now Canada began in the early 17th century .
Permanent British settlement in Australia commenced in the late 18th century .
And while the conflict between France and Britain for control of Canada and the permanent fact of English and French populations were a defining feature of Canadian existence , both countries came of age as continent - spanning enterprises during the Victorian age at the height of British imperial power .
In downtown Toronto , Sydney and Melbourne , Victorian British street names --- King , Queen , Albert , Wellington , York etc. --- enjoy pride of place .
Sparsely populated countries with large diverse sophisticated cities , Australia and Canada are advanced nations that rely enormously on their role as commodity producers that export their products to other countries .
For over a century , the two countries have been rivals in the production of wheat and other grains to meet the demands of global markets for these commodities .
Times of high prices have been a boon to farmers in Manitoba , Saskatchewan and Alberta , as well as in South Australia , Victoria and New South Wales .
Similarly when prices fall , farmers in these regions , though they are separated by thousands of kilometers , have suffered simultaneously .
Australia and Canada share a history of making enormous public investments to construct roads , railways , other infrastructure , and educational facilities in regions whose economies are devoted to farming , as well as to the extraction of coal , iron ore , uranium and other resources for export markets .
The public in both countries has been saddled with the high fixed costs that go with expenditures to support primary products industries .
When commodity markets boom , Australia and Canada prosper .
When commodity markets go bust as they have during the present economic crisis , their economies suffer .
The rise and fall of external demand for products from minerals to wheat and the changing technology that affects the value of specific commodities is a major source of economic vulnerability in Australia and Canada .
In the early years of the 21st century , Australia and Canada are respectively the hot and cold twins and the dry and wet twins .
Both countries are highly vulnerable to the threat of climate change although in quite different ways .
Much of Australia , especially the south and southeastern states of South Australia and Victoria and much of Western Australia have experienced a severe drought for many years .
Adelaide , the fine English style city that is the capital of South Australia , was parched when I visited in February 2009 .
The Barossa Valley , just north of the city , is one of Australia 's most prestigious wine producing regions .
When I toured it by bus , the vineyards were sparkling green thanks to massive irrigation efforts .
But the surrounding countryside was brown and dry , with the beds of streams completely dry and rivers reduced to a trickle .
Our guide spoke continually about the rising threat to wildlife and human activities as a consequence of the drought .
Later on a tour through the Grampian Mountains and along the Great Ocean Road in the State of Victoria , the consequences of drought and of fire , its dark companion , were even more starkly apparent .
A couple of weeks earlier over two hundred people had died in the terrible fires in Victoria in the worst natural disaster in the history of Australia .
Without being too apocalyptic about it , the viability of heavily populated regions of Australia is at stake as a consequence of potential long - term shortages of water and the threat of climate change .
While Canada 's supply of fresh water is much more ample than Australia 's , there are important regional exceptions .
The western prairies have been afflicted with major droughts .
The massive use of fresh water in the process of producing synthetic crude oil in the Alberta oil sands poses a threat to the supply of water available to meet the needs of agriculture , industries and cities .
The oil sands , it should be noted , are the largest source of green house gas emissions in Canada .
In that sense , Canada 's oil sands emissions add to the greenhouse effect that is generating climate change , not least in Australia as well as in Canada 's north , where temperatures have been rising with dire consequences for the wildlife of the region .
The global markets for Australian and Canadian commodities plunged in 2008 and the currencies of both countries dropped appreciably against the U.S. dollar .
Australia and Canada rode high during the commodity boom , especially Canada , whose oil industry roared ahead as the price of oil peaked in July 2008 .
Given the structures of their economies , with their dependence on commodity exports , both countries waited anxiously for the return to economic health of the countries that were home to their export markets .
The conundrum of Canadians and Australians is that of prosperous peoples with plenty of capital of their own in a world that is entering a new age .
Do these countries that have served as suppliers of primary products for others have to remain in that role in the future ?
In a time when the key to the future is development that is sustainable , can other options open for these peoples ?
It would make a good deal of sense for Canadians and Australians who are thinking about the crash and its aftermath to consider these questions together .
The similarities and differences between Australia and Canada should provoke sparks of insight helpful to these long separated twins .

A couple of bright friends reported to me some overriding themes at the PDAC gathering in Toronto last weekend .
Apparently , some surprise came to them .
They mentioned that more than a few analysts , writers , and speakers still do not get it .
They actually believe the situation with the USEconomy and US banking system has begun to stabilize .
That is like saying a college basketball player has Michael Jordan under control , or a farmer has his Clydesdale horse under control , or a misguided King can call back the ocean tide , or a man has a hurricane under control as he clings to a roof rafter .
The USEconomy has entered an accelerated phase of disintegration , while the populace has entered a new panic phase .
The US stock market is under the microscope , and it just broke a key multi- year critical support level .
This article is intended to be constructive , with a list of perceived meters and conditions , followed by a four - step foundation for a recovery .
When finished reading the four planks , one should easily conclude that no solution , let alone attempt , is on the correct path or is in the works .
Therefore the plan for individuals , who have been betrayed on a colossal scale , must defend themselves by exiting all assets and hunkering into cash .
The betrayal lies at the feet of bankers , politicians , military brass , and corporate chiefs .
By the way , cash is prescribed in that perfectly crafted document called the US Constitution .
Gold & silver are the only forms of money that can legally satisfy debts public and private .
That near perfect document has also been betrayed , with even the last president calling it a ' mere piece of paper ' incredibly .
The financial problems of the nation took deep root with the Vietnam War and the subsequent abrogation of the Bretton Woods Accord that had forged the US $ - Gold linkage .
The analysts , pundits , bankers , and politicos seem to have totally lost sight of this basic fact .
Their deep error , along with profound corruption , will be centerpieces in the next chapters written in history .
My rational and considered belief is that gold , as well as crude oil , will be anchors to the next global reserve currencies .
What better route to stabilize both financial and commercial price systems ?
Those who believe that the USDollar will prevail and survive this turmoil as the global reserve currency are precisely as incorrect as those who believed the US banking system could survive the mortgage debacle as it unfolded .
We are witnessing a long slow drawn - out death experience for the USDollar , liquidation of the USEconomy , to be followed by a default by the USTreasury Bonds .
During the panic phase , the response in the gold & silver prices will be profound , with advances to date only a prelude to a march to $ 2000 gold and $ 50 silver .
CRESCENDO AFTER ETHICS ORIGINAL SIN
The topic of fraud has clearly been in the news often in the last two years .
The mortgage fraud was for a while covered up by its framing as a subprime problem , but no longer .
The counterfeit of Fannie Mae mortgage bonds , estimated at well over $ 1 trillion , has been essentially kicked under the rug on USGovt hallways following its nationalization .
The insider trading by Goldman Sachs is an example of outstanding and impressive executions , perpetrated with complete impunity .
The maze of unscrupulous , devious , and insidious fraudulent business units of JPMorgan is worthy of a 500 - page chapter in the US financial history treatise , someday to be written .
See the complete distortion of usury costs ( interest rates kept low ) by JPM , with such a volume of Interest Rate Swaps that was sufficient to run the Bond Vigilantes out of town .
Skewed cost of money is the foundation for speculative bubbles .
See the management of USTreasury Bonds by JPM on behalf of the Federal Reserve , along with the $ 2.2 trillion that they sold above and beyond the officially stated USGovt issuance of USTreasury Bonds .
That is called counterfeit evidence , the records for which were lost in the third building at the World Trade Center .
See the management by JPM of the Bank of Baghdad .
Twice as much money is missing from the Iraq Reconstruction Fund than was stolen by Bernie Madoff , up to $ 100 billion being estimated .
And never overlook the financial tentacles that extend from Afghan operations on the contraband side , to the Bank of Baghdad as the clearinghouse .
The quiet climaxes of fraud are seen with the Madoff Ponzi Scheme and other minor cases .
If you think that authorities are still looking for where Madoff hid the stolen money , then you must believe that the Wall Street mission is to assist in the capitalization process for US industry .
The majority of the Madoff funds are safely placed in the same location as much of the Wall Street ill - gotten gains .
My sources report that location to be banks within the tiny ally coastal nation north of Egypt and south of Syria , which with the urging of the last Administration , removed all extradition laws in recent years .
Trace back to find the original sin of the ethics violations , and you should find your feet squarely at the abrogation of the Bretton Woods Accord that cut the linkage between the USDollar and gold .
This is an ethics violation climax of historical proportions .
The pathogenesis of breakdown must join with fraud during the advance of foreign debt ownership , which resulted in lost sovereignty .
The hidden placation of foreign creditors results in hidden policy that does not cater to national interests of the United States anymore .
The breakdown that comes will enable foreign creditors to gather a wide swath of US properties ( residential homes , commercial property , factories , etc ) from USTreasury Bond and USAgency Mortgage Bond conversion to hard assets .
The teamwork , synergy , and innovation at the core financial engineering had been concentrated in what can be described at best as a national Ponzi enterprise of clean industry for the next millennium , and at worst on a grand network of fraudulent financial enterprise that includes fraudulent bonds , counterfeit bonds , narcotics , and arms dealing .
The response in the gold & silver prices to recognized official and private fraud will be profound , with advances to date only a prelude to a march to $ 2000 gold and $ 50 silver .
STOCKS ARE THERMOMETER
The major indexes of the US stock market are in the news daily , and viewed by the public as perhaps the most important concurrent signal of the crisis .
Technical chart analysts warn that the breakdown below the 2002 - 2003 support levels sounds an extremely loud alarm , paints a large billboard warning , and should be taken seriously as a dire development .
Novices might not recognize the pattern below in the S&P500 index , but experienced analysts surely do .
It is a long - term DoubleTop Head & Shoulders reversal pattern .
It is a Mother of Reversal Patterns .
Its base is roughly at 775 , its top at 1550 , which indicates a target of nearly zero .
Not only are private wealth accounts being cut down but pension funds as well .
Individuals invest much more in stocks than pension funds , which are diversified into bonds and commercial property .
All asset groups are suffering .
The public has begun to respond in minor panic to the stock market declines , as private telephone calls testify .
Expect another decline of 25 % to 35 % on both the S&P index and Dow Jones Industrial Index .
With each passing month comes more specific evidence of economic deterioration or disintegration , coupled with mammoth additional bank losses .
They push stocks down .
The key drivers seem to be job loss and big financial firm loss .
See the history making $ 100 billion AIG annual loss , the ongoing hemorrhage at Citigroup and Bank of America , the gigantic extensions of cash from the USGovt to big banks .
The claptrap propaganda coming from Wall Street centers on price multiples against earnings .
The problem is that earnings are evaporating , and the PE ratio argument is empty .
The response in the gold & silver prices to the deep stock declines , cratered pensions , and loss of life savings will be profound , with advances to date only a prelude to a march to $ 2000 gold and $ 50 silver .
RETAIL IS THE BAROMETER
Over 80 thousand retail stores closed in 2008 .
The forecast from expert corners is for another 120 thousand retail shutdowns in 2009 .
Numerous retail chains have gone out of business , with the list expected to more than double in 2009 and 2010 .
Recall retail consumption had been the boasted foundation of the USEconomy , the engine of growth to the global economy , by inept clueless hack economists for at least a decade .
The national guidance from the economic counsel staffs continues to utter heresy that spending is healthy , when sound economic reason dictates that investment in productive enterprise is the key to any solution .
This blight is very difficult to hide from the American public , as they pass the partially and completely shutdown malls , mini-malls , and small office strip malls during their daily lives .
The feedback loops are indeed vicious , as reduced spending means job cuts , even though they are low - paid jobs .
Bear in mind that the construction and operation of retail shopping malls does not constitute investment in an economy toward its productive capacity , but rather creation of a pathway to liquidate and spend home equity on the path to foreclosure and bankruptcy .
In my view , retail serves as a barometer on what to expect in the near term future .
The crisis collapse in the car industry echoes loudly the retail woes , as annual sales decline range from 40 % to 50 % per brand .
The response in the gold & silver prices to the blight in shopping malls , retail crash , and car collapse will be profound , with advances to date only a prelude to a march to $ 2000 gold and $ 50 silver .
FORECLOSURES ARE THE LEADING INDICATOR
In 4Q2008 , the rate of foreclosures rose by 53 % .
No stability whatsoever is evident .
The only good news is that the rate of FC is no longer 100 % on an annual basis .
So a deceleration is in progress .
Maybe in one year 's time , the FC annual growth rate will only be 30 % to 35 % , with some luck .
The Mortgage Bankers Assn reported today that the mortgage delinquency rate rose by two percentage points to 7.88 % by year end 2008 , and the foreclosure rate rose to 3.3 % also .
The total in DQ or FC rose from 10.1 % in 3Q2008 to 11.2 % in 4Q2008 .
So one home loan in nine is late or dead .
Also , an estimated 20 % of American homes are in negative equity situations , with loan balances in excess of their home values .
As the delinquencies convert to foreclosures , the bloated home inventory for sale will remain at elevated levels .
In fact , they are grossly under - stated , since banks are rotating foreclosed properties on their books in order to avoid a further flood on the bloated condition .
REO properties by banks are a hot topic .
To be sure , a few dozen or a few hundred or perhaps even a thousand home loans might receive actual aid by the USGovt .
The number of home loans to receive some form of official aid is proposed to benefit one in nine , coincidentally .
Time will tell to what extent any new legislation on so - called ' cramdowns ' takes root .
Bankruptcy judges might soon have the power to dictate to a bank that it reduce home loan balances , seeking a level of affordability relative to proved income .
The home loan aid process is incredibly slow , while the pace of economic decline is accelerating .
Be sure to know that households in foreclosure , or in delinquency , or even in chronic insolvency from an under - water home loan do not spend money , and generally cut back on expenses , even enter a bunker mentality under siege .
The response in the gold & silver prices to the household insolvency and foreclosure process will be profound , with advances to date only a prelude to a march to $ 2000 gold and $ 50 silver .
JOBS ARE THE LIGHTNING ROD
Nothing captures the attention of the public like the reports on job loss .
Sudden income loss is often devastating .
The continuing claims for jobless in the official aggregate records eclipsed the 5 million mark in late February .
When the USGovt announces back - to - back months of over 500 thousand ( half a million ) job losses , the public will surely notice and scream from rooftops .
Of course , the number is probably worse , since official agencies are urged to put the best face of their tilted figures .
In the coming months , expect the number of monthly job losses to surpass the one million mark .
As that occurs , the national level of concern will surely morph into some form of panic , with disorder to follow , and civil disobedience rampant .
Calls for extreme action by the USGovt will be made , as though they control any solutions at all .
In fact , look for their collective actions to greatly aggravate the national economic ills , with time release to occur down the road .
After all , they sell hope .
The response in the gold & silver prices to horrendous job loss will be profound , with advances to date only a prelude to a march to $ 2000 gold and $ 50 silver .
POLITICIANS REPEAT HISTORICAL ERRORS
The honeymoon is almost over for the new president .
His cabinet staff comes from the same crowd within the establishment responsible for the financial collapse .
They just wear different colored jackets , coming from the Clinton Camp instead of the Bush Camp .
In my view , they are almost all turncoats to the nation .
The federal budget for next year has centerpieces of tax increases ( up 33 % on income , up 100 % on capital in the form of dividends ) , removal of some tax deductions for home mortgages , and a $ 20.4 billion defense budget increase .
Obama even mentions measures that harken protectionism .
Some of these main items are in a state of flux , as the errors of their ways are being re-evaluated .
One should not increase taxes during a recession .
One should not tax capital during a capital liquidation .
One should not tax energy production during price instability .
One should not discourage home purchase during a housing bear market .
One should not increase military spending , when money is desperately needed for domestic purposes .
These are classic political errors that will render additional harm to the current economic and financial crisis .
The Glass - Steagal Law to prevent collapse of the financial system was removed late in the 1990 decade .
Dominos can now fall , as it is joined at the hips from banking , stock brokerage , and insurance .
Its scrap was a Pet Project of former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , again the Poster Boy of financial failure and fraud ( see his gold leasing multi- year project ) .
His was the stolen 1990 decade of prosperity .
The damage is therefore certain to run across the primary financial sectors for a long painful sequence in time .
The insurance firms are next to fall .
Watch Prudential , MetLife , Hartford , and Lincoln .
History is being actively ignored .
" What experience and history teach is this : that people and governments never have learned anything from history , or acted on principles deduced from it . "
These words were spoken by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel ( 19th century German philosopher ) .
Few observers seem to realize that on the spectrum , the distance between Fascism ( battle cry of last eight years ) and Socialism ( battle cry since inauguration ) is remarkable short .
Socialism shares the misery , as the successful are forced to pay for the failures , the corrupt , and the lazy .
To construe that nationalization and absence of profit motive represent movement in the direction of communism seems very much correct .
The Politburo at the US Federal Reserve has done its job since irrational exuberance took root .
The response in the gold & silver prices to USGovt policies that amplify the damage to the national condition will be profound , with advances to date only a prelude to a march to $ 2000 gold and $ 50 silver .
BANKERS FUND FAILURE & FRAUD
For over a year , a clear trend has been set in stone .
The USFed and USCongress ( aid & abet ) have been on course to redeem fraudulent bonds , to fund almost exclusively the largest banks , and to deny credit supply to the mainstream .
Unwritten orders were given by the USFed and Goldman Sachs henchmen who dominate the Treasury Dept for banks receiving TARP funds not to lend , but rather to acquire smaller banks in distress .
All this while the regulators have been obviously given orders to sit on their hands or to aid the acquisitions and mergers ( see the FDIC and Bair efforts ) .
By the way , the FDIC fund is almost empty .
The inescapable conclusion is that proper credit supply to profitable and promising enterprise is being obstructed , thus strangling the USEconomy .
The nationalization of AIG and Fannie Mae was more designed to hide credit derivative explosions , to bury a mountain of counterfeit bonds , and to prevent a shutdown of perhaps over one hundred thousand businesses .
The AIG conglomerate insures 70 k individuals , over 100 k businesses , and has 74 million customers .
Without insurance or bonded coverage , many businesses would have been forced to close operations .
The response in the gold & silver prices to misdirection of credit toward failure and fraud , and to exclude the healthy promise of private enterprise will be profound , with advances to date only a prelude to a march to $ 2000 gold and $ 50 silver .
A GENERATION OF LOST WEALTH
Much talk has come of a lost decade of wealth .
A hint has come in the last few days of a lost generation of wealth , a cry which will reverberate very soon .
This is real .
This is accurate .
This is a legitimate claim .
My forecast is for housing prices to fall at least to those seen in 1988 - 1990 , maybe lower .
The stock market indexes could easily fall to the same levels they showed during those years , based upon powerful momentum and soured psychology .
One should really examine the root causes and likely consequences from diverse liquidation amidst economic deterioration .
The USEconomy can easily be described , as a result of unchecked credit growth combined with financial engineering hidden by a shadow banking system , to have been little more than a phony expansion of a national bubble for a full generation since that important 1971 year , when the USDollar broke ties with gold .
The palpable risk is for much of the accumulated wealth for perhaps over 30 years to gradually be lost .
If so , then a failure of state is assured .
If so , then the national debt in the form of USTreasury Bonds cannot possible remain viable .
The two best single indicators in my view , among numerous , for judging the prospect of such calamities are these .
1 ) The USTBond credit default swap has risen from a mere one basis point a few years ago to a full 1.0 % now .
That is a 100 - fold rise , and ranks among the worst in the world , along with the United Kingdom .
2 ) The BKX bank stock index has broken down in repeated fashion , the most recent being a month ago , fully forecasted by the Jackass .
Today the Citigroup stock fell below $ 1 per share .
The bank sector leads the stock market lower , and confirms the breakdown below critical support .
The response in the gold & silver prices to perceived decades of lost wealth will be profound , with advances to date only a prelude to a march to $ 2000 gold and $ 50 silver .
1ST STEP IN RECOVERY - REMOVAL OF WALL STREET
The elite power center is still in charge from Wall Street .
Their primary objectives are to avert a credit derivative meltdown , to prevent exposure of a bankrupt dead banking system from proper accounting , and to raid the public till ( more bailouts for fraud ) as much as is possible .
The USFed still refuses to reveal usage of the TARP funds from last autumn , in full defiance .
That Goldman Sachs executives continue to appear during official US Dept Treasury announcements on policy is a travesty .
TARP fund disbursement , along with control of surly Congressional members , was the job of Goldman Sachs henchmen employed as underlings at Treasury .
The travesty continues .
The Wall Street syndicate remains in firm control of Treasury .
They should be prosecuted , imprisoned , and ordered to give restitution to fraud victims .
Instead , they remain in control .
The official Stress Tests for big banks constitute yet another charade to endorse the channel of public funds into private banks .
The response in the gold & silver prices to continued syndicate control of public funds will be profound , with advances to date only a prelude to a march to $ 2000 gold and $ 50 silver .
2ND STEP - END FOREIGN WARS
War costs generally are horrific and serve as principal cause for massive indebtedness to the United States .
This has been the case since the Vietnam War .
Hundreds of billion $ are annually allocated without question to military budgets , war costs , foreign aid in support of military objectives , and elsewhere , all in crippling fashion .
Such chronic spending and industrial diversion has come for a generation without debate .
The next annual budget includes yet another sizeable increase for the defense budget .
The war in Afghanistan can be best described as Waterloo with a turban headdress .
The emphasis at the national level for construction and destruction has been centered on war initiatives , with shockingly little awareness of the ultimate millstone placed around the national neck for the United States .
Iraq Reconstruction
Funds have recently been reported to be the object of between $ 50 and $ 100 billion in missing funds !
Yet this news item was buried on back pages .
This has been a wellspring of corrupt slush funds that even touched Henry Kissinger 's hands .
The reconstruction should be focused within the US .
The response in the gold & silver prices to misallocation of priorities and funds toward war will be profound , with advances to date only a prelude to a march to $ 2000 gold and $ 50 silver .
3RD STEP - TRUE INFRASTRUCTURE
PROJECTS
Much talk has come for infrastructure projects that would fortify the USEconomy enough to provide traction toward recovery and sustenance .
Jobs would come on such projects .
To date , the projects are something of a joke .
Some actual measures on alternative energy seem like a trifling trickle .
Look to the Obama Stimulus package to see out of every $ 1 in funds , we have 14 cents of pork and 11 cents of stimulus , with a lot of political garbage typical of the last twenty years .
No change in makeup and mix .
In my view , a high - speed railway from Orange County California to Las Vegas Nevada does not qualify as manifested commitment to infrastructure .
What ?
The USGovt subsidizes shuttles to and from Disneyland and the Vegas casinos !!!
Thousands of bridges and tunnels and port facilities are in dire need of repair .
In my former hometown of Pittsburgh alone , several bridges are shut down as ancient and a hazard .
Pipelines for water , sewer , and energy supply are needed nationwide .
Expansion of airport facilities is sorely needed , like concourses , jetways , and air traffic control centers , not security rat mazes .
The infrastructure should include farms to harness the wind and sun , even to produce hydrogen gas from ocean water .
Such initiatives are nowhere to be seen , as the same old same old junk pork and garbage and home earmarks continue to prevail .
The response in the gold & silver prices to infrastructure waste and propaganda will be profound , with advances to date only a prelude to a march to $ 2000 gold and $ 50 silver .
4TH STEP - FACTORY RESTORATION
Any attempt to revive the nation with job creation and reconstruction would quickly expose the majority of observers ( except those who continue to sleep ) that the United States has an industrial base that is missing in action against a backdrop of a war economy .
The better description is abandoned , dispatched , and forfeited industrial base .
Unless and until the USEconomy reinstalls its factory foundation , returns significant portions of it from Asia ( especially China ) , and ensures adequate training to professional staffs , the nation cannot conceivable recover .
It is that simple , mainly because the challenge is not to put chunks of money in people 's hands to spend .
The challenge is to enable people to earn legitimate chunks of money to spend from viable jobs .
For a decade , the nation depended too much upon raiding home equity , upon jobs centered on the housing and mortgage industry , and upon extracting cash to spend on whatever they wished , whether productive , necessary , frivolous , or wasteful .
The monumental and highly visible destruction , dismantling , and deterioration of the US car industry highlights the damage done better than any words or graph .
The USGovt must encourage job creation on the Homeland soil , for factories , reconstruction , and alternative energy pursuits .
The Dept of Homeland Security seems much more intent on fencing the zones soon to morph into wasteland .
The industrial base is the most important structure to a national economy , not its financial sector .
The US has had its priorities backwards for almost two decades , putting financial engineering and its clean industry ahead of factories and their dirty effluent .
The smokestacks of Wall Street have poured out noxious gases that finally have rendered crippling damage .
The response in the gold & silver prices to continued factor ruin will be profound , with advances to date only a prelude to a march to $ 2000 gold and $ 50 silver .
Let 's bring back recycling initiatives , which are so productive .
Here is a factoid worth thinking about .
One metric tonne of recycled paper usage saves an average of 5 large trees , saves 30 thousand liters ( ~7100 gallons ) of water , and requires 60 % less energy for pulp processing .
Conservative is a great element to fit into the industrial revitalization of America .

During Sunday ’s Oscar broadcast , there were three times the TV screen showed a gay kiss .
Not surprising , given a little film named Milk was up for a bunch of trophies .
And the camera also zeroed in on kissing kiss between two members of the opposite sex a total of 14 times .
But Fox News ’ Sean Hannity , a homophobe disguised as a concerned parent , focuses in on those gay kisses to ask why we need to expose our children to such a sexualized — and violent , apparently — culture .
The same could be asked of why we need to expose children to the hatred of his television show , but bigots do n’t listen to reason .

Excerpt :
' For 16 months , inmate William Coleman has been wasting away in state prisons on a hunger strike .
A man who once carried more than 250 pounds on his 5 - foot - 10 frame , the former soccer coach lost about 125 pounds , sustaining himself on liquids , before alarmed Department of Correction officials restrained and force - fed him .
...
Coleman 's attorneys say his protest is in the tradition of hunger strikes by women suffragettes in the early part of the 20th century and by Mahatma Gandhi in India 's struggle for independence from Britain .
In recent years , detainees at Guantanamo Bay have staged hunger strikes to protest conditions .
...
Coleman , a native of Liverpool , England , and the former women 's soccer coach at Central Connecticut State University , says an acrimonious divorce and custody battle landed him in prison .
He claims his ex-wife falsely accused him of raping her in 2002 in their Waterbury home to prevent him from getting custody of their two young sons . '

Icarus : Revisiting the Daedalus Starship
by Kelvin Long
Project Daedalus was the first thoroughly detailed study of an interstellar vehicle , producing a report that has become legendary among interstellar researchers .
But Daedalus was n’t intended to be an end in itself .
Tau Zero practitioner Kelvin Long here offers news of Project Icarus , a follow - up that will re-examine Daedalus in light of current technologies .
A scientist in the plasma physics industry and an aerospace engineer , Long is assembling the team that will begin this work in 2010 , following a ‘ Daedalus After 30 Years ’ symposium scheduled for September at the headquarters of the British Interplanetary Society .
Can we improve Daedalus ’ propulsion systems , change its targets , modify its shielding ?
Numerous theoretical studies await .
During the period 1973 - 1978 members of the British Interplanetary Society undertook a theoretical study of a flyby mission to Barnard ’s star , some 5.9 light years away .
This was Project Daedalus , which remains the most detailed study of an interstellar probe ever attempted .
The 54,000 ton two - stage vehicle was to be powered by inertial confinement fusion using electron beams to compress deuterium / helium - 3 fusion capsules to ignition .
Daedalus was to have obtained an eventual cruise velocity of 36,000 km /s or 12 % of light speed from over 700 kN of thrust , burning at a specific impulse of 1 million seconds .
Travel time to flyby at destination would be approximately 50 years .
Daedalus had three stated guidelines :
The spacecraft must use current or near - future technology .
The spacecraft must reach its destination within a human lifetime .
The spacecraft must be designed to allow for a variety of target stars .
Announcing Project Icarus
Project Icarus : Son of Daedalus – flying closer to another star .
This is the full name of the new study , a Tau Zero Foundation initiative in collaboration with the British Interplanetary Society ( BIS ) .
Over three decades have passed since the Daedalus work , making this a good time to revisit the design study in light of scientific and technological advancements .
The purpose of Project Icarus is as follows :
To design a credible interstellar probe that is a concept design for a potential mission this century .
To allow a direct technology comparison with Daedalus and provide an assessment of the maturity of fusion based space propulsion for future precursor missions .
To generate greater interest in the real term prospects for interstellar precursor missions that are based on credible science .
To motivate a new generation of scientists to be interested in designing space missions that go beyond our solar system .
Certain reference points follow on from the original Daedalus study , modified to reflect changes of time and circumstance .
Thus the spacecraft design must use current or near - future technology so that it could be credibly launched by 2050 .
It must be designed to reach its destination as quickly as possible , in a time - frame not exceeding sixty years but , hopefully , much sooner .
The propulsion system must be mainly fusion - based .
Assuming realistic maximum cruise speeds of 0.3 c and a sixty year flight duration , this places approximately forty - eight stars within an 18 light year distance within range of Icarus .
Genesis of a New Starship Study
In the introduction to the Daedalus study report Alan Bond states that :
“ … it is hoped that these ‘ cunningly wrought ’ designs of Daedalus will be tested by modern day equivalents of Icarus , who will hopefully survive to suggest better methods and techniques which will work where those of Daedalus may fail , and that the results of this study will bring the day when mankind will reach out to the stars a step nearer . ”
So in essence , the naming of the successor project as Icarus was suggested by the original study group .
Daedalus and Icarus were characters from ancient Greek mythology .
In an attempt to escape the labyrinthine prison of King Minos , Icarus ’ father Daedalus fashioned a pair of wings made of feathers and wax for both himself and his son .
But soaring joyfully through the sky , Icarus flew too close to the sun , melting the wax on his wings .
He fell into the sea and died after having ‘ touched ’ the sky .
Project Icarus aims to ‘ touch ’ the stars and escape from the bounds of mother Earth .
Toward an Evolving Design
An assessment of the many dozens of propulsion concepts for interstellar flight made it clear that one way to advance the prospects for interstellar travel would be to focus on a specific design proposal .
This way , a concept design could be derived , iterated and improved .
Over time , the concept would be worked upon by future generations and could ultimately lead to a design blueprint for an interstellar probe .
As the Daedalus study was performed three decades ago , it seemed appropriate to start by re-designing the Daedalus probe with updated scientific knowledge .
Thus the genesis of Project Icarus .
It is hoped that other teams around the world will eventually be assembled , working on specific propulsion proposals that have been investigated in the past , such as Starwisp , VISTA , AIMStar or one of the many others .
In this way , the technological maturity of different propulsion schemes can be improved over time , drawing on a common background of study rather than diverse and uncoordinated research efforts .
Needless to say , Centauri Dreams will provide regular updates on the progress of the Icarus design team , which will also be developing its own Web site in conjunction with the September symposium .
BANG ON TARGET : US gun sales have boomed in the past four months , boosting profits at gun-maker Smith & Wesson Co , whose stock price has more than tripled .
US gun sales have boomed in the past four months , boosting profits at gun-maker Smith & Wesson Co , whose stock price has more than tripled .
" I have been in business for years , and ( gun sales are ) a lot higher than at other times , " said gun-shop owner Darrin Green , who owns Double Eagle Firearms Inc in Arkansas City , Kansas .
Green said sales of handguns at his store have risen about 80 percent since November .
" I do n't have any in stock -- I can't keep them in stock . "
Eric Wold , an analyst with Merriman Curhan Ford , said the trend would translate directly into benefits for Smith & Wesson , the U.S. leader in handguns .
" The boost is really because people still do n't know what the Obama administration will do , " Wold said .
" So instead of trying to guess , you just buy anything while you can . "
Last Thursday , Smith & Wesson reported a higher - than - expected profit for the quarter ended January 31 , helped by a 62 percent growth in sales of handguns and tactical rifles .
Green said he has a backlog of more than 50 orders for Smith & Wesson handguns , compared with an inventory of 200 guns in November .
Recent data from the FBI 's National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) show background checks for firearm sales jumped 24 percent in January and 23.3 percent in February compared with a year earlier .
NICS background checks are necessary for individuals buying firearms from federally licensed retailers , and are a strong indicator of the number of actual sales .
Some experts also think that the unsettled economic conditions make people more concerned about increased crime rates , thus boosting gun sales .
" There has n't been any unrest , there has n't been any increase in crime , but concerns about that potential is one reason " for the higher sales , Wold said .
HITTING THE BULLSEYE
" Smith & Wesson 's product mix makes it a winner , " Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Rommel Dionisio said .
The areas that are hottest within the firearms industry , such as high - capacity rifles , are the areas where Smith & Wesson tends to have a large presence , he said .
The 157 - year - old company launched several new models in January and expects demand to rise for at least the next couple of quarters .
For the third quarter , sales of both Smith & Wesson pistols and revolvers were up around 45 percent , while sales of tactical rifles doubled .
Analysts also see Smith & Wesson benefiting from the recently enacted economic stimulus bill , which steers $ 4 billion to state , local and tribal law enforcement .
" Over the past couple of years , the company has been winning more than 80 percent of every law - enforcement and pistol contract coming up for bid , " Wold said .
Combining the potential benefits from hiring additional police officers and an accelerated gun-replacement cycle , Wold estimates incremental revenue of as much as $ 45 million to $ 147 million in the next two years for the company .
STRAW -MAN VILLAIN ?
However , opinions vary on whether stricter laws are in the offing .
The four - million - member National Rifle Association is convinced they are , and vows to fight any attempt to curb gun ownership .
" We believe that the Obama administration will try to make gun laws in this country more restrictive , " National Rifle Association spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said .
" We will do what we have done all along , which is to fight for the rights of law - abiding Americans . "
But others think such fears are overblown .
" I think the industry has set up a straw - man villain -- the possibility of major policy changes , when that 's not likely to happen , " Garen Wintemute , director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California 's Davis School of Medicine , said .
" Guns are consumer products , and this is just one more case of follow the money . "

The Rules of Disinformation
( Includes The 8 Traits of A Disinformationalist )

Built upon " Thirteen Techniques for Truth Suppression " by David Martin , the following may be useful to the initiate in the world of dealing with veiled and half - truth , lies , and suppression of truth when serious crimes are studied in public forums .
This , sadly , includes every day news media , one of the worst offenders with respect to being a source of disinformation .
Where the crime involves a conspiracy , or a conspiracy to cover up the crime , there will invariably be a disinformation campaign launched against those seeking to uncover and expose the truth and / or the conspiracy .
There are specific tactics which disinfo artists tend to apply , as revealed here .
Also included with this material are seven common traits of the disinfo artist which may also prove useful in identifying players and motives .
The more a particular party fits the traits and is guilty of following the rules , the more likely they are a professional disinfo artist with a vested motive .
People can be bought , threatened , or blackmailed into providing disinformation , so even " good guys " can be suspect in many cases .
A rational person participating as one interested in the truth will evaluate that chain of evidence and conclude either that the links are solid and conclusive , that one or more links are weak and need further development before conclusion can be arrived at , or that one or more links can be broken , usually invalidating ( but not necessarily so , if parallel links already exist or can be found , or if a particular link was merely supportive , but not in itself key ) the argument .
The game is played by raising issues which either strengthen or weaken ( preferably to the point of breaking ) these links .
It is the job of a disinfo artist to interfere with these evaluation ... to at least make people think the links are weak or broken when , in truth , they are not ... or to propose alternative solutions leading away from the truth .
Often , by simply impeding and slowing down the process through disinformation tactics , a level of victory is assured because apathy increases with time and rhetoric .
It would seem true in almost every instance , that if one cannot break the chain of evidence for a given solution , revelation of truth has won out .
If the chain is broken either a new link must be forged , or a whole new chain developed , or the solution is invalid an a new one must be found ... but truth still wins out .
There is no shame in being the creator or supporter of a failed solution , chain , or link , if done with honesty in search of the truth .
This is the rational approach .
While it
is understandable that a person can become emotionally involved with a particular side of a given issue , it is really unimportant who wins , as long as truth wins .
But the disinfo artist will seek to emotionalize and chastise any failure ( real or false claims thereof ) , and will seek by means of intimidation to prevent discussion in general .
Twenty - Five Rules of Disinformation
1 . Hear no evil , see no evil , speak no evil
2. Become incredulous and indignant
3. Create rumor mongers
4 . Use a straw man
5. Sidetrack opponents w name calling , ridicule
6. Hit and Run
7. Question motives
8. Invoke authority
9. Play Dumb
10 . Associate opponent charges with old news
11 . Establish and rely upon fall - back positions
12 . Enigmas have no solution
13 . Alice in Wonderland Logic
14 . Demand complete solutions
15 .
Fit the facts to alternate conclusions
16 . Vanish evidence and witnesses
17 . Change the subject
18 . Emotionalize , Antagonize , and Goad
19 .
Ignore facts , demand impossible proofs
20 .
False evidence
21 . Call a Grand Jury , Special Prosecutor
22 . Manufacture a new truth
23 . Create bigger distractions
24 . Silence critics
25 . Vanish
Eight Traits of The Disinformationalist
1. Avoidance
2. Selectivity
3. Coincidental
4. Teamwork
5. Anti-conspiratorial
6. Artificial Emotions
7. Inconsistent
8. Newly Discovered : Time Constant
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is the disinfo artist and those who may pull their strings ( those who stand to suffer should the crime be solved ) MUST seek to prevent rational and complete examination of any chain of evidence which would hang them .
Since fact and truth seldom fall on their own , they must be
overcome with lies and deceit .
Those who are professional in the art of lies and deceit , such as the intelligence community and the professional criminal ( often the same people or at least working together ) , tend to apply fairly well defined and observable tools in this process .
However , the public at large is not well armed against such weapons , and is often easily led astray by these time - proven tactics .
Remarkably , not even media and law enforcement have NOT BEEN TRAINED to deal with these issues .
For the most part , only the players themselves understand the rules of the game .
This why concepts from the film , " Wag The Dog , " actually work .
If you saw that movie , know that there is at least one real - world counterpart to Al Pacino 's character .
For CIA , it is Mark Richards , who was called in to orchestrate the media response to Waco on behalf of Janet Reno .
Mark Richards is the acknowledged High Priest of Disinformation .
His appointment was extremely appropriate , since the CIA was VERY present at Waco from the very beginning of the cult to the very end of their days -- just as it was at the People 's Temple in Jonestown .
Richards purpose in life is damage control .
For such disinformationalists , the overall aim is to avoid discussing links in the chain of evidence which cannot be broken by truth , but at all times , to use clever deceptions or lies to make select links seem weaker than they are , create the illusion of a break , or better still , cause any who are considering the chain to be distracted in any number of ways , including the method of questioning the credentials of the presenter .
Please understand that fact is fact , regardless of the source .
Likewise , truth is truth , regardless of the source .
This is why criminals are allowed to testify against other criminals .
Where a motive to lie may truly exist , only actual evidence that the testimony itself IS a lie renders it completely invalid .
Were a known ' liar 's ' testimony to stand on its own without supporting fact , it might certainly be of questionable value , but if the testimony ( argument ) is based on verifiable or otherwise demonstrable facts , it matters not who does the
presenting or what their motives are , or if they have lied in the past or even if motivated to lie in this instance -- the facts or links would and should stand or fall on their own merit and their part in the matter will merely be supportive .
Moreover , particularly with respects to public forums such as newspaper letters to the editor , and Internet chat and news groups , the disinfo type has a very important role .
In these forums , the principle topics of discussion are generally attempts by individuals to cause other persons to become interested in their own particular position , idea , or solution -- very much in development at the time .
People often use such mediums as a sounding board and in hopes of pollination to better form their ideas .
Where such ideas are critical of government or powerful , vested groups ( especially if their criminality is the topic ) , the disinfo artist has yet another role -- the role of nipping it in the bud .
They also seek to stage the concept , the presenter , and any supporters as
less than credible should any possible future confrontation in more public forums result due to their early successes .
You can often spot the disinfo types at work here by the unique application of " higher standards " of discussion than necessarily warranted .
They will demand
that those presenting arguments or concepts back everything up with the same level of expertise as a professor , researcher , or investigative writer .
Anything less renders any discussion meaningless and unworthy in their opinion , and anyone who disagrees is obviously stupid -- and they generally put it in exactly those terms .
So , as you read any such discussions , particularly so in Internet news groups ( NG ) , decide for yourself when a rational argument is being applied and when disinformation , psyops ( psychological warfare operations ) or trickery is the tool .
Accuse those guilty of the later freely .
They ( both those deliberately seeking to lead you astray , and those who are simply foolish or misguided thinkers ) generally run for cover when thus illuminated , or -- put in other terms , they put up or shut up ( a perfectly acceptable outcome either way , since truth is the goal . )
Here are the 25 methods and seven traits , some of which do n't apply directly to NG application .
Each contains a simple example in the form of actual ( some paraphrased for simplicity ) from NG comments on commonly known historical events , and a proper response .
Accusations should not be overused -- reserve for repeat offenders and those who use multiple tactics .
Responses should avoid falling into emotional traps or informational sidetracks , unless it is feared that some observers will be easily dissuaded by the trickery .
Consider quoting the complete rule rather than simply citing it , as others will not have reference .
Offer to provide a complete copy of the rule set upon request ( see permissions statement at end ) :
Twenty - Five Rules of Disinformation
Note :
The first rule and last five ( or six , depending on situation ) rules are generally not directly within the ability of the traditional disinfo artist to apply .
These rules are generally used more directly by those at the leadership , key players , or planning level of the criminal conspiracy or conspiracy to cover up .
1 . Hear no evil , see no evil , speak no evil .
Regardless of what you know , do n't discuss it -- especially if you are a public figure , news anchor , etc .
If it 's not reported , it did n't happen , and you never have to deal with the issues .
Example : Media was present in the courtroom ( Hunt vs. Liberty Lobby ) when CIA agent Marita Lorenz ' confession ' testimony regarding CIA direct participation in the planning and assassination of John Kennedy was revealed .
All media reported was that E. Howard
Hunt lost his libel case
against Liberty Lobby ( Liberty Lobby 's newspaper , The Spotlight , had reported Hunt was in Dallas that day and were sued for the story ) .
See Mark Lane 's remarkable book , " Plausible Denial , " for the full confessional transcript .
Proper response :
There is no possible response unless you are aware of the material and can make it public yourself .
In any such attempt , be certain to target any known silent party as likely complicit in a cover up .
In this case , it would be the entire Time - Warner Media Group , among
others .
This author is relatively certain that reporters were hand - picked to cover this case from among those having intelligence community ties .
2. Become incredulous and indignant .
Avoid discussing key issues and instead focus on side issues which can be used show the topic as being critical of some otherwise sacrosanct group or theme .
This is also known as the ' How dare you ! ' gambit .
Example : ' How dare you suggest that the Branch Davidians were murdered !
The FBI and BATF are made up of America 's finest and best trained law enforcement , operate under the strictest of legal requirements , and are under the finest leadership the President could want to appoint . '
Proper response :
You are avoiding the Waco issue with disinformation tactics .
Your high opinion of FBI is not founded in fact .
All you need do is examine Ruby Ridge and any number of other examples , and you will see a pattern of abuse of power that demands attention to charges
against FBI / BATF at Waco .
Why do you refuse to address the issues with disinformation tactics ( rule 2 - become incredulous and indignant ) ?
3. Create rumor mongers .
Avoid discussing issues by describing all charges , regardless of venue or evidence , as mere rumors and wild accusations .
Other derogatory terms mutually exclusive of truth may work as well .
This method which works especially well with a silent press ,
because the only way the public can learn of the facts are through such ' arguable rumors ' .
If you can associate the material with the Internet , use this fact to certify it a ' wild rumor ' from a ' bunch of kids on the Internet ' which can have no basis in fact .
' You can't prove his material was legitimately from French Intelligence .
Pierre Salinger had a chance to show his ' proof ' that flight 800 was brought down by friendly fire , and he did n't .
All he really had was the same old baseless rumor that 's been floating around the Internet for months . '
Proper response :
You are avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
The Internet charge reported widely is based on a single FBI interview statement to media and a similar statement by a Congressman , neither of which had actually seen Pierre 's document .
As the FBI is being accused in participating in a cover up of this matter and Pierre claims his material is not Internet sourced , it is natural that FBI would have reason to paint his material in a negative light .
For you to assume the FBI to have no bias in the face of Salinger 's credentials and unchanged stance suggests you are biased .
At the best you can say the matter is in question .
Further , to imply that material found on Internet is worthless is not founded .
At best you may say it must be considered carefully before accepting it , which will require addressing the actual issues .
Why do you refuse to address these issues with disinformation tactics ( rule 3 - create rumor mongers ) ?
4 . Use a straw man .
Find or create a seeming element of your opponent 's argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad .
Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent / opponent
arguments / situation , or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges .
Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges , real and fabricated alike , while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues .
Example :
When trying to defeat reports by the Times of London that spy - sat images reveal an object racing towards and striking flight 800 , a straw man is used .
The disinformationalist , later identified as having worked for Naval Intelligence , simply stated : ' If these images exist , the public has not seen them .
Why ?
They do n't exist , and never did .
You have no evidence and thus , your entire case falls flat . '
Proper response : ' You are avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
You imply deceit and deliberately establish an impossible and unwarranted test .
It is perfectly natural that the public has not seen them , nor will they for some considerable time , if ever .
To produce them would violate national security with respect to intelligence gathering capabilities and limitations , and you should know this .
Why do you refuse to address the issues with such disinformation tactics ( rule 4 - use a straw man ) ? '
5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule .
This is also known as the primary ' attack the messenger ' ploy , though other methods qualify as variants of that approach .
Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as ' kooks ' , ' right - wing ' , ' liberal ' , ' left - wing ' , ' terrorists ' , ' conspiracy buffs ' , ' radicals ' , ' militia ' , ' racists ' , ' religious fanatics ' , ' sexual deviates ' , and so forth .
This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label , and you avoid
dealing with issues .
Example : ' You believe what you read in the Spotlight ?
The Publisher , Willis DeCarto , is a well - known right - wing racist .
I guess we know your politics -- does your Bible have a swastika on it ?
That certainly explains why you support this wild - eyed , right - wing conspiracy theory . '
Proper response : ' You are avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
Your imply guilt by association and attack truth on the basis of the messenger .
The Spotlight is well known Populist media source responsible for releasing facts and stories well before mainstream media will discuss the issues through their veil of silence .
Willis DeCarto has successfully handled lawsuits regarding slanderous statements such as yours .
Your undemonstrated charges against the messenger have nothing to do with the facts or the issues , and fly in the face of reason .
Why
do you refuse to address the issues by use of such disinformation tactics ( rule 5 - sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule ) ?'
6. Hit and Run .
In any public forum , make a brief attack of your opponent or the opponent position and then scamper off before an answer can be fielded , or simply ignore any answer .
This works extremely well in Internet and letters - to - the - editor environments where a steady stream of new identities can be called upon without having to explain criticism reasoning -- simply make an accusation or other attack , never discussing issues , and never answering any subsequent response , for that would dignify the opponent 's viewpoint .
Example : '' This stuff is garbage .
Where do you conspiracy lunatics come up with this crap ?
I hope you all get run over by black helicopters . '
Notice it even has a farewell sound to it , so it wo n't seem curious if the author is never heard from again .
Proper response : ' You are avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
Your comments or opinions fail to offer any meaningful dialog or information , and are worthless except to pander to emotionalism , and in fact , reveal you to be emotionally insecure with these matters .
If you do not like reading ' this crap ' , why do you frequent this NG which is clearly for the purpose of such discussion ?
Why do you refuse to address the issues by use of such disinformation tactics ( rule 6 - hit and run ) ? '
7. Question motives .
Twist or amplify any fact which could be taken to imply that the opponent operates out of a hidden personal agenda or other bias .
This avoids discussing issues and forces the accuser on the defensive .
Example : ' With the talk - show circuit and the book deal , it looks like you can make a pretty good living spreading lies . '
Proper response : ' You are avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
Your imply guilt as a means of attacking the messenger or his credentials , but cowardly fail to offer any concrete evidence that this is so .
If you think what has been presented are ' lies ' , why not simply so illustrate ?
Why do you refuse to address the issues by use of such disinformation tactics ( rule 6 - question motives ) ?'
8. Invoke authority .
Claim for yourself or associate yourself with authority and present your argument with enough ' jargon ' and ' minutia ' to illustrate you are ' one who knows ' , and simply say it is n't so without discussing issues or demonstrating concretely why or citing sources .
' You obviously know nothing about either the politics or strategic considerations , much less the technicals of the SR - 71 .
Incidentally , for those who might care , that sleek plane is started with a pair of souped up big - block V - 8's ( originally , Buick 454 C.I.D. with dual 450 CFM Holly Carbs and a full - race Isky cams -- for 850 combined BHP @ 6,500 RPM ) using a dragster - style clutch with direct - drive shaft .
Anyway , I can tell you with confidence that no Blackbird has ever been flown by Korean nationals nor have they ever been trained to fly it , and have certainly never overflown the Republic of China in a SR or even launched a drone from it that flew over China .
I 'm not authorized to discuss if there have been overflights by American pilots . '
Proper response : ' You are avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
Your imply your own authority and expertise but fail to provide credentials , and you also fail to address issues and cite sources .
You simply cite ' Jane 's - like ' information to make us think you know what you are talking about .
Why do you refuse to address the issues by use of such disinformation tactics ( rule 8 - invoke authority ) ?'
9. Play Dumb .
No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered , avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility , make any sense , provide any proof , contain or make a point , have logic , or support a conclusion .
Mix well for maximum effect .
Example : ' Nothing you say makes any sense .
Your logic is idiotic .
Your facts nonexistent .
Better go back to the drawing board and try again . '
Proper response : ' You are avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
You evade the issues with your own form of nonsense while others , perhaps more intelligent than you pretend to be , have no trouble with the material .
Why do you refuse to address the issues by use of such disinformation tactics ( rule 9 - play dumb ) ?'
10 . Associate opponent charges with old news .
A derivative of the straw man -- usually , in any large - scale matter of high visibility , someone will make charges early on which can be or were already easily dealt with -- a kind of investment for the future should the matter not be so easily contained . )
Where it can be foreseen , have your own side raise a straw man issue and have it dealt with early on as part of the initial contingency plans .
Subsequent charges , regardless of validity or new ground uncovered , can usually then be associated with the original charge and dismissed as simply being a rehash without need to address current issues -- so much the better where the opponent is or was involved with the original source .
Example : ' Flight 553 's crash was pilot error , according to the NTSB findings .
Digging up new witnesses who say the CIA brought it down at a selected spot and were waiting for it with 50 agents wo n't revive that old dead horse buried by NTSB more than 20 years ago . '
Proper response : ' You are avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
Your ignore the issues and imply they are old charges as if new information is irrelevant to truth .
Why do you refuse to address the issues by use of such disinformation tactics ( rule 10 - associate charges with old news ) ?'
11 . Establish and rely upon fall - back positions .
Using a minor matter or element of the facts , take the ' high road ' and ' confess ' with candor that some innocent mistake , in hindsight , was made -- but that opponents have seized on the opportunity to blow it all out of proportion and imply greater criminalities which , ' just is n't so . '
Others can reinforce this on your behalf , later , and even publicly ' call for an end to the nonsense ' because you have already ' done the right thing . '
Done properly , this can garner sympathy and respect for ' coming clean ' and ' owning up ' to your mistakes without addressing more serious issues .
Example : ' Reno admitted in hindsight she should have taken more time to question the data provided by subordinates on the deadliness of CS - 4 and the likely Davidian response to its use , but she was so concerned about the children that she elected , in what she now believes was a sad and terrible mistake , to order the tear gas be used . '
Proper response : ' You are avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
Your evade the true issue by focusing on a side issue in an attempt to evoke sympathy .
Perhaps you did not know that CIA Public Relations expert Mark Richards was called in to help Janet Reno with the Waco aftermath response ?
How warm and fuzzy it makes us feel , so much so that we are to ignore more important matters being discussed .
Why do you refuse to address the issues by use of such disinformation tactics ( rule 11 - establish and rely upon fall - back positions ) ?'
12 . Enigmas have no solution .
Drawing upon the overall umbrella of events surrounding the crime and the multitude of players and events , paint the entire affair as too complex to solve .
This causes those otherwise following the matter to begin to loose interest more quickly
without having to address the actual issues .
Example : ' I do n't see how you can claim Vince Foster was murdered since you can't prove a motive .
Before you could do that , you would have to completely solve the whole controversy over everything that went on in the White House and in Arkansas , and even then , you would have to know a heck of a lot more about what went on within the NSA , the Travel Office , and the secret Grand Jury , and on , and on , and on .
It 's hopeless .
Give it up .'
Proper response : ' You are avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
Your completely evade issues and attempt others from daring to attempt it by making it a much bigger mountain than necessary .
You eat an elephant one bite at a time .
Why do you refuse to address the issues
by use of such disinformation tactics ( rule 12 - enigmas have no solution ) ?'
13 . Alice in Wonderland Logic .
Avoid discussion of the issues by reasoning backwards or with an apparent deductive logic which forbears any actual material fact .
Example : ' The news media operates in a fiercely competitive market where stories are gold .
This means they dig , dig , dig for the story -- often doing a better job than law enforcement .
If there was any evidence that BATF had prior knowledge of the Oklahoma City bombing , they would surely have uncovered it and reported it .
They have n't reported it , so there can't have been any prior knowledge .
Put up or shut up .'
Proper response : ' You are avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
Your backwards logic does not work here .
Has media reported CIA killed Kennedy when they knew it ?
No , despite their presence at a courtroom testimony ' confession ' by CIA operative Marita Lornez in a liable trial between E. Howard Hunt and Liberty Lobby , they only told us the trial verdict .
THAT , would have been the biggest story of the Century , but they did n't print it , did they ?
Why do you refuse to address the issues by use of such disinformation tactics ( rule 13 - Alice in Wonderland logic ) ?'
14 . Demand complete solutions .
Avoid the issues by requiring opponents to solve the crime at hand completely , a ploy which works best with issues qualifying for rule 10 .
Example : ' Since you know so much , if James Earl Ray is as innocent as you claim , who really killed Martin Luther King , how was it planned and executed , how did they frame Ray and fool the FBI , and why ?'
Proper response :
You are avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
It is not necessary to completely resolve any full matter in order to examine any relative attached issue .
Discussion of any evidence of Ray 's innocence can stand alone to serve truth , and any alternative solution
to the crime , while it may bolster that truth , can also stand alone .
Why do you refuse to address the issues by use of such disinformation tactics ( rule 14 - demand complete solutions ) ?
15 .
Fit the facts to alternate conclusions .
This requires creative thinking unless the crime was planned with contingency conclusions in place .
Example : ' The cargo door failed on Flight 800 and caused a catastrophic breakup which ruptured the fuel tank and caused it to explode . '
Proper response :
The best definitive example of avoiding issues by this technique is , perhaps , Arlan Specter 's Magic Bullet from the Warren Report .
This was eloquently defeated in court , but the media blindly accepted it without challenge .
Thus rewarded , disinformationalists do not shrink from its application , even though today , thanks in part to the movie , " JFK , " most Americans do now understand it was fabricated nonsense .
Thus the defense which works best may actually be to cite the Magic Bullet .
' You are avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
Your imaginative twisting of facts rivals that of Arlan Specter 's Magic Bullet in the Warren Report .
We all know why the impossible magic bullet was invented .
You invent a cargo door problem when there has been not one shred of evidence from the crash investigation to support it , and in fact , actual photos of the cargo door hinges and locks disprove you .
Why do you refuse to address the issues by use of such disinformation tactics ( rule 15 - fit facts to an alternate conclusion ) ?'
16 . Vanish evidence and witnesses .
If it does not exist , it is not fact , and you wo n't have to address the issue .
Example : ' You ca n't say Paisley is still alive ... that his death was faked and the list of CIA agents found on his boat deliberately placed there to support a purge at CIA .
You have no proof .
Why can't you accept the Police reports ? '
This is a good ploy , since the dental records and autopsy report showing his body was two inches too long and the teeth were n't his were lost right after his wife demanded inquiry , and since his body was cremated before she could view it -- all that remains are the Police Reports .
Handy .
Proper response :
There is no suitable response to actual vanished materials or persons , unless you can shed light on the matter , particularly if you can tie the event to a cover up other criminality .
However , with respect to dialog where it is used against the discussion , you can respond ...
' You are avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
The best you can say is that the matter is in contention ONLY because of highly suspicious matters such as the simultaneous and mysterious vanishing of three sets of evidence .
The suspicious nature itself tends to support the primary allegation .
Why do you refuse to address the remaining issues by use of such disinformation tactics ( rule 16 - vanish evidence and witnesses ) ?'
17 . Change the subject .
Usually in connection with one of the other ploys listed here , find a way to side - track the discussion with abrasive or controversial comments in hopes of turning attention to a new , more manageable topic .
This works especially well with companions who can ' argue ' with you over the new topic and polarize the discussion arena in order to avoid discussing more key issues .
Example : ' There were no CIA drugs and was no drug money laundering through Mena , Arkansas , and certainly , there was no Bill Clinton knowledge of it because it simply did n't happen .
This is merely an attempt by his opponents to put Clinton off balance and at a disadvantage in the election :
Dole is such a weak candidate with nothing to offer that they are desperate to come up with something to swing the polls .
Dole simply has no real platform . '
Assistant 's response .
' You idiot !
Dole has the clearest vision of what 's wrong with Government
since McGovern .
Clinton is only interested in raping the economy , the environment , and every woman he can get his hands on ...'
One naturally feels compelled , regardless of party of choice , to jump in defensively on that one ...
Proper response : ' You are both avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
Your evade discussion of the issues by attempting to sidetrack us with an emotional response to a new topic -- a trap which we will not fall into willingly .
If you truly believe such political rhetoric , please drop out of this discussion , as it is not germane , and take it to one of the more appropriate politics NGs .
Why do you refuse to address the issues by use of such disinformation tactics ( rule 17 - change the subject ) ?'
18 . Emotionalize , Antagonize , and Goad Opponents .
If you can't do anything else , chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated , and generally render their material somewhat less coherent .
Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance , but even if their emotional response addresses the issue , you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how ' sensitive they are to criticism . '
Example : ' You are such an idiot to think that possible -- or are you such a paranoid conspiracy buff that you think the ' gubment ' is cooking your pea - brained skull with microwaves , which is the only justification you might have for dreaming up this drivel . '
After a drawing an emotional response : ' Ohhh ... I do seem to have touched a sensitive nerve .
Tsk , tsk .
What 's the matter ?
The truth too hot for you to handle ?
Perhaps you should stop relying on the Psychic Friends Network and see a psychiatrist for some real professional help ...'
Proper response : ' You are avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
You attempt to draw me into emotional response without discussion of the issues .
If you have something useful to contribute which defeats my argument , let 's here it -- preferably without snide and unwarranted personal attacks , if you can manage to avoid sinking so low .
Your useless rhetoric serves no purpose here if that is all you can manage .
Why do you refuse to address the issues by use of such disinformation tactics ( rule 18 - emotionalize , antagonize , and goad opponents ) ?'
19 .
Ignore proof presented , demand impossible proofs .
This is perhaps a variant of the ' play dumb ' rule .
Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums , claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by ( it may exist , but not be at his disposal , or it may be something which is known to be safely destroyed or withheld , such as a murder weapon . )
In order to completely avoid discussing issues , it may be required that you to categorically deny and be critical of media or books as valid sources , deny that witnesses are acceptable , or even deny that statements made by
government or other authorities have any meaning or relevance .
Example : ' All he 's done is to quote the liberal media and a bunch of witnesses who are n't qualified .
Where 's his proof ?
Show me wreckage from flight 800 that shows a missile hit it !'
Proper response : ' You are avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
You presume for us not to accept Don Phillips , reporter for the Washington Post , Al Baker , Craig Gordon or Liam Pleven , reporters for Newsday , Matthew Purdy or Matthew L. Wald , Don Van Natta Jr. , reporters for the New York Times , or Pat Milton , wire reporter for the Associated Press -- as being able to tell us anything useful about the facts in this matter .
Neither would you allow us to accept Robert E. Francis , Vice Chairman of the NTSB , Joseph Cantamessa Jr. , Special Agent In Charge of the New York Office of the F.B.I. , Dr. Charles Wetli , Suffolk County Medical Examiner , the Pathologist examining the bodies , nor unnamed Navy divers , crash investigators , or other cited officials , including Boeing Aircraft representatives a part of the crash investigative team -- as a qualified party in this matter , and thus , dismisses this material out of hand .
Good logic , -- about as good as saying 150 eye witnesses are n't qualified .
Then you demand us to produce evidence which you know is not accessible to us , evidence held by FBI , whom we accuse of cover up .
Thus , only YOU are qualified to tell us what to believe ?
Witnesses be damned ?
Radar tracks be damned ?
Satellite tracks be damned ?
Reporters be damned ?
Photographs be damned ?
Government statements be damned ?
Is there a pattern here ?
Why do you refuse to address the issues by use of such disinformation tactics ( rule 19 - ignore proof presented , demand impossible proofs ) ? '
20 . False evidence .
Whenever possible , introduce new facts or clues designed and manufactured to conflict with opponent presentations -- as useful tools to neutralize sensitive issues or impede resolution .
This works best when the crime was designed with contingencies for the purpose , and the facts cannot be easily separated from the fabrications .
Example : Jack Ruby warned the Warren Commission that the white Russian separatists , the Solidarists , were involved in the assassination .
This was a handy ' confession ' , since Jack and Earl were both on the same team in terms of the cover up , and since it is now known that Jack worked directly with CIA in the assassination ( see below . )
Proper response :
This one can be difficult to respond to unless you see it clearly , such as in the following example , where more is known today than earlier in time ...
' You are avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics .
Your information is known to have been designed to side track
this issue .
As revealed by CIA operative Marita Lorenz under oath , offered in court in E. Howard Hunt vs. Liberty Lobby , CIA operatives E. Howard Hunt , James McCord , et al. , met with Jack Ruby in Dallas the night before the assassination of JFK to distribute guns and money .
Clearly , Ruby was a coconspirator whose ' Solidarist confession ' was meant to sidetrack any serious investigation of the murder AWAY from CIA .
Why do you refuse to address the issues by use of such disinformation tactics ( rule 20 - false evidence ) ?'
21 . Call a Grand Jury , Special Prosecutor , or other empowered investigative body .
Subvert the ( process ) to your benefit and effectively neutralize all sensitive issues without open discussion .
Once convened , the evidence and testimony are required to be secret when properly handled .
For instance , if you own the prosecuting attorney , it can insure a Grand Jury hears no useful evidence and that the evidence is sealed an unavailable to subsequent investigators .
Once a favorable verdict is achieved , the matter can be considered officially closed .
Usually , this technique is applied to find the guilty innocent , but it can also be used to obtain charges when seeking to frame a victim .
Example : According to one OK bombing Federal Grand Juror who violated the law to speak the truth , jurors were , contrary to law , denied the power of subpoena of witness of their choosing , denied the power of asking witnesses questions of their choosing , and relegated to hearing only evidence prosecution wished them to hear , evidence which clearly seemed fraudulent and intended to paint conclusions other than facts actually suggested .
Proper response :
There is usually no adequate response to this tactic except to complain loudly at any sign of its application , particularly with respect to any possible cover up .
This happened locally in Oklahoma , and as a result , a new Grand Jury has been called to rehear evidence that government officials knew in advance that the bombing was going to take place , and a number of new facts which indicate it was impossible for Timothy McVeigh to have done the deed without access to extremely advanced explosive devices such as available ONLY to the military or intelligence community , such as CIA 's METC technology .
Media has refused to cover the new Oklahoma Grand Jury process , by they way .
22 . Manufacture a new truth .
Create your own expert(s ) , group (s ) , author (s ) , leader (s ) or influence existing ones willing to forge new ground via scientific , investigative , or social research or testimony which concludes favorably .
In this way , if you must actually address issues , you can do so authoritatively .
Example : The False Memory Syndrome Foundation and American Family Foundation and American and Canadian Psychiatric Associations fall into this category , as their founding members and / or leadership include key persons associated with CIA Mind Control research .
Read " The Professional Paranoid " or " Psychic Dictatorship in the U.S.A. " by Alex Constantine for
more information .
Not so curious , then , that ( in a perhaps oversimplified explanation here ) these organizations focus on , by means of their own " research findings , " that there is no such thing as Mind Control .
Proper response : Unless you are in a position to be well - versed in the topic and know of the background and relationships involved in the opponent organization , you are not well equipped to fight this tactic .
23 . Create bigger distractions .
If the above does not seem to be working to distract from sensitive issues , or to prevent unwanted media coverage of unstoppable events such as trials , create bigger news stories ( or treat them as such ) to distract the multitudes .
Example :
To distract the public over the progress of a WTC bombing trial that seems to be uncovering nasty ties to the intelligence community , have an endless discussion of skaters whacking other skaters on the knee .
To distract the public over the progress of the Waco trials that have the potential to reveal government sponsored murder , have an O.J. summer .
To distract the public over an ever disintegrating McVeigh trial situation and the danger of exposing government involvements , come up with something else ( Flight 800 ? ) to talk about -- or , keeping in the sports theme , how about sports fans shooting referees and players during a game and the focusing on the whole gun control thing ?
Proper response :
The best you can do is attempt to keep public debate and interest in the true issues alive and point out that the ' news flap ' or other evasive tactic serves the interests of your opponents .
24 . Silence critics .
If the above methods do not prevail , consider removing opponents from circulation by some definitive solution so that the need to address issues is removed entirely .
This can be by their death , arrest and detention , blackmail or destruction of their character
by release of blackmail information , or merely by destroying them financially , emotionally , or severely damaging their health .
Example :
As experienced by certain proponents of friendly - fire theories with respect to flight 800 -- send in FBI agents to intimidate and threaten that if they persisted further , they would be subject to charges of aiding and abetting Iranian terrorists , of failing to register as a foreign agents , or any other trumped - up charges .
If this does n't work , you can always plant drugs and bust them .
Proper response :
You have three defensive alternatives if you think yourself potential victim of this ploy .
One is to stand and fight regardless .
Another is to create for yourself an insurance policy which will point to your opponents in the event of any unpleasantness , a matter which requires superior intelligence information on your opponents and great care in execution to avoid dangerous pitfalls ( see " The Professional Paranoid " by this author for suggestions on how this
might be done ) .
The last alternative is to cave in or run ( same thing . )
25 . Vanish .
If you are a key holder of secrets or otherwise overly illuminated and you think the heat is getting too hot , to avoid the issues , vacate the kitchen .
Example : Do a Robert Vesco and retire to the Caribbean .
If you do n't , somebody in your organization may choose to vanish you the way of Vince Foster or Ron Brown .
Proper response :
You will likely not have a means to attack this method , except to focus on the vanishing in hopes of uncovering it was by foul play or deceit as part of a deliberate cover up .
Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist
by H. Michael Sweeney
< HMS@proparanoid.com >
copyright ( c ) 1997 , 2000
All rights reserved
( Revised April 2000 - formerly SEVEN Traits )
1 ) Avoidance .
They never actually discuss issues head - on or provide constructive input , generally avoiding citation of references or credentials .
Rather , they merely imply this , that , and the other .
Virtually everything about their presentation implies their authority and expert knowledge in the matter without any further justification for credibility .
2) Selectivity .
They tend to pick and choose opponents carefully , either applying the hit - and - run approach against mere commentators supportive of opponents , or focusing heavier attacks on key opponents who are known to directly address issues .
Should a commentator become argumentative with any success , the focus will shift to include the commentator as well .
3 ) Coincidental .
They tend to surface suddenly and somewhat coincidentally with a new controversial topic with no clear prior record of participation in general discussions in the particular public arena involved .
They likewise tend to vanish once the topic is no longer of
general concern .
They were likely directed or elected to be there for a reason , and vanish with the reason .
4) Teamwork .
They tend to operate in self - congratulatory and complementary packs or teams .
Of course , this can happen naturally in any public forum , but there will likely be an ongoing pattern of frequent exchanges of this sort where professionals are involved .
Sometimes one of the players will infiltrate the opponent camp to become a source for straw man or other tactics designed to dilute opponent presentation strength .
5 ) Anti-conspiratorial .
They almost always have disdain for ' conspiracy theorists ' and , usually , for those who in any way believe JFK was not killed by LHO .
Ask yourself why , if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists , do they focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on conspiracies ?
One might think they would either be trying to make fools of everyone on every topic , or simply ignore the group they hold in such disdain .
Or , one might more rightly conclude they have an ulterior motive for their actions in going out of their way to focus as they do .
6 ) Artificial Emotions .
An odd kind of ' artificial ' emotionalism and an unusually thick skin -- an ability to persevere and persist even in the face of overwhelming criticism and unacceptance .
This likely stems from intelligence community training that , no matter how condemning the
evidence , deny everything , and never become emotionally involved or reactive .
The net result for a disinfo artist is that emotions can seem artificial .
Most people , if responding in anger , for instance , will express their animosity throughout their rebuttal .
But disinfo types usually have trouble maintaining the ' image ' and are hot and cold with respect to pretended emotions and their usually more calm or unemotional communications style .
It 's just a job , and they often seem unable to ' act their role in character ' as well in a communications medium as they might be able in a real face - to - face conversation / confrontation .
You might have outright rage and indignation one moment , ho - hum the next , and more anger later -- an emotional yo - yo .
With respect to being thick - skinned , no amount of criticism will deter them from doing their job , and they will generally continue their old disinfo patterns without any adjustments to criticisms of how obvious it is that they play that game -- where a more rational individual who truly cares what others think might seek to improve their communications style , substance , and so forth , or simply give up .
7 ) Inconsistent .
There is also a tendency to make mistakes which betray their true self / motives .
This may stem from not really knowing their topic , or it may be somewhat ' freudian ' , so to speak , in that perhaps they really root for the side of truth deep within .
I have noted that often , they will simply cite contradictory information which neutralizes itself and the author .
For instance , one such player claimed to be a Navy pilot , but blamed his poor communicating skills ( spelling , grammar , incoherent style ) on having only a grade - school education .
I 'm not aware of too many Navy pilots who do n't have a college degree .
Another claimed no knowledge of a particular topic / situation but later claimed first - hand knowledge of it .
8 ) BONUS TRAIT : Time Constant .
Recently discovered , with respect to News Groups , is the response time factor .
There are three ways this can be seen to work , especially when the government or other empowered player is involved in a cover up operation :
1 ) ANY NG posting by a targeted proponent for truth can result in an IMMEDIATE response .
The government and other empowered players can afford to pay people to sit there and watch for an opportunity to do some damage .
SINCE DISINFO IN A NG ONLY WORKS IF THE READER SEES IT -- FAST RESPONSE IS CALLED FOR , or the visitor may be swayed towards truth .
2 ) When dealing in more direct ways with a disinformationalist , such as email , DELAY IS CALLED FOR -- there will usually be a minimum of a 48 - 72 hour delay .
This allows a sit - down team discussion on response strategy for best effect , and even enough time to ' get permission ' or instruction from a formal chain of command .
3 ) In the NG example 1 ) above , it will often ALSO be seen that bigger guns are drawn and fired after the same 48 - 72 hours delay -- the team approach in play .
This is especially true when the targeted truth seeker or their comments are considered more important with respect to
potential to reveal truth .
Thus , a serious truth sayer will be attacked twice for the same sin .
I close with the first paragraph of the introduction to my unpublished book , " Fatal Rebirth " :
Truth cannot live on a diet of secrets , withering within entangled lies .
Freedom cannot live on a diet of lies , surrendering to the veil of oppression .
The human spirit cannot live on a diet of oppression , becoming subservient in the end to the will of evil .
God , as truth incarnate , will not long let stand a world devoted to such evil .
Therefore , let us have the truth and freedom our spirits require ... or let us die seeking these things , for without them , we shall surely and
justly perish in an evil world .

Disinformation in Action : Operation Mockingbird and the Washington Post
The very lengthy ( 25 pages typwritten ) document below is actually a letter to the Washington Post by Julian C. Holmes , in which he takes the Post to task for decades of disinformation -- typically in the form of combating what the Post likes to describe as ' conspiracy theory ' which ,
in the end , turns out to be conspiracy fact .
This uncopyrighted document was borrowed with permission from Michael Rivero 's excellent Web site :
http://www.whatreallyhappened.com
In an unusual format , Holmes carefully documents each accusation with footnotes , a valuable
tool for the reader .
This is no mere rant , no mere opinionated dissatisfaction , no angry response dashed off without thinking .
No , it is an indictment .
Nestled within the over 100 footnotes and the not quite as many individual examples of supression and distrotions of truth , and even fabrications of ' truth ' , is a root - most clue to the real problem -- a problem which reader should take care not to miss grasping ...
That is the covert role played by the Washington Post in CIA 's Operation Mockingbird , which is the infiltration and control of American media to insure that you and I never quite hear the truth as it really is .
You will learn how the owner / publisher of the Post , Phillip Graham and graduate of the Army Intelligence School was literally the founding director of Operation Mockingbird on behalf of CIA .
The significance is amplified when it is understood that Mockingbird was not simply the sell - out of a newspaper .
It was the organized infiltration and in some cases the actual take over of the top 25 newpapers in the United States , major television networks , high - profile magazines , the wire services ( Reuters was an outright CIA - owned and operated front until ' sold ' to ' private ' interests ) and even motion picture studios .
Since then , of course , it has expanded further .
For more information , visit Rivero 's site and read the excellent piece found there by author Alex Constantine , " Tales From They Crypt . "
We might expect a fascist dictatorship to use the motto - policy of " Do what we tell you or else ! "
We would prefer to believe that our own democratic and free nation 's motto - policy would be " Do what you think best . "
However , thanks to a secret government and CIA , it is actually " Do what we tell you to think best . "
That may have been what Eisenhower was warning us about when he coined the the phrase " military industrial complex " in his farewell address .
In my own writing , I have followed his lead and updated the phrase to that of simply : MIIM -- the Military Industrial Intelligence Media complex .
Subscribe to the Washington Post , dear sheep , and welcome to the New World Order .
Or , listen to Holmes and decide for yourself .
It is still your choice to make , despite what they would have you believe ...
April 25 , 1992
Richard Harwood , Ombudsman
The Washington Post
1150 15th Street NW
Washington , D.C. 20071
Dear Mr. Harwood ,
Though the Washington Post does not over - extend itself in the pursuit of hard news , just let drop the faintest rumor of a government " conspiracy , " and a klaxon horn goes off in the news room .
Aroused from apathy in the daily routine of reporting assignations and various other political and social sports events , editors and reporters scramble to the phones .
The klaxon screams its warning : the greatest single threat to herd - journalism , corporate profits , and government stability the dreaded " CONSPIRACY THEORY " !!
It is not known whether anyone has actually been hassled or accosted by any of these frightful spectres , but their presence is announced to Post readers with a salvo of warnings to avoid the tricky , sticky webs spun by the wacko " CONSPIRACY THEORISTS . "
Recall how the Post saved us from the truth about Iran - Contra .
Professional conspiracy exorcist Mark Hosenball was hired to ridicule the idea that Oliver North and his CIA - associated gangsters had conspired to do wrong ( * 1 ) .
And when , in their syndicated column , Jack Anderson and Dale Van Atta discussed some of the conspirators , the Post
sprang to protect its readers , and the conspirators , by censoring the Anderson column before printing it ( * 2 ) .
But for some time the lid had been coming off the Iran - Contra conspiracy .
In 1986 , the Christic Institute , an interfaith center for law and public policy , had filed a lawsuit alleging a U.S. arms - for - drugs trade that helped keep weapons flowing to the CIA - Contra army in Nicaragua , and cocaine flowing to U.S. markets ( * 3 ) .
In 1988 , Leslie Cockburn published " Out of Control , " a seminal work on our bizarre , illegal war against Nicaragua ( * 4 ) .
The Post contributed to this
discovery process by disparaging the charges of conspiracy and by publishing false information about the drug - smuggling evidence presented to the House Subcommittee on Narcotics Abuse and Control .
When accused by Committee Chairman Charles Rangel ( D - NY ) .
of misleading reporting , the Post printed only a partial correction and declined to print a letter of complaint from Rangel ( * 5 ) .
Sworn testimony before Senator John Kerry 's Subcommittee on Terrorism , Narcotics , and International Operations confirmed U.S. Government complicity in the drug trade ( * 6 ) .
With its coverup of the arms / drug conspiracy evaporating , the ever - accommodating Post shifted gears and retained Hosenball to exorcise from our minds a newly emerging threat to domestic tranquility , the " October Surprise " conspiracy ( * 7 ) .
But close on the heels of Hosenball and the Post came Barbara Honegger and then Gary Sick who authored independently , two years apart , books with the same title , " October Surprise " ( * 8 ) .
Honegger was a member of the Reagan / Bush campaign and transition teams in 1980 .
Gary Sick , professor of Middle East Politics at Columbia University , was on the staff of the National Security Council under Presidents Ford , Carter , and Reagan .
In 1989 and 1991 respectively , Honegger and Sick published their evidence of how the Republicans made a deal to supply arms to Iran if Iran would delay release of the 52 United States hostages until after the November 1980 election .
The purpose of this deal was to quash the possibility of a pre-election release ( an October surprise ) .
which would have bolstered the reelection prospects for President Carter .
Others published details of this alleged Reagan - Bush conspiracy .
In October 1988 , Playboy Magazine ran an expose " An Election Held Hostage " ; FRONTLINE did another in April 1991 ( * 9 ) .
In June , 1991 a conference of distinguished journalists , joined by 8 of the former hostages ,
challenged the Congress to " make a full , impartial investigation " of the election / hostage allegations .
The Post reported the statement of the hostages , but not a word of the conference itself which was held in the Dirksen Senate Office Building Auditorium ( * 10 ) .
On February 5 , 1992 a gun-shy , uninspired House of Representatives begrudgingly authorized an " October Surprise " investigation by a task force of 13 congressmen headed by Lee Hamilton ( D - IN ) , who had chaired the House of Representatives Iran -Contra Committee .
Hamilton has named as chief team counsel Larry Barcella , a lawyer who represented BCCI when the Bank was indicted in 1988 ( * 11 ) .
Like the Washington Post , Hamilton had not shown interest in pursuing the U.S. arms - for - drugs operation ( * 12 ) .
He had accepted Oliver North 's lies , and as Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee he derailed House Resolution 485 , which had asked President Reagan to answer
questions about Contra support activities of government officials and others ( * 13 ) .
After CIA operative John Hull ( from Hamilton 's home state ) was charged in Costa Rica with " international drug trafficking and hostile acts against the nation 's security , " Hamilton and 18 fellow members of Congress tried to intimidate Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez into handling Hull 's case " in a manner that will not complicate U.S. - Costa Rican relations " ( * 14 ) .
The Post did not report the Hamilton letter or the Costa Rican response that declared Hull 's case to be " in as good hands as our 100 - year - old uninterrupted democracy can provide to all citizens " ( * 15 ) .
Though the Post does its best to guide our thinking away from conspiracy theories , it is difficult to avoid the fact that so much wrongdoing involves government or corporate conspiracies :
In its COINTELPRO operation , the FBI used disinformation , forgery , surveillance , false arrests , and violence to illegally harass U.S.citizens in the 60's ( * 16 ) .
The CIA 's Operation MONGOOSE illegally sabotaged Cuba by " destroying crops , brutalizing citizens , destabilizing the society , and conspiring with the Mafia to assassinate Fidel Castro and other leaders " ( * 17 ) .
" Standard Oil of New Jersey was found by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice to be conspiring with I.G. Farben ... of Germany .
... By its cartel agreements with Standard Oil , the United States was effectively prevented from developing or producing [ for World War - II ] any substantial amount of synthetic rubber , " said Senator Robert LaFollette of Wisconsin ( * 18 ) .
U.S. Government agencies knowingly withheld information about dosages of radiation " almost certain to produce thyroid abnormalities or cancer " that contaminated people residing near the nuclear weapons factory at Hanford , Washington ( * 19 ) .
Various branches of Government deliberately drag their feet in getting around to cleaning up the Nation 's dangerous nuclear weapons sites ( * 20 ) .
State and local governments back the nuclear industry 's secret public relations strategy ( * 21 ) .
" The National Cancer Institute , the American Cancer Society and some twenty comprehensive cancer centers , have misled and confused the public and Congress by repeated claims that we are winning the war against cancer .
In fact , the cancer establishment has continually minimized the evidence for increasing cancer rates which it has largely attributed to smoking and dietary fat , while discounting or ignoring the causal role of avoidable eposures to industrial carcinogens in the air , food , water , and the workplace . " ( * 22 ) .
The Bush Administration coverup of its pre-Gulf - War support of Iraq " is yet another example of the President 's people conspiring to keep both Congress and the American people in the dark " ( * 23 ) .
If you think about it , conspiracy is a fundamental aspect of doing business in this country .
Take the systematic and cooperative censorship of the Persian Gulf War by the Pentagon and much of the news media ( * 24 ) .
Or the widespread plans of business and government groups to spend $ 100 million in taxes to promote a distorted and truncated history of Columbus in America ( * 25 ) .
along the lines of the Smithsonian Institution 's " fusion of the two worlds " ( * 26 ) , rather than examining more realistic aspects of the Spanish invasion , like " anger , cruelty , gold , terror , and death " ( * 27 ) .
Or circumstances surrounding the U.S. Justice Department theft from the INSLAW company of sophisticated , law - enforcement computer software which " now point to a widespread conspiracy implicating lesser Government officials in the theft of INSLAW 's technology , " says former U.S .
Attorney General Elliot Richardson ( * 28 ) .
Or Watergate .
Or the " largest bank fraud in world financial history " ( * 29 ) , where the White House knew of the criminal activities at " the Bank of Crooks and Criminals International " ( BCCI ) ( * 30 ) , where U.S. intelligence agencies did their secret banking ( * 31 ) , and where bribery of prominent American
public officials " was a way of doing business " ( * 32 ) .
Or the 1949 conviction of " GM [ General Motors ] , Standard Oil of California , Firestone , and E. Roy Fitzgerald , among others , for criminally conspiring to replace electric transportation with gas - and diesel - powered buses and to monopolize the sale of buses and related products to transportation companies throughout the country " [ in , among others , the cities of New York , Philadelphia , Baltimore , St. Louis , Oakland , Salt Lake City , and Los Angeles ] ( * 33 ) .
Or the collusion in 1973 between Senator Abraham Ribicoff ( D - CT ) . and the U.S. Department of Transportation to overlook safety defects in the 1.2 million Corvair automobiles manufactured by General Motors in the early 60's ( * 34 ) .
Or the A. H. Robins Company , which manufactured the Dalkon Shield intrauterine contraceptive , and which ignored repeated warnings of the Shield 's hazards and which " stonewalled , deceived , covered up , andcovered up the coverups ...[ thus inflicting ] on women a worldwide epidemic of pelvic infections . " ( * 35 ) .
Or that cooperation between McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Company and the FAA resulted in failure to enforce regulations regarding the unsafe DC - 10 cargo door which failed in flight killing all 364 passengers on Turkish Airlines Flight 981 on March 3 , 1974 ( * 36 ) .
Or the now - banned , cancer - producing pregnancy drug Diethylstilbestrol ( DES ) , that was sold by manufacturers who ignored tests which showed DES to be carcinogenic ; and who acted " in concert with each other in the testing and marketing of DES for miscarriage purposes " ( * 37 ) .
Or the conspiracies among bankers and speculators , with the cooperation of a corrupted Congress , to relieve depositors of their savings .
This " arrogant disregard from the White House , Congress and corporate world for the interests and rights of the American people " will cost U.S .
tapayers many hundreds of billions of dollars ( * 38 ) .
Or the Westinghouse , Allis Chalmers , Federal Pacific , and General Electric executives who met surreptitiously in hotel rooms to fix prices and eliminate competition on heavy industrial equipment ( * 39 ) .
Or the convictions of Industrial Biotest Laboratories ( IBT ) officers for fabricating safety tests on prescription drugs ( * 40 ) .
Or the conspiracy by the asbestos industry to suppress knowledge of medical problemsrelating to asbestos ( * 41 ) .
Or the 1928 Achnacarry Agreement through which oil companies " agreed not to engage in any effective price competition " ( * 42 ) .
Or the conspiracy among U.S. Government agencies and the Congress to cover up the nature of our decades - old war against the people of Nicaragua , a covert war that continues in 1992 with the U.S. Government applying pressure for the Nicaraguan police to reorganize into a more repressive force ( * 43 ) .
Or the conspiracy by the CIA and the U.S. Government to interfere in the Chilean election process with military aid , covert actions , and an economic boycott which culminated in the overthrow of the legitimately elected government and the assassination of President Salvador Allende in 1973 ( * 44 ) .
Or the conspiracy among U.S. officials including Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and CIA Director William Colby to finance terrorism in Angola for the purpose of disrupting Angola 's plans for peaceful elections in October 1975 , and to lie about these actions to the Congress and the news media ( * 45 ) .
And CIA Director George Bush 's subsequent cover up of this U.S. - sponsored terrorism ( * 46 ) .
Or President George Bush 's consorting with the Pentagon to invade Panama in 1989 and thereby violate the Constitution of the United States , the U.N. Charter , the O.A.S. Charter , and the Panama Canal Treaties ( * 47 ) .
Or the " gross antitrust violations " ( * 48 ) and the conspiracy of American oil companies and the British and U.S. governments to strangle Iran economically after Iran nationalized the British - owned Anglo - Iranian Oil Company in 1951 .
And the subsequent overthrow by the CIA in 1953 of
Iranian Prime Minister Muhammed Mossadegh ( * 49 ) .
Or the CIA - planned assassination of Congo head - of - state Patrice Lumumba ( * 50 ) .
Or the deliberate and wilful efforts of President George Bush , Senator Robert Dole , Senator George Mitchell , various U.S. Government agencies , and members of both Houses of the Congress to buy the 1990 Nicaraguan national elections for the presidential candidate supported by President Bush ( * 51 ) .
Or the collective approval by 64 U.S. Senators of Robert Gates to head the CIA , in the face of " unmistakable evidence that Gates lied about his role in the Iran - Contra scandal " ( * 52 ) .

Or how the Reagan Administration connived with the Vatican to ban the use of USAID funds by any country " for the promotion of birth control or abortion " ( * 54 ) .
Or " the way the Vatican and Washington colluded to achieve common purpose in Central America " ( * 55 ) .
Or the collaboration of Guatemalan strong - man and mass murderer Hector Gramajo with the U.S. Army to design " programs to build civilian - military cooperation " at the U.S. Army School of the Americas ( SOA ) at Fort Benning , Georgia ; five of the nine soldiers accused in the 1989 Jesuit massacre in El Salvador are graduates of SOA which trains Latin / American military personnel ( * 56 ) .
Or the conspiracy of the Comanche Peak Nuclear Plant administration to harass and cause bodily harm to whistleblower Linda Porter who uncovered dangerous working conditions at the facility ( * 57 ) .
Or the conspiracy of President Richard Nxion and the Government of South Vietnam to delay the Paris Peace Talks until after the 1968 U.S. presidential election ( * 58 ) .
Or the pandemic coverups of police violence ( * 59 ) .
Or the always safe - to - cite worldwide communist conspiracy ( * 60 ) .
Or maybe the socially responsible , secret consortium to publish " The Satanic Verses " in paperback ( * 61 ) .
Conspiracies are obviously a way to get things done , and the Washington Post offers little comment unless conspiracy theorizing threatens to expose a really important conspiracy that , let 's say , benefits big business or big government .
Such a conspiracy would be like our benevolent CIA 's 1953 overthrow of the Iranian government to help out U.S. oil companies ; or like our illegal war against Panama to tighten U.S. control over Panama and the Canal ; or like monopoly control of broadcasting that facilitates corporate censorship on issues of public importance ( * 62 ) .
When the camouflage of such conspiracies is stripped away , public confidence in the conspiring officials can erode depending on how seriously the citizenry perceives the conspiracy to have violated the public trust .
Erosion of public trust in the status quo is what the Post seems to see as a real threat to its corporate security .
Currently , the Post has mounted vituperative , frenzied attacks on Oliver Stone 's movie " JFK " , which reexamines the U.S. Government 's official ( Warren Commission .
finding that a single gunman , acting alone , killed President John F. Kennedy .
The movie also is the story of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison 's unsuccessful prosecution of Clay Shaw , the only person ever tried in connection with the assassination .
And the movie proposes that the Kennedy assassination was the work of conspirators whose interests would not be served by a president who , had he lived , might have disengaged us from our war against Vietnam .
The Post ridicules a reexamination of the Kennedy assassination along lines suggested by " JFK . "
Senior Post journalists like Charles Krauthammer , Ken Ringle , George Will , Phil McCombs , and Michael Isikoff have been called up to man the bulwarks against public sentiment , which has never supported the government 's non-conspiratorial assassination thesis .
In spite of the facts that the Senate Intelligence Committee of 1975 and 1976 found that " both the FBI and CIA had repeatedly lied to the Warren Commission " ( * 63 ) and that the 1979 Report of the House Select Committee on Assassinations found that President Kennedy was probably killed " as a result of a conspiracy " ( * 64 ) , a truly astounding number of Post stories have been used as vehicles to discredit " JFK " as just another conspiracy ( * 65 ) .
Some of the more vicious attacks on the movie are by editor Stephen Rosenfeld , and journalists Richard Cohen , George Will , and George Lardner Jr ( * 66 ) .
They ridicule the idea that Kennedy could have had second thoughts about escalating the Vietnam War and declaim that there is no historical justification for this idea .
Seasoned journalist Peter Dale Scott , former Pentagon / CIA liaison chief L. Fletcher Prouty , and investigators David Scheim and John Newman have each authored defense of the " JFK " thesis that Kennedy was not enthusiastic about staying in Vietnam ( * 67 ) .
But the Post team just continues ranting against the possibility of a high - level assassination conspiracy while offering little justification for its arguments .
An example of particularly shabby scholarship and unacceptable behavior is George Lardner Jr's contribution to the Post 's campaign against the movie .
Lardner wrote three articles , two before the movie was completed , and the third upon its release .
In May , six months before the movie came out , Lardner obtained a copy of the first draft of the script and , contrary to accepted standards , revealed in the Post the contents of this copyrighted movie ( * 68 ) .
Also in this article , ( * 69 ) .
Lardner discredits Jim Garrison with hostile statements from a former Garrison associate Pershing Gervais .
Lardner does not tell the reader that subsequent to the Clay Shaw trial , in a U.S. Government criminal action brought against Garrison , Government witness Gervais , who helped set up Garrison for prosecution , admitted under oath that in a May 1972 interview with a New Orleans television reporter , he , Gervais , had said that the U.S. Government 's case against Garrison was a fraud ( * 70 ) .
The Post 's 1973 account of the Garrison acquittal mentions this controversy , but when I recently asked Lardner about this , he was not clear as to whether he remembered it ( * 71 ) .
Two weeks after his first " JFK " article , Lardner blustered his way through a justification for his unauthorized possession of the early draft of the movie ( * 72 ) .
He also defended his reference to Pershing Gervais by lashing out at Garrison as a writer " of gothic fiction . "
When the movie was released in December , Lardner " reviewed " it ( * 73 ) .
He again ridiculed the film 's thesis that following the Kennedy assassination , President Johnson reversed Kennedy 's plans to de-escalate the Vietnam War .
Lardner cited a memorandum issued by Johnson four days after Kennedy died .
Lardner says this memorandum was written before the assassination , and that it " was a continuation of Kennedy 's policy . "
In fact , the memorandum was drafted the day before the assassination by McGeorge Bundy ( Kennedy 's Assistant for National Security Affairs ) Kennedy was in Texas , and may never have seen it .
Following the assassination , it was rewritten ; and the final version provided for escalating the war against Vietnam ( * 74 ) facts that Lardner avoided .
The Post 's crusade against exposing conspiracies is blatantly dishonest :
The Warren Commission inquiry into the Kennedy Assassination was for the most part conducted in secret .
This fact is buried in the Post ( * 75 ) .
Nor do current readers of this newspaper find meaningful discussion of the Warren Commission 's secret doubts about both the FBI and the CIA ( * 76 ) .
Or of a dispatch from CIA headquarters instructing co-conspirators at field stations to counteract the " new wave of books and articles criticizing the [ Warren ] Commission 's findings ...[ and ] conspiracy theories ...[ that ] have frequently thrown suspicion on our organization " and to " discuss the publicity problem with liaison and friendly elite contacts , especially politicians and editors " and to " employ propaganda assets to answer and refute the attacks of the critics .
... Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose .
... The aim of this dispatch is to provide material for countering and discrediting the claims of the conspiracy theorists ... " ( * 77 ) .
In 1979 , Washington journalist Deborah Davis published Katharine The Great , the story of Post publisher Katharine Graham and her newspaper 's close ties with Washington 's powerful elite , a number of whom were with the CIA .
Particularly irksome to Post editor Benjamin Bradlee was a Davis claim that Bradlee had " produced CIA material " ( * 78 ) .
Understandably sensitive about this kind of publicity , Bradlee told Davis ' publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich , " Miss Davis is lying ... I never produced CIA material ... what I can do is to brand Miss Davis as a fool and to put your company in that special little group of publishers who do n't give a shit for the truth . "
The Post bullied HBJ into recalling the book ; HBJ shredded 20,000 copies ; Davis sued HBJ for breach of contract and damage to reputation ; HBJ settled out of court ; and Davis published her book elsewhere with an appendix that demonstrated Bradlee to have been deeply involved with producing cold - war / CIA propaganda ( * 79 ) .
Bradlee still says the allegations about his association with people in the CIA are false , but he has apparently taken no action to contest the xetensive documentation presented by Deborah Davis in the second and third editions of her book ( * 80 ) .
And it 's not as if the Post were new to conspiracy work .
[ large blank space ]
* Former Washington
Post publisher Philip Graham , " believing that the function of the press was more often than not to mobilize consent for the policies of the government , was one of the architects of what became a widespread practice : the use and manipulation of journalists by the
CIA " ( * 81 ) .
This scandal was known by its code name Operation MOCKINGBIRD .
Former Washington
Post reporter Carl Bernstein cites a ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^ former CIA deputy director as saying , " It was widely known that Phil Graham was someone you could get help from " ( * 82 ) .
More recently the Post provided cover for CIA personality Joseph Fernandez by " refusing to print his name for over a year up until the day his indictmen twas announced ... for crimes committed in his official capacity as CIA station chief in Costa Rica " ( * 83 ) .
[ large blank space ]
Of the meetings between Graham and his CIA acquaintances at which the availability and prices of journalists were discussed , a former CIA man recalls , " You could get a journalist cheaper than a good call girl , for a couple hundred dollars a month " ( * 84 ) .
One may wish to consider Philip
Graham 's philosophy along with a more recent statement from his wife Katharine Graham , current Chairman of the Board of the Washington Post .
In a lecture on terrorism and the news media , Mrs. Graham said : " A second challenge facing the media is how to prevent terrorists from
using the media as a platform fortheir views .
...
The point is that we generally know when we are being manipulated , and we 've learned better how and where to draw the line , though the decisions are often difficult " ( * 85 ) .
Today , the Post and its world of big business are apparently terrified that our elite and our high - level public officials may be exposed as conspirators behind Contra drug - smuggling , October Surprise , or the assassination of President Kennedy .
This fear is truly remarkable in that , like most of us and like most institutions , the Post runs its business as a conspiracy of like - minded entrepreneurs a conspiracy " to act or work together toward the same result or goal " ( * 86 ) .
But where the Post really parts company from just plain people is when it pretends that conspiracies associated with big business or government are " coincidence . "
Post reporter Lardner vents the frustration inherent in having to maintain this dichotomy .
He lashes out at Oliver Stone and suggests that Stone may actually believe that the Post 's opposition to Stone 's movie is a " conspiracy . "
Lardner assures us that Stone 's complaints are " groundless and paranoid and smack of McCarthyism " ( * 87 ) .
So how does the Post justify devoting so much energy to ridiculing those who investigate conspiracies ?
The Post has answers : people revert to conspiracy theories because they need something " neat and tidy " ( * 88 ) that " plugs a gap no other generally accepted theory fills ' , ( * 89 . and " coincidence ... is always the safest and most likely explanation for any conjunction of curious circumstances ... " ( * 90 ) .
And what does this response mean ?
It means that " coincidence theory " is what the Post espouses when it would prefer not to admit to a conspiracy .
In other words , some things just " happen . "
And , besides , conspiracy to do certain things would be a crime ; " coincidence " is a safer bet .
Post Ombudsman Richard Harwood , who , it is rumored , serves as Executive Director of the Benevolent Protective Order of Coincidence Theorists , ( * 91 ) recently issued a warning about presidential candidates " who have begun to mutter about a press conspiracy . "
Ordinarily , Harwood would simply dismiss these charges as " symptoms of the media paranoia that
quadrennially engulfs members of the American political class " ( * 92 ) .
But a fatal mistake was made by the mutterers ; they used the " C " word against the PRESS !
And Harwood exploded his off - the - cuff comment into an entire column ending it with : " We are the new journalists , immersed too long , perhaps , in the cleansing waters of political conformity .
But conspirators we ain't . "
Distinguished investigative journalist Morton Mintz , a 29 - year veteran of the Washington Post , now chairs the Fund for Investigative Journalism .
In the December issue of The Progressive , Mintz wrote " A Reporter Looks Back in Anger : Why the Media Cover Up Corporate Crime . "
Therein he discussed the difficulties in convincing editors to accept important news stories .
He illustrated the article with his own experiences at the Post , where he says he was known as " the biggest pain in the ass in the office " ( * 93 ) .
Would Harwood argue that grief endured by journalists at the hands of editors is a matter of random coincidence ?
And that such policy as Mintz described is made independently by editors without influence from fellow editors or from management ?
Would Harwood have us believe that at the countless office " meetings " in which news people are ever in attendance , there is no discussion of which stories will run and which ones will find inadequate space ?
That there is no advanced planning for stories or that there are no cooperative efforts among the staff ?
Or that in the face of our news - media " grayout " of presidential candidate Larry Agran , ( * 94 ) a Post journalist would be
free to give news space to candidate Agran equal to that the Post lavishes on candidate Clinton ?
Let 's face it : these possibilities are about as likely as Barbara Bush entertaining guests at a soup kitchen .
Would Harwood have us believe that media critic and former Post Ombudsman Ben Bagdikian is telling less than the truth in his account of wire - service control over news :
" The largely anonymous men who control the syndicate and wire service copy desks and the central wire photo machines determine at a single decision what millions will see and hear .
... there seems to be little doubt that these gatekeepers preside over an operation in which an appalling amount of press agentry sneaks in the back door of American journalism and marches untouched out the front door as ' news ' " ( * 95 ) .
When he sat on the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington , Judge Clarence Thomas violated U.S. law when he failed to remove himself from a case in which he then proceeded to reverse a $ 10 million judgment against the Ralston Purina Company ( * 96 ) .
Ralston Purina , the animal feed empire , is the family fortune of Thomas ' mentor , Senator John Danforth .
The Post limited its coverage of the Thomas malfeasance to 56 words buried in the middle of a 1200 - word article ( * 97 ) .
Would Harwood have us believe that the almost complete blackout on this matter by the major news media and the U.S. Senate was a matter of coincidence ?
Could a
Post reporter have written a story about Ralston Purina if she had wanted to ?
Can a brick swim ?
Or take the fine report produced last September by Ralph Nader 's Public Citizen .
Titled " All the Vice President 's Men , " it documents " How the Quayle Council on Competitiveness Secretly Undermines Health , Safety , and Environmental Programs . "
Three months later , Post journalists David Broder and Bob Woodward published " The President 's Understudy , " a seven - part series on Vice President Quayle .
Although this series does address Quayle 's role with the Competitiveness Council , its handling of the Council 's disastrous impact on America is inadequate .
It is 40,000 words of mostly aimless chatter about Quayle memorabilia : youth , family , college record , Christianity , political aspirations , intellectual aspirations , wealthy friends , government associates , golf , travels , wife Marilyn , and net worth revealing little about Quayle 's abilities , his understanding of society 's problems , or his thoughts about justice and freedom , and never mentioning the comprehensive Nader study of Quayle 's record in the Bush Administration ( * 98 ) .
Now , did Broder or did Woodward forget about the Nader study ?
Or did both of them forget ?
Or did one , or the other , or both decide not to mention it ?
Did these two celebrated , seasoned Post reporters ever discuss together their jointly authored stories ?
Did they decide to publish such a barren set of articles because it would enhance their reputations ?
How did management feel about the use of precious news space for such frivolity ?
Is it possible that so many pages were
dedicated to this twaddle without people " acting or working together toward the same result or goal " ?
( * 99 ) Do crocodiles fly ?
On March 20 , front - page headlines in the Wall Street Journal , the New York Times , USA Today , and the Washington Post read respectively :
TSONGAS DROPPED OUT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE CLEARING CLINTON'S PATH ;
TSONGAS ABANDONS CAMPAIGN LEAVING CLINTON CLEAR PATH TOWARD SHOWDOWN WITH BUSH ;
TSONGAS CLEARS WAY FOR CLINTON ;
TSONGAS EXIT CLEARS WAY FOR CLINTON .
This display of editorial independence should at least raise questions of whether the news media collective mindset is really different from that of any other cartel like oil , diamond , energy , ( * 100 ) or manufacturing cartels , a cartel being " a combination of independent commercial enterprises designed to limit competition " ( * 101 ) .
The Washington Post editorial page carries the heading :
AN INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER
Is it ?
Of course not .
There probably is no such thing .
Does the Post " conspire " to keep its staff and its newspaper from wandering too far from the safety of mediocrity ?
The Post would respond that the question is absurd .
In that I am not privy to the Post 's telephone conversations ,
I can only speculate on how closely the media elite must monitor the staff .
But we all know how few micro-seconds it takes a new reporter to learn what subjects are taboo and what are " safe , " and that experienced reporters do n't have to ask .
What is more important , however , than speculating about how the Post communicates within its own corporate structure and with other members of the cartel , is to document and publicize what the Post does in public , namely , how it shapes and censors the news .
Sincerely ,
Julian C. Holmes

The 13 Basic Principles of Gameplay Design
By Matt Allmer
[ In an intriguing design feature , EA and Page 44 veteran Allmer re-imagines the famous ' 12 Principles Of Animation ' for video games - adding a principle along the way ! ]
Gameplay design is chaotic and full of frustrations and contradictions .
More often than not , the request is to come up with something guaranteed to be successful .
This condition steers solutions towards the established -- which means solutions that have been done before .
But in the same breath , the product must separate itself from the competition or stand out in some way .
This immediately pulls the designer in conflicting directions .
Then , whatever the solution , it must fit within the confines of the project 's resources .
Not to mention scheduling pressure and strategy changes coming from executive positions .
Hup hup !
No time for analyzing the previous paragraph !
We 've got a title to ship !
Never mind your lack of proper tools !
Quit your sniveling !
Do n't you know ?
Game design is like sailing a ship while still building the hull !
Jump out of a plane while still sewing your parachute and you 'll get a good sense of pace in this business .
The horse is never put before the cart .
We race them side - by - side to see which one wins !
With so much urgency , conflict and uncertainty , there must be an anchor somewhere .
Call me boring , but I 'm a fan of preparation and established fundamentals .
They give me a better understanding of which rules I can break , and which rules I should think twice about .
I took a traditional animation class in college and on the first day , the professor handed out the " 12 Principles of Animation " , introduced by Frank Thomas & Ollie Johnston .
If you 're not familiar with these two , they were part of the Nine Old Men :
The legendary Disney animation crew responsible for the studio's timeless classics , such as , Snow White , 101 Dalmatians , Bambi , Sleeping Beauty , and others .
At first , these 12 principles were difficult to fully grasp .
However , by the end of the semester , I noticed the more principles I applied to my work , the better the animation .
Remembering that experience , I think to myself , " By George !
Game design should have something similar ! "
So , George and I scoured the Internet .
Unfortunately , I was disappointed after finding so many disjointed theories , strategies , approaches and creeds .
There was a lot of broad subject matter like theories on fun , rewarding players ' choices , controlling thought activity , mental multi-tasking ... and calls to " simplify " ( whatever that means .
I 'm a designer for crying out loud ) .
I also found principles so apparent , Captain Obvious would roll his eyes : " know your audience " , " do n't break the player 's trust " , " give players choice " , " know thyself " , " one mechanic in the engine is two in the bush " .
Alright , the last two were made up , but nothing I found really did it for me .
I was perplexed .
None of what I found would help a designer on a day - to - day basis .
So George , Captain Obvious and I have decided to throw our proverbial hat into the muddled picture .
( And quick !
For god 's sake , before I collect any more metaphorical personalities ! )
The 12 Basic Principles of Animation was my starting point .
I took the commonalities and added to them based on what I 've identified as the different compartments of gameplay design .
You 'll notice some are described similarly and some even have the same name , but all apply to gameplay .
The purpose of these principles is to cover all your bases before presenting your designs .
You might have a principle fully covered in the beginning , but these principles may spark a thought later when circumstances present a new opportunity .
Think of this as a reference sheet .
And now , without further ado ...
Direction
The first three principles have to do with leading and directing the player 's experience .
Even though this medium is heavily based on personal , interactive discovery , it is still an artistic medium .
Do not underestimate the importance of artistic direction .
Just as a painting leads the eye , a book leads the imagery , a film leads the narrative , so too must a game lead the interactivity .
1. Focal Point
Never allow the player to guess what they should focus on .
At the same time , always allow secondary subject matter , but it is the designer 's job to clearly provide the primary focus at all times .
This applies to both visual and visceral aspects of gameplay .
Level design example
Creating clear , apparent lines of sight .
System design example
Clearly defined plot points and objectives during game progression / user experience .
2. Anticipation Time is needed to inform the player that something is about to happen .
Always factor in Anticipation when designing and implementing events and behaviors .
Level design example
A train sound effect occurs before player sees train .
System design example
An energy charge builds before the lightning attack occurs .
3. Announce Change Communicate all changes to the player .
This short step occurs between Anticipation and the event itself .
The important part to remember is maintaining a hierarchy of notable changes .
A good rule of thumb is degree of rarity .
If a change occurs a hundred times in an hour , the announcement may not be required .
However , if the change occurs five times throughout the entire game experience , a number of visual cues could be needed .
This principle is so obvious , it can be taken for granted and sometimes overlooked .
Be diligent in knowing what changes the player should be aware of at the correct time and on the correct event .
Level design example
" Cast - off " animations trigger for NPCs when the player 's character boards the ship .
System design example
An on - screen notification occurs when quest criteria have been completed ( i.e. " Slay 10 goblins for Farmer Bob " )
Behavior
These next four principles address the very important aspect of behavior .
This tackles the player 's expectations , both conscious and unconscious .
This is where common design theories are addressed such as player choice , reward and payoff , etc .
These principles are also broader , so they can be applied to additional types of design like UI and story ...
4. Believable Events and Behavior Every event or behavior must occur according to the logic and expectations of the player .
Every action , reaction , results , emotion and conveyance must satisfy the players ' subconscious acceptance test .
Level design example
Place destructible objects near an explosive object .
This way , the explosion looks more believable .
System design example
Weaker enemies run away when the advantage shifts in the player 's favor .
UI example
HUD elements are affected when player 's mech is near death .
Story example
Villagers are more upbeat and react positively after the player has slain the dragon .
5. Overlapping Events and Behavior Dynamic is lost if only one change occurs at a time .
Discover the right amount of events to occur at any given moment of time .
Level design example
Providing the player the ability to build from an appropriate list of structures .
System design example
The linebacker points to direct fellow players , the defensive end shifts over , the quarterback points and calls out football jargon and the crowd cheers louder because it 's third down .
All this occurs before the snap .
UI example
Points accumulate in the score while each kill is individually tallied on screen .
Story Example
Multiple plot points are at the forefront of the narrative experience .
Example : the king is on his deathbed while his war is being waged and he has yet to announce an heir -- all while an unknown saboteur orchestrates a military coup .
6. Physics
The player 's primary logic operates within the known possibilities of physics .
Keep in mind gravity , weight , mass , density , force , buoyancy , elasticity , etc .
Use this as the starting point , but do not be limited by it .
Level design example
Ensuring a hole in the floor is the correct size for the correct purpose .
Whether it is part of the path of level progression , or simply for visual aesthetics .
System design example
A spark particle effect occurs when the player 's vehicle scrapes the side of the concrete wall .
UI example
The GUI 's theme references scrapbook elements .
In which case , animated transitions , highlights , etc. follow the physical characteristics of paper .
7. Sound Ask yourself , " What sound does it make when ________ happens ? "
" Is the sound appropriate ? " " Is the sound necessary ? " " Does it benefit the experience or hinder it ? "
If players close their eyes , the sound alone should still achieve the desired affect .
It 's debatable whether this principle should be included since Sound Design can be considered separate from Gameplay Design .
I 've included it because sound is crucial and can easily be neglected .
The more it is considered , the better the experience is for the player .
Level design example
Flies in swamp level make a sound when close to the camera .
System design example
A proximity system where sound effects volume fluctuates depending on distance of game assets .
UI example
Only visually prominent graphics have sound effects attached to them , so as not to muffle the auditory experience .
The next three principles individually touch on other major design components .
Progression
8. Pacing Keep in mind the desired sense of urgency , the rate in which events occur , the level of concentration required and how often events are being repeated .
Spread out the moments of high concentration , mix up the sense of urgency , and change things wherever possible to achieve the proper affect .
Level design example
Create areas for the player to admire the expansive view , versus areas where the player feels claustrophobic .
System design example
Create long , powerful attacks versus short , light attacks .
Environment
9. Spacing Understand how much space is available both on - screen and in - world , recognize the spatial relationship between elements and take into account the effects of modifying those spaces .
Level design example
Lay out the appropriate amount of space for the appropriate number of enemies to maneuver correctly .
System design example
When an AI character moves through a bottleneck area , walk loops switch to standing idle when the AI character is not moving forward , to show that the character is " waiting " to move through the narrowed space .
Method
10 . Linear Design versus Component Breakdown Linear Design involves solving challenges as they come .
All solutions and possibilities hold the same institutional value .
Focus can be lost with this method , but it provides creative and spontaneous solutions .
Component Breakdown involves systemic categorization and forming a logical hierarchy of all solutions .
This method can restrict innovation but preserves clarity of primary design objectives .
This principle does not mean designers must choose one or the other .
There are times during development where one method is more appropriate than the other .
For instance , pre-production provides plenty of time for breaking down a sequence of events .
However , when the publisher drops a " must have " change after pre-production , linear design can provide an acceptable solution quickly .
Level design example
Typical blocking of level geometry in an early stage of development , versus adjusting a small area of the same level to implement an idea that was n't thought of until later .
System design example
Identifying all major systems ( combat , AI , input , etc ) , and progressively filling in various levels of detail versus conceiving the first couple of levels and extracting possible systems based on a linear player experience .
Foundation
The final three principles mark the foundation of gameplay design , which are listed in reverse order of importance .
These should be a surprise to no one .
11 . Player
How does the player factor into this ?
How does the player interact with everything that has been designed ?
More than just device input , address how the player contributes to the experience .
If it 's a good idea and you 're able to convey it correctly but the player is not into it , change it or scrap it !
Level design example
Setting up the player in hopes of making them jump out of their seat .
System design example
Orchestrating progression so that the player feels empowered , determined , anxious , etc .
12 . Communication
Is the appropriate team member correctly aware of the objective ?
Are the appropriate developers clear on the solution ?
If it 's a good idea but you can't communicate it correctly , it might as well be a bad idea because it 's very likely to be received as such .
Level design example
Using the elements of the environment so the player is compelled to travel in the correct direction .
System design example
Using visual cues so the player learns when to punch rather than kick , jump rather than strafe , etc .
13 . Appeal
When addressing anyone , ask yourself , " Does this draw the audience in ? "
This applies to ( but is not limited to ) the player , the spectator , your fellow developers , the publisher , and their marketing team .
If it 's not a good idea , there 's no need to continue until it becomes a good idea or is replaced by something better .
Level design example
Running down the street is not fun , but running down the street while being pursued by government secret agents is .
System design example
Punching can be fun but when the camera shakes on impact , it 's even more fun .
Conclusion
So , there you have it .
These principles have noticeably improved my designs and forced me to think of components from all angles .
I thoroughly believe they will give you an edge on all those impatient carts .
So , stick that in your horse and race it !

( Natural News ) Mike Adams , the Health Ranger , is a fan of simple , innovative solutions for sustainable living .
In a new video recorded in Vilcabamba , Ecuador , Adams demonstrates the Brumby Pump ( www.BrumbyPumps.com ) , an amazing water pump that has no moving parts and uses no electricity .
The Brumby Pump uses nothing but compressed air to pump enormous quantities of water out of wells .
In this video , Adams uses a low - cost 2 - horsepower air compressor running on a common 110 - volt electrical line to pump startling quantities of water from a 20 - meter well .
The water is used to irrigate garden crops , many of which are donated to low - income families in the local community .
Adams chose the Brumby Pump due to the high cost of purchasing traditional electric well pumps as well as the mechanical simplicity of the Brumby Pump , which runs on compressed air .
" I wanted a simple , low - cost pump that would last at least ten years without needing repairs or maintenance , " Adams said .
" Traditional electric pumps simply can't achieve that , and it 's difficult to find parts for them in rural Ecuador .
"
The video shows Adams connecting the air hose to the pump , lowering it into the well , turning it on and producing enormous flows of water and air out of the return hose .
In his set up , this water is pumped to a surface holding take , from which a second pump pushes the water through irrigation sprinklers .
" This configuration is incredibly easy to maintain because there are no motors or moving parts down in the well , " Adams explained .
" Everything is right on the surface , where it 's easy to reach and easy to maintain . "
Adams also says the air compressor could easily be driven by solar power , making this irrigation solution suitable for remote areas in developing countries .
Adams has no financial stake in the Brumby Pump and received no compensation to review and publicize the pump .
He purchased it from the manufacturer in Australia just like any other customer .

British Telecom ( LON : BT.A ) said last week that it might cancel a £ 250 m plan to build electricity - generating wind farms because of a rule change by the Department of Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) .
BT , whose shares hit a record low last week , planned to build one hundred wind turbines on up to thirty sites in England and Scotland capable of generating 25 % of its power needs .
At a cost of £ 250 m it represented the biggest investment in renewable energy by any British company apart from energy businesses .
However the projects were looking doubtful last week , with BT claiming that new rules make the project uneconomic and that the government is now actually discouraging companies from switching to renewable energy .
The cause of the dispute is a row over government - issued credits called Renewable Obligation Certificates ( Rocs ) .
“ Overall , we support what the government is trying to do to promote energy efficiency , but the ruling on Rocs means there is no sense in us building wind turbines , ” said Chris Tup - pen , BT ’s chief sustainability officer .
“ It is a perverse ruling that will also affect a number of other big businesses that are trying to act responsibly .
We planned to build wind turbines that would generate a quarter of BT ’s electricity by 2016 .
Without the subsidy that will not go ahead . ”
“ It ’s an accounting thing but it ’s very important , ” a government spokesman said .
“ We have to be very tough on it .
The Roc is not a subsidy .
If you sell the energy to the National Grid it is used to offset the grid ’s emissions .
You ca n’t both claim the money and use it to offset the company ’s own emissions .
That ’s double accounting . ”
Ed Miliband , the energy and climate change secretary , is expected to announce a consultation on its so - called carbon - reduction commitment ( CRC ) – the scheme that blocks BT from claiming credits at the same time as counting its green energy against its CO2 footprint – in late spring .
BT and other firms are already lobbying to block it or change it .
Among them is Tesco , which is becoming increasingly interested in renewable - energy generation .
David North , community and government director at Tesco , said : “ I can see why the civil servants see this as double counting but the effect is to hold up renewable - energy initiatives .
The government needs to find a way around this , perhaps by creating other incentives to help companies that are not power generators or other large fossil fuel users to switch to renewable energy . ”
BT ’s wind - power project was welcomed by the government when it was revealed two years ago .
But the row now illustrates the fiendish complexity of the subsidy regimes devised to encourage the expansion of renewable - energy generation .
Rocs are issued by Ofgem , the energy regulator , to companies that produce green energy and can be sold on to third parties such as power generators , who have to prove – via the Rocs – that they gain a percentage of their power from renewable sources .
By selling the Roc , a company such as BT in effect gains a government subsidy on its green power .
The government says BT is not entitled to that subsidy if it also exploits the fact that it produces renewable energy to reduce its overall carbon footprint .
BT says its proposed wind farms were planned on the assumption that it could sell Rocs in this way , and that the government has now back - tracked , making the project uneconomic .
The new CRC regulations make clear that businesses can either trade their Rocs or claim the carbon saved against their overall footprint – not both .
It is this change that has infuriated BT .
“ All sides are acting with good intentions but the result is that a plan that would make substantial cuts in CO2 emissions could be cancelled by BT ’s board , ” said Sir Michael Rake , chairman of BT .
“ We ’re very disappointed and we would like the government to rethink these rules . ”
There are mounting concerns that the economic downturn is forcing companies to scale back or to scrap altogether environ - mental initiatives .
Last month Vestas , the world ’s biggest wind turbine manufacturer , reported a drop in demand that left it with 15 % excess manufacturing capacity , while Wall Street analysts said 2009 would be a tough year for wind and solar supplying firms .
BT has also been buffeted by the markets : shares fell 7.8 % to 97 p – an all time low – last week after the group warned of further writedowns on its troubled corporate telecoms infra-structure division .
As BT wavers on its green plans , Marks & Spencer is today announcing a multi-million - pound contract with Npower as part of its Plan A to be carbon neutral by 2012 .
Under the six - year deal the energy supplier will provide M&S with 2.6TWh ( terawatt - hour ) of renewable electricity – enough to power all the retailer ’s stores and offices – from April .
The deal in itself is worthy , but a caveat that stipulates that a quarter of the energy must come from small - scale generators makes it unique .
In simple terms this means M&S is offering contracts to UK farmers to feed renewable energy into the grid , which it will then buy from Npower .
The retailer has already awarded five contracts to small farmers , and this has enabled them to get financing for building wind turbines , anaerobic digesters and small - scale hydro systems .
Grant Mackie , an Aberdeenshire grain and cattle farmer , won an M&S energy contract in 2006 .
He said : “ A wind turbine costs about £ 1 m upfront and unless you have a five - year contract the banks are not interested in providing the capital .
The longest contract we could get before M&S was two years at a push .
There was a disconnect , and M&S bridged that gap . ”
Mackie now has three wind turbines on his 500 - acre farm .
Richard Gillies at M&S said : “ Mackie has wind blowing over his land , which we can use , but can still do what he likes at ground level , be that growing grain or rearing cattle . ”

TOKYO  Japanese companies are caught in a double bind , facing markets at home that are shrinking with the population as well as the global downturn .
Nevertheless , companies must expand foreign sales aggressively  or face longer - term decline .
Exports from the world ’s No. 2 economy fell an unprecedented 49 percent in February .
But even as Japanese policy makers call for a renewed focus on domestic markets , companies are tying themselves more tightly to overseas markets and innovation .
“ Japanese companies themselves just do n’t see a future in the domestic market , ” said Yasuo Yamamoto , senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute .
“ They ’re looking for opportunities overseas instead of investing at home .
That makes it almost impossible for Japan to reduce its export dependence . ”
Prime Minister Taro Aso announced Tuesday that Japan would put together yet another economic package to stimulate demand , with steps to create jobs and further reduce taxes .
Japan has already announced stimulus plans worth 12 trillion yen , or $ 122 billion , including 2 trillion yen in cash handouts .
There is mounting evidence to support the existence of a syndrome afflicting heavy cannabis users , after the world 's first cases were found in South Australia .
The condition " cannabinoid hyperemesis " was first identified in a group of about 20 heavy drug users in the Adelaide hills in 2004 , and a new case has emerged this time in the US .
The syndrome is characterised by nausea , stomach pain and bouts of vomiting - ill effects which , oddly , sufferers say they get some relief from by having a hot shower or bath .
The new case , involving a 22 - year - old man in Omaha , is published in the where doctors were also told to consider it when treating people with unexplained vomiting .
" Given the high prevalence of chronic cannabis abuse worldwide and the paucity of reports in the literature , clinicians need to be more attentive to the clinical features of this under - recognised condition , " writes Dr Siva Sontineni , and colleagues , from the Creighton University Medical Centre .
While some reports suggest Digg may be trying to reduce the influence of power users - the handful of submitters that can dictate what appears on the front page - Fark founder Drew Curtis says they 're essential to Fark .
In an exclusive interview with TechRadar , Curtis says that 's why his site is embracing its power users , making it easier for them to get their submissions seen .
He says that about " 20 to 30 people submit about 80 % of the stories " you 'll see on the Fark front page .
" I have no problem with that because that means that consistently these 20 people are sending in some awesome stuff , and we 've done what we can to make it easier for them to do it , " Curtis explains .
" For example , currently if you submit stuff to Fark we block duplicates or we would n't be able to read what people are sending in , which sucks because I 'm sure we 're missing out on some funny taglines because of that .
" But what we did was we took our top submitters – every year I look at the top 10 – and among other things I remove the block for them , to make it easier for them to get stuff to us because their stuff is better .
" Almost all of the stuff that makes the main page is from those 20 guys – not exclusively , and it's not like we 've got a quota or anything like that , but that 's how it works out .
Because those guys are writing it properly . "
Advantages of moderation
Curtis also reckons that a moderated story system , where moderators choose what goes on the front page , has inherent benefits over the user voted systems employed by Digg and Reddit .
" One of the advantages is that you can't be taken over by well organised minorities , " Curtis explains .
" Reddit got completely owned by about 200 Ron Paul supporters during the [ US election ] campaign , and they basically made sure that anything to do with Ron Paul made the top of Reddit .
Just 200 guys – they 've got a million people reading that site but 200 guys took it over . "
Fark can also move stories to the front page a lot faster , adds Curtis .
" I was talking to a guy from USA Today last night and one of the talks going on at the same time as mine [ at SXSWi ] is about breaking news in the digital age , and I said , 'here , I 'll post this up for you , it takes 10 seconds ' .
" That 's basically it – somebody will get it out there first but the second , third , twentieth and two - hundredth guy will get it 10 seconds later .
It takes a good half hour to an hour for stories to pop up to the top of the social news sites , whereas we can just go 'oh , shit , something just happened . ' "

Rapid social change and unsafe sex are blamed for rising infection levels Chinese officials have said that HIV / Aids was the leading cause of death last year , compared with other infectious diseases .
It is thought to be the first time this has happened .
A report by the country 's state media said HIV / Aids had led to the deaths of almost 7,000 people in the first nine months of 2008 .
The number of deaths caused by tuberculosis and rabies fell back into second and third place .
The numbers are increasing dramatically - China 's Ministry of Health say that until three years ago , fewer than 8,000 people altogether had died from HIV / Aids .
By last year , the total had risen to five times that many .
Data on HIV in China are still unreliable .
Official reporting of cases does seem to have improved .
The central authorities seem more willing to recognise HIV as a public health crisis and address it with education campaigns .
But there are still concerns that officials at local and provincial level are under - reporting , either by mistake or because they think it 's not in their interest to show rises .
This latest news comes as the spread of HIV in China has entered a dangerous new phase .
Initially it was concentrated in high - risk populations , injecting drug users in particular .
Infection from contaminated blood transfusions was also common .
More sex
But now the main cause of transmission is thought to be unsafe sex .
China is still a deeply conservative society - but it is also going through a period of rapid social change .
Greater freedom of movement means millions of migrant workers have left small communities to enjoy the anonymity of cities .
Male workers , away from their families , have more sexual opportunity .
Prostitution has increased .
Premarital sex is also becoming more acceptable .
On Tuesday , the World Health Organisation warned of a steep rise in HIV amongst Asian men who have sex with men , unless prevention programmes targeting them were greatly improved .

Even the casual student of Buddhism has probably heard the story of Siddhartha Gautama ’s long sit under a fig tree , during which time he reached enlightenment .
That tree , now referred to as the Bodhi Tree , was in Bodh Gaya , India ; a current descendant of it , found near the Mahabhodi Temple in that city , is today an important pilgrimage site .
Turns out that a cutting from the original tree also made its way to Sri Lanka , where it was rooted .
A cutting was subsequently taken from THAT tree …and rooted in the botanical garden at the University of Uppsala .
( Did Neurath ’s boat get repaired with wood from this fig tree ?
Did Plato ’s third man perhaps sit under a third fig tree ?
Allusions to famous philosophical metaphors - of - once - or - twice - removedness are irresistable at this point . )
Lisa is spending spring break traveling and learning with the Gustavus Semester in Sweden program , led by Roland Thorstensson .
Two philosophy students –major Alex Legeros and minor Andrew Nelson–are a part of the group .
During our fascinating tour of the botanic gardens , we had a chance to stop and admire the Bodhi Tree ’s Swedish offshoot .
We were not , alas , able to stand under the tree long enough to be enlightened .
Thanks to Alex for making the photos .

PALERMO ( Reuters ) - A Tunisian pilot who paused to pray instead of taking emergency measures before crash - landing his plane , killing 16 people , has been sentenced to 10 years in jail by an Italian court along with his co-pilot .
The 2005 crash at sea off Sicily left survivors swimming for their lives , some clinging to a piece of the fuselage that remained floating after the ATR turbo - prop aircraft splintered upon impact .
A fuel - gauge malfunction was partly to blame but prosecutors also said the pilot succumbed to panic , praying out loud instead of following emergency procedures and then opting to crash - land the plane instead trying to reach a nearby airport .
Another five employees of Tuninter , a subsidiary of Tunisair , were sentenced to between eight and nine years in jail by the court , in a verdict handed down Monday .
The seven accused , who were not in court , will not spend time in jail until the appeals process has been exhausted .
If you 're gonna lose your pilot 's license , David Keith Martz has found a great way to do it , even though there is no specific rule against having sex in the cockpit .
Martz lost his appeal to regain the flight certificate he lost after engaging in a little , um , in - flight entertainment with Swedish porn star Puma Swede ( NSFW ) .
Although the airborne hanky - panky occurred almost four years ago , the Federal Aviation Administration did n't get wind of it until earlier this year when the gossip site TMZ broke the story and then posted a video ( NSFW ) of the two in action .
That 's Swede in a frame grab from the video at right .
The feds were not happy and yanked Hartz 's license .
The 52 - year - old pilot appealed .
Last week he told a National Transportation Safety Board judge that receiving oral sex while flying over San Diego was n't " the brightest thing " but he 's learned his lesson and should be allowed to fly .
Judge William Mullins disagreed .
" The evidence clearly shows grossly reckless conduct on the part of the respondent , " he said after spending an hour reviewing an unedited copy of the film in his chambers .
It seems the judge felt flying with your pants around your knees and a porn star blocking access to the flight controls could be a problem .
Interestingly , there is no specific rule barring sex in the cockpit , an FAA spokesman told Wired.com , and Martz could apply for a new license next year .
Although the FAA does n't specifically address sex in the cockpit , spokesman Ian Gregor says Hartz violatedregulation 91.13 ( a ) , which makes it a crime " to operate an aircraft in a careless or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of another . "
" The regulation that Mr. Martz broke was 91.13 ( a ) , careless or reckless operation of an aircraft , " Gregor told Wired.com .
" That 's a broad regulation that covers a wide range of potential offenses .
The onus is on the FAA to prove that the alleged violation falls under 91.13 ( a ) . "
Martz was at the controls of a a Bell 206B , a four - passenger , 1,700 - pound helicopter capable of 140 mph .
Martz had loaned the chopper to an adult film company for use in a scene , which explains why there was a video camera handy to film the airborne indiscretion .
It was n't the first time Martz had run afoul of the authorities , according to Aero - News .
He lost his license in 1986 for flying with a forged medical certificate .
He lost it again in 2002 for doing aerobatics over a populated area at below 1,500 feet .
And in 2006 he was charged with reckless operation of an aircraft after allegedly landing on a public street to pick up Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee .
But Martz - who according to his lawyer and a flight instructor has been behaving himself lately - may take to the sky again .
Although the FAA can revoke a license , it is permanent only in those cases where the pilot has an irreversible medical condition or illicit drugs are found in the cockpit .
Martz can reapply for his license next year .
As for Swede , she made the switch from computer sales to porn in 2005 and , according to Steve Javors , editor - in - chief of the trade publication XBiz , is an industry favorite .
" She 's definitely in the top tier of adult film stars , " Javors told Wired.com .
" There are n't too many six foot tall Swedish blonds in this business , and she always seems to be having fun when she 's working . "

The Damned Human Race
by Mark Twain
In proceeding toward this unpleasant conclusion I have not guessed or speculated or conjectured , but have used what is com­monly called the scientific method .
That is to say , I have sub­jected every postulate that presented itself to the crucial test of actual experiment , and have adopted it or rejected it according to the result .
Thus I verified and established each step of my course in its turn before advancing to the next .
These experiments were made in the London Zoological Gardens , and covered many months of painstaking and fatiguing work .
Before particularizing any of the experiments , I wish to state one or two things which seem to more properly belong in this place than further along .
This , in the interest of clearness .
The massed experiments established to my satisfaction certain gener­alizations , to wit :
1 . That the human race is of one distinct species .
It exhibits slight variations ( in color , stature , mental caliber , and so on ) due to climate , environment , and so forth ; but it is a species by itself , and not to be confounded with any other .
2 . That the quadrupeds are a distinct family , also .
This fam­ily exhibits variations ( in color , size , food preferences , and so on ; but it is a family by itself ) .
3 . That the other families ( the birds , the fishes , the insects , the reptiles , etc. ) are more or less distinct , also .
They are in the procession .
They are links in the chain which stretches down from the higher animals to man at the bottom .
Some of my experiments were quite curious .
In the course of my reading I had come across a case where , many years ago , some hunters on our Great Plains organized a buffalo hunt for the entertainment of an English earl .
They had charming sport .
They killed seventy - two of those great animals ; and ate part of one of them and left the seventy - one to rot .
In order to determine the differ­ence between an anaconda and an earl ( if any ) I caused seven young calves to be turned into the anacondas cage .
The grateful reptile immediately crushed one of them and swallowed it , then lay back satisfied .
It showed no further interest in the calves , and no disposition to harm them .
I tried this experiment with other anacondas ; always with the same result .
The fact stood proven that the difference between an earl and an anaconda is that the earl is cruel and the anaconda is n't ; and that the earl wantonly destroys what he has no use for , but the anaconda does n't .
This seemed to suggest that the anaconda was not descended from the earl .
It also seemed to suggest that the earl was descended from the anaconda , and had lost a good deal in the transition .
I was aware that many men who have accumulated more millions of money than they can ever use have shown a rabid hunger for more , and have not scrupled to cheat the ignorant and the helpless out of their poor servings in order to partially appease that appetite .
I furnished a hundred different kinds of wild and tame animals the opportunity to accumulate vast stores of food , but none of them would do it .
The squirrels and bees and certain birds made accumulations , but stopped when they had gathered a winter s supply , and could not be persuaded to add to it either honestly or by chicane .
In order to bolster up a tottering reputa­tion the ant pretended to store up supplies , but I was not de­ceived .
I know the ant .
These experiments convinced me that there is this difference between man and the higher animals : he is avaricious and miserly ; they are not .
In the course of my experiments I convinced myself that among the animals man is the only one that harbors insults and injuries , broods over them , waits till a chance offers , then takes revenge .
The passion of revenge is unknown to the higher animals .
Roosters keep harems , but it is by consent of their concu­bines ; therefore no wrong is done .
Men keep harems but it is by brute force , privileged by atrocious laws which the other sex were allowed no hand in making .
In this matter man occupies a far lower place than the rooster .
Cats are loose in their morals , but not consciously so .
Man , in his descent from the cat , has brought the cats looseness with him but has left the unconsciousness behind ( the saving grace which excuses the cat ) .
The cat is innocent , man is not .
Indecency , vulgarity , obscenity ( these are strictly confined to man ) ; he invented them .
Among the higher animals there is no trace of them .
They hide nothing ; they are not ashamed .
Man , with his soiled mind , covers himself .
He will not even enter a drawing room with his breast and back naked , so alive are he and his mates to indecent suggestion .
Man is The Animal that Laughs .
But so does the monkey , as Mr. Darwin pointed out ; and so does the Australian bird that is called the laughing jackass .
No !
Man is the Animal that Blushes .
He is the only one that does it or has occasion to .
At the head of this article we see how three monks were burnt to death a few days ago , and a prior put to death with atrocious cruelty .
Do we inquire into the details ?
No ; or we should find out that the prior was subjected to unprintable muti­lations .
Man ( when he is a North American Indian ) gouges out his prisoners eyes ; when he is King John , with a nephew to render untroublesome , he uses a red - hot iron ; when he is a reli­gious zealot dealing with heretics in the Middle Ages , he skins his captive alive and scatters salt on his back ; in the first Richard 's time he shuts up a multitude of Jew families in a tower and sets fire to it ; in Columbus ' time he captures a family of Spanish Jews and ( but that is not printable ; in our day in England a man is fined ten shillings for beating his mother nearly to death with a chair , and another man is fined forty shillings for having four pheasant eggs in his possession without being able to satisfacto­rily explain how he got them ) .
Of all the animals , man is the only one that is cruel .
He is the only one that inflicts pain for the pleasure of doing it .
It is a trait that is not known to the higher animals .
The cat plays with the frightened mouse ; but she has this excuse , that she does not know that the mouse is suffering .
The cat is moderate ( unhumanly moderate : she only scares the mouse , she does not hurt it ; she doesnt dig out its eyes , or tear off its skin , or drive splinters under its nails ) man-fashion ; when she is done playing with it she makes a sudden meal of it and puts it out of its trouble .
Man is the Cruel Animal .
He is alone in that distinction .
The higher animals engage in individual fights , but never in organized masses .
Man is the only animal that deals in that atrocity of atrocities , War .
He is the only one that gathers his brethren about him and goes forth in cold blood and with calm pulse to exterminate his kind .
He is the only animal that for sordid wages will march out , as the Hessians did in our Revolu­tion , and as the boyish Prince Napoleon did in the Zulu war , and help to slaughter strangers of his own species who have done him no harm and with whom he has no quarrel .
Man is the only animal that robs his helpless fellow of his country , takes possession of it and drives him out of it or destroys him .
Man has done this in all the ages .
There is not an acre of ground on the globe that is in possession of its rightful owner , or that has not been taken away from owner after owner , cycle after cycle , by force and bloodshed .
Man is the only Slave .
And he is the only animal who en­slaves .
He has always been a slave in one form or another , and has always held other slaves in bondage under him in one way or another .
In our day he is always some man 's slave for wages , and does that man 's work ; and this slave has other slaves under him for minor wages , and they do his work .
The higher animals are the only ones who exclusively do their own work and provide their own living .
Man is the only Patriot .
He sets himself apart in his own country , under his own flag , and sneers at the other nations , and keeps multitudinous uniformed assassins on hand at heavy ex­pense to grab slices of other peoples countries , and keep them from grabbing slices of his .
And in the intervals between cam­paigns , he washes the blood off his hands and works for the universal brotherhood of man , with his mouth .
Man is the Religious Animal .
He is the only Religious Ani­mal .
He is the only animal that has the True Religion , several of them .
He is the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself , and cuts his throat if his theology is n't straight .
He has made a graveyard of the globe in trying his honest best to smooth his brothers path to happiness and heaven .
He was at it in the time of the Caesars , he was at it in Mahomet 's time , he was at it in the time of the Inquisition , he was at it in France a couple of cen­turies , he was at it in England in Mary 's day , he has been at it ever since he first saw the light , he is at it today in Crete ( as per the telegrams quoted above ) he will be at it somewhere else tomor­row .
The higher animals have no religion .
And we are told that they are going to be left out , in the Hereafter .
I wonder why ?
It seems questionable taste .
Man is the Reasoning Animal .
Such is the claim .
I think it is open to dispute .
Indeed , my experiments have proven to me that he is the Unreasoning Animal .
Note his history , as sketched above .
It seems plain to me that whatever he is he is not a reasoning animal .
His record is the fantastic record of a maniac .
I consider that the strongest count against his intelligence is the fact that with that record back of him he blandly sets himself up as the head animal of the lot : whereas by his own standards he is the bottom one .
In truth , man is incurably foolish .
Simple things which the other animals easily learn , he is incapable of learning .
Among my experiments was this .
In an hour I taught a cat and a dog to be friends .
I put them in a cage .
In another hour I taught them to be friends with a rabbit .
In the course of two days I was able to add a fox , a goose , a squirrel and some doves .
Finally a monkey .
They lived together in peace ; even affectionately .
Next , in another cage I confined an Irish Catholic from Tipperary , and as soon as he seemed tame I added a Scotch Presbyterian from Aberdeen .
Next a Turk from Constantinople ; a Greek Christian from Crete ; an Armenian ; a Methodist from the wilds of Arkansas ; a Buddhist from China ; a Brahman from Benares .
Finally , a Salvation Army Colonel from Wapping .
Then I stayed away two whole days .
When I came back to note results , the cage of Higher Animals was all right , but in the other there was but a chaos of gory odds and ends of turbans and fezzes and plaids and bones and flesh , not a specimen left alive .
These Reasoning Animals had disagreed on a theological detail and carried the matter to a Higher Court .
One is obliged to concede that in true loftiness of character , Man cannot claim to approach even the meanest of the Higher Animals .
It is plain that he is constitutionally incapable of ap­proaching that altitude ; that he is constitutionally afflicted with a Defect which must make such approach forever impossible , for it is manifest that this defect is permanent in him , indestructible , ineradicable .
I find this Defect to be the Moral Sense .
He is the only animal that has it .
It is the secret of his degradation .
It is the quality which enables him to do wrong .
It has no other office .
It is incapable of performing any other function .
It could never have been intended to perform any other .
Without it , man could do no wrong .
He would rise at once to the level of the Higher Animals .
Since the Moral Sense has but the one office , the one capacity ( to enable man to do wrong ) it is plainly without value to him .
It is as valueless to him as is disease .
In fact , it manifestly is a disease .
Rabies is bad , but it is not so bad as this disease .
Rabies enables a man to do a thing , which he could not do when in a healthy state : kill his neighbor with a poisonous bite .
One is the better man for having rabies : The Moral Sense enables a man to do wrong .
It enables him to do wrong in a thousand ways .
Rabies is an innocent disease , compared to the Moral Sense .
No one , then , can be the better man for having the Moral Sense .
What now , do we find the Primal Curse to have been ?
Plainly what it was in the beginning : the infliction upon man of the Moral Sense ; the ability to distinguish good from evil ; and with it , necessarily , the ability to do evil ; for there can be no evil act without the presence of consciousness of it in the doer of it .
And so I find that we have descended and degenerated , from some far ancestor ( some microscopic atom wandering at its pleasure between the mighty horizons of a drop of water perchance ) insect by insect , animal by animal , reptile by reptile , down the long highway of smirch less innocence , till we have reached the bottom stage of development ( namable as the Human Being ) .
Below us , nothing .

Eight officials were fired last week for their negligence and poor oversight during the milk contamination scandal that occurred last year .
David Barboza of the New York Times reports :
The government said high - ranking regulators in the country ’s major food supervisory agencies , including the ministries of health and agriculture and the top food safety watchdog , were stripped of their positions and their membership in the Communist Party .
One of the highest officials to lose his job was Wang Bubu , chief of the law enforcement division of the General Administration of Quality Supervision and Quarantine .
The dismissals were Beijing ’s latest efforts to strengthen food safety practices and hold government officials accountable after the worst food safety crisis here in decades .

Here ’s something to think about :
How many police officers and sheriff ’s deputies are involved in investigating and solving crimes involving illegal drugs ?
And arresting and transporting and interrogating and jailing the suspects ?
How many prosecutors and their staffs spend time prosecuting drug cases ?
How many defense lawyers spend their time defending drug suspects ?
How many hours of courtroom time are devoted to drug trials ?
How many judges , bailiffs , courtroom security officers , stenographers , etc. , spend their time on drug trials ?
How many prison cells are filled with drug offenders ?
And how many corrections officers does it take to guard them ?
How much food do these convicts consume ?
And when they get out , how many parole and probation officers does it take to supervise their release ?
And how many ex-offenders turn right around and do it again ?
So how ’s this war on drugs going ?
Someone described insanity as doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result each time .
That ’s a perfect description of the war on drugs .
The United States is the largest illegal drug market in the world .
Americans want their weed , crack , cocaine , heroin , whatever .
And they ’re willing to pay big money to get it .
The drug suppliers are only too happy to oblige .
The Mexican drug cartels now have operations in 230 American cities .
That ’s 230 American cities !
And we ’re not just talking about border towns , but places such as Anchorage , Alaska ; Boston , Massachusetts ; Atlanta , Georgia ; and Billings , Montana .
They ’re everywhere .
And they do n’t just bring drugs , but violence and crime as well — lots of it at no extra charge .
They have been able to infiltrate those 230 cities because we have not bothered to secure our borders .
In addition to illegal aliens who come here to work and avail themselves of our social programs , we have criminals from Mexico bringing drugs in , taking money and guns back , and recruiting American kids into their criminal enterprises while they ’re here .
iReport.com :
Is it time to legalize pot ?
What do you suppose the total price tag is for this failed war on drugs ?
One senior Harvard economist estimates we spend $ 44 billion a year fighting the war on drugs .
He says if they were legal , governments would realize about $ 33 billion a year in tax revenue .
Net swing of $ 77 billion .
Could we use that money today for something else ?
You bet your ass we could .
Plus the cartels would be out of business .
Instantly .
Goodbye crime and violence .
If drugs were legalized , we could empty out a lot of our prison cells .
People will use this stuff whether it ’s legal or not .
Just like they do booze .
And you could make the argument that in some cases alcohol is just as dangerous as some drugs .
I know .
Like I said … something to think about .
It ’s time .

I wanted to take LSAT and when I told people who are close to me about that , they started warning me about a particular set of problems .
There is a section known as analytical reasoning , logic games , and it is a section in which you will be tested for or your ability to group information and order it .
The questions seem to be really easy when read , but these are the questions which stop thousands and thousands of people from scoring and attending the schools of their choices .
If you are someone who wants to get into a top Law School in the USA then you will need a score of 165 or higher out of 180 .
when we tried these questions about logic games , without preparation , we were able to score around 24 questions right meaning we scored around 160 before starting any other sections .
This was surely not going to get us and do any top Law School .
There is a thing about logic games , students realized that all of the logic can be turned into an equation with variables .
The concept is not that easy to grasp for new students .
I have seen people who talked three calculus classes , two Physics classes , as well as 6 chemistry classes and still , get completely blank at the logic games part .
This section requires a new skill set and we know that there are books which are available for preparing the section .
The big companies provide books for the preparation of logic games
And they are not what that expensive .
But after spending some time trying to solve the problems in those books , students usually start looking for help .
Law School applicants
If you are one of the Law School applicants from good backgrounds , you will be having an easier time with logic games because you have a good amount of time to study .
There are a good number of people who quit their jobs and talk several months off from other things for the preparation of this exam .
Most of the times , their parents support them when they leave working and start studying for this exam .
If you want to master logic games , you need to be visual and you need to draw diagrams and charts in order to answer these questions .
If you read those questions in a book and do not represent them in a diagram , it wo n’t be easy .
If someone starts drawing the questions for you and coach you then it will be way easier .
There are private sessions available from big companies or tutors but that you talk charge around $ 150 to $ 250 per hour and the companies with a number of students charge 950 dollars to 1600 dollars for 80 hours of class time .
Fortunately , there are now a good amount of online pathways available for the students to score well in their LSAT exam .
they are affordable and you can access the preparation companies which offer online exclusively to the student who wants to challenge the exam .
The teacher will work through the logic games on paper and then the student can pause the video and try it themselves .
The online curriculum is developed by these companies and the videos consist of hundreds of hours of content in short chunks .
There are companies dedicated to free education as well as some minimum charges which help the students prepare for the LSAT the exam while only paying and 8th of the price of a standard course which the big companies offer .
The people behind these companies thought that if the student saw the tutors solve each and every logic game ever created , they will be able to solve the section quite easily .
That is the main reason the idea behind this thing was created .
With the growing numbers of these companies , the students will have less stress preparing for the LSAT the exam and it will make the logic games not much of an obstacle even if the students are not getting enough income .
Conclusion :
We know that the LSAT the exam is not easy to crack for the students who are are not earning enough to afford the coaching classes .
The situation has now changed and the students will surely be able to crack the exam if they are accessing the correct resources online .
We hope that this article helped you out .
Have a great day .…
A father managed to deliver his baby son after watching DIY baby delivery video clips on YouTube .
Feeling nervous about the imminent birth of his child Marc Stephens had a look at childbirth videos on his home computer .
Four hours later his wife , Jo , went into labour three weeks earlier than expected and , as paramedics rushed to help , Stephens was able to put his new - found knowledge into action and helped deliver 5 lb 5 oz Gabriele .
Stephens , 28 , a naval engineer , told yesterday how he had already learned how to play the guitar and solve the Rubik 's Cube puzzle from YouTube videos .
So it did n't seem too much of a leap for him to check out the whys and wherefores of childbirth .
He said : " I spent about half a hour on Google and watched a couple of videos on YouTube .
One was a cheesy American video called : " This is how you give birth . "
After he finished looking at the sites at about 10.30 pm the couple went to bed , only to wake up at 2 am with Jo , 28 , in labour .
The couple had wanted to have the birth at home but were told there were no midwives available .
Stephens said : " At this time Jo rushed out of the bathroom and dropped down on all fours .
As soon as she dropped down I looked down and its head was sticking out .
I was still on the phone to the midwife .
To be honest I did n't have time to panic . "
The baby was delivered safely and both mother and child are doing well .
Jo , who has three other children , said : " I was quite relaxed .
I have to say , out of all my four labours , that was the one I enjoyed the most .
Marc is one of those people who can put his hand to anything . "
After successfully delivering Gabriele the paramedics arrived and congratulated Marc on a good job , before the family travelled from their home in Redruth , Cornwall , to the Royal Cornwall hospital at Treliske , for the new mum and baby to be checked .

Dear Rita :
We operate a nonprofit social services agency .
In response to the Covid - 19 pandemic , we have taken what we believe to be very aggressive steps to protect our nonprofit ’s clients and employees .
These efforts include taking the body temperatures of employees and clients , asking for doctors ’ notes from employees returning from suspected exposure , and requiring testing for employees returning from self - or medically - suggested quarantines .
We are also very aware of our obligations to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) , and we are proud to have a good history of providing accommodations for our disabled employees .
We take …
Inspired by this thread on reddit I thought I ’d write an open letter to Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church , the Archbishop of Westminster and President of the Catholic Bishops ’ Conference of England and Wales , requesting that my name no -longer be counted as Catholic .
Dear Sir ,
According to The Times religious affairs correspondent , Ruth Gledhill , “ Figures for 2005 show that there are 4.2 million Catholics in England and Wales ” .
I was baptised a Catholic , as a baby , by my parents , in 1973 .
Since then I have grown to appreciate the significance of religion throughout human history and have a great respect for the tradition of learning and academic excellence encouraged for hundreds of years by the Roman Catholic tradition .
However , I am troubled by the idea that my name might still count as being a Catholic , in the Church ’s records , since it has been a number of decades since my last confession .
Indeed , since the 1990 ’s I have considered myself atheist on the existence of Yahweh , or any other deity , and for the past 5 years have identified myself as a secular humanist .
I wondered if there was any mechanism in place , within your Church , for removing records of membership or a system whereby membership figures might be amended , so as to remove my name from the archive .
This may seem like a petty stance — but in principal I feel very strongly that my name be in no way associated with an organisation such as one which would protect Bishop Paul Marcinkus , for example ; or , indeed , one which would have as its leader , a man who calls for humility and sacrifice , when sitting atop a golden , jewel encrusted throne , whilst calling 11,000 signatures on petition to investigate child abuse , a “ Media Exaggeration ” .
If removing my name from the official register is a matter of excommunication , I am happy to admit I have committed a great number of “ mortal sins ” , over the years .
I ’ve had sex out of wedlock , I deny the existence of the holy ghost , the virgin birth , I deny transubstantiation and renounce my confirmation name Saint , Mark , as a composite character from folklore , highly unlikely to have even met Jesus , whom himself is highly unlikely to have been the son of his own externalised ego .
Indeed , with regard to these articles of faith , I differ only slightly from Agnesë ‘ Mother Teresa ’ Gonxhe Bojaxhiu , who ’s posthumously published memoirs revealed the doubts I ’m sure you have similarly felt about the historical verisimilitude of the new testament story , in that she believed it to be untrue for just the final 25 years of her life , whereas the rest of my life is still ahead of me .
Yours , sincerely
James Gardner .
Sometimes we see things so often that we simply forget to ask “ why are they like that ? ”
For instance , let ’s take a closer look at domestic animals .
Dogs , cats , horses , cows , pigs – animals that we live with , and who could n’t live without us .
Common Traits
What do all these domestic animals have in common ?
Now this is n’t a particularly subtle example , but that ’s kind of the point .
You can see that all of these domestic animals have large white patches – they ’ve lost pigment in their coats in some areas .
Why do we care ?
Well , this is something that is extremely common among domesticated animals , but very rare among wild animals .
I hear you saying “ but what about zebras , or any other wild animal with white patches ? ” .
What we ’re referring to here is slightly different .
A zebra will always have that patterning , whereas what we ’re looking at here is depigmentation – the loss of color in certain areas in an animal that is “ normally ” colored .
What else is common among domestic animals but rare in the wild ?
Well , things like dwarf and giant varieties , floppy ears , and non-seasonal mating .
Charles Darwin , in Chapter One of Origin of the Species noted that “ not a single domestic animal can be named which has not in some country drooping ears ” .
A very significant observation when you consider that there is only a single wild animal with drooping ears – the elephant .
So perhaps something weird is going on here .
Why do animals as different as cats and dogs have these common traits ?
It seems to arise simply from being around humans !
The Hypothesis
The Russian geneticist Dmitri Belyaev provided a very interesting potential explanation .
Genetics at the time was preoccupied with easily measurable traits that could be passed on – if you bred dogs , you could pick the biggest puppies , breed them , and they would produce bigger dogs on average .
Fine .
But that is selection of a single simple trait , something that likely did not require that many genes to “ switch ” in order for the puppies to be bigger .
But what if you were selecting for something more complicated ?
What if , instead of selecting for a simple trait like size or eye color , you selected for something more vague like behaviour – in this case , the very behaviour that made these animals more likely to be around humans .
We can call it tamability , or lack of aggressiveness , or whatever – the point is , we are selecting for those animals who will behave in a manner we want around us .
A wolf who does not display aggressive behaviour might be able to grab a few scraps of food from the garbage pile of a early human settlement , rather than being driven off .
And if we were selecting a complicated behaviour , rather than a simple trait , it seems likely that it will require more change in the animals genetic code .
And since the genetic code is a tangled web where a small bit of DNA can be referenced in many areas of the body – perhaps selecting for a common behaviour would also cause other common traits to arise in animals that are otherwise different .
It ’s like giving your car a paint job versus trying to make it go faster – the paint job is easy , but trying to make it faster could lead to your car exhibiting other traits you did n’t directly request , like consuming more gas during regular driving .
This could be common across all your project cars .
One is a low level trait ( the paint , the size of puppy ) that can be encompassed in a tiny bit of information ( color , size ) , the other is a high level trait ( speed , tamability ) that must involve a wide variety of sub-systems changing as well .
The Experiment
Now if you were a Soviet scientist in the late 1950s , you probably worked on something awesome like a giant robot that shot nuclear missles , or a flying submarine .
Not Dmitri Belyaev .
No , he lost his job as head of the Department of Fur Animal Breeding at the Central Research Laboratory of Fur Breeding in Moscow in 1948 because he was committed to the theories of classical genetics rather than the very fashionable ( and totally wrong ) theories of Lysenkoism .
So instead , he started breeding foxes .
Well , it was technically an experiment to study animal physiology , but that was more of a ruse to get his Lysenkoism - loving bosses off his back while he could study genetics and his theories of selecting for behaviour .
He started out with 130 silver foxes .
Like foxes in the wild , their ears are erect , the tail is low slung , and the fur is silver - black with a white tip on the tail .
Tameness was selected for rigorously – only about 5 % of males and 20 % of females were allowed to breed each generation .
At first , all foxes bred were classified as Class III foxes .
They are tamer than the calmest farm - bred foxes , but flee from humans and will bite if stroked or handled .
The next generation of foxes were deemed Class II foxes .
Class II foxes will allow humans to pet them and pick them up , but do not show any emotionally friendly response to people .
If you are a cat owner , you would call the experiment a success at this point .
Later generations produced Class I foxes .
They are eager to establish human contact , and will wag their tails and whine .
Domesticated features were noted to occur with increasing frequency .
Forty years after the start of the experiment , 70 to 80 percent of the foxes are now Class IE – the “ domesticated elite ” .
When raised with humans , they are affectionate devoted animals , capable of forming strong bonds with their owner .
These “ elite ” foxes also exhibit domestic features such as depigmentation ( 1,646 % increase in frequency ) , floppy ears ( 35 % increase in frequency ) , short tails ( 6,900 % increase in frequency ) , and other traits also seen frequently in domesticated animals .
The Results
Belyaevn passed away in 1985 , but he was able to witness the early success of his hypothesis , that selecting for behaviour can cause cascading changes throughout the entire organism .
For instance , the current explanation for the loss of pigment is that melanin ( a compound that acts to color the coat of the animal ) shares a common pathway with adrenaline ( a compound that increases the “ fight or flight ” instinct of an animal ) .
Reduction of adrenaline ( by selecting for tame animals ) inadvertently reduces melanin ( causing the observed depigmentation effects ) .
So if Belyaevn is right , genetics is not just a low slow process that works on tiny incremental tweaks .
Complicated environmental pressures can result in complicated genetic results , in a stunningly quick period of time .
Where do I think we ’re going with this ?
Well , designer pets for one .
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , the project ran into serious financial trouble in the late 1990s .
They had to cut down the amount of foxes drastically , and the project survived primarily on funding obtained from selling the tame foxes as exotic pets .
Imagine a menagerie of dwarf exotic animals , who crave human attention and form bonds with people .
It would be obscenely profitable .
And the out there thought for the day ?
We ’re doing this to ourselves .
We do n’t encourage people to act aggressively all day to everyone they meet .
We reward certain behaviours more than other behaviours .
My unprovable conjecture ?
Humanity is selecting itself for certain behaviours , and the traits we think of as fundamentally human ( loss of hair , retention of juvenile characteristics relative to primates ) are a side effect of this self - selection .
Videos
Here are some great videos with footage of the tame foxes .
From NOVA – Dogs and More Dogs ( starts at about 17:30 )
“ Suddenly , it all started to make sense .
As Belyaev bred his foxes for tameness , over the generations their bodies began producing different levels of a whole range of hormones .
These hormones , in turn , set off a cascade of changes that somehow triggered a surprising degree of genetic variation .
Just the simple act of selecting for tameness destabilized the genetic make up of these animals in such a way that all sorts of stuff that you would never normally see in a wild population suddenly appeared . ”

I. Technical Content and National Context
When it appeared in 1953 , the Russian translation of the “ Mathematical Theory of Communication ” hardly read like the same text written in English by Claude Shannon a few years before . [ 1 ]
Purged of any trace of man-machine analogies , the translation portrayed communications engineering as an ideologically neutral technical field .
The Russian editor replaced Shannon ’s original title with the Russian , “ The Statistical Theory of Electrical Signal Transmission , ” and he rid the work of the words “ information , ” “ communication , ” and “ mathematical ” entirely , put “ entropy ” in quotation marks , and substituted “ data ” for “ information ” throughout the text .
The editor assured the reader ( and the censor ) that Shannon ’s concept of “ entropy ” had nothing to do with physical entropy and was called such only on the basis of “ purely superficial similarity of mathematical formulae . ” [ 2 ]
Thus the editor carefully avoided the anthropomorphic connotations of the words information and communication and at the same time distanced the use of the term “ entropy ” in the text from its controversial discussions in physics and biology .
Trying to avoid any reference to the links between information theory and linguistics , the cautious editor even removed the entire third section of Shannon ’s paper , the one dealing with the statistical analysis of natural language .
The editor drew a sharp line between what he called ideologically deficient , pseudo - scientific attempts to “ transfer the rules of radio communication to biological and psychological phenomena ” and the practically useful , firmly scientific statistical theory of electrical signal transmission . [ 3 ]
His discursive strategy was simple : to portray information theory as a purely technical tool with no connection to the ideology - laden biological and social sciences .
The translation typified Soviet communications engineers ' attempts to remove ideology from their work to place emphasis on technical applications of information theory rather than its potential conceptual innovations .
This translation of Shannon 's work occurred at the time of the Soviet anti-cybernetics campaign , about which more will be said later in this paper .
Taken on its own , however , the episode points to the charged relationship of information theory , and its cold - war cousin , cybernetics , to ideology and the social sciences in the cultural and political worlds of the 1940s and 50s .
In both cases , highly technical theories put forward by mathematicians acquired ideological baggage which some took up with enthusiasm and others vehemently rejected .
In both cases , claims were made for the broader significance of the work outside the technical realms in which they originated , although the authors participated in this process to differing degrees .
Norbert Wiener explicitly expanded his theory of prediction and smoothing to a universal science , an extrapolation Claude Shannon always resisted for his information theory .
French scientists took up cybernetics and information theory , at least in part , because of their perceived ideological implications .
In contrast , Shannon 's Russian editors clearly thought they could distinguish between the political and cultural implications of information theory and the raw , technical content which concerned transmission of signals through noisy channels .
A cross-national comparison of the generation and reception of the two new sciences reveals how they acquired , shaped , and in were formed by the cultures in which they were embedded .
In the United States , information theory and cybernetics emerged out of highly technical , but also irreducibly social , military problems presented by World War II .
In his post war Cybernetics , Norbert Wiener attempted to abstract his mathematics out of the technical culture which gave birth to it and simultaneously to extend its reach beyond technology into biology , economics , and social systems .
Claude Shannon , with a less ambitious but more analytically specific theory , made more modest claims but with equally broad implications : his theory of entropy and channel capacity could model not only technical communications but also human language , and hence a broad array of human activities .
In France , commentators and scientists variously saw these new American sciences as bourgeois conjecture , full of mythology and mystification , or as exciting meta - theories capable of uniting diverse disciplines .
Similarly , in Russia , an early anti-cybernetics campaign saw Shannon and Wiener 's work as embodiments of idealist , reactionary , American pseudoscience .
After Stalin 's death , however , Russian scientists made a complete reversal of their attitude toward the two new sciences .
They extracted from information theory “ natural laws ” of information processing and made cybernetic feedback the foundation of a dialectical description of language and society .
Following initial skepticism and discussion , cybernetics was institutionalized in Europe in a way it never was in the United States .
In the pages that follow we examine the conception of information theory and cybernetics in the United States and their relationship to the technical cultures within which Shannon and Wiener worked .
Then we move on to their reception in France , and how ensuing debates shaped significant French contributions to the information sciences .
Similarly , in Russia we trace how an initial ideological hostility transformed into grudging acceptance and then total embrace .
As with any such story , the choice of origins is somewhat arbitrary , as both Shannon and Wiener had important influences from France , Russia , and elsewhere , but the two formed significant nodes in ongoing international networks of mathematics .
In the interests of analytical simplicity and brevity , we do allow some slippage between information theory and cybernetics , as did the actors under study , though the relationship between them is worthy of a study in its own right .
In all these debates , and indeed in the subsequent history , the essence of cybernetics and information theory prove hard to pin down .
Were they embodiments of an American , overarching military - industrial mindset , or new sciences of everything ?
The intellectual equivalents of the Marshall Plan , or useful new descriptions of electrical signals ?
Did Shannon and Wiener represent the antecedents of computer science , or an updated expression of Taylorist industrial rationality ?
Information theory and cybernetics were , perhaps , all of these things and none of them .
Their very malleability makes a cross-national comparison worthwhile , as it highlights the difficulty of culling discrete political messages from mathematics , and also the difficulty of harvesting a pure , apolitical mathematics from its historical soil .
II .
The Origins of Cybernetics : Expanding Control Norbert Wiener , in his 1948 book Cybernetics : or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine articulated the marriage of communication and control for a generation of engineers , systems theorists , and technical enthusiasts of varied stripes .
Wiener declared the merger occurred instantly , obviously and completely in the course of his work on antiaircraft prediction devices .
“ I think that I can claim credit , ” Wiener wrote in his memoir , “ ... for transferring the whole theory of the servomechanism bodily to communication engineering . ” [ 4 ]
Recently , historians have revisited this account , exploring the genesis of Wiener ’s project , its roots in his earlier work , and its short - term failure and profound long - term effects .
But these views center on Wiener : the academic , the intellectual , and the mathematician ; they tend not to address his connection to a broader technical culture . [ 5 ]
Indeed we have little historical understanding of cybernetics in relation to engineering practice in control , computing , electronics , and communications .
Some things were genuinely new about the human / machine relationship articulated by cybernetics , others were derived from existing ideas in engineering .
Wiener ’s cybernetics emerged from the world of automation , military command , and computing during and after World War II .
Wiener ’s own work on control systems during the war existed within a set of projects and a technical agenda which aimed to automate human performance in battle through a tight coupling of people and machines .
Indeed before Wiener ’s cybernetics , American technology was already suffused with what would later be called “ cybernetic ” ideas .
Several strong pre-war traditions of feedback mechanisms — including regulators and governors , industrial process controls , military control systems , feedback electronics , and a nascent academic discipline of control theory — suggests a broader and more gradual convergence of communications and control than the strict “ Wienerian ” account . [ 6 ]
Servo engineers turned to techniques common in the telephone network to characterize the behavior of powerful feedback devices .
Radar engineers adapted communications theory to deal with noise in tracking .
Human operators were always necessary but problematic components of automatic control systems .
Military technologists had wrestled with the notion of prediction since at least the turn of the century .
These were but a few of the features of the technological terrain onto which Norbert Wiener stepped in 1940 when he began working on control systems .
Yet Wiener eventually presented cybernetics as a specifically scientific discourse of communication and control , distinct from its practitioners .
Like Shannon 's Russian translator , Wiener attempted to divorce the content of his work from its social soil , and to embed it in a different tradition .
A . The NDRC and the fire control problem In 1940 Vannevar Bush formed the National Defense Research Committee ( or NDRC ) , to bring university and industrial research to bear on military problems .
Led by Warren Weaver , then also head of the Natural Sciences Division of the Rockefeller Foundation , the NDRC established a committee , called section D - 2 , responsible for control systems .
Under this committee , control engineers developed the technology , indeed the practical philosophy , that Wiener would articulate so effectively in his postwar writing on cybernetics .
During the war , much of that philosophy coalesced around difficult problems of antiaircraft fire control .
Using artillery to hit fast - moving airplanes pressed to its limits the engineering knowledge of dynamic performance , mathematical precision , corrupted data , and the human operator .
Research in data smoothing and prediction — two key elements of fire control — began to formalize an engineering approach based on abstracting the physical world and manipulating it as electrical signals , the basis of later strategies of computing and information processing .
Engineering practice evolved in parallel with this theoretical work , and sometimes preceded it .
Weaver 's control systems committee brought institutional pressure to bear on communications and control ; it placed dual emphasis on Bell Labs , temple of communications , and MIT , which had a strong program in feedback control and servomechanisms ( a servomechanism or servo is an electric or hydraulic motor that , with the addition of a feedback loop , is able to precisely hold and control its position ) .
During the war , the NDRC control systems committee funded eighty research contracts in feedback theory , devices , and computing , totaling about $ 10 million at Bell Labs , MIT , and a number of other academic and industrial laboratories .
Nearly every American computer pioneer ( Atanasoff , Eckert & Mauchly , Shannon , Stibitz ) of the time worked on at least one of these contracts during the war .
Two of the eighty projects funded Norbert Wiener at MIT . [ 7 ]
Wiener had studied electrical networks during the 1930s and in 1940 he proposed to apply network theory to servo engineering .
This work had already been done by Henrik Bode at Bell Labs , however , so by late 1940 , the NDRC asked Wiener to bring his knowledge of networks to prediction in fire control .
This tricky problem required anticipating the future position of a target aircraft so an antiaircraft gun could lead the target and hit it with a shell , after some finite delay of the shell 's time of flight ( as much as one minute for high flying aircraft ) .
Wiener simulated a prediction network on MIT ’s calculating machine , the Differential Analyzer , and showed encouraging results .
On December 1 , 1940 the NDRC let a contract to MIT for “ General Mathematical Theory of Prediction and Applications . ”
For the contract , Wiener and his assistant , engineer Julian Bigelow , would devise a theory to follow a given curve , chosen to represent the path of an airplane , and estimate the value of that curve at some time in the future .
During early 1941 the two designed and built a machine to simulate their ideas on prediction . [ 8 ]
Wiener and Bigelow quickly ran into a stability problem .
Wiener ’s network was highly sensitive , even unstable , in the presence of high frequency noise . [ 9 ]
This was a cousin of the stability problem facing other engineering disciplines which dealt with feedback loops — transient inputs caused oscillations .
Wiener quickly realized the problem was fundamental , “ in the order of things , ” ( he compared it to Heisenberg ’s uncertainty principle ) and that he would need a new approach .
He and Bigelow now turned to statistics , designing a new predictor based on “ a statistical analysis of the correlation between the past performance of a function of time and its present and future performance . ”
The new network continually updated its own prediction as time passed and it compared the target ’s flight path with previous guesses .
A feedback network converged on guesses which minimized this error . [ 10 ]
In modern terms , this device might be described as a one - dimensional neural network , which learned about the world as it gathered new data .
Through the remainder of 1941 , Wiener worked out in detail the theory behind his statistical approach , scribbling on a blackboard as Bigelow took notes .
Warren Weaver agreed that Wiener 's theory could produce an optimal predictor and let another NDRC contract for Wiener to write up his theoretical results . [ 11 ]
The product of that contract , Wiener ’s report , Extrapolation , Interpolation , and Smoothing of Stationary Time Series , was published by the NDRC for restricted circulation in early 1942 .
Here Wiener explicitly brought together statistics and communications theory with engineering of high power systems ,
In that moment in which circuits of large power are used to transmit a pattern or to control the time behavior of a machine , power engineering differs from communication engineering only in the energy levels involved and in the particular apparatus used suitable for such energy levels , but is not in fact a separate branch of engineering from communications . [ 12 ]
Building on his own work in harmonic analysis and operational calculus , Wiener constructed a general theory of smoothing and predicting “ time series , ” — any problem ( including economic and policy questions ) expressed as a discrete series of data .
While he gestured at electric power and servo design as well as communications , Wiener did not explicitly address any previous work in feedback theory .
Yet Wiener 's work , however theoretically important , did not have immediate applications .
In late 1942 , Weaver reported that for predicting actual recorded target tracks , Wiener ’s “ optimal ” method proved only marginally more effective than a far , far simpler design of Henrik Bode's .
At its next meeting , the NDRC decided to terminate Wiener ’s work ; the project ended in January , 1943 ( Bigelow left to join a statistical fire control group at Columbia ) . [ 13 ]
B. Wiener 's civilian elaboration Disappointed by his failure to produce a practical device for the war effort , Wiener plunged into elaborating on his work in a context separate from the NDRC 's concrete demands .
Wiener had a long time interest in physiology , and the previous spring he and collaborators physician Arturo Rosenblueth and neurologist Walter Cannon had begun addressing physiological and neurological feedback .
In the spring of 1942 Wiener ’s papers first mention the idea of the human operator as a feedback element , an integral part of the system .
He discussed the “ behaviorist ” implications of his work in control , “ the problem of examining the behavior of an instrument from this [ behaviorist ] point of view is fundamental in communication engineering . ” [ 14 ]
This period , the last few months of Wiener ’s NDRC program , marked the conception of his “ cybernetic vision , ” which would make him famous after the war .
Wiener placed his understanding of the servomechanical nature of the mechanisms of control and communication in both humans and machines at the core of cybernetics and his program sought to extend that understanding to biological , physiological , and social systems .
For Norbert Wiener , in the midst of the technological war , cybernetics became a civilian enterprise .
The cancellation of his NDRC contracts in 1943 put him outside the massive wartime research effort , with access to only civilian resources .
His 1943 paper , “ Behavior , Purpose , and Teleology , ” written with Rosenblueth and Bigelow , allied servomechanisms with the “ behavioristic approach ” to organisms and classified behavior by level of prediction . [ 15 ]
The paper ’s philosophical tone and biological metaphors reflected the strictures of secrecy surrounding Wiener ’s prior work and his new alliance with the life sciences : topics and researchers which , like Wiener , were comparatively free of the war effort .
Later Wiener acknowledged the role fire control and prediction played in his thinking , but beginning with “ Behavior , Purpose , and Teleology , ” cybernetics recast military control in a civilian mold .
Most indicative of this alienation and reconstruction is Wiener ’s consistent hesitation to acknowledge any of the multiple traditions of feedback in engineering which preceded him .
In all his writing on cybernetics , he never cited Elmer Sperry , Nicholas Minorsky , Harold Black , Harry Nyquist , Hendrik Bode , or Harold Hazen — all published on the theory of feedback before 1940 ( their publications became standard citations ) ; all were recognized as important to the field ; all speculated on the human role in automatic control ; some even wrote on the merger of communications and control and the epistemology of feedback .
But Wiener only rarely cited any servo theory later than Maxwell ’s 1867 paper “ On Governors . ” [ 16 ]
The omissions are striking , Wiener must have been aware of the work : he was closely involved in Vannevar Bush ’s research program in the 1930s including Hazen 's work on servos ; he worked with the MIT ’s Servomechanisms Lab and its Radiation Laboratory during the war , and was in touch with Hendrik Bode during the wartime work on predictors .
Still he wrote , “ I think that I can claim credit for transferring the whole theory of the servomechanism bodily to communication engineering . ”
Wiener placed cybernetics at the end of an intellectual , scientific trajectory , separate from the traditions of technical practice from which it sprang .
Wiener ’s chapter on “ Cybernetics in history , ” from The Human Use of Human Beings , refers only to Leibniz , Pascal , Maxwell , and Gibbs as “ ancestors , ” of the new discipline .
Wiener reacted to and built on an evolving understanding , pervasive among engineers and psychologists involved with fire control in the 1940s , that the boundary between humans and machines affected the performance of dynamic systems and was a fruitful area of research .
Unlike Wiener , however , NDRC researchers remained bound by military secrecy at least until 1945 and busy with contractual obligations ( many remained so after the war .
With no publication restrictions and no time obligations to wartime research contracts , Wiener could do and say as he pleased .
Wiener 's reformulation had ideological implications , especially in light of his own estrangement from military research .
After Hiroshima and Nagasaki , Wiener became critical of the American military 's dominance of the country 's engineering efforts .
In the early forties , he had been anything but a pacifist : he suggested to the army filling antiaircraft shells with flammable gasses to burn enemy planes from the sky ; he pondered what types of forested areas and grain crops were most susceptible to fire bombing . [ 17 ]
Still , the atomic bombs , and perhaps his disappointing NDRC project , changed Wiener ’s attitude toward military research .
His primary substantive contact with what he later called “ the tragic insolence of the military mind , ” occurred under NDRC auspices and ended in January , 1943 . [ 18 ]
Though the " Interpolation , Extrapolation … " paper had significant military applications , Wiener 's Cybernetics sought primarily to elaborate it as civilian philosophy , rather than military engineering .
Wiener 's efforts to bring his model to broad communities of physiologists , physicians , and social scientists , are well documented . [ 19 ]
Through the informal " Teleological Society , " the series of Macy Conferences , and a growing identity as a public intellectual , Wiener elevated his thinking on control and communication to a moral philosophy of technology , and enjoyed enthusiastic response .
Of this elevation , of the A.A. Predictor to the “ symbol for the new age of man , ” Galison argues that Wiener enshrined an oppositional military metaphor into the civilian science of cybernetics and its descendents . [ 20 ]
In light of Wiener 's wartime work , however , the survival of the oppositional model was also ironic , as Wiener 's wartime experience suggests he formulated cybernetics also as a specifically non-military , scientific endeavor .
Nor was Wiener 's formulation the only to emerge from the War with broad implications .
In 1945 , as the NDRC closed down , it issued a series of Summary Technical Reports .
The volume on fire control contained a special essay , “ Data Smoothing and Prediction in Fire - Control Systems , ” by Richard B. Blackman , Hendrik Bode , and Claude Shannon , which formally integrated communications and control and pointed toward generality in signal processing .
The authors treated fire control as “ a special case of the transmission , manipulation , and utilization of intelligence . ”
They assessed control as a problem in electrical communications , developing analogs to the prediction problem , “ couched entirely in electrical language . ”
The authors , like Wiener , recognized the broad applicability of their study , “ The input data ... are thought of as constituting a series in time similar to weather records , stock market prices , production statistics , and the like . ”
Acknowledging the importance of Wiener ’s work , Blackman , Bode , and Shannon devoted significant effort to summarizing his statistical approach .
Ultimately they rejected it , however , due to problems applying the RMS error criterion to fire control , as well as its assumptions about statistical behavior of human pilots .
Instead , the paper formulated the problem as one of communications engineering , drawing heavily on Bode ’s work in feedback control : “ there is an obvious analogy between the problem of smoothing the data to eliminate or reduce the effect of tracking errors and the problem of separating a signal from interfering noise in communications systems . ” [ 21 ]
While noting “ this analogy ... must of course not be carried too far , ” the paper considered inputs and disturbances in fire control systems as signals in the frequency domain , just like those in telephone communications .
At the same time that Wiener was working through his ideas on cybernetics , of course , Claude Shannon developed his own theory of communication , and the case forms something of a contrast to Wiener 's expansive moves .
Shannon built on his own experiences in fire control , computing , and cryptography as well as ideas from twenty years before at Bell Labs .
In his famous 1948 paper , " A Mathematical Theory of Communication , " Shannon provided provide a measure of channel capacity , in bits per second , which describes the maximum amount of information possible to send down a given channel .
He added a serious consideration of noise and a statistical approach to the problem .
“ Communication theory is heavily indebted to Wiener for much of its basic philosophy and theory , ” Shannon wrote , citing Wiener ’s NDRC report . [ 22 ]
Shannon ’s measure leads to a theory of efficient coding , how to optimally translate a series of “ primary symbols , ” such as English text , into “ secondary code ” to be transmitted . ” [ 23 ]
As if to solidify the connection between Shannon ’s theory and fire control , Warren Weaver wrote a popular introduction and explication of information theory , published with Shannon ’s paper in a small book , in which Weaver called for an expanded context for information theory in a hierarchy of human activity . [ 24 ]
Yet while others built on Shannon 's work and applied it to numerous other problems , including everything from biology to psychology and art , Shannon himself did not make the expansive leaps that Wiener did .
In fact , Shannon mocked the " scientific bandwagon " which had grown up around information theory , and warned that " the basic results of the subject are aimed in a very specific direction , a direction that is not necessarily relevant to such fields as psychology , economics , and other social sciences . " [ 25 ]
In light of the NDRC ’s research program in fire control , and , for that matter , of decades of pre-war control engineering , Wiener ’s syntheses of communications and control , human and machine , articulated broad converging patterns as much as created new ones .
Cybernetic ideas had as much to do with established and evolving engineering traditions as with any radically new military mindset .
Cybernetics , the book as well as the movement , articulated a vision of changing human / machine analogies which resonated with a broad audience .
Its ramifications in the United States and abroad were significant , if as much for the overarching vision as for any concrete results .
Its very malleability , however , of the human - machine analogy and its underlying mathematics , would both undermine cybernetics and be a source of its power , especially as it moved into international environments .
Wiener 's own postwar politics would not be enough to stabilize the ideology of his formulation , for others , as they took up cybernetics , had politics of their own .
III .
Cybernetics and Information Theory in France How , then , was cybernetics received outside the United States , as a military tool , an analytical technique , and a philosophical program ?
While cybernetics is generally thought to have American origins , the book itself was actually published in France .
In that country , information theory was hailed as a new general discipline which included cybernetics .
Through the first two congresses dealing with cybernetics , held in Paris in 1950 and 1951 , the French adopted and modified Wiener 's work .
Debates became acrimonious as the French Communist Party strongly engaged itself against cybernetics , which it saw as a ‘ bourgeois ’ science .
From the late 1950s onwards , a kind of normalization of the field took place , which correlated both with the promotion of cybernetics in popular science articles and books and with the institutionalization of cybernetics research in Western Europe .
This development also relied on the contributions of a few scientists who took advantage of information theory to fill the existing gap between physics , mathematics and engineering science .
In the spring of 1947 , Wiener was invited to a congress on harmonic analysis , held in Nancy , France and organized by the bourbakist mathematician , Szolem Mandelbrojt ( 1899 -1983 ) .
During this stay in France Wiener received the offer to write a manuscript on the unifying character of this part of applied mathematics , which is found in the study of Brownian motion and in telecommunication engineering .
The following summer , back in the United States , Wiener decided to introduce the neologism ‘ cybernetics ’ ( from the Greek – meaning the man at the wheel or rudder ) into his scientific theory .
Though the word is found in the Gorgias by Plato , it also had a French usage , though Wiener did n’t know that the French physicist André - Marie Ampère ( 1775 - 1836 ) had already used it for his classification of the sciences to define “ how the citizens can enjoy a peaceful time ” . [ 26 ]
Wiener ’s book was published in English by Hermann Editions in Paris and by M.I.T.
Press , in collaboration with John Wiley & Sons in New York .
In an introductory chapter about this “ explosive science ” , Pierre De Latil reminds us that M.I.T .
Press tried their best to prevent the publication of the book in France , since Wiener , then professor at M.I.T. , was bound to them by contract .
As a representative of Hermann Editions , M. Freymann managed to find a compromise and the French publisher won the rights to the book . [ 27 ]
This became financially significant since after three reprints in six months , the book had sold 21,000 copies .
A journalist at Business Week compared it with the Kinsey Report , also published in 1948 , about the sexual behavior of American people , “ In one respect Wiener ’s book resembles the Kinsey report ; the publication reaction to it is at least as significant as the content of the book itself . ” [ 28 ]
The French press reacted enthusiastically .
On December 28 , 1948 in the well - known newspaper Le Monde , a whole page was dedicated to “ A new science : Cybernetics ” with the subtitle “ Towards a governing machine … ” .
The author , Dominique Dubarle , sticks close to the myth of the robot , predicting that man would be replaced by machine even for the functions which require man ’s intelligence .
Far from the technical questions linked to servomechanisms , this perspective was clearly driven by a kind of techno - optimism .
New kinds of machines are mentioned : “ prediction machines ” ( like air defense systems ) , “ sensitive machines ” ( so the blind people could ‘ see ’ again ) , and “ sorting machines ” .
It is noteworthy that Dubarle identifies the key common point of these machines , the capacity to treat information , newly defined according to the scientific context introduced by Wiener and especially developed by Claude E. Shannon in his mathematical theory of communication .
“ Let ’s say that those machines are designed to collect and elaborate information in order to produce results which can lead to decisions as well as to knowledge ” .
This is how Dubarle ends his review , reflecting on “ a unique government for the planet ” which could as a new “ political Leviathan , ” “ supply the present obvious inadequacy of the brain when the latter is concerned with the customary machinery of politics . ”
This is in fact the translation Wiener himself made for his book on The Human Use of Human Beings which devotes six pages to Dubarle ’s “ penetrating review ” . [ 29 ]
This article in Le Monde was the impetus for a series of articles in the main intellectual journals like Esprit and La Nouvelle revue française .
We again find Dubarle , in 1950 , defending an indeterminist conception of science , necessary for him in order to introduce the scientific notion of information . [ 30 ]
This philosophical debate turned out to be crucial in 1953 , when the famous French physicist , Louis de Broglie , commenting on the theories of quantum physics adopted this same position ( see below ) .
During this lapse of two years , between 1948 and 1950 , Louis de Broglie had already been confronted with cybernetics .
A “ Circle of Cybernetical Studies ” ( Cercle d'Etudes Cybernétiques ) had been created and de Broglie was the Honorary President of this first association with the word ' cybernetics ' in its name . [ 31 ]
Vallée , Scotto du Vettimo and Talbotier decided as early as 1949 to gather interested readers of Wiener 's book . [ 32 ]
Whereas many people read and discussed Wiener 's book , few scientists were in touch with Americans involved in these fields .
For instance , the physicist Leon Brillouin ( 1889 - 1969 ) , who had lived in New York since 1941 , tried to organize visits from French officials to take advantage of the latest developments related to computers . [ 33 ]
J. Pérès , director of the Institut Blaise Pascal in Paris ( created in 1946 ) , went with L. Couffignal to the United States , but Couffignal , then in charge of the construction of the first French computer , preferred advocating a different ‘ French ’ conception and decided to ignore the American accomplishments related to the construction of the first computers .
This turned out to be an important error and the notorious French delay in computing finds an explanation in the fact that so much credit had been accorded to Couffignal .
A. French Political Context Still , the fact that Couffignal decided to ignore US research has to be understood in the French context of this time .
In 1947 , France was marked by political instability .
In the November 1946 legislative election , the French Communist Party came first , with nearly a third of the votes , but in May 1947 , the communist ministers were dismissed by the President Ramadier who followed Truman ’s appeal from March 15th to all Western countries to exclude all communist forces from governments .
French people still had to live with rationing , and by the end of August 1947 , the daily bread value per inhabitant went under the 200g level .
Strikes in October and November led to the resignation of the Ramadier cabinet .
These strikes affected the reception of cybernetics in France .
At the Conservatoire Nationale des Arts et Métiers ( C.N.A.M. ) , a series of five public lectures had been announced , dealing with servomechanisms .
In his introductory remarks , Albert Métral ( 1902 - 1962 ) advocated the “ French technology ” which could in his view could easily compete with the “ science and techniques from abroad . ”
The participants were mostly scientists who also worked with the military , especially from the engineering sciences or telecommunication research .
Trained in mechanics , Métral praised the French “ grey matter potential . ”
This kind of scientific nationalism was indeed associated with a vague anti-Americanism , as in some of the public declarations made at this time by Général de Gaulle . [ 34 ]
One of the lectures organized in Paris in the last week of October 1947 had to be cancelled because of the strikes . [ 35 ]
The general climate of opinion at this time was somewhat hostile to American culture and science , and this was only the beginning of the Cold War era .
France was really “ between the East and the West , ” which was made clear whenever the Marshall Plan or the status of Germany were discussed . [ 36 ]
This political context , then , set the stage for cybernetics , viewed as an American theory , to be introduced in France .
In 1950 , the French mathematician G. - Th.
Guilbaud in his article entitled , “ Cybernetical Divagations , ” criticized the use of a “ fashionable name ” and wondered if , in the development of cybernetics , there were not some " improper associations , ” “ fuzzy meaning ” and constitution of “ myths . ”
Nevertheless , he recalled that cybernetics was born out of a desire for unification and that , as such , it was worthy of consideration . [ 37 ]
This idea of unification provided the impetus for the first scientific congresses on cybernetics .
B. Discussions at the first French congresses
The first two congresses dealing with cybernetics or information theory gathered scientists from different backgrounds with different goals . [ 38 ]
Mathematicians , for instance , were not much interested in the very general considerations contained in Cybernetics , while some engineers , who in France were somewhat despised by the intellectual elite , were intrigued by this book , in which they saw as a possibility of gaining social recognition .
Generally , these congresses allowed a first timid institutionalization of cybernetics when new research areas were being recognized .
Instead of a congress , between April and May 1950 Louis de Broglie organized a series of lectures .
The general title was “ Cybernetics ” , with the subtitle “ signal and information theory . ” [ 39 ]
Dennis Gabor was the only scientist from abroad who insisted , like Louis de Broglie , on bringing cybernetics into the physical sciences to avoid it becoming a part of mathematics .
Studies on Brownian motion , for instance , were considered helpful for telecommunication engineers .
Engineers involved in this field generally accepted this suggestion , and Julien Loeb , from the National Center for the Study of Telecommunications ( C.N.E.T. ) , who also had presented a paper at the C.N.A.M. in 1947 , recalled that “ If sciences like biology , sociology etc. should benefit from the theoretical works exposed in these series of lectures , the telecommunication techniques themselves should also profit . ” [ 40 ]
It was only after these lectures that information theory was progressively recognized as an autonomous scientific discipline .
A. Blanc - Lapierre , a trained physicist who decided to work on noise effects , remembers that prior to this lecture series , his colleagues found his work too impregnated with mathematics and that in the mathematics community , he was criticized for not having thoroughly studied probability theory . [ 41 ]
Cybernetics appeared again one year later in a congress titled “ computing machines and human thought ” held in Paris in January 1951 .
This congress was aimed at a larger public ; as we can read in a report written by Paul Chauchard , it was “ the first manifestation in France of the young cybernetics , with the participation of N. Wiener , the father of this science . ” [ 42 ]
The anti-Americanism expressed at the end of the 1940s had almost vanished .
The Marshall Plan had been accepted , two countries had been created in Germany and France was now clearly on the Western side . [ 43 ]
For this congress , sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation , a number of foreigners were invited , including Howard Aiken , Warren McCulloch , Maurice Wilkes , Grey Walter , Donald MacKay and Ross Ashby , along with Wiener who was staying in Paris for a couple of months at the Collège de France .
It is no surprise that the two French scientists who organized the conference were the two who had visited the U.S. laboratories , Couffignal and Pérès .
Three hundred people attended the congress where fourteen machines from six different countries were demonstrated , including a mechanical chess player by Torres y Quevedo and the famous ‘ Turtle ’ conceived by Grey Walter , two machines specially designed to imitate human behavior .
Studying the 38 presented papers and the script of the reported discussions , one can make two points .
First , whereas in France the mathematicians seemed to dominate research related to computing machines , one finds physicists in the same position in the U.K .
Secondly , information theory already played an important role in the development of the analogy between the human brain and computing machines .
McCulloch for instance suggested that the nervous system makes use of “ logarithmic processes ” , which are also utilized by telecommunications engineers .
So , at the end of these two conferences , already a kind of “ French cybernetics ” which had been admitted in the scientific establishment .
In 1952 , a first assessment of American cybernetics was made by Louis de Broglie , who also attended this congress .
He estimated that overall , cybernetics had not been as innovative as it could have been and that in fact , servomechanism theory had already been established as an independent discipline without it . [ 44 ]
This was the time when cybernetics became the focal point of an important ideological debate .
C. Ideological attack from the French Communist Party
Since the outbreak of the Cold War , philosophy of science had developed into a major ideological battlefield , and cybernetics quickly became the subject of several lively discussions .
Already in May 1948 , before the publication of Cybernetics , Jacques Bergier had written an article on “ an ongoing new revolution even more important than that of the atomic age ” , the general theory of automata .
His position was ambiguous : on the one hand he expressed his enthusiasm , and on the other , he feared that “ robots will take the place of workers . ”
Since the outbreak of the Cold War , philosophy of science had developed into a major ideological battlefield , and cybernetics quickly became the subject of several lively discussions .

His position was ambiguous : on the one hand he expressed his enthusiasm , and on the other , he feared that “ robots will take the place of workers . ” [ 45 ]
He referred mostly to Soviet science , and , as in the American case , his two reference fields which led to a general theory were automatic exchange systems and anti-aircraft technology .
One year later , in the same weekly , Jean Cabrerets attacked cybernetics . [ 46 ]
Referring to the project of a French computing machine that Couffignal had begun to conceive , Cabrerets proudly announced that “ the universal French machines have chosen intelligence ” and will soon “ eclipse those [ American ] electronic brains like the Eniac . ”
His comments on the visit that Brillouin organized for Couffignal were typical of the period , “ It is to us significant that these new ‘ electronic brains ’ were born after and not before the visit that Brillouin and Couffignal made last year to the universities of Harvard and Philadelphia . ”
To understand these vehement attacks against American science , one has to consider the action of the Kominform , created in September 1947 , and the evolution of the Soviet positions ( see the section on Soviet cybernetics below ) .
The anti-cybernetics campaign in France culminated with an article by André Lentin , in the official monthly journal of the communist party , La Pensée ( The Thought ) .
Lentin writes on “ Cybernetics : real problems and mystifications ” . [ 47 ]
In an interview , Lentin remembers that he was annoyed at the beginning of the 1950s because “ bad scientists ” used cybernetics ’ popularity to publish and Wiener ’s book was used in almost all disciplines as a kind of panacea . [ 48 ]
In his article , he directed the reader to the proceedings of the 1947 conferences held at the C.N.A.M. to understand a real general theory of servomechanisms .
He tried to show that what Wiener did was more or less merely commentary on J. Watt ’s work on the governor .
Cybernetics was simply described as a “ gigantic enterprise of mystification . ”
The only interest Lentin saw in Wiener ’s theory was the description of negative feedback which showed for him a “ clear and conscious expression of the dialectic laws . ”
Apart from this point , he believes that cybernetics should be rejected because it is a legitimatization of three dangerous bourgeois ideologies : Taylorism , robots without class consciousness instead of workers ; idealism , interpreting a formal analogy between information and entropy as an identity ; and , above all , capitalist economy , if one thinks of such feedback laws as “ offer and demand determine the market . ” [ 49 ]
D. French contributions to information theory Apart from these ideological critics , the mid 1950s were also marked by French contributions to the development of information theory .
Brillouin , central figure for the exchanges he organized between France and the United States , was also one of the first promoters of information theory in physics .
His first publication on this theme , which emphasized the analogy between entropy and information as defined by Shannon in order to explain paradox like that of the Maxwell ’s Demon , dates from 1949 . [ 50 ]
A few years later he managed to rewrite most of the chapters of physics using information theory .
The corresponding book became worldwide known as a milestone in the development of information theory . [ 51 ]
With his involvement in information theory , Brillouin managed to fill the gap between his interests for engineering science ( he contributed for instance during the war to the development of magnetron ) and his general conceptions of physics .
In mathematics , two names are particularly significant and information theory is again at the crossing between different interests .
Benoît Mandelbrot ( born in 1924 ) , who proofread with Walter Pitts the manuscript written by Wiener for Cybernetics , made for his Ph.D. in mathematics a clear connection between game theory and information theory . [ 52 ]
He showed for instance that both thermodynamics and statistical structures of language can be explained as results of minimax games between ‘ nature ’ and ‘ emitter ’ .
He also made the connection between the definitions of information given by the British statistician Ronald A. Fisher in the 1920s , by the physicist Dennis Gabor in 1946 ( he was born in 1900 in Budapest but exiled in Great - Britain since 1934 ) and the already well - known definition proposed by Shannon .
Beyond a mathematical generalization of all these definitions , one finds also an important development of the unifying character of information theory .
This is a noteworthy aspect of another Ph.D. written by Marcel - Paul Schützenberger ( 1920 - 1996 ) and also published in 1953 . [ 53 ]
As early as 1951 , preparing this work , Schützenberger had showed that a generalized information theory could be used as well for the analysis of electrical circuits as for the determination of liminal sensibility values in drug design or for botanic taxonomy . [ 54 ]
These French contributions to information theory quickly found recognition in the United States more than in their own country .
From 1952 to 1954 Mandelbrot was for instance at M.I.T. and then at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Princeton and it is emblematic that when a new journal is founded on information theory , Information and Control , in 1958 , Brillouin is one the three editors ( with the British Colin Cherry and the American Peter Elias ) and among the scientists of editorial board , one finds L. Couffignal and B. Mandelbrot , next to Shannon and Wiener . [ 55 ]
E. A French consensus regarding the place of cybernetics After Stalin ’s death in May 1953 , the general strike that took place in France in August and the election of René Coty in December , a period of normalization set in .
This was profoundly marked for the cybernetics field by the popularization of Wiener ’s theory with a European reappropriation and the beginning , even in the 1950s of the institutionalization of cybernetics research .
A few journalists decided to write books recasting the work of Wiener and all the American scientists who had participated in the birth of cybernetics in a wider ( French ! ) tradition beginning with Ampère and including for instance , the work of Lafitte presented in his Thoughts on the Science of Machines , published in 1932 . [ 56 ]
The main books assuring a large audience for cybernetics were written by the journalists Pierre de Latil , Albert Ducrocq in France and also by the mathematician Vitold Belevitch in Belgium . [ 57 ]
With this new rebuilt history of cybernetics , the aim was to present an alternative to the Anglo - Saxon empiricism which gave significant importance to simulations .
For the French , a few realizations are indeed shown as example , but the “ as if ” does n’t become an “ is ” like in the American case .
Presenting the latest work on machine languages , Belevitch showed the underestimated difficulties related to the understanding of language .
General enthusiasm had given place to moderate assessment .
At the same time , the institutionalization of cybernetics took place along a French - Belgian axis . [ 58 ]
The International Association for cybernetics was created in Namur and it is in this Belgian city that international conferences are regularly held , the first one in 1956 and the most recent in 1998 .
In France , Cybernetics helped to reshape the boundaries between mathematics , physics and engineering , making them more permeable .
After identifying ideological load of cybernetics and using it in the debates of the national context , cybernetics was regarded as a pool of new ideas to promote interdisciplinarity .
The Second International Congress on Cybernetics in Namur in September 1958 was attended by a small “ reconnaissance mission ” ( three delegates ) from the Soviet Academy of Sciences .
Upon their return , the delegates complained in their report that “ the small size of the Academy of Sciences delegation does not correspond to the scale of our country and to the tasks put before Soviet science in the field of cybernetics . ” [ 59 ]
In subsequent years , however , Soviet delegations remained small and low - profile .
In 1960 Communist Party bureaucrats rejected a proposal for the Soviet Academy Council on Cybernetics to join the International Association for Cybernetics . [ 60 ]
As in the French case , the history of Soviet cybernetics was marred by a controversy .
IV .
Cybernetics and Information Theory in the Soviet Union
The evolution of Soviet attitudes toward cybernetics and information theory in many ways paralleled the French story , but with stronger accents : the initial Soviet rejection of cybernetics was more decisive , while the later embrace of this field proved more wide - spread and profound .
In 1954 , the Short Philosophical Dictionary — a standard ideological reference — defined cybernetics as a “ reactionary pseudo - science , ” “ an ideological weapon of imperialist reaction . ” [ 61 ]
By the mid-1950s , cybernetics was portrayed as an innocent victim of political oppression and “ rehabilitated , ” along with political prisoners of the Stalinist regime .
In the early 1960s , cybernetics was canonized in a new Party Program and hailed as a “ science of communism . ”
Soviet intellectuals of the Khrushchev era put cybernetics forward as a project for radical reform , challenging the Stalinist legacy in science and society .
By the early 1970s , however , former cybernetics enthusiasts were left disillusioned , while cybernetic discourse was appropriated by the political establishment and cybernetics turned into a tool for maintaining the existing order rather than changing it . [ 62 ]
A. The Anti-Cybernetics Campaign in the USSR
The early 1950s — the time when cybernetics and information theory became known to the Soviet reader — was the wrong time to propagate in the Soviet Union ideas originated in the West .
That applied not only to political doctrines , but to scientific theories and engineering approaches as well .
In the Cold War wave of anti-American propaganda in the early 1950s , nearly a dozen sharply critical articles appeared in Soviet academic journals and popular periodicals , attacking cybernetics and information theory as products of American imperialist ideology and totally ignoring Russian traditions in these fields . [ 63 ]
Soviet critics charged that Shannon ’s theory of communication reduced the human being to a “ talking machine ” [ 64 ] and equated human speech with “ just a ‘ flow ’ of purely conditional , symbolic ‘ information , ’ which does not differ in principle from digital data fed into a calculating machine . ” [ 65 ]
Wiener ’s formula , “ information is information , not matter or energy , ” provoked a philosophical critique of the concept of information as a non-material entity . [ 66 ]
Repeating Lenin ’s criticism of some philosophical interpretations of relativity physics in the early twentieth century , Soviet authors castigated cyberneticians for replacing material processes with “ pure ” mathematical formulae and equations , in which “ matter itself disappears . ” [ 67 ]
Cybernetics was labeled a “ pseudo - science produced by science reactionaries and philosophizing ignoramuses , prisoners of idealism and metaphysics . ” [ 68 ]
The anti-cybernetics campaign turned into a relentless war on words like “ information ” and “ entropy , ” which crossed the boundaries between the animate and the inanimate .
In his Cybernetics , Wiener attempted to bring together Shannon ’s concept of entropy as a measure of uncertainty in communication and Erwin Schrödinger ’s concept of negative entropy as a source of order in living organisms .
Wiener identified information with negative entropy and aspired to create a common language for describing living organisms , self - regulating machines ( e.g. , servomechanisms and computers ) , and human society .
The critics argued that such crossing of disciplinary boundaries was illegitimate and accused cyberneticians of philosophical , ideological , and eventually political errors .
As in the French case , the Soviet critique of cybernetics served a particular political agenda ; it was inspired if not directly commissioned by the Communist Party and became part of a general wave of anti-American propaganda in the context of the Cold War . [ 69 ]
Schrödinger ’s analysis of life within the framework of the chromosome theory became a prominent target in Trofim Lysenko ’s crusade against genetics .
Lysenko , backed by high - ranking Soviet officials , attempted to discredit the use of physical methods and conceptual apparatus in biology . [ 70 ]
In his 1940 dispute with the leading Soviet specialist on probability theory Andrei Kolmogorov Lysenko argued that “ biological regularities do not resemble mathematical laws ” and equated the use of statistics in support of genetics with the submission to “ blind chance . ” [ 71 ]
Trying to protect their political and institutional domination in Soviet biology , the Lysenkoites erected a philosophical Chinese wall between biology , on the one side , and physics and mathematics , on the other .
This posed serious obstacles before information theory and cybernetics , which attempted to breach that wall .
Seeking to avoid political complications , Soviet mathematicians and engineers working in the field of control and communications kept their studies strictly technical and eschewed man-machine analogies .
In the late 1930s and early 1940s Kolmogorov developed a prediction theory of stationary processes similar to Wiener ’s , but did not make any attempt to extend its applications to the life sciences or social sciences . [ 72 ]
Kolmogorov was also among the first mathematicians to appreciate the significance of Shannon ’s “ Mathematical Theory of Communication . ” [ 73 ]
Kolmogorov and his students developed a rigorous mathematical foundation of information theory , providing precise definitions and meticulous proofs of major theorems .
The 1953 Russian translation of Shannon ’s work , unfortunately , transformed the original nearly beyond recognition ; working under Soviet ideological censorship and self - censorship , a cautious editor removed not only ideologically suspicious passages , but also Appendix 7 , which seemed too abstract for a technical paper .
As Kolmogorov later discovered with great disappointment , some of his important theoretical results had already been published by Shannon in the cut - out fragments . [ 74 ]
B. The Rehabilitation of Cybernetics and the New Era In March 1953 , with the death of Stalin , the Soviet Union entered a new era .
The political “ thaw ” brought significant changes to all spheres of Soviet life , including science and technology .
The period of forced isolation of Soviet science and technology from its Western counterpart came to an end .
The division into “ socialist ” and “ capitalist ” science no longer held ; claims were made for the universality of science across political borders .
The Soviet leadership embarked on a course of rapid assimilation of modern Western scientific and technological advances .
In March 1955 , a special governmental committee prepared a classified report , “ On the State of Radioelectronics in the USSR and Abroad and Measures Necessary for Its Further Development in the USSR . ”
This report emphasized the Soviet lag in communications engineering , control engineering , and computing and blamed it on the anti-cybernetics campaign : “ As a result of irresponsible allegations by incompetent journalists , the word “ cybernetics ” became odious and cybernetic literature was banned , even for specialists , and this has undoubtedly damaged the development of information theory , electronic calculating machines , and systems of automatic control . ” [ 75 ]
In October 1955 , the Academy of Sciences , the State Committee on New Technology , and the Ministry of Higher Education submitted to the Party Central Committee a top - secret report , “ The Most Important Tasks in the Development of Science in the Sixth Five - Year Plan , ” which , in particular , called for a significant expansion of studies in the theory of probabilities , including information theory .
“ It is imperative , ” the report stressed , “ to achieve a radical improvement in the application of probability theory and mathematical statistics to various problems of biology , technology , and economics .
The void existing here must be filled . ” [ 76 ]
As a sign of recognition of the importance of information theory for the national defense , the Soviet authorities became concerned with potential leaks of Soviet results in this field to the West .
In August 1955 , when Kolmogorov was invited to Stockholm to give a series of lectures on the theory of probabilities , the Party Central Committee allowed him to go only under the condition that he would not lecture on information theory .
The head of the Science Department of the Central Committee argued that “ certain aspects of information theory , if developed further , may become very important for secret work . ” [ 77 ]
Ironically , as soon as ideological obstacles to the development of information theory were removed , the policy of military secrecy imposed new , even more severe restrictions on this field .
In August 1955 , in a drastic reversal of the earlier philosophical critique , the journal Problems of Philosophy published the first Soviet article speaking positively about cybernetics and non-technical applications of information theory , authored by three specialists in military computing — Aleksei Liapunov , a noted mathematician and the creator of the first Soviet programming language ; Anatolii Kitov , an organizer of the first military computing centers ; and Sergei Sobolev , the deputy head of the Soviet nuclear weapons program in charge of the mathematical support .
They presented cybernetics as a general “ doctrine of information , ” of which Shannon ’s theory of communication was but one part .
“ Cybernetics , ” they wrote , “ combines common elements from diverse fields of science : the theory of communication , the theory of filters and anticipation , the theory of tracking systems , the theory of automatic regulation with feedback , the theory of electronic calculating machines , physiology , and so on .
Cybernetics treats various subjects of these sciences from a single point of view — as systems that are processing and transmitting information . ” [ 78 ]
The three authors interpreted the notion of information very broadly , defining it as “ all sorts of external data , which can be received and transmitted by a system , as well as the data that can be produced within the system . ” [ 79 ]
Under the rubric of “ information ” fell any environmental influence on living organisms , any knowledge acquired by man in the process of learning , any signals received by a control device via feedback , and any data processed by a computer .
Treating information theory as an “ exact science , ” Soviet specialists saw its mission in bringing rigor into disciplines deeply corrupted by ideological and political pressures .
Kolmogorov insisted that now , with the advent of cybernetics and information theory , “ it is impossible to use vague phrases and present them as being ‘ laws , ’ something that unfortunately people working in the humanities tend to do . ” [ 80 ]
“ The laws of existence and transformation of information are objective and accessible for study , ” wrote the electrical engineer Igor ’ Poletaev , the author of Signal , the first Soviet book on cybernetics .
“ The determination of these laws , their precise description , and the use of information - processing algorithms , especially control algorithms , together constitute the content of cybernetics . ” [ 81 ]
Soviet cybernetics transcended the domain of engineering and fashioned itself as a science , a systematic study of the laws of nature .
The “ nature ” that cybernetics studied , however , was of a special kind : it was an “ objective ” world constituted by information exchanges and control processes .
Liapunov and his colleagues soon put forward an ambitious project for the comprehensive “ cybernetization ” of Soviet science .
Lecturing in diverse scientific , engineering , and public audiences , Liapunov carried with him a huge human - size table , whose rows represented twelve methods of cybernetic analysis ( determining information exchanges , deciphering information code , determining the functions and elements of the control system , etc. ) each of which was applied to eight fields of study ( economics , computer programming , hardware design , production control , linguistics , genetics , evolutionary biology , and physiology ) , represented by columns . [ 82 ]
Biologists and linguists , physiologists and economists , computer programmers and engineers — all found a place for themselves in this grand design .
In 1956 - 57 , Liapunov and his associates delivered over one hundred lectures on cybernetics in various academic institutions .
Soviet cybernetics spread over a wide range of disciplines and became a large - scale social movement among Soviet scientists and engineers .
In April 1959 , the Academy of Sciences created the Council on Cybernetics to coordinate all Soviet cybernetic research , including mathematical and engineering aspects of information theory .
The Academy also established the Laboratory for the Systems of Information Transmission , later transformed into the Institute for the Problems of Information Transmission , which became the leading Soviet research center in communications engineering . [ 83 ]
Institutionally and conceptually , Soviet communications engineering was brought under the roof of cybernetics ; the Laboratory director Aleksandr Kharkevich became deputy chairman of the Cybernetics Council .
C. Soviet Cybernetics as a Trading Zone Soviet cybernetics served as a “ trading zone , ” in which information theory concepts could transcend the boundaries of communications engineering and spread into the life sciences and the social sciences . [ 84 ]
Bringing genetics under the cybernetic umbrella , in particular , served an important purpose : to protect Soviet geneticists from Lysenkoites ’ attacks .
“ A ‘unit of hereditary information ’ sounded less anti-Lysenkoist than a ‘ gene , ’ ” recalled geneticist Raisa Berg . [ 85 ]
Soviet genetics found an institutional niche among the communication sciences , the domain of mathematicians and engineers , where the Lysenkoites could not reach .
Mathematicians Liapunov and Sobolev declared : “ A living organism develops out of certain embryonic cells in which somewhere lies information received from the parental organisms .
This is not physics ; this is not physiology ; this is the science of the transmission of information . ” [ 86 ]
They argued that since Lysenko could not prove the flow of hereditary information from an organism as a whole to its embryonic cells , his claim of the inheritance of acquired traits must be false .
On the other hand , they asserted the validity of classical genetics on the basis of its “ full agreement with the ideas advanced in cybernetics . ” [ 87 ]
The prominent evolutionary biologist Ivan Shmal ’ gausen , one of the main targets of Lysenko ’s 1948 speech , defended his theory of stabilizing selection by “ translating Darwin ’s theory into the language of cybernetics . ” [ 88 ]
The Council on Cybernetics provided support for persecuted biologists ; the series Problems of Cybernetics , edited by Liapunov , regularly published articles on genetics , which could not appear in the biological journals , controlled by the Lysenkoites .
In the field of linguistics , a crucial mediating role was played by the prominent Russian émigré linguist Roman Jakobson , who since 1949 taught at Harvard University .
Jakobson was fascinated by Shannon ’s work and applied Shannon ’s method of calculating the entropy of printed English in his analysis of spoken Russian . [ 89 ]
Jakobson saw a deep similarity between Shannon ’s choice of binary digits ( bits ) as minimal units of information and his own earlier idea of using binary oppositions as the structural basis for organizing phonemic distinctive features into a phonological system .
In Jakobson ’s view , Shannon ’s theory helped generalize Jakobson ’s insight about the underlying binary structure of spoken language to human communication in general . [ 90 ]
In 1957 , Jakobson became an Institute Professor at MIT , where he helped establish the Center for Communications Sciences ; in 1958 he joined the editorial board of the journal Information and Control .
Starting from the mid-1950s , Jakobson regularly visited the Soviet Union and actively propagated the innovations brought into linguistics by information theory .
D. Models of Communication as Exchange of Information
The model of human communication as information exchange became very popular among young linguists who challenged traditional Soviet linguistics , which relied on intuitive concepts and ideological declarations .
Ironically , they elaborated a new concept of meaning based on Shannon ’s notion of information , even though Shannon himself had intentionally excluded any consideration of meaning from his communication theory .
Linguists Igor ’ Mel’chuk and Alexander Zholkovsky developed a formal model of natural language , in which they turned Shannon ’s definition of information as “ that which is invariant under all reversible encoding or translating operations ” [ 91 ] into a definition of meaning as “ what is common in all texts that are intuitively perceived as equivalent to the original text . ” [ 92 ]
In a Soviet context , Shannon ’s model of communication crossed the boundaries between engineering and science to serve as a basis for an alternative to the dominant linguistic discourse .
Searching for rigorous laws in linguistics , Kolmogorov and his students conducted a series of experiments on measuring the entropy of printed texts , using a modified version of Shannon ’s letter - guessing method . [ 93 ]
Kolmogorov was particularly pleased to remark ( in private ) that from the viewpoint of information theory ( Soviet ) newspapers were less informative than poetry since political discourse employed a large number of stock phrases and was highly predictable in its content . [ 94 ]
On the other hand , brilliant poetry , despite the strict limitations imposed by the poetic form , carried more information , for original poetic expressions were much more difficult to guess .
Kolmogorov ’s poetic studies had a surprising outcome , leading to the elaboration of an original mathematical theory of complexity related to the concepts of information and entropy .
While Shannon interpreted entropy as a measure of uncertainty , and Wiener as a measure of disorder , Kolmogorov viewed it as a measure of complexity .
Kolmogorov put forward an algorithmic approach to the definition of information as an alternative to Shannon ’s probabilistic approach .
In his view , the main problem with the probabilistic approach was that it precluded the possibility of calculating the amount of information in the case of a unique message , e.g. , Tolstoy ’s novel War and Peace .
“ Is it possible to include this novel in a reasonable way into the set of ‘ all possible novels , ’ ” Kolmogorov asked sarcastically , “ and further to postulate the existence of a certain probability distribution in this set ? ” [ 95 ]
He proposed to measure the amount of information in an individual object with relation to another individual object , based on the notion of “ relative complexity , ” or entropy , of those objects .
He defined the relative complexity of an object ( depending on the “ method of programming ” ) as the minimal length of a “ program ” that can produce that object . [ 96 ]
“ If some object has a ‘ simple ’ structure , ” he explained , “ then for its description it suffices to have a small amount of information ; but if it is ‘ complex , ’ then its description must contain a lot of information . ” [ 97 ]
Kolmogorov argued that , within his algorithmic approach , the complexity of the novel War and Peace could be “ uniquely determined , ” given certain a priori information about the language , style , and content of the text . [ 98 ]
His reformulation of both information theory and probability theory in term of complexity was perceived in the mathematics community as “ almost a cultural revolution , turning both subjects inside out , and reversing the order in which they are normally considered . ” [ 99 ]
Paradoxically , cybernetics , which was supposed to bring formal rigor and exact reasoning to all disciplines , was itself conspicuously lacking a formal definition .
Soviet cyberneticians often had very different notions about the content and boundaries of cybernetics .
In his 1958 article in The Great Soviet Encyclopedia , Kolmogorov defined cybernetics as a discipline studying “ the methods of receiving , storing , processing , and using information in machines , living organisms , and their associations . ” [ 100 ]
In the same volume , Kolmogorov also published an entry on information , which he introduced as the “ main concept of cybernetics . ” [ 101 ]
Mathematician Andrei Markov , Jr. , ridiculed Kolmogorov ’s definitions , arguing that they produced a vicious circle .
Kolmogorov responded by defining information as an “ operator which changes the distribution of probabilities in a given set of events . ”
Markov dismissed that definition too , mockingly describing how “ a given computer would receive a given operator , which changes the distribution of its probabilities , and store this operator on its magnetic drum . ” [ 102 ]
In cybernetic discourse , the word “ information ” had two very different meanings : in information theory , the “ amount of information ” characterized the uncertainty removed by the “ information source ” ; in computing , on the other hand , the term “ information ” stood informally for any kind of data processed by a computer .
The mechanical unification of information theory and computing in the Soviet Union under the rubric of cybernetics mixed the two uses of the term “ information ” together and produced the confusion pointed out by Markov .
The insurmountable difficulty of forging a common language for all members of the diverse cybernetic community to a large extent undermined the entire project for the “ cybernetization ” of science .
Soviet cybernetics , which at first had emerged as an alternative to official philosophy and a movement for radical reform , eventually lost its rebellious spirit and turned into a pliable philosophical doctrine of the “ dialectical rotation of information and noise . ” [ 103 ] V. Conclusion
The main difference between Soviet cybernetics and its American and French counterparts is not to be found in the range of cybernetic applications or the types of mathematical models used .
In this sense , there was a great similarity across the borders , due to the systematic Soviet efforts to appropriate the latest American and Western European techniques and technologies .
The main difference lies in the political and cultural meanings attached to cybernetic ideas .
The history of cybernetics and information theory is one of crossing cultural , political , and disciplinary boundaries .
Wiener abstracted a general scientific theory out of technical culture , and his theory was broadly interpreted by American political scientists , anthropologists , economists , and social scientists .
Through Wiener 's supple hands , what started out as an applied method of military computing transformed into a vision of the new bio -machine age .
In the West , cybernetics contributed to the already strong contemporary traditions of mathematical reasoning in biology , physiology , linguistics , and economics by expanding the arsenal of mathematical and engineering tools used in those disciplines for modeling and implementation of control and communication mechanisms .
In the United States , Wiener 's formulation of cybernetics as civilian science of technology and society helped to legitimize ideas originally developed and continually applied to warlike purposes .
Ironically , that vision 's military roots , and many of its Cold War military applications , were at odds with Wiener ’s personal pacifist stand .
Crossing international borders placed cybernetics and information theory in completely different cultural contexts , in which the question of national origins of scientific ideas suddenly acquired great political significance .
The Soviet ideological campaigns against Western influences condemned of information theory and cybernetics as reactionary and idealistic .
The Soviet position had great impact on French Communists and the subsequent controversy over the these theories in France .
In both France and the Soviet Union , cybernetics and information theory could be adopted only after their “ domestication , ” i.e. adaptation to the specific cultural situations in the two countries .
In France , reactions of many scientists towards cybernetics were , from the beginning , marked by a kind of diffuse nationalism .
The French attempted to appropriate cybernetics as their own by claiming Ampère ’s priority .
Even if Wiener 's work had to be mentioned , it was only to add immediately that the book was published in Paris and that Ampère had used the word ' cybernétique ' as early as the 19th century .
The communist party supported this campaign until it reversed its position following changes coming from Moscow .
From the mid 1950s onwards , cybernetics was used to promote interdisciplinary fields in which some engineers found public recognition .
Once cybernetics was sufficiently reinterpreted , France and the Soviet Union also deployed its ideas differently .
In France , from the mid 1950s onwards , cybernetics was used to promote interdisciplinary fields in which engineers as a group found public recognition .
Soviet cybernetics , on the other hand , emerged during the post - Stalin era as a cross- disciplinary project and a social movement with a distinct political mission — to reform Soviet science , both politically and intellectually — after the years of Stalinism .
Western scientists viewed cybernetics as a useful method for solving a wide range of theoretical and practical problems .
For Soviet scientists , cybernetics served a higher goal — breaking administrative and disciplinary barriers and liberating Soviet science from ideological and political pressures ; they spoke the cybernetic language as a language of objectivity and truth .
Different national versions of cybernetics and information theory did not differ much in the range of cybernetic applications or the types of mathematical models used , considering the active exchange of latest techniques and technologies among the industrialized countries .
The main difference lay in the political and cultural meanings attached to cybernetic ideas .
Crossing boundaries often provoked attempts to separate the content of information theory and cybernetics from their initial ideological assumptions .
Each time a significant cultural / political / disciplinary boundary is crossed , old ideological connotations are questioned and new ones attached .
Trying to avoid political complications , Soviet scientists in the early 1950s tried hard to present the two new sciences as politically neutral , value - free technical tools for solving problems .
Having failed to de-ideologize cybernetics and information theory , however , they instead re-ideologized these two sciences — but with different ideology .
A cross-cultural analysis illuminates both the ideological malleability of cybernetics and information theory and the role of cultural context in shaping the fate of these ideas
20th Birthday of the Exxon Valdez Lie
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
" Gail , Please !
Stick your hand in it ! "
The petite Eskimo - Chugach woman gave me that you - dumb - ass - white - boy look .
" Gail , Gail .
STICK YOUR DAMN HAND IN IT ! "
She stuck it in , under the gravel of the beach at Sleepy Bay , her village 's fishing ground .
Gail 's hand came up dripping with black , sickening goo .
It could make you vomit .
Oil from the Exxon Valdez .
It was already two years after the spill and Exxon had crowed that Mother Nature had happily cleaned up their stinking oil mess for them .
It was a lie .
But the media would n't question the bald - faced bullshit .
And who the hell was going to investigate Exxon 's claim way out in some godforsaken Native village in the Prince William Sound ?
So I convinced the Natives to fly the lazy - ass reporters out to Sleepy Bay on rented float planes to see the oil that Exxon said was n't there .
The reporters looked , but did n't see it , because it was three inches under their feet , under the shingle rock of the icy beach .
Gail pulled out her hand and now the whole place smelled like a gas station .
The network crews wanted to puke .
And now , with their eyes open , they saw the oil , the vile feces - colored smear across the glaciated ridge faces , the poisonous " bathtub ring " that ran for miles and miles at the high tide level .
And it 's still there .
Less for sure .
But twenty years later , IT'S STILL THERE , GODDAMMIT .
And I want YOU , dear reader , to stick your hand in it .
I want YOU , President Obama , to stick your hand in it before you blithely fulfill your Palin - esque campaign promise for a little more offshore drilling .
***
Tuesday marks the 20th Anniversary of the Exxon Valdez grounding and the smearing of 1,200 miles of Alaska 's coastline with its oil .
James Macalpine
It also marks the 20th Anniversary of a lie .
Lots of lies : catalogued in a four - volume investigation of the disaster ; four volumes you 'll never see .
I wrote that report , with my team of investigators working with the Natives preparing fraud and racketeering charges against Exxon .
You 'll never see the report because Exxon lawyers threatened the Natives , " Mention the f- word [ fraud ] and you 'll never get a dime " of compensation to clean up the villages .
The Natives agreed to drop the fraud charge -- and Exxon stiffed them on the money .
You 're surprised , right ?
***
Doubtless , for the 20th Anniversary of the Great Spill , the media will schlep out that old story that the tanker ran aground because its captain was drunk at the wheel .
Bullshit .
Yes , the captain was " three sheets to the wind " -- but sleeping it off below - decks .
The ship was in the hands of the third mate who was driving blind .
That is , the Exxon Valdez ' Raycas radar system was turned off ; turned off because it was busted and had been busted since its maiden voyage .
Exxon did n't want to spend the cash to fix it .
So the man at the helm , electronically blindfolded , drove it up onto the reef .
So why the story of the drunken skipper ?
Because it lets
Exxon off the hook : Calling it a case of " drunk driving " turns the disaster into a case of human error , not corporate penny - pinching
Indeed , the " human error " tale was the hook used by the Bush - stacked Supreme Court to slash the punitive damages awarded against Exxon by 90 % , from $ 5 billion , to half a billion for 30,000 Natives and fishermen .
Chief Justice John Roberts erased almost all of the payment due with the la- dee - dah comment , " What more can a corporation do ? "
Well , here 's what they could have done : Besides fix the radar , Exxon could have set out equipment to contain the spill .
Containing a spill is actually quite simple .
Stick a rubber skirt around the oil slick and suck it back up .
The law requires it and Exxon promised it .
So , when the tanker hit , where was the rubber skirt and where was the sucker ?
Answer :
The rubber skirt , called " boom " -- was a fiction .
Exxon promised to have it sitting right there near the Native village at Bligh Reef .
The oil company fulfilled that promised the cheap way : they lied .
And the lie was engineered at the very top .
After the spill , we got our hands on a series of memos describing a secret meeting of chief executives of Exxon and its oil company partners , including ARCO , a unit of British Petroleum .
In a meeting of these oil chieftains held in April 1988 , ten months before the spill , Exxon rejected a plea from T.L. Polasek , the Vice - President of its Alaska shipping operations , to provide the oil spill containment equipment required by law .
Polasek warned the CEOs it was " not possible " to contain a spill in the mid-Sound without the emergency set -up .
Exxon angrily vetoed ARCO 's suggestion that the oil companies supply the rubber skirts and other materiel that would have prevented the spill from spreading , virtually eliminating the spill 's damage .
Regulations state that no tanker may leave the Alaska port of Valdez without the " sucker " equipment , called a " containment barge , " at the ready .
Exxon signed off on the barge 's readiness .
But , that night twenty years ago , the barge was in dry - dock with its pumps locked up under arctic ice .
By the time it arrived at the tanker , half a day after the spill , the oil was well along its thousand - mile killing path .
Natives watched as the now - unstoppable oil overwhelmed their islands .
Eyak Native elder Henry Makarka saw an otter rip out its own eyes burning from oil residue .
Henry , pointing down a waterside dead - zone , told me , in a mix of Alutiiq and English , " If I had a machine gun , I 'd shoot every one of those white sons - of - bitches . "
***
Exxon promised -- promised -- to pay the Natives and other fisherman for all their losses .
The Chief of the Natives at Nanwalek lost his boat to bankruptcy .
His village , like other villages , Native and non-Native , decayed into alcoholism .
The Mayor of fishing port Cordova killed himself , citing Exxon in his suicide note .
On the island village of Chenega , Gail Evanoff 's uncle Paul Kompkoff was hungry .
Until the spill , he had lived on seal meat , razor clams and salmon Chenegans would catch , and on deer they hunted .
The clams and salmon were declared deadly and the deer , not able to read the government warning signs , ate the poisoned vegetation and died .
The President of Exxon , Lee Raymond , helicoptered into Chenega for a photo op .
He promised to compensate the Natives and all fishermen for their losses , and Exxon would thoroughly clean the beaches .
Uncle Paul told the Exxon chief of his hunger .
The oil company , sensing PR disaster , shipped in seal meat to the isolated village .
The cans were marked , " NOT FIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION . "
Uncle Paul said , " Zoo food . "
Paul did n't want a seal in a can .
He wanted a boat to go fishing , to bring the village back to life .
Two years after the spill , Otto Harrison , General Manager of Exxon USA , told Evanoff and me to forget about a fishing boat for Uncle Paul .
Exxon was immortal and Natives were not .
The company would litigate for 20 years .
They did .
Only now , two decades on , Exxon has finally begun its payout of the court award -- but only ten cents on the dollar .
And Uncle Paul 's boat ?
No matter .
Paul 's dead .
So are a third of the fishermen owed the money .
***
Lee Raymond , President of Exxon at the time of the spill -- and its President when the company made the secret decision to do without oil spill equipment , retired in April 2006 .
The company awarded him a $ 400 million retirement bonus , more than double the bonuses received by all AIG executives combined .
***
Gail 's oily hand never made it to national television .
The networks were distracted with another oil story .
After sailing back to Chenega from Sleepy Bay , I sat with Uncle Paul , watching the smart bombs explode over Baghdad .
Gulf War I had begun .
Uncle Paul was silent a long time .
The generals on CNN pointed to the burning oil fields near Basra .
Paul said , " I guess were all some kind of Native now . "

On Thursday morning , the company ’s chief financial officer , Keith Sherin , appeared on CNBC , which G.E. conveniently owns , and offered a passionate defense of the company .
“ We have an incredibly strong liquidity position , ” Mr. Sherin said .
“ We have $ 45 billion in cash , ” he added .
“ We have no triggers that we can see that would have any call on our cash in the short term . ”
Later that afternoon , I had my own conversation with Mr. Sherin .
“ We do n’t need more capital , ” he insisted .
“ On a tangible common equity basis , we are fine .
Our tangible common equity for GE Capital is higher than any of the big banks . ”
He added : “ We are trying to rebuild credibility and also trying to be clear and open and honest . ”
By the end of Thursday , the stock closed at $ 6.66 ; by Friday , it stood at $ 7.06 .
For the moment at least , the pressure had eased .
Still , you could n’t help thinking that we ’d seen this movie before .
Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers , A.I.G. , Merrill Lynch , Citi , Morgan Stanley  they ’d all come under the same kind of intense pressure , seemingly out of the blue , hammering the stock and blowing out the credit - default swaps while rumors swirled of imminent catastrophe .
“ It ’s like a moving plague that hits different targets and has now landed on G.E. , ” said Michael Lewitt , president of Harch Capital Management .
In every case the top brass went on the air to insist that all was well  just as G.E. did this week .
Only Morgan Stanley was able to fend off disaster .
I called my friend Jerry Useem , who used to cover G.E. for Fortune magazine .
Like me  like just about everyone this week  he was stunned by this week ’s developments .
“ The last time G.E. cut its dividend was during the Great Depression , ” he pointed out .
He was quiet for a minute .
Then he added , “ If G.E. is in trouble , God help us all . ”

I ’m going to stick my neck out and say that when this crisis ends , General Electric will still be a huge industrial conglomerate that operates all over the globe and makes plenty of money .
It ’s not going to vanish like Lehman Brothers or be permanently crippled like Citi .
But its finance unit will almost surely be much smaller and G.E. will be less dependent on it to achieve its profit goals .
And G.E. will not be an AAA company anymore .
In other words , G.E. will be a humbled  and humbler  company .
Which will be a good thing .
Admittedly , I lack the forensic accounting skills of its fiercest critics , who believe , just for starters , that GE Capital ’s losses are tens of billions of dollars more than the company has admitted .
( G.E. says it has $ 4 billion in “ embedded losses ” ; Mr. Heymann and Mr. Kelley of Sterne
Agee think the number is more likely to be $ 21 billion to $ 54 billion . )
But most of the traders who are now betting against G.E. are n’t forensic accountants either .
G.E. has put itself in this position by allowing confidence to erode in the company  primarily through its own actions .

" Will you be celebrating Jim Jones and David Koresh 's birthday ? " gadfly Arnold Sacks dramatically said during public comment before the City Council voted to approve around $ 40,000 in fee waivers — meaning the city absorbs the costs of paying overtime for workers to shut streets down — for special events around the city , including $ 3,000 for a L. Ron Hubbard Birthday Event taking place Saturday at the Shrine Auditorium .
Activist and pain - in - the - council 's - neck Zuma Dogg hypothetically questioned what the public would want to do with a $ 5,000 gift to the city .
Would you rather have " homeless services on skid row , give it to the underprivileged kids of LAUSD programs , how about keeping the parks an libraries open that we 're thinking of cutting , " he asked .
" With all due respect , you got people like John Travolta and Tom Cruise that are part of this organization , how about if they can chip in and pick up the tab ? "
The motion was passed unanimously , although Councilmembers Eric Garcetti , Tom LaBonge , Ed Reyes and Bill Rosendahl were absent from the meeting .
" This annual celebration recognizes the achievements of Mr. Hubbard , Founder of the Scientology religion , and honors Churches of Scientology internationally , " wrote Councilmember Bernard Parks in the motion ( .pdf ) .
" The event is attended by over 7,000 local Scientologists , their families and friends , as well as by representatives of other religions and professions . "
WASHINGTON  January could be the Army 's worst month for suicides since record - keeping started in 1980 .
The service announced Thursday that 24 soldiers may have killed themselves last month .
Seven suicides have been confirmed , the Army said , and 17 are suspected .
If all are confirmed , it means that more than twice as many soldiers died by their own hand last month than were killed in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Ten soldiers died in combat last month .
The suicides included a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point , the second suicide at the school since December .
There were also two attempted suicides reported at West Point in January .
The announcement comes a week after the Army reported a 25 % increase in suicides last year over 2007 .
With 128 confirmed cases last year and an additional 15 suspected suicides , 2008 set another record :
It was the fourth consecutive year of increases in soldier suicides .
Army leaders reacted with alarm to the January figures .
" The trend and trajectory seen in January further heightens the seriousness and urgency that all of us must have in preventing suicides , " said Gen. Peter Chiarelli , the vice chief of staff of the Army .
Last week , he was put in charge of efforts to curtail the deaths .
The Army announced last week that all soldiers will be trained in coming weeks about how to recognize suicidal behavior and intervene .
The Army is also pleading for more mental health specialists .
Officials said they did not know what caused the apparent rise in suicides .
" We have not identified any particular problem , " said Lt. Col .
Mike Moose , an Army spokesman .
" We lost more soldiers to suicide than to al - Qaeda , " said Paul Rieckhoff , executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America .
" If we lost this many soldiers to an enemy weapon … we would demand defensive measures .
The DoD ( Department of Defense ) and VA ( Department of Veterans Affairs ) must take bold and immediate action . "
The veterans group and other organizations have urged the military to require servicemembers to undergo face - to - face screening with mental health specialists .
However , the Pentagon has an ongoing shortage of mental - health caregivers .

GAZA ( Reuters ) - Israeli warplanes pounded the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip on Saturday , killing at least 229 people in one of the bloodiest days for the Palestinians in 60 years of conflict with the Jewish state .
Hamas vowed revenge including suicide bomb attacks in the “ cafes and streets ” of Israel , as Israeli air strikes continued late into the night .
Israel said the offensive would continue as long as necessary and that it may also involve land forces .
Israel said the strikes were in response to almost daily “ intolerable ” rocket and mortar fire by Gaza militants , which intensified after Hamas ended a six - month ceasefire a week ago .
The rockets caused few injuries , but Israeli leaders were under pressure to stop these attacks ahead of a February 10 election which opinion polls show the right - wing opposition Likud party may win .
On Saturday , one Israeli man was killed by a rocket fired after the Israeli strikes began .
“ There is a time for calm and a time for fighting , and now the time has come to fight , ” Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said in a televised statement .
He later ruled out any new truce with Hamas .
Outgoing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert warned that “ it may take time , and each and every one of us must be patient so we can complete the mission . ”
Israel Radio said Israeli infantry and armored forces had been reinforced along the border with Gaza after the attacks .
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said “ Palestine has never seen an uglier massacre ” and in Damascus , Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal called for a new Palestinian peoples ’ uprising against Israel .
“ We will not leave our land , we will not raise white flags and we will not kneel except before God , ” Haniyeh said .
Black smoke billowed over Gaza City , where the dead and wounded lay on the ground after Israel bombed more than 40 security compounds , including two where Hamas was hosting graduation ceremonies for new recruits .
MORE THAN 700 WOUNDED
At the main Gaza City graduation ceremony , uniformed bodies lay in a pile and the wounded writhed in pain .
Some rescue workers beat their heads and shouted “ God is greatest . ”
One badly wounded man quietly recited verses from the Koran .
More than 700 Palestinians were wounded in all , medics said .
Israel said the operation , dubbed “ Solid Lead , ” targeted “ terrorist infrastructure ” following days of rocket attacks on southern Israel that caused damage but few injuries .
Israeli army officials said Hamas leaders could be targeted .
A series of air strikes were launched after darkness fell .
Israel telephoned some Palestinians to warn them their homes were targeted and they should leave to avoid being killed .
In at least one instance a home was bombed after the occupants left .
Two Palestinians were killed when a mosque was bombed in Gaza City , Hamas officials and medics said .
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , a leading candidate to become Israel ’s next prime minister , called for international support against “ an extremist Islamist organization ... that is being supported by Iran , ” Israel ’s arch - foe .

Israel instructed hundreds of thousands of Israelis living up to 30 km ( 19 miles ) from the Gaza border to remain in “ safe areas ” indoors in case of retaliatory rocket fire .
Backing Israel , the administration of President George W. Bush , in its final weeks in office , put the onus on Hamas to prevent a further escalation .
“ The United States ... holds Hamas responsible for breaking the ceasefire and for the renewal of violence in Gaza , ” Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a statement .
“ The ceasefire should be restored immediately . ”
The United Nations and the European Union , in contrast , simply called for an immediate halt to all violence .

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the Israeli air campaign was “ criminal ” and urged world powers to intervene .
Egypt said it would keep trying to restore the truce .
UPRISING CALL
Saturday ’s death toll was the highest for a single day in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict since 1948 , when the Jewish state was established .
“ I call upon you to carry out a third intifada ( uprising ) , ” Hamas leader Meshaal said on Al - Jazeera television .
The first Palestinian intifada began in 1987 and the second in 2000 after peace talks failed .
Hamas estimated that at least 100 members of its security forces had been killed , including police chief Tawfiq Jabber and the head of Hamas ’s security and protection unit , along with at least 15 women and some children .
The Islamist group , which won a 2006 parliamentary election but was shunned by Western powers over its refusal to renounce violence and recognize Israel , said all of its security compounds in the Gaza Strip were destroyed or seriously damaged .
Aid groups said they feared the Israeli operation could fuel a humanitarian crisis in the impoverished coastal enclave , home to 1.5 million Palestinians , half of them dependent on food aid .
Gaza hospitals said they were running out of medical supplies because of the Israeli - led blockade .
Israel said it would let 10 trucks into Gaza with vital medical supplies and flour on Sunday , a Palestinian official said .
Israeli analyst Ron Ben - Yishai said the strike was “ shock treatment ... aimed at securing a long - term ceasefire between Hamas and Israel on terms that are favorable to Israel . ”
Or , Can a Girl Get a Thank - You Note , Please ?
Back on November 24 , 2008 , I cashed in a bunch of credit card miles through Capital One ’s No Hassle Giving Site , converting them into cash gifts to charities .
Capital One partnered with Network for Good to deliver the donations to the charities .
I specifically selected 12 national charities that I had not previously contributed to , but whose missions I support , in order to see what the communications response would be to my $ 25 gift .
On the form , I opted - in to share my contact information with the charities and provided both email and mailing addresses .
I called it the “ What I Got When I Gave ” experiment .
I ’ve been waiting all this time to report back on the experiment in hopes that the results would change , but they have n’t .
It ’s pitiful .
Of the 12 national charities I gave to , only four — a measly 33 % — acknowledged the gift in any way .
( I also gave to three regional charities where I live and the percentage was the same – only 1 of the 3 acknowledged the gift . )
The fastest response came from National Public Radio , which sent me an email thank - you note addressed to “ Dear Friend ” on December 10 .
Personalization would have been nice , but at least they get the Gold Star for timeliness .
I have n’t received any other communication from NPR since .
The next three all came within a day of each other , on January 6 - 7 , 2009 .
Both Interplast and The Alliance for Climate Protection sent paper thank - you letters , addressed to me personally .
The Alliance mentioned receiving the gift through Network for Good on December 15 , which would have been Network for Good ’s next payment distribution day after my gift .
Given the holidays , I have no problem with the date I received the letter .
It was a standard form thank - you letter – nothing stand - out about it , but adequate .
Interplast ’s thank - you letter was great .
I ’m a big fan of their blog because of their effective storytelling , and the thank - you letter does the same thing .
Instead of a bunch of generic successes ( which are better than none at all , I guess ) , they tell me a story and include before and after pictures !
I ’m constantly telling people to include pictures in thank you notes ( see here and here ) , so I ’m glad to see a nonprofit doing it well .
Way to go , Interplast !
I have n’t received any additional communication from either Interplast or the Alliance for Climate Protection since the thank - you letters .
St. Jude ’s Children ’s Research Hospital did n’t send a thank - you note , but they did add me to their Hopeline email newsletter list and I ’ve received the January and February 2009 editions .
I ’m obviously really disappointed in not hearing a peep from the other eight .
But , ever the supporter of nonprofits , I have come up with several potential reasons ( uh , excuses ) why this may be the case :
$ 25 is chump change to them and does n’t merit acknowledgment .
I know there is significant debate out there about what you do with low - dollar donors .
I hoped that $ 25 was high enough to generate some kind of response , but apparently not .
Since I cashed in miles , they do n’t think it ’s a “ real ” gift ( even though Network for Good sent them real money ) .
It was the holidays and the gift fell through the cracks .
Giving through Network for Good is not their preferred means of receiving online gifts — they ’d prefer to get them through their own website — so they are not set up to acknowledge gifts like mine .
The post office and / or Gmail ’s spam filter ate their thank - you notes .
Do any of these hold water with you ?
You may also be wondering what I was really expecting .
I think each charity should have acknowledged the gift either via email or in print .
Either one or both is acceptable , given that it was an online gift .
Since I supplied my email address , I would have been fine being added to an e-newsletter list .
Or , they could have strongly encouraged me to join a list in the thank - you note ( or subscribe to a blog ) , with very explicit instructions for how to do that and a motivating description for why I would want to .
So , none of the four who responded knocked it out of the park for me , but they all get kudos for responding at all .
Right about now , you are probably dying to know who the other 8 organizations are .
I ’m really torn about naming names , because as I said at the top , I really do believe in the missions of every single one of them and I would hate for their inclusion in this post to tarnish them in any way .
So I ’m not printing them here , at least not right now .
But I definitely thought about it . . .
C’mon , people , ca n’t a girl get a thank you note ?!?
What do you think ?
Do these results surprise you or not ?
Are any of the rationales for no response legitimate ?
What would your group have done with a $ 25 donation from out of nowhere ?
Please leave a comment and let ’s talk about it !

Here is my follow - up post : Saying Thanks Even When
It ’s Inconvenient or Time - Consuming

The fortunes of a newspaper published out of a second - floor Chinatown Plaza office may give us insight into differing attitudes about money and ways of surviving tough economic times .
In a time when a 162 - year - old national news chain such as the Tribune Co. file for bankruptcy protection , the Las Vegas Chinese Daily News is actually growing , fueled by an increase in advertising .
The paper has gone from 16 to as many as 36 pages since printing its first copy five years ago .
Publisher Helen Hsueh said the paper ’s success is due in part to the fact that many Chinese business owners consider times of economic stress a time to spend money on advertising .
Hsueh said advertising outlook is one of several that separate Chinese and U.S. cultures when it comes to doing business .
Together , these attributes may make it easier for the estimated 20,000 valley residents of Chinese heritage to survive the highest unemployment rates in a generation , not to mention the nation ’s worst foreclosure rates .
Chinese attitudes about money include the notion of saving profits and growing slowly , instead of leveraging long lines of credit and expanding rapidly , several business owners said .
Then there ’s the idea of developing loyalty between employees and employers .
And of controlling consumption , or frugality , both at work and at home .
Though these qualities may be found in people everywhere , there are definitely differences between the cultures , said Robbie Blinkoff , a Baltimore - based anthropologist who has studied Chinese consumer habits .
“ The Chinese rely more on what is known as a relational economy , compared to Americans , who function more in a ‘ me economy . ’
The Chinese system is based more on , ‘ I do something for you , you do something for me , ’ with everyone being on the same level , whereas our system is more hierarchical , with more differences based on power . ”
So the traditional Chinese outlook — which , of course , can vary among Chinese - Americans depending on how long they have lived in the United States — leads people to avoid credit , for example , because “ credit is a risk , and it puts people around you at risk , ” Blinkoff said .
Similarly , “ you live within your means and take care of the people around you , ” he added .
These are “ underlying cultural attitudes , ” said Alan Chen , president of the local Chinese American Chamber of Commerce and does public relations for the Chinatown Plaza Corp. , the commercial center that started what is known as Las Vegas ’ Chinatown in 1997 .
These days , Chinatown Plaza has no vacancies , even as other strip malls around the valley empty out .
The most recent valleywide commercial vacancy rates are twice as high as a year ago , with the highest reaching 15 percent .
Chen uses the tortoise and hare parable to illustrate the gap in viewpoints between the cultures .
“ When we ’re doing well in business , we may feel we do n’t need to advertise , we can trust the momentum .
And we think , let ’s just collect .
Let ’s save .
Whereas American businesses think , expand , expand ! ”
This can be seen in personal finances as well , Chen said .
According to a 2006
Fortune magazine article on the subject , people in China save about 30 percent of household income , while people in the United States save nothing after taxes .
Sitting at her backroom desk in a small office next door to Chen ’s , Hsueh says : “ This is because we think , when you ’re in the sunshine , you have to prepare for the rain . ”
Albert Cheng , executive director of the 43 - year - old nonprofit organization , the Chinese Culture Center of San Francisco , said this millenary attitude comes from having to survive so many political and natural ups and downs .
“ Even in the villages , you can see people saving rice in case something happens to the crops , ” he said .
Hsueh notes that advertising has also increased from what she calls “ Caucasian ” businesses because “ they know that Chinese people still have cash , ” even in a recession .
She gets visits all day from her advertisers among the 42 businesses in the plaza .
One of them , Frank Hu , owner since last February of the Emperor ’s Garden restaurant , said he recently began advertising in the paper because “ otherwise , how are you going to get out of bad times ? ”
Hu also noted that even bad times do n’t change his relationship with his employees , which he considers more like family .
“ In the traditional Chinese culture , we have loyalty to our employees .
If I make money , they make money , ” he said .
And even with sales down , he still recently engaged in the Chinese New Year ’s custom of giving money to his employees in little red envelopes .
Similarly ,
Hu noted that most owners and managers do all they can to avoid layoffs in tough times .
Hu said recent sales declines have led them to cut back employee hours .
But no jobs have been lost .
Benjamin Chen , manager of 99 Ranch Market , the plaza ’s supermarket , said sales have dropped about 10 percent in the past year , but he has cut only employees ’ overtime hours .
Cheng , of the Chinese Culture Center , voluntarily took the step that only recently has become fashionable among Wall Street CEOs — cutting his salary .
He reduced it 35 percent .
He said he also had to reduce salaries of his staff — but he held that decrease to 20 percent .
Cheng , who has lived in the United States most of his 60 years , thinks Americans might need to learn some new habits to avoid sinking deeper into recession .
“ We need to rethink our way of spending money , ” he said .
“ It ’s like it grows on trees — but , trees do n’t grow without pruning . ”
Might there be other lessons in traditional Chinese values ?
“ It would be good to look not just at the Chinese culture , but other old cultures , to see how they ’ve survived so long , ” Cheng said .
Once the commercial hub of the southern West Bank , Hebron city center became the site of several settlements that Israel established in the midst of the local Palestinian population .
For years , the Palestinians living in that area have been subjected to extreme restrictions imposed by the military .
As a result , huge numbers of residents moved out and hundreds of businesses were shut down , leaving the area in economic ruin .
The extreme restrictions on Palestinian movement together with violence by settlers and security forces have made life intolerable for Palestinians , leading to a mass exodus and the economic ruin of the downtown area .
Owing to the presence of settlers in Hebron , the military did not withdraw from the city as part of the Interim Agreement ( Oslo II Accord ) .
In 1997 , Israel and the PLO signed the Hebron Agreement ( The Protocol Concerning the Redeployment in Hebron ) which addressed the redeployment of Israeli forces in the city .
Under the agreement , Hebron was divided into two areas : H1 and H2 .
Responsibility for security and civilian matters in Area H1 – where most of the Palestinian residents of Hebron live ( approx .
115,000 at the time , now approx .
166,000 ) – was formally handed over to the Palestinian Authority as was done in all other West Bank cities .
As for Area H2 , Israel retained responsibility for security matters there , while the PA received authority only for civilian matters relating to local Palestinian residents .
Some 35,000 Palestinians and 500 settlers were living in H2 at the time , and Hebron ’s Old City was designated a part of H2 .

The reinforced al - Arb’in Checkpoint , installed at one of the entrances to the neighborhood of Tel Rumeidah .
About 34,000 Palestinians and 700 settlers now live in H2 .
Of the Palestinian residents , some 7,000 live in areas near settlers ’ homes or near streets in use by the settlers .
Israeli authorities impose a regime intentionally and openly based on the “ principle of separation ” , the result of which is legal and physical segregation between the Israeli settlers and the Palestinian residents .
Palestinians living in the area are subjected to extreme restrictions on their movement by car or on foot – including the closure of main streets – while settlers are free to go where they wish .
In addition , the military has issued shutdown orders to hundreds of stores and commercial establishments in the area .
The military has established 21 permanent staffed checkpoints in Hebron .
Palestinians who need to go through any of these checkpoints must endure lengthy , humiliating inspections .
While ten of the checkpoints operate around the clock , access via the other checkpoints is blocked at night .
Often , the military closes a checkpoint with no prior notice , citing security needs .
Residents then have no choice but to take detours , some of them barely passable , to reach their destinations – even if they are simply trying to get home .
In some parts of H2 , the military imposes especially stringent restrictions .
For example , to access the neighborhood of Tel Rumeidah , Palestinians must go through barricaded checkpoints ; prior to this - from October 2015 through December 2018 - only Tel Rumeidah residents were allowed into the neighborhood , leaving them entirely isolated .
Another example is the neighborhood of a - Salaimeh .
The military split it in two by building a fence that runs down the middle of the neighborhood .
There is a gate in the fence but soldiers open it only at certain hours , and the matter is left solely to their discretion .
When the gate is closed , residents have to take a long detour to get home .
Moreover , the considerable presence of Israeli soldiers and police in the city center and their constant contact with Palestinian residents engender violent conduct and cynical abuse of the power entrusted to them .
Palestinians in H2 routinely endure violence , nightly military excursion into their homes , harassment , delays at checkpoints and various forms of degrading treatment .
Violent conduct by settlers has also become routine in the area .
Over the years , systematic abuse and harassment of Palestinians by settlers has become an established part of life in Hebron .
As often as not , the abuse takes the form of severe violence .
Documented instances include physical assault , stone - throwing , vandalism of shops and doors , theft , verbal abuse , attempts to run Palestinians over and several cases of gunfire .
In one such case , a 12 - year - old Palestinian girl was shot and killed .
Soldiers are to be found on every street corner wherever there are Israeli settlements .
Nevertheless , they rarely intervene when settlers attack Palestinians .
Even after the fact , the Israel Police hardly ever investigate settler assaults against Palestinians or their property – in spite of the many security cameras crisscrossing the city – and very seldom take action against the perpetrators .
This is tantamount to the police backing the settlers ’ acts of violence .
The restrictions and unremitting harassment that Palestinians suffer in Area H2 – which result entirely from Israel ’s decision to allow settlers to live there – prevent them from leading a normal routine and make life in the area unbearable .
Israeli authorities thereby promote an ongoing transfer , driving Palestinians out of Hebron ’s city center .

Mitch McConnell is as insincere and duplicitous as they come .
When Obama reached out to the Republicans , the Republicans shut him down .
So , Obama is moving ahead to pass the agenda of change , which is what the American people want .
McConnell does n’t like that :
A leading congressional Republican did not pull any punches Sunday when asked whether President Obama had kept one of his most prominent campaign promises .
“ I must say I ’m disappointed , ” Senate Minority Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Sunday on CNN ’s State of the Union .
“ After two months , the president has not governed in the middle as I had hoped he would .
But it ’s not too late .
He ’s only been in office a couple of months .
Still before him are the opportunities to deal with us on a truly bipartisan basis , ” the Republican told CNN Chief National Correspondent John King .
Seems like Obama is governing from where the American people want him to be .
His approval rating is a lot higher than the Republicans in Congress .
Keep in mind , in 2006 , there were 55 Republicans Senators .
Now , there are 41 .
The Republicans have lost 25 % of their membership .
That ’s because they ’re out - of - touch and have had nothing to offer the American people .
Over the last 12 years , Warner Home Video has released about 1,200 vintage films from its vast library on DVD .
But that still leaves about 3,800 feature titles that have yet to make their digital debuts .
At the studio ’s current release rate of 100 per year , they would n’t all be available until midcentury .
So in an industry first , the company today is , in a manner of speaking , inviting the public into the vaults to order what it wants .
And like the neighborhood pizzeria , it wo n’t make it till you order it .
Among the titles available are several early Clark Gable films , including “ Possessed ” and “ Men in White ” ; “ Love , ” Greta Garbo ’s silent version of “ Anna Karenina ” ; “ This Woman Is Dangerous , ” with Joan Crawford ; “ Abe Lincoln in Illinois , ” with Raymond Massey ; and “ Wisdom , ” with Emilio Estevez and Demi Moore .
The only catch : Not everything in the vault is on the menu yet .

The consumer who visits www.warnerarchive.com initially will find 150 classic titles from Warner Bros .
Pictures , MGM and RKO that each can be ordered either as a computer download ( $ 14.95 ) or as a DVD ( $ 19.95 ) that arrives in the mailbox approximately five days after purchase .
The studio says it intends to bolster that list at the rate of 20 new titles a month -- including TV series and TV movies .
Many of the movies and shows were once available on video cassette , but none has been on DVD , and many others have never been available for purchase at all .
“ My dream has always been to find a way to get everything to everybody who wants it , ” says George Feltenstein , senior vice president of theatrical catalog marketing for Warner Home Video .
“ No matter how obscure or arcane , there is something in the library that somebody wants .
But yet you have to hit a certain threshold of sales potential to justifying making a DVD the old - fashioned way . ”
That ’s because it ’s expensive to release and market a DVD -- even if the movie has no extras .

“ Just the cost of authoring , compression and menus , all of that kind of thing , can run into a great deal of money , ” Feltenstein says , “ and with shelf space at retail being diminished -- there is no more Tower Records , Music Plus . . . . ”
But now there is a system that permits manufacturing on demand -- not only creating the DVD but also placing it into a hard plastic case featuring custom art , wrapping it and shipping it .
“ We can make two DVDs or we can make 2,000 [ of a title ] , ” says Feltenstein .
( Sorry , Blu-ray fans :
It does n’t work for you . )
What the DVDs do n’t come with are any extras -- no commentary tracks , no deleted scenes , no “ making - of ” features .
You get the film and , if it ’s available , the original trailer .

As for picture quality , the website allows customers to preview each title to see how it looks .
“ We have digital masters of all of these films that have been created by the company as part of preservation and restoration [ of films ] , ” Feltenstein says .

Wired has an interview with author Maggie Jackson who ’s recently written a book called ‘ Distracted : The Erosion of Attention and the Coming Dark Age ’ in which she argues modern life and digital technology constantly demand our attention and are consequently damaging our ability to concentrate and be creative .
The trouble is , I just do n’t buy it and it ’s easy to see why .
The ‘ modern technology is hurting our brain ’ argument is widespread but it seems so short - sighted .
It ’s based on the idea that before digital communication technology came along , people spent their time focusing on single tasks for hours on end and were rarely distracted .
The trouble is , it ’s plainly rubbish , and you just have to spend time with some low tech communities to see this is the case .
In some of the poorer neighbourhoods Medell√≠n , my current city of residence , there is no electricity .
In these barrios , computers , the internet , and even washing machines and telephones do n’t exist in the average home .
Pretty much everything is done manually .
By the lights of the ‘ driven to digital distraction ’ argument , the residents should be able to live blissfully focused distraction - free lives , but they do n’t .
If you think twitter is an attention magnet , try living with an infant .
Kids are the most distracting thing there is and when you have three of even four in the house it is both impossible to focus on one thing , and stressful , because the consequences of not keeping an eye on your kids can be frightening even to think about .
The manual nature of all the tasks means you have to watch everything .
There is no timer on the cooker , so you need to watch the food .
The washing has to be done , by hand , while keeping an eye on everything else .
People call all the time , because , well , there is no other way of communication .
Street vendors pass by the house and shout what they ’re selling .
If you miss out on something , it might mean your days food planning has gone down the drain .
On top of this , people may be working to make a living in the same building .
Running a shop , mending stuff , selling food , or whatever their business might be .
The difference between this , and the “ oh is n’t email stressful ” situation , is that you can take a break from email and phone calls .
You can switch everything off for an hour so you can concentrate .
You can tell people you wo n’t be available .
For people trying to work and run a family at the same time , not only are the consequences of missing something more important and potentially more dangerous , but it ’s impossible to take a break .
A break means your kids are in danger , your family does n’t get fed and you ’re losing money that buys the food .
Now , think about the fact that the majority of the world live just like this , and not in not in the world of email , tweets and instant messaging .
Until about 100 years ago everyone lived like this .
In other words , the ability to focus on a single task , relatively uninterrupted , is the strange anomaly in the history of our psychological development .
New technology has not created some sort of unnatural cyber - world , but is just moving us away from a relatively short blip of focus that pervaded parts of the Western world for probably about 50 years at most .
And when we compare the level of stress and distraction it causes in comparison to the life of the average low - tech family , it ’s nothing .
It actually allows us to focus , because it makes things less urgent , it controls the consequences and allows us to suffer no more than social indignation if we do n’t respond immediately .
The past , and for most people on the planet , the present , have never been an oasis of mental calm and creativity .
And anyone who thinks they have it hard because people keep emailing them should trying bringing up a room of kids with nothing but two pairs of hands and a cooking pot .

A technology licensing suit between Intel and NVIDIA over controller chipsets and the next generation of Intel 's Core i7 CPUs may complicate Apple 's immediate plans for the next iMac and Mac Pro , and disrupt the company 's long term strategy for standardized GPU acceleration using OpenCL .
Apple in the middle
The suit relates to a disagreement between Intel , the maker of the Core 2 Duo CPUs used in Apple 's MacBook line and its desktop Macs ( apart from the high end Mac Pro , which uses Intel 's Xeon " Harpertown " CPU ) , and NVIDIA , which last year expanded its role with Apple as a GPU provider into one where the graphics company now supplies the chipset - on - a - chip controller that serves as the glue between Intel 's CPU and everything else in the computer .
Intel and NVIDIA teamed up in 2004 in a patent licensing agreement that resulted in NVIDIA making a competitive move into Intel 's chipset business with its MCP79 chipset platform .
Last year , Apple became the first PC vendor to adopt NVIDIA 's one - chip controller in its MacBook line .
The move not only simplified and improved the architecture of Apple 's notebook machines , but also provided significantly better graphics compared to the Intel controller chips it had been using .
The dispute between Intel and NVIDIA involves Intel 's next generation Nehalem CPUs ( marketed as " Core i7 " ) with QuickPath integrated memory controllers ;
Intel says NVIDIA 's license does not allow it to make competing , compatible chipsets for the new CPUs , while NVIDIA says it believes the 2004 agreement does .
Apple has a lot riding on the dispute , as its next iMac and Mac Pro are both expected to use Nehalem CPUs .
Further , a mobile version of Nehalem is expected next year , resulting in Apple 's entire Mac lineup being Nehalem - based within the near future .
Upsetting the Apple cart
Apple 's migration to NVIDIA controllers last fall in the new unibody MacBooks was part of a long term strategy to standardize on GPUs across its Mac product line .
In addition to being able to deliver optimized graphics drivers that take fuller advantage of NVIDIA hardware features than previous Macs , the move will also make it easier for the company and third party developers to accelerate tasks in Mac OS X Snow Leopard using OpenCL .
If Apple is forced to go back to Intel platform chipsets in order to use Intel 's latest CPUs , it will end up with two separate GPU architectures to support , just as it had prior to last fall : NVIDIA standalone GPUs in its higher - end Pro models , and Intel integrated graphics on the lower end consumer models .
Intel 's integrated graphics ( where the GPU is integrated into the controller chipset ) are significantly behind NVIDIA 's in performance and do not support OpenCL .
The uncertainty involved in the dispute is likely itself a significant problem for Apple .
The company was widely expected to introduce a revised iMac last fall at the one year anniversary of the current design , and again at Macworld Expo .
If Apple delayed the refresh primarily to take advantage of the upcoming Nehalem CPUs , this eleventh hour wrinkle could again delay an already overdue update .
The company 's desktop Mac sales have already tapered off in expectation of the next refresh ; Apple 's cyclical sales surges are directly tied to new product introductions .
Any additional delay will only compound this year 's sales slump related to the economic crisis .
On the other hand , this is one of the better years to suffer through an architecture war ; had the battle between Intel and NVIDIA played out during a surge in economic growth , Apple 's dilemma of having no new desktop products to sell would be a much bigger problem .
The issue does not affect Apple 's notebook sales , which now make up the majority of its Mac sales .
Intel 's history with competition
As the long term leader in PC CPUs , Intel has played the hardware equivalent to Microsoft in the decades since IBM released its original PC in 1982 .
Like Microsoft , Intel has defended its dominant position by seeking to kill opportunities for competitors to muscle into its business .
Intel 's battle with NVIDIA today has already played out in the past like the dramatic foreshadowing of a soap opera .
After struggling to sell memory components against Japanese competitors , Intel 's sudden success in microprocessors tied to IBM 's selection of its 8088 processor in its first PC led to a cutthroat battle to defend that business in the 1980s .
When IBM selected Intel 's 8088 CPU , it insisted Intel license the design to other manufacturers to ensure a chip supply from at least two sources .
Intel licensed its chip to AMD .
Intel then happily supported Compaq 's efforts to take away IBM 's business after the new PC maker cloned IBM 's ROM , allowing Compaq to sell IBM - compatible PCs with Intel 's new 386 processors .
At the same time , Intel naturally defended its own intellectual property , refusing to license the new 386 processor that Compaq was using to other chip manufacturers , including AMD , starting in 1986 .
AMD filed suit and won in arbitration , but Intel kept the case in the courts until 1991 , when the Supreme Court of California ended the matter by ruling in favor of AMD .
In the meantime , that legal uncertainty forced AMD to develop additional clean room compatibility with Intel 's CPUs .
After AMD muscled its way into the 386 business , Intel developed Socket 1 in 1997 , a proprietary new physical connector for its new 486 CPUs to prevent users from being able to replace Intel 's 486 with compatible versions from other vendors such as AMD .
Earlier CPU socket designs had been essentially open standards .
Fierce competition from competitors also resulted in Intel marketing its 586 as Pentium , a brand it could trademark .
With the Pentium II , Intel released Slot 1 , a cartridge - style , proprietary CPU packaging that again threw competing CPU makers off the track .
In markets where Intel faced less competition , such as with its late 90s Pentium Pro , chip prices did n't fall nearly as dramatically each year compared to markets where Intel faced AMD and others .
That led Intel into its partnership with HP to build Itanium , an entirely new 64 - bit CPU intended to eventually replace the x86 entirely , starting in the server market .
The subsequent , monumental failure of Itanium was particularly embarrassing for Intel because the company was then forced to start over in copying AMD 's 64 - bit extensions to x86 , in order to produce CPUs compatible with the standard AMD had popularized .
Along with Itanium , Intel also floundered in the development of its x86 Pentium 4 , ending up trounced by AMD 's competing Athlon XP CPUs .
However , intense competition with AMD eventually resulted in Intel producing its Core CPU architecture and again grabbing the lead in desktop performance at high efficiency and competitive prices , attracting Apple 's attention just as PowerPC began to run out of steam .
Partnership and rivalry with NVIDIA
With AMD 's merger with NVIDIA 's arch - rival ATI , one might think Intel and NVIDIA would find more reasons to agree than to argue .
NVIDIA has sought to release a series of " two - chip PC " systems , where one chip is made by NVIDIA and the other is made by Intel : the first being the MCP79 used by Apple in the MacBooks , and a second being Ion , a platform that pairs NVIDIA 's graphics and controller chip with a low cost Intel Atom CPU .
Apple is rumored to be considering Ion for use in its future products , such as an update to Apple TV .
Intel naturally wants Apple 's entire business to itself , as well as the chipset business of other PC makers that it is rapidly losing to NVIDIA .
Along those lines , the company has worked hard to brand its combination of CPU , controller chips , and WiFi components into a platform brand it could co-market with PC makers , including the Centrino laptop brand , of which Santa Rosa was a member .
While many PC makers buy up Intel 's parts across the board , Apple has never co-marketed the Centrino brand with Intel , instead preferring to use Intel 's components together with those of other makers .
Apple 's move last fall to adopt NVIDIA 's chipset was a particularly large jump away from Intel 's integrated platform , however , likely serving as further motivation for Intel to investigate ways to keep its customers , including Apple , tied to its products using artificial means rather than by simply providing the best products available on the market .
That includes leveraging strong products ( such as Intel 's CPUs ) to force adoption of its weaker products ( such as its integrated GPUs ) , by refusing to license interoperability with key products to its competitors ( such as seeking to block NVIDIA 's attempt to support its upcoming Nehalem CPUs ) .
Such competitive games are played by everyone in the industry , from Apple ( refusing to license FairPlay and iPod connectivity to Microsoft's Xbox ) Microsoft ( resisting efforts to make Windows and Office interoperable with competitors ) to NVIDIA ( which similarly seeks protect its proprietary technologies , including CUDA ) .
Back in December of 2008 the first ever declaration at the United Nations called for an immediate end to imprisonment and execution for people based on sexual orientation .
The resolution passed without approval by the United States .
" The Obama administration will endorse a U.N. declaration calling for the worldwide decriminalization of homosexuality that then - President George W. Bush had refused to sign , The Associated Press has learned " .

Do kids want fries with that ?
Evidently , yes : Fried potatoes account for as much as 25 % of children 's vegetable intake .
WHAT'S IN A SERVING SIZE ?
WHAT'S IN A SERVING SIZE ?
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture recommend that adults and children , 2 and older , consume 2 to 6 ½ cups of fruits and vegetables each day , depending on their calorie level of 1,000 to 3,200 .
Vegetables
• 1 cup raw leafy vegetable
• ½ cup cut - up raw or cooked vegetable
• ½ cup vegetable juice ( Try for a variety , including vegetables that are dark green and leafy or orange , and dry beans and peas . )
Fruit
• 1 medium fruit
• ¼ cup dried fruit
• ½ cup fresh or frozen or canned fruit
• ½ cup juice ( Consumption of whole fruits rather than juice is suggested to ensure adequate fiber intake . )

• Watercooler - worthy bits Kids are n't eating enough fruits and vegetables , and when they do consume produce , they are more likely to eat french fries than nutrient - rich dark green or orange vegetables , a study shows .
That wo n't surprise parents who have been trying to tempt their kids with better diets for years .
CHILDHOOD OBESITY : See its effects on kids ' bodies BETTER LIFE : Insurance companies , employers , medical groups teaming up against childhood obesity Researchers at Ohio State University analyzed government data on 6,500 children and teens , ages 2 - 18 , and found that the children were consuming an average of 2 cups of fruits , vegetables and juice a day .
Teens ate only slightly more than that .
The government nutritional guidelines base recommended produce intake on total calories consumed .
The range is 2 to 6 ½ cups of fruits and vegetables each day , based on an intake of 1,000 to 3,200 calories a day .
Someone consuming 2,000 calories a day should eat 2 cups of fruit and 2½ cups of vegetables a day .
Other findings reported in the March Journal of the American Dietetic Association : • French fries are the most common type of vegetable children eat .
Fries account for about one - quarter of children 's vegetable intake .
• Juice makes up about 40 % of kids ' fruit intake .
• Fruit and vegetable consumption is greater in families with higher incomes .
Earlier research has shown that this is because fresh produce can be expensive , and there often are n't stores that sell it in low - income neighborhoods .
If french fries and fruit juice had not been included in the survey data , then children would be eating far fewer fruits and vegetables than they should , says Hugo Melgar - Quinonez , an assistant professor in the department of human nutrition at Ohio State .
Parents have to get their children to go greener by eating more deep - green leafy vegetables , he says .
His advice : Always include vegetables and fruits in children 's meals , even if it means putting baby carrots and broccoli or a sliced apple on the table with the meal : " Just a little effort makes a big difference in kids ' diets and therefore their health . "
Barbara Lorson , a registered dietitian at Ohio State , recommends offering vegetables when the children are especially hungry , such as after school .

Torture Revealed Yet Again
By David Swanson
As with the evidence that Bush , Cheney , and gang intentionally lied us into a war , or the evidence of illegal and unconstitutional spying , each time a major new piece of evidence of torture emerges , it is impossible not to hope that this is the one that will compel the Justice Department or Congress or the courts or the American people to act decisively .
Certainly I hope that , right now , the day after Mark Danner reported on a report from the International Committee of the Red Cross .
But let ’s not kid ourselves .
Everyone has known that the United States was torturing for years .
Congress has known it so well that it has both attempted to legislate immunity for the torturers ( through the McCain Amendment to the Detainee Treatment Act and through the Military Commissions Act ) and put on a show of attempting to “ ban ” torture , despite its having already been illegal under U.S. law and treaties to which the United States is a party .
We ’ve witnessed high profile lobbying competitions over whether or not Congress should “ ban ” torture again .
We ’ve seen President Bush declare his right to torture in signing statements .
And we ’ve seen Congress respond to those with renewed proposals to yet again “ ban ” torture .
President Obama was elected promising to stop the torturing , and has announced that he is doing so , as well as that he will someday close one of the many places we illegally detain people without charge .
But torture in that place ( Guantanamo ) has reportedly worsened , and Obama is not letting independent groups in to observe .
There are publicly available videotapes of Bush ( April 11 , 2008 ; Jan. 11 , 2009 ) and Cheney ( Dec. 15 , 2008 ) confessing to authorizing torture .
There are reports and photographs and videotapes from Abu Ghraib , some of which certain members of Congress have seen but the public has not .
There are reports from dozens and dozens of victims , and from torturers and jailers .
There are dozens of dead bodies , victims of torture , identified , and the torture techniques used to kill them identified .
( This is separate from Cheney ’s assassination squad recently reported on by Seymour Hersh , which may not have used torture as its murder technique . )
There are full - blown public scandals in nearby and allied nations like Canada , Britain , and Germany , over our torture of their citizens .
Italy is trying members of our secret government in absentia for kidnapping a man in their country and having him tortured .
Victims from around the world are suing former members of our government and corporations involved in the crimes , and Eric Holder ’s Justice Department is opposing those efforts , seeking to keep information secret and prevent accountability for crimes .
Obama ’s administration is threatening the British government in order to do the same .
“ Five Years of My Life : An Innocent Man in Guantanamo , ” by Murat Kurnaz resulted in this one victim of torture speaking to a largely empty U.S. Congressional committee hearing via satellite .
After he ’d told part of his story , Congressman Dana Rohrabacher told him that the United States was at war and needed to protect itself even at the price of making some errors .
Publicly available are numerous memos , orders , and directives through which President Bush authorized torture and obtained “ legal ” views that illegality was now legal .
Here are two collections :
One , Two .
Many more such documents are already known and identified , but not yet released by Bush or Obama .
We have reports from torturers and participants on the US side .
We have reports that draw on the testimony of both participants and victims .
We have books that draw on the testimony of participants and the findings of secret government reports , books like Jane Mayer ’s “ The Dark Side ” , Philippe Sands ’ “ The Torture Team ” , Jack Goldsmith ’s “ The Terror Presidency ” , Steven Wax ’s “ Kafka Comes To America ” , and Andy Worthington ’s “ The Guantanamo Files ” .
We have reports that organize and summarize the information in these books .
We have a report from the Senate Armed Services Committee detailing the authorization of torture by Bush and his subordinates , and rumors that a stronger report has been kept secret .
We have reports that a Department of Justice report that is being kept secret contains Emails in which the White House asked the Department of Justice for its illegal “ legal ” opinions .
( Activists are demanding a special prosecutor investigation , while just releasing that report would hammer home the fact that no investigation is needed prior to indictments . )
We know that the CIA destroyed 92 “ interrogation ” tapes , and we have a good idea from Danner ’s report on the Red Cross report what ’s on most of the tapes .
Danner reports in the New York Times and the New York Review of Books on the accounts given to the Red Cross by 14 victims of US torture in secret foreign sites who were later transferred to Guantanamo .
Each use of torture was approved from Washington by such people as Dick Cheney , Condoleezza Rice , and John Ashcroft , who were briefed almost daily by George Tenet .
Danner draws some obvious conclusions , none of which are new :
“ 1. Beginning in the spring of 2002 the United States government began to torture prisoners .
This torture , approved by the President of the United States and monitored in its daily unfolding by senior officials , including the nation ’s highest law enforcement officer , clearly violated major treaty obligations of the United States , including the Geneva Conventions and the Convention Against Torture , as well as US law .
“ 2 . The most senior officers of the US government , President George W. Bush first among them , repeatedly and explicitly lied about this , both in reports to international institutions and directly to the public .
The President lied about it in news conferences , interviews , and , most explicitly , in speeches expressly intended to set out the administration ’s policy on interrogation before the people who had elected him .
“ 3 . The US Congress , already in possession of a great deal of information about the torture conducted by the administration ” ” which had been covered widely in the press , and had been briefed , at least in part , from the outset to a select few of its members ” ” passed the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 and in so doing attempted to protect those responsible from criminal penalty under the War Crimes Act .
“ 4 . Democrats , who could have filibustered the bill , declined to do so ” ” a decision that had much to do with the proximity of the midterm elections , in the run-up to which , they feared , the President and his Republican allies might gain advantage by accusing them of ‘ coddling terrorists . ’
One senator summarized the politics of the Military Commissions
Act with admirable forthrightness :
“‘ Soon , we will adjourn for the fall , and the campaigning will begin in earnest .
And there will be 30 - second attack ads and negative mail pieces , and we will be criticized as caring more about the rights of terrorists than the protection of Americans .
And I know that the vote before us was specifically designed and timed to add more fuel to that fire . ’
“ Senator Barack Obama was only saying aloud what every other legislator knew : that for all the horrified and gruesome exposÃ©s , for all the leaked photographs and documents and horrific testimony , when it came to torture in the September 11 era , the raw politics cut in the other direction .
Most politicians remain convinced that still fearful Americans ” ” given the choice between the image of 24 ‘s Jack Bauer , a latter - day Dirty Harry , fantasy symbol of untrammeled power doing “ everything it takes ” to protect them from that ticking bomb , and the image of weak liberals “ reading Miranda rights to terrorists ” ” ” will choose Bauer every time .
As Senator Obama said , after the bill he voted against had passed , “ politics won today . ”
“ 5 . The political damage to the United States ’ reputation , and to the ‘ soft power ’ of its constitutional and democratic ideals , has been , though difficult to quantify , vast and enduring .
In a war that is essentially an insurgency fought on a worldwide scale ” ” which is to say , a political war , in which the attitudes and allegiances of young Muslims are the critical target of opportunity ” ” the United States ’ decision to use torture has resulted in an enormous self - administered defeat , undermining liberal sympathizers of the United States and convincing others that the country is exactly as its enemies paint it : a ruthless imperial power determined to suppress and abuse Muslims .
By choosing to torture , we freely chose to become the caricature they made of us . ”
Point # 4 above has a certain weakness as framed by Danner .
He does not note the role of the news media in shaping public opinion .
Nor does he note the stunning resistance of the public to that shaping , as found in a recent USA Today / Gallup poll showing that Americans favor holding accountable those who authorized torture .
Nor does he sufficiently point out that Obama is evidence against his own claim : he voted No on the Military Commissions Act and was elected president .
Nor does Danner mention that Democrats in the House could have voted No as well as filibustering in the Senate .
It would be interesting to know how long the New York Times has sat on this story , as well as how long it took the Red Cross to leak the report ( over two years ? ) .
Another important point that this misses is that many of those who have been tortured were not terrorists , at least prior to being tortured .
Andy Worthington has documented that “ [ A]t least 93 percent of the 779 men and boys in [ Guantanamo ] – were either completely innocent people , seized as a result of dubious intelligence or sold for bounty payments , or Taliban foot soldiers , recruited to fight an inter-Muslim civil war that began long before the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , and that had nothing to do with al - Qaeda , Osama bin Laden or international terrorism . ” 
Danner points out that there is no evidence that useful information has been obtained by torture .
He leaves open the possibility that some has , but I find this highly dubious .
If such evidence of the utility of torture existed , it would have been trumpeted from the rooftops by now .
The important point is # 5 above .
Whether or not any torturer has learned anything accurate and useful , huge damage has been done that certainly outweighs whatever it was — even as calculated from a moral standpoint in which only American lives have value .
But Danner fails to fully expand on his point .
Not only has U.S. torture been the single biggest recruiting tool for anti-U.S. terrorist groups , but U.S. abuse of human rights has encouraged other nations to follow suit .
And this blatant disregard for the law has encouraged other leaders at home and abroad to feel more comfortable disregarding other laws as well .
The New York Review of Books yesterday admitted the obvious in point # 1 above : our president was a criminal .
But Danner and others suggest that perhaps that ’s not enough , that we must first persuade a majority of Americans to oppose torture before action can be taken to seriously deter its future use .
As I ’ve already noted , this misses the fact that a majority of Americans want action now .
But it is also a strangely selective transformation of our Constitutional republic into a direct democracy .
A majority of Americans disapprove of our punitive system for drug use , but the prosecutions continue .
A majority of Americans want an end to corporate tax loopholes , but the holes go right on looping .
A majority of Americans think taxes are too high on working people , yet the tax bills keep coming .
A majority of Americans want a higher minimum wage , but they ca n’t get employers to pay it .
A majority of Americans want habeas corpus maintained for everyone , but it is n’t .
Almost all Americans want higher auto fuel efficiency standards , but gas guzzlers keep coughing out black smoke .
And so on .
Why is it that when very important people ’s crimes are involved , we suddenly throw out laws and institute direct democracy ( and then ignore the will of the people to boot ) ?
Enforcement of the law is not legally an option , and is required by treaty obligations .
Attorney General Eric
Holder effectively admitted awareness of the crimes at his confirmation hearing .
Not to do so would have brought into question whether he ’d been conscious the last several years .
And yet his loyalty is clearly to Obama , not the law .
The Detainee Treatment Act and Military Commissions
Act do not provide an excuse .
Article VI of our Constitution makes treaties we ratify the supreme law of the land .
Torture cannot be legalized and torturers cannot be immunized .
Even assuming such things to be possible , these legislative attempts at immunity left holes , as Larry Velvel has pointed out , including for cases in which the victims were citizens , and cases in which the victims are not “ enemy combatants . ”
Many victims were never determined to be “ enemy combatants , ” a court could easily throw out the term as legally meaningless , and Obama ’s administration has ceased using it ( even while continuing the policies of detention and rendition ) .
Keeping secret agencies secret is not an excuse .
Holder could create a prosecutor for torture by the military if he wanted to let the CIA off .
Or he could target Bush , Cheney , and other top officials , leaving the underlings alone .
But the secrecy of government operations is what facilitates criminal behavior , and therefore makes a lousy excuse for not punishing it .
In June 2008 , 56 Democratic Congress members , led by Congressman John Conyers , wrote to Attorney General Mukasey asking for a Special Prosecutor .
Conyers and Congressman Jerrold Nadler wrote to Mukasey again in December 2008 .
Nadler said weeks ago that he was drafting a new letter .
Just as with Holder , Congress members tend to obey people , not laws or moral requirements .
Nadler is unlikely to act without Conyers .
Conyers is unlikely to act without Nancy Pelosi .
And Pelosi shares blame because she and a handful of other top Congress members were privately told to some extent about the torture early on and kept silent .
Pelosi ’s comments in the media suggest that she would prefer prosecutions to public hearings , but there is no doubt that her first choice would be neither , and as long as Democrats join Republicans in opposing calls by Conyers and Senator Patrick Leahy to create “ truth commissions , ” and as long as powerful members of government all refrain from asking Holder to enforce the law , the option of doing nothing will remain available .
The Senate Intelligence Committee is holding secret hearings , or claiming to .
But the value of that may be nil , and the point may be to weaken the push for a commission by the Senate Judiciary Committee or to assert jurisdiction over CIA materials that the Judiciary Committee could conceivably make public .
Meanwhile , the proposals by the two Judiciary Committee chairs ( Leahy and Conyers ) appear counterproductive unless usable as tools for scaring up support for prosecutions instead .
Investigations substituted for impeachment for two full years .
Actually holding a “ truth and reconciliation ” commission as a substitute for prosecution would be counterproductive , as argued by Jonathan Turley , Peter Dyer , David Swanson , Bob Fertik , and Martin Garbus .
The Justice Department itself has argued for “ state secrets ” blocks on prosecutions on the grounds that commissions can substitute for enforcing laws .
They cannot .
And they are unlikely to reveal as much information as are whistleblowers and the occasional journalists who do their jobs .
The truth that I think we should all insist upon is that Bush and Cheney committed serious crimes and have yet to be held accountable , and that we risk a slide into presidential dictatorship if we allow our nation to become reconciled to that .
There are several easy steps anyone can take to correct this situation .
UPDATE 1 :
Pre-Legal Memo

( CNN ) --
White House officials and some members of Congress reacted strongly Sunday to news that insurance giant AIG had intended to pay out $ 165 million in bonuses and compensation .
The company has received at least $ 170 billion in federal bailout money .
In a letter to the White House , AIG Chairman Edward Liddy , shown here in December , vows to curb bonuses .
Under pressure from the Treasury , AIG scaled back the bonus plans and pledged to reduce 2009 bonuses -- or " retention payments " -- by at least 30 percent .
That did little to temper outrage at the initial plan , however .
In a letter Sunday to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , U.S. Sen .
Russ Feingold urged the Obama administration to explore " legal options " to prevent the millions in AIG payouts .
" I write to ask why any bonuses would be legally required , given the company 's abysmal performance , " says Feingold , D - Wisconsin .
Feingold asked whether the bonuses could be canceled or recouped from recipients , and whether the administration will sue AIG executives for breaching their duties to shareholders
" There are a lot of terrible things that have happened in the last 18 months , but what 's happened at AIG is the most outrageous , " Lawrence Summers , head of the National Economic Council , told ABC's " This Week . "
" What that company did , the way it was not regulated , the way no one was watching , what 's proved necessary , it is outrageous . "
And on " Fox News Sunday , " White House economic adviser Austan Goolsbee said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was " really upset by the news . "
" He stepped in and berated them , got them to reduce the bonuses following every legal means he has to do this , " Goolsbee said .
In a letter to Geithner , obtained Saturday by CNN , AIG Chairman and CEO Edward Liddy said his company was taking steps to limit compensation in AIG Financial Products -- the British - based unit responsible for issuing the risky credit default swaps that have brought the company to the brink of collapse .
The default swaps amount to insurance against losses from bad loans , which have increased dramatically since the U.S. housing boom peaked .
In the letter to Geithner , Liddy said the unit 's 25 highest - paid contract employees will reduce their salaries to $ 1 this year and all other officers in the unit will reduce their salaries by 10 percent .
Other " non-cash compensation " will be reduced or eliminated .
But he told Geithner that some bonus payments are binding legal obligations of the company , and " there are serious legal , as well as business consequences for not paying . "
Rep. Barney Frank , the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , told Fox that bailout recipients should have to follow stricter compensation rules , and said Congress should look into whether the bonuses are " legally recoverable . "
" We can't just violate legal obligations , I understand that , " the Massachusetts Democrat said .
" But I do want to find out at what point these legal obligations were incurred .
Who said , and at what point , ' We 're going to give these bonuses no matter what ? '
And I do think it 's inappropriate for those people to stay in power at that company . "
Frank said that if banks complain that the Obama administration has made things too tough , " They can give the money back .
We made that easy . "
Goolsbee said AIG was following " a policy that 's really not sensible , is obviously going to ignite the ire of millions of people . "
" We 've done exactly what we can do to prevent this kind of thing from happening again , " Goolsbee said .
Summers told ABC that the administration was taking " every legal step possible to limit those bonuses . "
Sen . Bob Corker , R - Tennessee , told " Fox News Sunday " he believes it 's important to know whether the bonuses are actually commission payments for products sold by brokers , saying he would withhold judgment until that is clarified .
However , " I do think that these entities that are receiving government money , our money , I do think they have to play by a different set of rules , " Corker said .
Hopefully , those different rules will discourage companies from accepting bailout funds , he said .
Liddy , however , makes clear in the letter that he took steps to limit his employees ' compensation with trepidation .
He said the company will have trouble attracting and retaining " the best and the brightest ... if employees believe that their compensation is subject to continued and arbitrary adjustment by the U.S. Treasury . "
AIG lost a record $ 62 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
It has more than 74 million insurance policies issued in 130 countries around the world .

All About Timothy Geithner • American International Group Inc .
My mischievous blogging buddy , Paul Staines , aka Guido Fawkes , finally did what he has been working for for most of the last the four years : bust the political lobby system wide open …
With the fingering of Damian McBride , out came a flood of embarrassing stories of how political spin doctors had pistol whipped , cajoled and boycotted their way to civil stories about the government …
As our scooped letter from the First and Deputy First Minister and their clumsy attempt to put the clamp on what they saw as excessive negativism in the Belfast Telegraph … and , no doubt , there are innumerable stories of individual journalists being cut off from press conferences , and party press lists for writing stories that went too hard on one of their representatives …
Now , if they are reading the tailspin Labour ’s communication strategy correctly , it must be obvious to the local political incumbents that those darker , bullying tactics can turn into some very nasty blog blow back …
Those closed doors you think you are operating behind are no longer quite as closed as you once thought they were …
That ’s not a threat by the way , it ’s just a fact .
Guido has blown away the Victorian , Industrial Age conceit that media and political elites can confide with confidence and between them manage the best compromise deal for either and both …
Of course , though there are many who suspect otherwise , Guido is an avowed partisan .
He has made no secret of the fact he supports the Tory party .
Much of his animosity towards the Daily Telegraph is because of its reluctance to wholeheartedly back the Cameron project .
He ca n’t be stung for dirty tricks or cooking shitty personal stories about Labour , because , unlike McBride , he is an independent ( and independently wealthy ) player .
He ’s also a former hedge fund specialist .
It was these guys ’ jobs to exploit weaknesses in the operation of the markets to destruction , and in the process make the system work better and stronger ( unless it is already too scuzzed up , in which case the whole thing keels over anyway ) .
They also made good money out of it .
Paul ’s approach to blogging and mine are profoundly different ( see this CIF piece from three years ago ) .
He thinks personalities ( and their utter destruction ) is critical , and makes and breaks government ( s ) .
I think policy and the conduct of government is ( or should be ) paramount .
The cross hairs graphic he uses to mark his ‘ targets ’ also gives away something important .
Guido is a Tory sniper …
According to an old Scots soldier friend who fought at Monte Casino , during the last war those who volunteered for that job got a whole 6d extra a day … .
For that they would have to spend days in no man ’s land beyond the trenches slowly getting into place …
Each move imperceptable to the enemy scouring the landscape …
Then firing just twice ( a third shot allows the enemy to triangulate and find where you are firing from ) before spending days moving back …
But generally snipers were distrusted amongst the ranks , since it was one form of combat in which the ordinary soldier had no way of saving himself ( except deserting the line ) …
Guido will be fated for each of his hits , but feared and loathed even by many on his own side for the way it exposes the political class as a whole to similarly unpredictable incoming fire …
So is this only a quick fizz in the pan ?
Well , no .
Although what Guido ( and we in our own more modest and certainly more civil way ) has done is political , it would not have happened without the technological means for people to ‘ tunnel ’ information out of big institutions , be they political , media , public or private .
And the personal rather than the political is apparently to be the method of choice .
In Brown ’s camp of office juniors is McBride , Charlie Whelan and the hapless Derek Draper .
Cameron has bought in as his chosen Head of PR , Andy Coulson , is the guy who resigned just over two years ago from the News of the World after one of his journalists , Clive Goodman , made more than 600 calls hacking into messages of members of the royal household .
As John Lloyd notes in yesterday ’s FT :
Mr Coulson was hired not for his political but for his media nous .
He had , self - confessedly , little interest in politics , having reported on show business and celebrities before being elevated to the editorship  although , in an interview with Tony Blair before the 2001 election , he asked the then prime minister whether he and his wife Cherie had joined the  mile - high club ( had sex in an aircraft toilet ) .
In appointing him to such a key post , Mr Cameron was signalling , both to the media and to his party , that he would mould the Conservatives  presentation around tropes that a tabloid professional would judge had most impact .
This is trench warfare within representative democracy the like of which we rarely see in Northern Ireland .
It ai n’t pretty , but neither is it an illusion of t’ Internet - land …
Even if as my Telegraph colleague Janet Daley notes that :
It may have been the blogger Paul Staines who obtained the fatal information but bizarrely , he did not then put it on his website , as Matt Drudge did when he had the similarly dangerous Monica Lewinsky story .
To have done that might have established beyond doubt the influence of the Web in the political game here just as Drudge did in the US .
Instead Mr Staines chose to tout his story to the newspapers in the sweet old fashioned way .
Must we assume that even he does not believe that a blog post would have as much influence as a newspaper splash ?
She is right up to a point .
But what we have witnessed is a blogger using an asymmetrical relationship with big media to get the story out there , and then riding the Augean wave it creates to pistol whip certain sections of that media into making a series of mea culpas …
Not to mention comprehensively stealing the news agenda from the Government …
It may not be a trick Guido Fawkes can pull off too many times …
But then again , having proved the point he no longer has to …
