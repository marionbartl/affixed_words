Eminent domain is the government 's ability to take property and use it for the greater good .
An example is taking a person 's land to build a new highway on it .
The word property does n't always mean physical property ; it can include contracts , copyrights and patents .
The government took intellectual property during WWI when it took vacuum tube patents and put them in a public pool .
Owners were reward from the licensing pool and out of this , other inventors created FM radio .
Today , it seems the government is eager to take property and give it to major corporations .
Such acts would be projects like the Texas Trans Corridor or a natural gas line in Oregon .
Would n't it be ironic if the government took a patent from a major corporation for the “ greater good ? ”
When GM and Toyota were building an EV ( electric vehicle ) car to meet future California emission requirements in the late 1990s , they needed a good battery .
A company called Ovonics 's created a NiMH battery .
GM acquired part of the company and when the EV project was discontinued , they sold their share to Texaco .
A few days later Texaco was acquired by Chevron .
The old GM joint venture was renamed to Cobasys .
Chevron ( Cobasys ) promptly sued Toyota and Panasonic over a similar battery technology .
Chevron won the case ; thus , allowing Chevron to have the sole patent for EV ( plug - in NiMH batteries ) .
Cobasys even got to collect royalties from Toyota on some of the hybrid batteries and 30 million dollars in damages .
Toyota has been trying to license the technology for a plug - in vehicle ever since , but Cobasys has been unwilling to sell or license the technology .
Cobasys is providing batteries for some hybrids today such as GM's Malibu and Verizon to upgrade their vans to hybrid vehicles .
Too bad we do not see the EV vehicles or a hybrid that plugs in with this technology today .
To think , it 's been over 10 years since these plug - in EVs were leased in California , and we do not even have that technology available on a gas electric today .
McCain wants to end an 18 cent federal gas tax , and Obama is calling for win - fall profit taxes to lower gas prices .
No one seems willing to use the government to rob a corporation for the public good .
If the government is willing to steal land to solve a highway problem and pump more natural gas to California , it would make sense that the government would be just as willing to steal a patent .
This patent would curb money going overseas to countries that do n't like us , slow inflation and help us become less entangled around the world .
I guess a win - fall tax that ends up filtering down to the consumer is better because the government gets more revenue .
Of course , what good is the redistribution of money to new technologies if the technologies can never reach the market because of patent ?
NOTE :
I hate eminent domain and think that it should never be used .
It is the government taking property , basically stealing .
I also believe in anti-trust laws that stop monopolies from gouging consumers .
Patents and copyrights , while they have good intentions are being abused .
They are now a tool for companies and organizations to control markets , not for individuals to protect their works and earn a living .
It is hard to believe in a free market when tools exist to prevent it from being free .
Technology should flow .
If Xerox had patented the first personal computer and sat on it so that no one else could make one because they wanted to sell copiers , we might not have a computer today .
I fear other countries because they will not obey these patent laws .
They will develop electric vehicles and power them with nuclear power while our economy drowns with oil prices .

With one brilliant burst , Marshevet Hooker put her name alongside those of Florence Griffith - Joyner , Marion Jones and Evelyn Ashford .
Hooker ran a wind - aided 10.76 seconds to win her 100 - meter quarterfinal Friday at the U.S. Olympic track and field trials , tying her with former world record - holder Ashford as the fifth - fastest woman in all conditions .
Marshevet Hooker ran the 100 in a wind - aided 10.76 seconds .

" I heard the time first , " said Hooker , an NCAA champion at Texas .
" I was like , ' Wow ! ' "
Then , though , she heard the wind speed : 3.4 meters per second , above the 2.0 that 's allowed for a time to count as a personal best or official record .
Still , only world - record holder Griffith - Joyner , Jones , Christine Arron and Merlene Ottey ever have run faster , regardless of wind .
That impressed the other women in what 's considered a talented field , with more than a half - dozen legitimate contenders for the three 100 berths on the Beijing Games roster .
" She was fast .
Real fast , " said Torri Edwards , the 2003 world champion in the 100 .
" I hope she 's tired . "
The first athletes to secure their Olympic team berths came in the women 's 10,000 , led by winner Shalane Flanagan in 31 minutes , 34.81 seconds , breaking the Hayward Field mark set by Mary Slaney in 1982 .
Kara Goucher and Amy Begley also earned trips to Beijing .
Edwards won her 100 heat in a wind - aided 10.85 , while Carmelita Jeter advanced by winning her heat in 10.97 .
Allyson Felix , hoping to compete in four events in China , was second to Jeter in 10.98 , and 2004 Olympic silver medalist Lauryn Williams finished behind Hooker in 10.86 .
Hooker also had the fastest time of the opening round Friday , a wind - aided 10.94 .
One woman who did not make it out of the 100 quarterfinals was Chryste Gaines , who clocked 11.15 in the first round but finished seventh in her next race .
Gaines , a two - time Olympic relay medalist , was banned for two years in December 2005 , a punishment based not on a positive drug test but on evidence gathered in the criminal investigation of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative and the testimony of fellow sprinter Kelli White .
Gaines was among dozens of athletes who testified in 2003 before a federal grand jury probing BALCO .
She also was part of the series of athletes whose scandals and suspensions placed a cloud over the sport , a cloud that Felix and others are hoping to lift .
" We paved the way for them .
That 's why they get the money they get .
We do n't get those props , " said Gaines , who noted she 's still friends with former BALCO head Victor Conte .
The competition got off to a quick start under a cloudless sky with the temperature approaching 90 degrees :
In the very first event of the 10 - day meet , Hyleas Fountain broke Jackie Joyner - Kersee 's decade - old U.S. record in the heptathlon 100 hurdles .
Fountain , a two - time national champion in the heptathlon , finished in 12.65 , eclipsing Joyner - Kersee 's mark of 12.69 .
Fountain also bested Joyner - Kersee 's Olympic trials record of 12.71 from 1988 , and Joyner - Kersee 's U.S. national championship record of 12.77 from 1991 .
In preliminaries for other events , past national champion and 2004 Olympian Walter Davis fouled on all three attempts and did not advance in the long jump ; 2000 Olympic gold medalist Angelo Taylor and reigning world champion Kerron Clement advanced in the 400 - meter hurdles ; and pole vaulter Brad Walker -- competing at the same track where he set the U.S. record less than three weeks ago -- led with 18 feet , 4 ½ inches ( 5.6 meters ) .
Bernard Lagat , who won medals for Kenya at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Games , took the first step toward making his first U.S. Olympic team by reaching Monday 's final .
" The way I 've been received here , it 's like I was born here , " Lagat said .
" I 'm happy to be running for the red , white and blue . "
This has to be the most embarrassing for the government .
If a hacker can break down the walls of our Homeland Security , than how exposed are we to other threats ?
President would you like to answer that one ?
A hacker broke into a Homeland Security Department telephone system over the weekend and racked up about $ 12,000 in calls to the Middle East and Asia .
The hacker made more than 400 calls on a Federal Emergency Management Agency voicemail system in Emmitsburg , Md. , on Saturday and Sunday , according to FEMA spokesman Tom Olshanski .
FEMA is part of Homeland Security , which in 2003 put out a warning about this very vulnerability .
The voicemail system is new and recently was installed .
It is a Private Branch Exchange , or PBX , a traditional corporate phone network that is used in thousands of companies and government offices .
Many companies are moving to a higher tech version , known as Voice Over Internet Telephony .
FEMA must be embarrassed over this incident , though it ’s not high tech like other hack attempts , but it leaves a bad taste .
A presidential pardon is a right granted to the President of the United States by the U.S. Constitution to forgive a person for a crime , or to excuse a person convicted of a crime from punishment .
The president ’s power to pardon is granted by Article II , Section 2 , Clause 1 of the Constitution , which provides : “ The President … shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States , except in Cases of Impeachment . ”
Key Takeaways Article II , Section 2 , Clause 1 of the Constitution grants the President of the United States the power to pardon any person convicted for or accused of federal crimes , except in cases of impeachment .
The president may not pardon persons convicted for or accused of violating state or local laws .
Through the power of “ commutation of sentence , ” the president may reduce or completely eliminate the prison sentences being served by persons convicted of federal crimes .
While he or she is not required to follow them , recommendations on all applications for presidential pardons must be prepared and submitted to the president by the U.S. Pardon Attorney of the Department of Justice .
Clearly , this power can result in some controversial applications .
For example , in 1972 Congress accused President Richard Nixon of obstruction of justice — a federal felony — as part of his role in the infamous Watergate scandal .
On September 8 , 1974 , President Gerald Ford , who had assumed office following Nixon ’s resignation , pardoned Nixon for any crimes he may have committed related to Watergate .
On January 21 , 1977 , President Jimmy Carter , on his first full day in office , made good on a campaign promise by issuing an executive order granting unconditional pardons to the nearly 500,000 young American men who had evaded the military draft during the Vietnam War by fleeing the United States or refusing to register for the draft with their Selective Service boards .
At the time , the blanket pardons came under fire from both veterans ’ groups — who considered the “ draft dodgers ” to be unpatriotic lawbreakers — and from amnesty groups — for not including deserters , dishonorably discharged soldiers , and civilians arrested during anti-war demonstrations .
In the end , the war and the draft had so deeply divided the people that only about half of the approximately 100,000 draft evaders who had fled to Canada chose to return to the United States , despite having been granted amnesty .
In 2018 , President Donald Trump offered to posthumously pardon late boxing legend Muhammad Ali , who had been convicted and jailed in 1967 for refusing to be inducted into the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War .
However , President Trump ’s offer had been more symbolic than substantive , as the U.S. Supreme Court had overturned Mr. Ali ’s conviction in 1971 , confirming his status as a conscientious objector .
On February 20 , 2020 , President Trump controversially hinted that he might pardon his longtime adviser Roger Stone , shortly after Stone had been sentenced to three years and four months in prison .
Stone had been convicted in November 2019 of lying to Congress , witness tampering , and obstructing the Mueller investigation into alleged pro-Trump interference by Russia in the 2016 presidential elections .
“ I ’m not going to do anything in terms of the great powers bestowed upon a president of the United States , I want the process play out , I think that 's the best thing to do , ” Trump said .
“ Because I 'd love to see Roger exonerated and I 'd love to see it happen because I personally think he was treated very unfairly . ”
On February 24 , 2020 , Stone ’s attorneys filed a request for a new trial , claiming the trial jury ’s foreperson had held a political bias against President Trump .
While not ruling out an eventual pardon , President Trump said he would wait to see the legal process play out .
“ At some point I 'll make a determination , but Roger Stone and everybody has to be treated fairly .
And this has not been a fair process , ” the president said .
The number of pardons issued by the presidents has varied widely .
Between 1789 and 1797 , President George Washington issued 16 pardons .
In his three terms — 12 years — in office , President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued the most pardons of any president so far — 3,687 pardons .
Presidents William H. Harrison and James Garfield , both of whom died shortly after taking office , did not grant any pardons .
Under the Constitution , the president may pardon only persons convicted or accused of federal crimes and offenses prosecuted by the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia in the name of the United States in the D.C. Superior Court .
Crimes that violate state or local laws are not considered crimes against the United States and thus cannot be considered for presidential clemency .
Pardons for state - level crimes are typically granted by the state ’s governor or a state board of pardon and parole .
Can Presidents Pardon Their Relatives ?
The Constitution places few restrictions on who presidents can pardon , including their relatives or spouses .
Historically , the courts have interpreted the Constitution as giving the president virtually unlimited power to issue pardons to individuals or groups .
However , presidents can only grant pardons for violations of federal laws .
In addition , a presidential pardon only provides immunity from federal prosecution .
It does provide protection from civil lawsuits .
Clemency : Pardon or Commutation of Sentence
“ Clemency ” is the general term used to describe the president ’s power to grant leniency to persons who have violated federal laws .
A “ commutation of sentence ” partially or completely reduces a sentence being served .
It does not , however , overturn the conviction , imply innocence , or remove any civil liabilities that might be imposed by the circumstances of the conviction .
A commutation may apply to prison time or to payments fines or restitution .
A commutation does not alter a person ’s immigration or citizenship status and does not prevent their deportation or removal from the United States .
Likewise , it does not protect a person from extradition requested by other countries .
A “ pardon ” is a presidential act of forgiving a person for a federal crime and is typically granted only after the convicted person has accepted responsibility for the crime and has demonstrated good conduct for a significant period of time after their conviction or completion of their sentence .
Like a commutation , a pardon does not imply innocence .
A pardon may also include forgiveness of fines and restitution imposed as part of the conviction .
Unlike a commutation , however , a pardon does remove any potential civil responsibility .
In some , but not all cases , a pardon eliminates the legal grounds for deportation .
Under the Rules Governing Petitions for Executive Clemency , shown below , a person is not allowed to apply for a presidential pardon until at least five years after they have fully served any prison term imposed as part of their sentence .

Israel tries to play down minister 's warning of attack on Iran
Israel yesterday attempted to play down a warning from a senior government minister that an attack on Iran was " unavoidable " if Tehran continued to develop nuclear weapons .
The transportation minister , Shaul Mofaz , a key figure in Israel 's dialogue with the US on Iran 's nuclear programme , raised the prospect of a unilateral Israeli attack against Tehran on Friday , adding that international sanctions had been ineffective .
The threat , which is at odds with Israel 's support so far for an international campaign to curtail and , if necessary , confront Iran 's uranium enrichment programme , contributed to frenzied buying in the financial markets , where oil prices soared to a record $ 139 , and sparked an international furore .
Yesterday , Mark Regev , a spokesman for Israel 's prime minister , Ehud Olmert , said that " all options must remain on the table " , adding that " tangible steps by the international community " were needed to " put pressure on the regime in Tehran " .
Defence officials criticised Mofaz , saying his comments would make it more difficult for Israel to convince the international community to intensify its efforts .
Political rivals accused him of exploiting Israel 's fear of Iran for political gain .
A spokeswoman for Mofaz , Talya Somech , confirmed that he had been quoted accurately .
She said Mofaz was expressing " his own opinion " .
Israel 's deputy defence minister , Matan Vilnai , said Mofaz , a former defence minister and a contender to replace the scandal - battered Olmert , had turned " one of the most strategic security issues into a political game , using it for the internal purposes of a would - be campaign in Kadima " .
Kadima , the party founded by the former prime minister Ariel Sharon , leads the coalition government and has been thrown into turmoil by the latest corruption scandal surrounding Olmert .
Mohamed ElBaradei , head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , rebuked Israel for damaging diplomatic efforts aimed at reining in Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
" With unilateral military actions , countries are undermining international agreements , and we are at a historic turning point , " ElBaradei said .
Iran retaliated against Mofaz 's comments at the weekend , demanding action from the UN security council and accusing Israel of violating international law .
Israel bombed a Syrian target suspected of being a North Korean - built reactor last September .
It also bombed an Iraqi reactor in 1981 .
But last week , while visiting Washington , Olmert called for tougher diplomatic efforts .
Is there any framework , scientific , philosophic , or religious that addresses where the universe came from in the first place ?
i.e. where god , the singularity , or the infinite cycle of birth and death arose / came from ?
Where did the universe come from in the first place ?
Kerry : ' Before he debates Obama , McCain should debate himself '

Print This Email This DENVER --
If there was one sound byte that contributed more than any other to his defeat in 2004 , it was when John Kerry let slip that he " was for it before I was against it . "
Four years later , the Massachusetts senator unveiled a blistering attack on John McCain trying to paint the Republican presidential candidate with the same flip - flopper brush that sunk his own campaign .
" I have known about been friends with John McCain now for 22 years , but every day now I learn something new about candidate McCain , " he said .
" Let 's compare Senator McCain to Candidate McCain , " Kerry said , noting that on the campaign trail , the GOP nominee has voiced support for tax cuts he voted against in the senate , criticized an environmental bill he originally co-authored and said he would n't vote for an immigration bill he championed .
" Are you kidding me folks ? " Kerry mocked .
" Talk about being before it before you 're against it . "
Democrats have learned many lessons from Kerry 's failed bid .
In 2004 , he waited too long to respond to Swift Boat attacks on his Vietnam War record , and the Democratic convention mostly lacked harsh attacks on President Bush and the Republicans .
Kerry criticized McCain , " who once railed against the smears of Karl Rove when he was a target , " of now embracing those very same negative tactics in his campaign against Obama .
He said Americans were tired of such tactics and that Americans would not fall for them this time around .
The Massachusetts senator also rebutted criticisms of Obama 's youth and status as a newcomer to national politics .
The 47 - year - old was virtually unknown outside of Chicago before his electrifying speech at the 2004 convention and election to the Senate that year .
" When we choose a Commander in Chief this November , we 're electing judgement , character , " he said .
" Not years in the Senate or on this Earth . "
FULL SPEECH TEXT :
Thank you so much .
Four years ago , you gave me the honor of fighting our fight .
I was proud to stand with you then , and I am proud to stand with you now , to help elect Barack Obama as President of the United States .
In 2004 , we came so close to victory .
We are even closer now , and let me tell you , this time we 're going to win .
Today , the call for change is more powerful than ever , and with more seats in Congress , with more people with more passion engaged in our politics , and with a President Obama , we stand on the brink of the greatest opportunity of our generation to move this country forward .
The stakes could not be higher , because we do know what a McCain administration would look like : just like the past , just like George Bush .
And this country can't afford a third Bush term .
Just think : John McCain voted with George Bush 90 percent of the time .
Ninety percent of George Bush is just more than we can take .
Never in modern history has an administration squandered American power so recklessly .
Never has strategy been so replaced by ideology .
Never has extremism so crowded out common sense and fundamental American values .
Never has short - term partisan politics so depleted the strength of America 's bipartisan foreign policy .
George Bush , with John McCain at his side , promised to spread freedom but delivered the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time .
They misread the threat and misled the country .
Instead of freedom , it 's Hamas , Hezbollah , the Taliban and dictators everywhere that are on the march .
North Korea has more bombs , and Iran is defiantly chasing one .
Our mission is to restore America 's influence and position in the world .
We must use all the weapons in our arsenal , above all , our values .
President Obama and Vice President Biden will shut down Guantanamo , respect the Constitution , and make clear once and for all , the United States of America does not torture , not now , not ever .
We must listen and lead by example because even a nation as powerful as the United States needs some friends in this world .
We need a leader who understands all our security challenges , not just bombs and guns , but global warming , global terror and global AIDS .
And Barack Obama understands there is no way for America to be secure until we create clean energy here at home , not with a little more oil in five , 10 or 20 years , but with an energy revolution starting right now .
I have known and been friends with John McCain for almost 22 years .
But every day now I learn something new about candidate McCain .
To those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician , I say , let 's compare Senator McCain to candidate McCain .
Candidate McCain now supports the wartime tax cuts that Senator McCain once denounced as immoral .
Candidate McCain criticizes Senator McCain 's own climate change bill .
Candidate McCain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that Senator McCain wrote .
Are you kidding ?
Talk about being for it before you 're against it .
Let me tell you , before he ever debates Barack Obama , John McCain should finish the debate with himself .
And what 's more , Senator McCain , who once railed against the smears of Karl Rove when he was the target , has morphed into candidate McCain who is using the same " Rove " tactics and the same " Rove " staff to repeat the same old politics of fear and smear .
Well , not this year , not this time .
The Rove -McCain tactics are old and outworn , and America will reject them in 2008 .
So remember , when we choose a commander - in - chief this November , we are electing judgment and character , not years in the Senate or years on this earth .
Time and again , Barack Obama has seen farther , thought harder , and listened better .
And time and again , Barack Obama has been proven right .
When John McCain stood on the deck of an aircraft carrier just three months after 9/11 and proclaimed , " Next up , Baghdad ! " , Barack Obama saw , even then , " an occupation of " undetermined length , undetermined cost , undetermined consequences " that would " only fan the flames of the Middle East . "
Well , guess what ?
Mission accomplished .
So who can we trust to keep America safe ?
When Barack Obama promised to honor the best traditions of both parties and talk to our enemies , John McCain scoffed .
George Bush called it " the soft comfort of appeasement . "
But today , Bush 's diplomats are doing exactly what Obama said : talking with Iran .
So who can we trust to keep America safe ?
When democracy rolled out of Russia , and the tanks rolled into Georgia , we saw John McCain respond immediately with the outdated thinking of the Cold War.
Barack Obama responded like a statesman of the 21st century .
So who can we trust to keep America safe ?
When we called for a timetable to make Iraqis stand up for Iraq and bring our heroes home , John McCain called it " cut and run . "
But today , even President Bush has seen the light .
He and Prime Minister Maliki agree on - guess what ? - a timetable .
So who can we trust to keep America safe ?
The McCain - Bush Republicans have been wrong again and again and again .
And they know they will lose on the issues .
So , the candidate who once promised a " contest of ideas , " now has nothing left but personal attacks .
How insulting to suggest that those who question the mission , question the troops .
How pathetic to suggest that those who question a failed policy doubt America itself .
How desperate to tell the son of a single mother who chose community service over money and privilege that he does n't put America first .
No one can question Barack Obama 's patriotism .
Like all of us , he was taught what it means to be an American by his family : his grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line in World War II , his grandfather who marched in Patton 's army , and his great uncle who enlisted in the army right out of high school at the height of the war .
And on a spring day in 1945 , he helped liberate one of the concentration camps at Buchenwald .
Ladies and gentlemen , Barack Obama 's uncle is here with us tonight .
Please join me in saluting this American hero , Charlie Payne .
Charlie , your nephew , Barack Obama , will end this politics of distortion and division .
He will be a president who seeks not to perfect the lies of Swift boating , but to end them once and for all .
This election is a chance for America to tell the merchants of fear and division : you do n't decide who loves this country ; you do n't decide who is a patriot ; you do n't decide whose service counts and whose does n't .
Four years ago I said , and I say it again tonight , that the flag does n't belong to any ideology .
It does n't belong to any political party .
It is an enduring symbol of our nation , and it belongs to all the American people .
After all , patriotism is not love of power or some cheap trick to win votes ; patriotism is love of country .
Years ago when we protested a war , people would weigh in against us saying , " My country right or wrong . "
Our answer ?
Absolutely , my country right or wrong .
When right , keep it right .
When wrong , make it right .
Sometimes loving your country demands you must tell the truth to power .
This is one of those times , and Barack Obama is telling those truths .
In closing , let me say , I will always remember how we stood together in 2004 , not just in a campaign , but for a cause .
Now again we stand together in the ranks , ready to fight .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A U.S. Coast Guard cutter will embark on an Arctic voyage this week to determine the extent of the continental shelf north of Alaska and map the ocean floor , data that could be used for oil and natural gas exploration .
U.S. and University of New Hampshire scientists on the Coast Guard Cutter Healy will leave Barrow , Alaska , on Thursday on a three - week journey .
They will create a three - dimensional map of the Arctic Ocean floor in a relatively unexplored area known as the Chukchi borderland .
The Healy will launch again on September 6 , when it will be joined by Canadian scientists aboard an icebreaker , who will help collect data to determine the thickness of sediment in the region .
That is one factor a country can use to define its extended continental shelf .
With oil at $ 114 a barrel , after hitting a record $ 147 in July , and sea ice melting fast , countries like Russia and the United States are looking north for possible energy riches .
“ These are places nobody ’s gone before , in essence , so this is a first step , ” said Margaret Hays , the director of the oceanic affairs office at the U.S. State Department .
She said the data collected may provide information to the public about future oil and natural gas sources for the United States .
This will be the fourth year that the United States has collected data to define the limits of its continental shelf in the Arctic .
Russia , which has claimed 460,000 square miles of Arctic waters , last summer planted its flag on the ocean floor of the North Pole .
Hays said the Alaskan continental shelf may lie up to 600 nautical miles from the coastline , far beyond the 200 - mile ( 322 - km ) limit where coastal countries have sovereign rights over natural resources .
The research could also shed light on other potential energy resources , like methane frozen in ice under the ocean , that Hays said might one day have some commercial interest .
Larry Mayer , a university scientist , said melting sea ice , presumably from global warming , helped last year ’s mission .
“ It was bad for the Arctic , but very very good for mapping . ”
WASHINGTON – Hoping to bring the Democratic presidential nomination fight to an end , party leaders are intensifying their efforts to encourage remaining uncommitted superdelegates to make their choice public by the middle of next week .
In an interview Thursday on a San Francisco talk radio station , Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the majority leader , said he had spoken with Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier in the day , and they had agreed to take steps to avoid a contest that extends into the convention in August .
Senator Harry Reid on KGO Senator Harry Reid on KGO
“ We all are going to urge our folks next week to make a decision very quickly , ” said Mr. Reid , on station KGO .
He said he had also spoken with party chairman Howard Dean on Wednesday night .
Mr. Reid ’s comments came after Ms. Pelosi told the editorial board of the San Francisco Chronicle on Wednesday that she would intercede in the contest if it were not concluded by the end of June to bring it to a close .
Both Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid have remained publicly neutral in the contest and have said that the primaries should run their course .
But with the last contests set for Tuesday , the two top lawmakers are evidently ready to exercise their influence with the approximately 200 members of Congress and the party elite who have yet to make their preference known publicly .
Party officials say both Mr. Reid and Ms. Pelosi are also calling uncommitted superdelegates to press them for a resolution .
Traveling in California to promote his new memoir , Mr. Reid also told an audience in Los Angeles that the nominee would be known by Wednesday .
He told others that a sufficient number of superdelegates are prepared to put Senator Barack Obama over the top quickly after Tuesday ’s voting is finished .
Both Mr. Reid and Ms. Pelosi have also said they agree that the delegates from Michigan and Florida should get some voice at the convention as well .
The Congressional leaders have said previously that the contest has been good for the party given the attention to the campaign and the registration of new voters , but Ms. Pelosi said to the newspaper .
“ We can not take this fight to the convention . ”

If you ’ve been to Yonge and Dundas in the last few days you may have noticed that a new set of street light signals have been installed that face out into the middle of the intersection .
Once the hoods are lifted in late August , these signals will be directing pedestrians across Toronto ’s first “ scramble ” intersection .
We posted about the approval of this type of intersection back in October .
Yonge and Bloor and Bay and Bloor are also supposed to be receiving similar treatment .
Below is the famous Tokyo scramble intersection at Shibuya .

Obese People are Causing Global Warming ?
Chalk this one up in the “ now I have heard it all when it comes to global warming ” column , because this time I have really heard it all .
I know I keep saying that I have heard it all , and eventually it will be true , but for now once again I say I have heard it all .
I keep saying that , but the stories get more strange and more stupid by the day , so here I go again claiming that there is nothing else that will ever surprise me when it comes to the depths that the environmental wackos will sink .
Obese people cause greater harm to the planet than skinny people .
Obese and overweight people require more fuel to transport them and the food they eat , and the problem will worsen as the population literally swells in size , a team at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine says .
And it gets better still as the obese are causing the food prices to rise , as well as the electric bill .
This adds to food shortages and higher energy prices
Non-smokers laugh every time the tobacco taxes are raised , but now the taxes are creeping into trans - fats and it wo n’t stop there .
The sin tax list will grow and grow .
Now that these scientists tell us there is a link between the obese and global warming ; look out !
Non-smokers are being targeted in more and more selected groups and they are being guilted into paying more .
If you read long and hard enough you will notice that anything and everything has been linked to man-made global warming .
And because of this more and more activities need to be regulated and taxed .
Do n’t you see what is going on here ?
They blame more and more groups , and get them to acquiesce to them in the guise of saving the planet , and the only solutions proposed require more taxes .
That is the end game to the global warming hoax , more taxes .
They are expanding their tax base through guilt one group at a time and it is time to stop the madness .
You could be next .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
If the trends of the past three decades continue , it ’s possible that every American adult could be overweight 40 years from now , a government - funded study projects .

The figure might sound alarming , or impossible , but researchers say that even if the actual rate never reaches the 100 - percent mark , any upward movement is worrying ; two - thirds of the population is already overweight .
“ Genetically and physiologically , it should be impossible ” for all U.S. adults to become overweight , said Dr. Lan Liang of the federal government ’s Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , one of the researchers on the study .
However , she told Reuters Health , the data suggest that if the trends of the past 30 years persist , “ that is the direction we ’re going . ”
Already , she and her colleagues point out , some groups of U.S. adults have extremely high rates of overweight and obesity ; among African - American women , for instance , 78 percent are currently overweight or obese .
The new projections , published in the journal Obesity , are based on government survey data collected between the 1970s and 2004 .
If the trends of those years continue , the researchers estimate that 86 percent of American adults will be overweight by 2030 , with an obesity rate of 51 percent .
By 2048 , all U.S. adults could be at least mildly overweight .
Weight problems will be most acute among African - Americans and Mexican - Americans , the study projects .
All black women could be overweight by 2034 , according to the researchers , as could more than 90 percent of Mexican - American men .
All of this rests on the “ big assumption ” that the trends of recent decades will march on unabated , Liang acknowledged .
“ This is really intended as a wake - up call to show what could happen if nothing changes , ” she said .
Waistlines are n’t the only thing poised to balloon in the future , according to Liang and her colleagues .
They estimate that the healthcare costs directly related to excess pounds will double each decade , reaching $ 957 billion in 2030 -- accounting for one of every six healthcare dollars spent in the
U.S .
Those financial projections are based on Census data and published estimates of the current healthcare costs attributed to excess weight -- and they are probably a “ huge underestimate ” of what the actual costs will be , Liang said .
The findings highlight a need for widespread efforts to improve Americans ’ lifestyles and keep their weight in check , according to the researchers .
Simply telling people to eat less and exercise more is not enough , Liang noted .
Broader social changes are needed as well , she said -- such as making communities more pedestrian - friendly so that people can walk regularly , or getting the food industry to offer healthier , calorie - conscious choices .
“ It really needs to be more than an individual effort , ” Liang said .
“ It needs to be a societal effort . ”

Claims that the explosion in text messaging among children is eroding youngsters ' literacy skills appear to be unfounded , according to research .
A study comparing the punctuation and spelling of 11 - and 12 - year - olds who use mobile phone text messaging with another group of non-texters conducting the same written tests found no significant differences between the two .
Both groups made some grammatical and spelling errors , and " text - speak " abbreviations and symbols did not find their way into the written English of youngsters used to texting .
According to the author of the research , the speech and language therapist Veenal Raval , the findings reflect children 's ability to " code switch " , or move between modes of communication - a trend familiar to parents whose offspring slip effortlessly between playground slang and visit - the - grandparents politeness .
But the study did find that the pupils familiar with text messaging wrote significantly less when asked to describe a picture or an event than those who did not use mobiles , potentially fuelling concerns that the quality and expressiveness of children 's writing could be at risk even if their spelling is not .
The study , conducted at the the department of communication and science at City University in London , comes amid growing concern in some quarters over the potentially damaging effects of new technologies on children 's ability to communicate effectively using conventional means .
According to the mobile telecoms consultancy Mobile Youth , 700,000 ( 20 % ) of primary school children own mobile phones and the under - 10s are the fastest - growing section of Britain 's mobile phone market .
The leap in the popularity of mobiles and text messaging among children and teenagers over the past five years has prompted concern that pupils ' literacy skills could suffer .
Texting puts a premium on speed and concision , leading to the creation of a host of abbreviations and acronyms incomprehensible to the untrained reader , together with symbols or " emoticons " , such as smiley faces , to express emotions .
Chief examiners ' reports on trends in public examinations have begun to note instances of texting language in exam scripts .
Some cases - includ ing a 13 - year - old Scottish pupil who wrote an entire description of her summer holidays in text - speak - have provoked concern among some teachers .
But despite widespread speculation there is little research into the potential influence of texting on children 's writing .
According to Mr Raval 's small - scale study , which focused on 20 youngsters , children have developed an ability to switch between two forms of language when texting or writing standard English .
Pupils were given a spelling test and conducted two writing exercises designed to replicate situations where they might normally text , such as describing something they had done the previous day , held in formal classroom conditions .
Mr Raval said : " The fear that has been put across in the media is that children do n't understand the need to code switch - that is , switch between standard English grammar for an exam or essay and what is acceptable when you are communicating on a social level .
In fact , they are capable of that switch , just as bi- or tri-lingual children might speak English at school and a mother or father tongue at home . "
While the text - experienced children wrote much less than those without mobiles , concision was not necessarily a bad thing , he argued .
" Whether that is a positive or negative effect is up for debate .
It depends on the situation or the subject studied .
A science exam might require brief answers which might not be appropriate in a literature exam . "
A spokesman for the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority , which oversees public examinations , said the authority was interested in the research , and believed more investigation was necessary into the effect of texting on written communication .
It was important that children could communicate in a range of ways " depending on the communication channel they were using " , he said .
A National Union of Teachers spokeswoman welcomed the research , saying abbreviation used in texting could even boost literacy skills by helping children to learn about how words divide into syllables .

REMINDER : NORML podcaster Russ Belville and I will be discussing this essay , as well as my previous blog post “ US Government Patents Medical Pot , ” later today on the NORML Daily Audio Stash .
An abbreviated version of my essay appears on Alternet.org here .
The US government ’s longstanding denial of medical marijuana research and use is an irrational and morally bankrupt public policy .
On this point , few Americans disagree .
As for the question of “ why ” federal officials maintain this inflexible and inhumane policy , well that ’s another story .
One of the more popular theories seeking to explain the Feds ’ seemingly inexplicable ban on medical pot — and the use of cannabis by adults in general — goes like this :
Neither the US government nor the pharmaceutical industry will allow for the use of medical marijuana because they can’t patent it or profit from it .
A related , yet equally common hypothesis argues : Big Pharma lobbies the federal government to keep pot illegal because it wo n’t be able to compete with patients growing their own medicine .
They ’re appealing theories , yet I ’ve found neither to be accurate nor persuasive .
Here ’s why .
First , let me state the obvious .
Big Pharma is busily applying for — and has already received — multiple patents for the medical properties of pot .
( The US government has too , but that ’s a different story all together . )
These include patents for synthetic pot derivatives ( such as the oral THC pill Marinol ) , cannabinoid agonists ( synthetic agents that bind to the brain ’s endocannabinoid receptors ) like HU - 210 and cannabis antagonists such as Rimonabant .
This trend was most recently summarized in the NIH paper , “ The endocannabinoid system as an emerging target of pharmacotherapy , ” which concluded , “ The growing interest in the underlying science has been matched by a growth in the number of cannabinoid drugs in pharmaceutical development from two in 1995 to 27 in 2004 . ”
In other words , at the same time the American Medical Association is proclaiming that pot has no established medical value , Big Pharma is in a frenzy to bring dozens of new , cannabis - based medicines to market .
Not all of these medicines will be synthetic pills either .
Most notably , GW Pharmaceutical ’s oral marijuana spray , Sativex , is a patented standardized dose of natural cannabis extracts .
( The extracts , primarily THC and the non-psychoactive , anxiolytic compound CBD , are taken directly from marijuana plants grown at an undisclosed , company warehouse . )
Does Big Pharma ’s sudden and growing interest in the research and development of pot - based medicines mean that the industry is proactively supporting marijuana prohibition ?
Not if they know what ’s good for them .
First , any and all cannabis - based medicines must be granted approval from federal regulatory bodies such as the US Food and Drug Administration — a process that remains as much based on politics as it is on scientific merit .
Chances are that a government that is unreasonably hostile toward the marijuana plant will also be unreasonably hostile toward sanctioning cannabis - based pharmaceuticals .
A recent example of this may be found in the Medicine and Health Products Regulatory Agency ’s recent denial of Sativex as a prescription drug in the United Kingdom .
( Sativex ’s parent company , GW Pharmaceuticals , is based in London . )
In recent years , British politicians have taken an atypically hard - line against the recreational use of marijuana — culminating in Prime Minister Gordon Brown ’s declaration that today ’s pot is now of “ lethal quality . ”
( Shortly thereafter , Parliament elected to stiffen criminal penalties on the possession of the drug from a verbal warning to up to five years in jail . )
In such an environment is it any wonder that British regulators have steadfastly refused to legalize a pot - based medicine , even one with an impeccable safety record like Sativex ?
Conversely , Canadian health regulators — who take a much more liberal view toward the use of natural cannabis and oversee its distribution to authorized patients — recently approved Sativex as a prescription drug .
Of course , gaining regulatory approval is only half the battle .
The real hurdle for Big Pharma is finding customers for its product .
Here again , a culture that is familiar with and educated to the use therapeutic cannabis is likely going to be far more open to the use of pot - based medicines than a population still stuck in the grip of “ Reefer Madness . ”
( For example , Marinol , despite having been approved by the FDA in 1986 , was rescheduled so that doctors might prescribe it more liberally in 1999 — three years after California and other states began approving medical marijuana use legislation .
Coincidence ?
I doubt it . )
Will those patients who already have first - hand experience with the use of medical pot switch to a cannabis - based pharmaceutical if one becomes legally available ?
Maybe not , but these individuals comprise only a fraction of the US population .
Certainly many others will — including many older patients who would never the desire to try or the access to obtain natural cannabis .
Bottom line : regardless of whether pot is legal or not , cannabis - based pharmaceuticals will no doubt have a broad appeal .
That said , many argue that the legal availability of pot would encourage patients to use fewer pharmaceuticals overall and significantly undercut Big Pharma ’s profits .
To a minor degree this may be a possibility , though likely not to an extent that adversely impacts the industry ’s bottom line .
Certainly most individuals in the Netherlands , Canada , and in California — three regions where medical pot is both legal and easily accessible on the open market — use prescription drugs , not cannabis , for their ailments .
Further , despite the availability of numerous legal healing herbs and traditional medicines such as Echinacea , Witch Hazel , and Eastern hemlock most Americans continue to turn to pharmaceutical preparations as their remedies of choice .
Should the advent of legal , alternative pot - based medicines ever warrant or justify the criminalization of patients who find superior relief from natural cannabis ?
Certainly not .
But , as the private sector continues to move forward with research into the safety and efficacy of marijuana - based pharmaceuticals , it will become harder and harder for the government and law enforcement to maintain their absurd and illogical policy of total pot prohibition .
Needless to say , were it not for advocates having worked for four decades to legalize medical cannabis , it ’s unlikely that anyone — most especially the pharmaceutical industry — would be turning their attention toward the development and marketing of cannabis - based therapeutics .
That said , I wo n’t be holding my breath waiting for any royalty checks .
So , if Big Pharma is n’t a significant player in the ongoing prohibition of the personal use of cannabis , then who is responsible ?
Based on my experience , the answer is obvious .
First and most importantly , there ’s federal government — as represented not only by the lawmakers who continue to vote in favor of America ’s Draconian drug policies , but also the numerous acronymn ladened bureaucracies ( such as the ONDCP , NIDA , etc. ) who actively lobby against any change in direction .
The second most powerful player in maintaining pot prohibition ?
That ’s easy : law enforcement , as represented by bigwigs like the US Drug Enforcement Administration and the California Narcotics Officers Association , all the way down the line to small - town police forces — all of whom consistently finance efforts to derail any relaxation of federal , state , or local marijuana policies .
The third and final primary player responsible for maintaining modern - day pot prohibition ?
Unfortunately , that would be us , the general public — a majority of whom have repeatedly voiced disapproval for legalizing the use personal use of pot by adults in both national polls and on statewide ballot initiatives , most recently in Colorado and in Nevada in 2006 .
( By contrast , more than half of Americans do support — and have consistently voted for — legislation in support of the qualified medical use of cannabis by authorized patients . )
In short , until there is a significant sea-change in the attitudes and actions of the Feds , cops , and the general public , expect prohibition — particularly the broader prohibition on the recreational use of cannabis — to continue .

Typical WTC 7 floor showing locations of columns ( numbered ) .
The buckling of Column 79 was the initiating event that led to the collapse of WTC 7 .
The buckling resulted from fire - induced damage to floors around Column 79 , failure of the girder between Columns 44 and 79 , and cascading floor failures
The fall of the 47 - story World Trade Center building 7 ( WTC 7 ) in New York City late in the afternoon of Sept. 11 , 2001 , was primarily due to fires , the Commerce Department ’s National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) announced today following an extensive , three - year scientific and technical building and fire safety investigation .
This was the first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building , the agency stated as it released for public comment its WTC investigation report and 13 recommendations for improving building and fire safety .
“ Our study found that the fires in WTC 7 , which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings , caused an extraordinary event , ” said NIST WTC Lead Investigator Shyam Sunder .
“ Heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail , initiating a fire - induced progressive collapse that brought the building down . ”
“ Video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of WTC 7 , ” Sunder said .
The NIST investigation team also determined that other elements of the building ’s construction — namely trusses , girders and cantilever overhangs that were used to transfer loads from the building superstructure to the columns of the electric substation ( over which WTC 7 was constructed ) and foundation below — did not play a significant role in the collapse .
According to the report , a key factor leading to the eventual collapse of WTC 7 was thermal expansion of long - span floor systems at temperatures “ hundreds of degrees below those typically considered in current practice for fire resistance ratings . "
WTC 7 used a structural system design in widespread use .
Citing its one new recommendation ( the other 12 are reiterated from the previously completed investigation of the World Trade Center towers , WTC 1 and 2 ) , the NIST investigation team said that “ while the partial or total collapse of a tall building due to fires is a rare event , we strongly urge building owners , operators and designers to evaluate buildings to ensure the adequate fire performance of the structural system .
Of particular concern are the effects of thermal expansion in buildings with one or more of the following features : long - span floor systems , connections not designed for thermal effects , asymmetric floor framing and / or composite floor systems . ”
Engineers , the team said , should be able to design cost - effective fixes to address any areas of concern identified by such evaluations .
The investigators also reported that if the city water main had not been cut by the collapse of World Trade Center towers 1 and 2 ( WTC 1 and WTC 2 ) , operating sprinklers in WTC 7 would likely have prevented its collapse .
“ Nevertheless , ” Sunder said , “ we recommend that building standards and codes be strengthened beyond their current intent to achieve life safety by preventing structural collapse even during severe fires like this one , when sprinklers do not function , do not exist or are overwhelmed by fire . ”
Sunder identified several existing , emerging or even anticipated capabilities that could have helped prevent WTC 7 ’s collapse .
He cautioned that the degree to which these capabilities improve performance remains to be evaluated .
Possible options for developing cost - effective fixes include :
-- More robust connections and framing systems to better resist effects of thermal expansion on the structural system .
-- Structural systems expressly designed to prevent progressive collapse , which is the spread of local damage from a single initiating event , from element to element , eventually resulting in the collapse of an entire structure or a disproportionately large part of it .
Current model building codes do not require that buildings be designed to resist progressive collapse .
-- Better thermal insulation ( i.e. , reduced conductivity and / or increased thickness ) to limit heating of structural steel and to minimize both thermal expansion and weakening effects .
Insulation has been used to protect steel strength , but it could be used to maintain a lower temperature in the steel framing to limit thermal expansion .
-- Improved compartmentation in tenant areas to limit the spread of fires .
-- Thermally resistant window assemblies to limit breakage , reduce air supply and retard fire growth .
The 12 recommendations reiterated from the WTC towers investigation address several areas , including specific improvements to building standards , codes and practices ; changes to , or the establishment of , evacuation and emergency response procedures ; and research and other appropriate actions needed to help prevent future building failures .
Determining the probable collapse sequence for WTC 7 , NIST found that the impact of debris from the collapse of WTC 1 ignited fires on at least 10 floors of WTC 7 , and the fires burned out of control on six lower floors .
The heat from these uncontrolled fires caused thermal expansion of the steel beams on the lower floors of the east side of WTC 7 , damaging the floor framing on multiple floors .
Eventually , a girder on Floor 13 lost its connection to a critical interior column that provided support for the long floor spans on the east side of the building .
The displaced girder and other local fire - induced damage caused Floor 13 to collapse , beginning a cascade of floor failures down to the fifth floor .
Many of these floors had already been at least partially weakened by the fires in the vicinity of the critical column .
This collapse of floors left the critical column unsupported over nine stories .
“ When this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports , it was the first domino in the chain , ” Sunder explained .
“ What followed in rapid succession was a progression of structural failures .
Failure first occurred all the way to the roof line — involving all three interior columns on the most eastern side of the building .
Then , progressing from east to west across WTC 7 , all of the columns in the core of the building failed .
Finally , the entire façade collapsed . ”
The investigation team considered the possibility of other factors playing a role in the collapse of WTC 7 , including the possible use of explosives , fires fed by the fuel supply tanks in and under the building , and damage from the falling debris of WTC 1 .
The team said that the smallest blast event capable of crippling the critical column would have produced a “ sound level of 130 to 140 decibels at a distance of half a mile , ” yet no noise this loud was reported by witnesses or recorded on videos .
As for fuel fires , the team found that they could not have been sustained long enough , could not have generated sufficient heat to fail a critical column , and / or would have produced “ large amounts of visible smoke ” from Floors 5 and 6 , which was not observed .
Finally , the report notes that “ while debris impact from the collapse of WTC 1 initiated fires in WTC 7 , the resulting structural damage had little effect in causing the collapse of WTC 7 . ”
The investigation team found that the design of WTC 7 was generally consistent with the New York City building code in effect at the time .
The estimated 4,000 occupants of WTC 7 on the morning of Sept. 11 were evacuated without any fatalities or serious injuries .
To reach the conclusions in its report , NIST complemented its in - house expertise with private - sector technical experts ; accumulated an extensive collection of documents , photographs and videos related to the WTC events of 9/11 ; conducted first - person interviews of WTC 7 occupants and emergency responders ; analyzed the evacuation and emergency response operations in and around WTC 7 ; and performed the most complex computer simulations ever conducted to model a building ’s response behavior and determine its collapse sequence due to a combination of debris impact damage , fires and a progression of structural failures from local fire - induced damage to collapse initiation , and , ultimately , to global collapse .

Can a 20 - year - old gaming console be the way to offer truly low - cost computing to Third World students ?
An international group of designers and graduate students believe it is , saying that they believe they can modernize a ' TV computer ' available for $ 12 on the street in India by adding Internet access and other features while keeping the price affordable .
The designers are attending the International Development Design Summit held this month at MIT , as the Boston Herald reported on Monday .
According to his blog , American graduate student Derek Lomas stumbled across the ' TV Computer ' while working in India earlier this year .
( Pictures of the system can be found online . )
The Herald and other reports interpreted Loma 's comments as meaning that the TV Computer , apparently made by a company called Victor , was an unbranded knockoff of some member of the Apple II family .
But according to pictures and a wiki partly maintained by Lomas , the ' Victor - 70 ' is an 8 - bit machine that so closely resembles the original Nintendo Entertainment System , also known as the Famicom , that it accepts its cartridges .
Better known in the U.S. as the NES or simply the Nintendo , the Famicom trailed popular gaming consoles such as the Atari 2600 and the Mattel Intellivision .
Technically advanced for the time , the Famicom came with a 1.78 MHz 8 - bit processor , 2 K of video memory , and the ability to display 256x240 pixels in 25 colors .
Released in the United States and elsewhere in 1985 , more than 62 million Famicoms were sold worldwide , a record at that time .
They remained popular until the early 1990s in the U.S. and even longer elsewhere .
The Famicom 's popularity led to a large number of knockoffs such as the Victor - 70 over the years , machines that were often unlicensed and built in China , according to Lomas ' pictures and blog .
" A lot of the Srishti Design students who saw me playing with this used to have one themselves , several years ago .
Back then , this cost nearly [ $ 75 ] , " Lomas wrote on his blog .
Coincidentally , MIT is where the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) effort , a separate endeavor to bring low - cost computers to Third World students , was also started .
Unlike the Famicom , which came in a grey plastic console , The Victor - 70's processor , memory and other internal hardware are all contained in its keyboard , which connects to a television instead of a dedicated monitor .
It comes with game controllers as well as a mouse .
The Victor - 70 and other models are available from online retailers in India , though starting at the slightly higher price of $ 23.99 each .
Though the Victor appears to be an unlicensed clone of the Famicom , Lomas notes that that may not matter , given the 20 - year duration of U.S. patents .
The Victor would also come with wide software ecosystem courtesy of the Famicom , including a version of the Basic programming language , wrote Lomas .
Moreover , the fact that the Victors plug into a TV makes computing both more social and more affordable , since half of Indian households own televisions .
Lomas also has a picture of a $ 15 laptop sold in India that appears to use a primitive black - and - white LCD screen and also purports to be an educational computer .

Amy Winehouse plans to appeal against her cannabis fine
The singer was fined for cannabis possession in Norway last year .
A spokesman for the troubled star said she was " disappointed " , but had " accepted the ruling and will be concentrating on her recovery " .
Winehouse has been nominated for six Grammy Awards ahead of the ceremony in Los Angeles on Sunday .
They include the major prizes of record , album and song of the year .
AMY WINEHOUSE IN THE US Nominated for six Grammy Awards Sold 1.5 million copies of her album Back To Black Album reached number six in Billboard charts Cancelled North American tour last August Also cancelled appearance at MTV Music Video Awards 2007
A statement from her management company did not say why her application was turned down .
The US Embassy in London and the State Department in Washington also declined to comment .
BBC entertainment reporter Colin Paterson said : " The blow to Amy Winehouse is that this was going to be one of the highlights of her whole career .
" She was going to be on the same bill as Aretha Franklin , Tina Turner , Jerry Lee Lewis , Little Richard , Herbie Hancock - all - time greats .
" The Grammys was the carrot her family and record company used as a way to persuade her to get into rehab .
Now they 're going to have to find another way to motivate her . "
Beyonce will duet with Tina Turner at this year 's ceremony
And she is planning to appeal against the cannabis fine in a Norwegian court later this month .
Winehouse called off a series of concerts and appearances at the end of last year after reportedly being treated for drug addiction .
Back To Black was the biggest - selling album of 2007 in the UK after shifting more than 1.85 million copies .
The Grammys is the most prestigious award event in the music industry 's calendar .
This year , Tina Turner and Beyonce will perform a duet and Andrea Bocelli , Josh Groban , Fergie and Alicia Keys are among the other performers .
Award presenters include Stevie Wonder , Prince , Tony Bennett , Nelly Furtado , Ringo Starr and Tom Hanks .
A Superior Court Judge in Fulton County , Georgia has ruled that construction of Dynegy ’s Longleaf plant be halted until it is assured the plant will limit the amount of carbon dioxide it releases .
The original permit would have allowed the plant to emit 9 million tons of carbon dioxide annually , something the court said was unreasonable .
The court cited the Supreme Court ’s 2007 ruling recognizing that carbon dioxide is a pollutant under the federal Clean Air Act .
It ’s the first time any court has applied the ruling to an industrial source .
Commenting on the ruling , Bruce Nilles , director of the Sierra Club ’s National Coal Campaign said :
“ Coal - fired power plants emit more than 30 % of our nation ’s global warming pollution .
Thanks to this decision , coal plants across the country will be forced to live up to their clean coal rhetoric . ”
Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius rejected construction of a new coal plant in that state , saying global warming is a public health threat .
It is n’t known yet whether Dynegy , the largest coal plant developer in the country , will fight the ruling .
Dynegy has more new coal plants planned in the country than any other developer .

After years of being criticised for the dire nature of its online video content , Downing Street has just come up with something that 's really – pretty good .
It 's a response to an e-petition .
In April the website received a petition calling for Jeremy Clarkson to be made prime minister ( citing , as a reason , " Jezza is a legend " , which I suppose is true ) .
Downing Street always posts responses to petitions and normally the replies to the jokey ones are pretty terse .
But last night , in response to the Clarkson request , it put up this .
Okay , it 's not quite Jon Stewart and the Daily Show .
But I thought it hit the right note .
It 's already had 40,000 hits and at LabourHome someone has praised it as " Gordon Brown 's first truly viral video " .
But if Downing Street thought they would get any credit for this from their critics , they 're in for a disappointment .
In the Daily Mail today , Mark Wallace from the TaxPayers '
Alliance is whingeing about the video being a waste of public money .
In the rightwing blogosphere , Dizzy Thinks has posted a response which is just as joyless .
And Guido Fawkes also put up the video under a " Your taxes at work " headline " , although , to be fair , he did make the point that more people voted for Clarkson to be PM ( 49,447 people put their name to the petition ) than have voted for Brown .
For the record , Downing Street tells me the video " did n't really cost anything at all " .
A spokesman said : " It was done by our web team who had a spare half an hour over the summer .
It was quite a light - hearted petition and we thought it deserved a light - hearted response . "

( My father owns an auto shop where I sometimes work part time .
Late one afternoon , a woman comes in . )
Me : “ May I help you ? ”
Customer : “ Yes .
I need my car inspected . ”
Me : “ Well , we ’re not taking any more inspections this afternoon .
May I schedule you for tomorrow ? ”
Customer : “ No , I want my car inspected now . ”
Me : “ I ’m sorry , but we take in our last inspection at 4:00 so we have time to pack up and shut down the machine . ”
Customer : “ Yes , but I just bought my car from [ Dealer ] and they told me I could bring my car here to get inspected for free . ”
Me : “ Yes , they will pay for your inspection here , but we ’re closing soon .
I ’d be happy to schedule you an appointment for another day . ”
Customer : “ No !
This is an outrage !
At [ Dealer ] they told me I could bring in my car ANY TIME to be inspected here ! ”
Me : “ Um … well … ”
Customer : “ I want my car inspected RIGHT NOW .
They told me I could have it inspected any time ! ”

According to the wireless security researchers at AirTight Networks , this Saturday , August 9th at 4:30 PM in the Riviera Las Vegas , they will be sharing with DEFCON 16 their findings about self destructive behavior spotted in select open source and commercial wireless LAN Access Points .
Below is a sneak peek at what the presentation will cover , in AirTight 's own words :
An autoimmune disorder is a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue .
This presentation is about discovery of autoimmunity disorder in select open source and commercial 802.11 AP implementations .
By sending specially crafted packets , it is possible to trigger autoimmunity disorder and cause AP to turn hostile against its own clients .
Eight examples of autoimmune disorder will be demonstrated .
Autoimmunity disorder can be exploited to craft new DoS attacks .
Although 802.11w promises immunity from DoS attacks , we show that autoimmunity disorder leaves a door open through which DoS attacks can still be launched .
One example of DoS attack against MFP ( 11w ) will be demonstrated .
Similarities between biological systems and security systems have been known for years .
Both systems are known to possess some degree of attack resistance ( self defense ) capability .
An autoimmune disorder is a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly starts attacking and destroying healthy body cells .
This suicidal tendency is known to exist in biological systems .
We spotted similar self destructive behavior in WLAN Systems .
An attacker only needs to inject a stimulus to trigger self destructive behavior .
The rest of the damage is inflicted by the AP upon its own clients .
During the presentation we ’ll show an example stimulus packet which will cause a select set of WLAN APs to turn against their own clients .
This attack exploits implementation bugs ( not protocol flaws ) in select open source and commercial WLAN APs .
We ’ll demonstrate eight additional examples .
These attacks do not make WLANs any more vulnerable than they already are – except that they cause destruction by triggering suicidal tendencies imbedded in faulty software code of WLAN APs .
Cisco ’s self defending WLAN network implement Management Frame Protection ( MFP ) .
MFP capability is supposed to make Cisco WLAN networks attack resistant .
We ’ll show an example stimulus packet which will turn a Cisco self defending WLAN AP into a self destructing WLAN AP !
Security software is very hard to get right until extreme care is taken in designing and coding it correctly .

Nader : Obama supporters are in ' political slavery ' Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday July 28 , 2008
Print This Email This During a Sunday press conference and campaign rally attended by RAW STORY , Independent Presidential Candidate Ralph Nader claimed that liberals and Democrats who will vote for Sen.
Barack Obama as the " least worst candidate " are actually trapped in " political slavery . "
At the campaign stop in Austin , Texas , Nader spoke to an audience of approximately 200 about his campaign 's primary issues in the 2008 presidential election .
During the press conference -- held in a sweltering classroom at the back of a small , suburban Methodist church -- Nader also directly addressed an elderly white woman as a " political bigot . "
" What is your answer to people , including myself , who believe that the votes you get will take away from the Democratic party and ensure McCain wins ? " asked the woman during Nader 's Q&A with the press .
" People who say that a vote for you is a vote for McCain . "
Nader grew tense , and his response to the woman was abrupt .
" Madam , do you think I 'm a second - class citizen ? " he asked .
" I 'd like for you to answer my question , " said the woman .
" No , because that question implies that somehow I am less equal in running for election than two crooked politicians in Washington , " he said .
" You are a political bigot , wittingly or unwittingly . "
It was during his speech , and after the press conference , that Nader said progressives who will vote for Obama as the " least worst candidate " are actually trapped in " political slavery . "
In June , Nader drew criticism for commenting that Sen. Obama is trying to " talk white , " adding in a filmed interview that his candidacy was appealing to " white guilt . "
" I have n't heard him have a strong crackdown on economic exploitation in the ghettos , " said Nader of Obama .
" Payday loans , predatory lending , asbestos , lead .
What 's keeping him from doing that ?
Is it because he wants to talk white ?
He does n't want to appear like Jesse Jackson ? "
He continued : " He wants to appeal to white guilt .
You appeal to white guilt not by coming on as black is beautiful , black is powerful .
Basically , he 's coming on as someone who is not going to threaten the white power structure , whether it 's corporate or whether it 's simply oligarchic .
And they love it .
Whites just eat it up . "
" Put bluntly , because he 's black he must be by definition in Nader 's eyes an inherent rebel or at the very least actively challenge the white corporate and political establishment , " wrote Alternet 's Earl Hutchison .
" But that assumes that blacks are instinctive rebels because of their color .
Earth to Nader on this one ; the likes of blacks from Clarence Thomas to Colin Powell should have long since dispelled that myth .
Yet , to even think that blacks should be open racial crusaders is crass , cynical , and even borderline racist . "
" Progressives have a hard enough time convincing communities of color that we 're on their side without arrogant old white guys talking down to them and the nation 's first black presidential candidate , " commented Steven T. Jones , writing for the San Francisco Bay Guardian .
Responding to Nader 's comments , Obama chided the independent candidate for not paying attention to his speeches .
" All the issues that he talked about , whether its predatory lending , or the housing foreclosure crisis or what have you , or issues that the traveling press can tell you , I 've devoted multiple speeches , town hall meetings to , throughout this campaign , " said Obama .
" At this point , he 's someone who 's trying to get attention , and whose campaign has n't gotten any traction .
It is what it is . "
A recent NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll found Nader 's candidacy drawing 5 percent support nationally .

I honestly see no problem with spending a measly 1 million dollars a year ( we spend a couple billion a month in Iraq ) on promoting Bicycle Riding .
This Jerk Idiot Republican representative from North Carolina would rather we burn more coal .
Here they are again bashing the bicycle … this time in print .
As Democrats yesterday encouraged people to ride their bicycles to work today as a solution to rising gas prices , Republicans had this to say : â€ œYouâ €™ve got to be kidding .â€ 
While more than 20,000 commuters throughout Denver metro today plan to ditch the car and participate in Bike to Work Day , some Republicans said cycling falls short of any real energy solutions .
â€ œColorado families are struggling at the pump and the answer we are getting from Colorado Democrats is shut down oil and gas production in Colorado and ride your bike â€ ” unbelievable , â€ said Rep. Frank McNulty , R- Highlands Ranch .
â€ œIâ€™d like to see how they expect a mother of three in my district to get her kids to school and to buy groceries for her family using a bicycle.â€ ( via )
I mean why do these people hate the two wheeled wonder that is the bicycle so much ?
I just do n’t get it ?
Russia 's former president , Vladimir Putin , has presided over a resurgence in his country 's economic and military might , largely thanks to a booming oil sector .
(( Mikhail Klimentyev / Associated Press / Presidential Press Service ) ) Russia is back .
Flush with petro-rubles and one year into a huge rearmament program , the world 's largest country is flexing its muscles .
Georgia , Ukraine and perhaps even Poland know this only too well .
And it 's not just the military .
While the West slumps , the Russian economy leaps ahead at seven per cent a year .
Moscow has more billionaires than any other city on Earth .
Just 10 years after a financial implosion that drove the country into near - bankruptcy , today 's Russia has all the glitz and confidence of a nouveau - riche entrepreneur - on - the - make .
In European capitals and Washington , there are fears of a new Cold War , or worse .
After all , Russia still has nuclear missiles pointed west , and plenty of them .
The bear and the new world
The growling of the Russian bear is resounding through what the first President George Bush once called " the new world order , " the post - Communist scenario where democracy , capitalism and liberal social values were supposed to predominate .
It 's a scary thought , but maybe , just maybe , not as bad as the worst - case scenarios suggest .
For starters , those who help shape American foreign - policy thinking say today 's Russia is n't yesterday 's Soviet Union .
" I do not think it is accurate or useful to see this in terms of a new Cold War , " says Strobe Talbott of the Brookings Institution in Washington .
" The cold war had very specific characteristics .
It was a global geopolitical , ideological contest or struggle between two armed camps and we know what they were .
" This is a new phenomenon , although it derives a lot from history . "
That history is recent — bitter memories of humiliation after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 when Russia 's economy shrank alarmingly and its voice was ignored by a triumphant West .
Modern - day Russian soldiers in Second World War uniforms ride through Red Square in November 2006 in an enactment of the call - up to fight off Hitler 's advancing army .
(( Sergey Poromarev / Associated Press ) )
There 's also the legacy of Russian Imperialism in the 1900s when the Czars projected their country as a military , economic and cultural behemoth like Britain , France or Germany .
The wars and geo-politics of the 20th century hit Russians hard .
World wars killed tens of millions of soldiers and civilians ; Communism promised much but delivered little .
It was a wounded , humiliated Russian bear that staggered into the current century .
But many commentators warn against easy analogies , quick conclusions .
This is a country , they say , where things are often not as they seem .
Remember the Potemkin village
" Russia was never as weak as it seemed , nor as strong , " says Aurel Braun of the University of Toronto , " It 's a country that 's very good at stage management .
There are centuries of experience .
Do n't forget , the Potemkin village is a Russian invention . "
Braun is referring to the fake facades of thriving villages built along the route taken through the Crimea by Catherine the Great during an 18th century royal tour .
They were supposed to fool the Empress into believing that her kingdom was full of happy , loyal , prosperous subjects .
Through bellicose rhetoric and the bullying of neighbours like Georgia , Russia — Braun believes — is trying to make the West believe it 's stronger , richer and more confident than it actually is .
" This is a vast entity with oil wealth and nuclear weapons , " he says , " but it 's also a place with a per capita incomes that are well behind other industrialized states , and a place with a catastrophically shrinking population that will be a real problem in the years ahead . "
Braun is referring to the fact that more Russians die every year than are born , or settle in the country from abroad .
The average annual per capita income in Russia is around $ 15,000 , behind even poorer European countries like Portugal or the Czech Republic .
Oil wealth does n't trickle down particularly fast .
Georgians with their eyes covered sit atop a Russian armored personnel carrier while being detained by Russian troops in the Black Sea port city of Poti , western Georgia , in August 2008 .
( ( Bela Szandelszky / Associated Press ) )
Another explanation for Moscow 's furious response to the Georgian situation can be found in a new pipeline being built between the Caspian Sea and Turkey , argues BusinessWeek magazine 's Steve Levine , a long - time Central Asia hand .
The politics of pipelines
The pipeline passes through Georgia and bypasses Russia completely , Levine told CBC's The Current .
" Russia has opposed these pipelines from the beginning , " he says , " They reduce Russian influence in what are in effect former colonies .
By bombing Georgia , and sometimes near the pipeline , Moscow is sending [ the U.S. ] a message : you do n't control this region . "
The old Soviet Union had direct authority over most of Central Asia and the countries around the Caspian Sea .
Russia 's invasion of Georgia , Levine believes , is a message to local leaders to keep Moscow in mind at all time when they 're signing big petroleum deals with Western multinationals .
So how to respond to Russia 's muscle flexing in the neighbourhood it once controlled , and yearns to dominate again ?
The United States and Europe , through NATO , have condemned Moscow 's military aggression but done little else .
A military alliance designed to thwart a Soviet invasion of Western Europe can seemingly do little to stop a relatively small number of Russian troops from menacing a tiny neighbour .
Again , says Strobe Talbott , the answer lies in what Russia has become , not what it was .
This is a country that yearns to be accepted in the West , whatever posturing it does .
Diplomacy , not tanks
" Russia [ does n't ] want to go back to a system where they 're squared off against the rest of the world and have a different system of government and economics , " Talbott says , " What they do want to do is rejoin the world on their terms and on the basis of their strength , some of which they are demonstrating now in the Caucasus . "
In other words , Moscow needs to be told that it will be taken far more seriously as a global power if it uses diplomacy and trade to get it what it wants , not tanks and missiles .
That 's all fine , says Aurel Braun , if you 're dealing with a government that is n't corrupt , authoritarian already , and rich with oil wealth .
The challenge of Russia resurgent , he says , is a little more complex .
" We need to be balanced , respectful of Russian nationalism , of course we do , " he says , " but if Russia discovers that this whole Georgian exercise has been cost - free , then we 'll have made one huge miscalculation .
I 'm very skeptical that this is a regime that will start behaving responsibly anytime soon . "
Domestic discontent and demographics may have more impact on Moscow in the long term than Western diplomacy and disapproval , Braun says , and that may be too long to wait .

Two researchers at UCLA , Martin Roberts and David B.N. Lee , have designed a peritoneal , wearable kidney that could replace the failing organs of a patient .
The automated , wearable artificial kidney ( AWAK ) functions continuously , instead of having to spend hours on a machine which is typically four hours at a time , three times a week .
The AWAK also regenerates and reuses the fluids and proteins contained in the dialysate which reduces protein loss and eliminates water loss .
It is " bloodless " , which means that it does not involve blood circulation outside the body .
AWAK is being called " dialysis - on - the - go " because of its wearability and automation .
Around 1980 , an artificial kidney machine was built , but the machine was portable , not wearable .
This new technology would allow patients to go about their daily lives while on dialysis .
Martin Roberts , one of the researchers developing the AWAK , says , " What 's really new about it is the patient 's freedom .
To me , as the inventor , the most important thing for the patients is their freedom .
The next important thing is that because it 's working all the time instead of intermittently , you can do a much better job of treating the patient .
So we expect the patient to feel better and live longer . "
This study is published in the Clinical and Experimental Nephrology Journal .
" Dialysis - on - the - go , made possible by AWAK 's ‘ wearability ' and automation , frees end - stage renal failure patients from the servitude that is demanded by the current dialytic regimentations , " Roberts and Lee write in the journal article .

Physicists assume that the laws they discover on Earth hold true throughout the universe and throughout all time .
Their faith is only as good as the facts that support it .
That support now is a little stronger .
New data show that a mathematical constant that ’s fundamental to our understanding of particle physics remains the same on Earth today as it did half way across the universe and billions of years ago .
And an unusual object 1,700 light - years away has verified Einstein ’s general relativity theory of gravity with a type of measurement never made before .
Atoms are made up partly of protons and electrons .
The ratio of a proton ’s mass to that of an electron is one of the bedrock constants underpinning our standard theory of particle physics .
If this – or any other fundamental constant – varied from place to place , it would make a hash of that theory .
Hence the ongoing quest to test those constants ’ universality .
Michael Murphy at Australia ’s Swinburne University of Technology and his colleagues found a new opportunity to explore this idea : radio emissions from the energetic galaxy BO218+367 some 6 billion light - years from us .
The emissions passed through ammonia clouds in a neighboring galaxy .
They observed how the ammonia absorbed certain wavelengths in the radio emission spectrum to examine the proton - electron mass ratio of the material that emitted the radio waves in the first place .
The ratio checks out at approximately 1836.15 , just as it does in earthly labs .
“ We have been able to show that the laws of physics are the same in this galaxy [ BO218+367 ] half way across the visible universe as they are here on Earth , ” Dr. Murphy said .
Technical details of this research were published last month in Science .
Last Friday , the journal carried details of a new test of Einstein ’s 93 - year - old gravity theory , the other main pillar of modern physics .
About 1,700 light - years from Earth , two very dense rotating dead stars provided the test as they orbit each other .
They are separated by only about twice the distance between Earth and the Moon .
Einstein ’s general relativity theory predicts that two massive objects in such a tight orbit should affect each other ’s rotation in a specific way .
Victoria Kaspi , the research group ’s leader at Canada ’s McGill University , calls this setup “ the kind of extreme ‘ cosmic laboratory ’ needed to test Einstein ’s prediction . ”
Rene Breton , lead author on the research paper , notes that this is the only known case where two stars of this type orbit each other .
Moreover , one star repeatedly eclipses the other as seen from Earth .
“ Those eclipses are the key to making a measurement that could never be done before , ” Mr. Breton says .
It ’s a perspective that allows the interaction of the two stars to be seen .
The measurements verified the prediction of Einstein ’s theory .
However , Breton warns , “ It ’s not quite right to say that we have now proven general relativity . ”
For now , the physicists ’ faith in the universality of their standard particle physics theory and of general relativity is upheld .
They will continue to seek such confirmation .
Some will seek it in laboratories such as the new high - energy particle accelerator in Geneva .
Others will look to what happened long ago in galaxies far away .
True to his benefactorâ€™s wishes , Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies Chairman Anatol Sharansky today endorsed John McCain for president , calling Sen .
Obama a â€œriskâ€ for Israel .
Sharansky , an old pal of Richard Perleâ€™s as well as a beneficiary of multi-billionaire Sheldon Adelson , made his endorsement during an interview on Shalom TV , a Jewish - American cable network .
â€
œIn the case of McCain , we know exactly where his policy is , â€ said Sharansky .
â€ œI know , personally , McCain for 20 years .
He is a person of principle , and he is also a person who has absolutely a great record of supporting Israel .
Getting to Obama , there is no record .
Nobody can know for sure what will be .
It can happen to be good .
It can happen to be very bad .
Itâ€™s a risk.â€ 
( In addition to his Institute at Jerusalemâ€™s Shalem Center , Adelson , of course , is the major funder of Freedomâ€™s Watch and is himself the beneficiary ( although I imagine he pays handsomely ) of Karl Roveâ€™s political advice , according to a recent account by the National Journal .
An intriguing report from Adelsonâ€™s Las Vegas headquarters suggests that he may be having some problem with his Macau interests . )
Sharanskyâ€™s intervention comes in the wake of warnings several days ago on the reliably Likudnik Wall Street Journalâ€™s editorial page by two other Adelson beneficiaries and Institute officials , Michael Oren and Yossi Klein Halevy , against any attempt by outgoing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to continue pursuing peace negotiations with the Palestinian Authority or with Syria before he leaves office .
â€ œMembers of Mr. Olmertâ€™s party , Kadima , and of the governing coalition need to ensure that all substantive negotiations with Arab leaders are suspended until a new prime minister assumes office , â€ they argue .
â€ œAllowing Mr. Olmert to negotiate over life - and - death issues means continuing to hold Israel hostage to his political maneuvers.â€ 

The combination of using the SPARC - optimized Ruby and eliminating the huge sort shaved over four hours off the implementation time , but the results are still horrible : 25:24:41 elapsed time , with zero use of parallelism .

Ian GILMARTIN & Robert CATTLEY Mini Water
Wheel
http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/77788.html
1 January 2007
" Free Electricity "
It is a mechanical problem that has troubled scientists since the ancient Greeks .
Now a Scottish electrician has invented a small water wheel that could save thousands of pounds in energy bills .
Ian Gilmartin , 60 , who has no mains electricity , is generating power from the stream in his garden .
He and friend Bob Cattley , 58 , have invented a mini water wheel capable of supplying enough electricity to power a house , with no running costs and zero carbon emissions .
The contraption is the first off - the - shelf water wheel system which can generate a good supply of electricity from a waterfall as little as 20 cm in height .
It is designed to be used in small rivers or streams , making it ideal for potentially thousands of homes across Britain .
Mr Gilmartin , an electrician and inventor born and raised in the village of Springfield , near Cupar , Fife , was not prompted to think up his device by high energy bills - he does not own a TV and has never lived in a house with electricity .
But he has a stream at the back of his house near Staveley , in Cumbria , and with the help of PhD engineering student Mr Cattley , now hopes to see the invention in the shops by the end of next year .
Mr Gilmartin , who lived in Linwood before moving to Cumbria in the late - 1960s , began experimenting three years ago with yoghurt pots , toilet rolls and wheelie bins in the stream , before test - running a prototype .
He took the results to the Lake District National Park , and secured a £ 15,000 grant from the organisation 's sustainability fund .
The prototype has been working successfully at St Catherine 's , a National Trust site near Windermere , opening up previously untapped energy .
The water wheel produces one to two kilowatts of power and generates at least 24 kilowatt hours of sustainable green energy in a day , just less than the average household 's daily consumption of around 28 kilowatt hours .
It should cost around £ 2000 to install , and will pay for itself inside two years .
The Beck Mickle low head micro hydro generator could potentially provide electricity to more than 50,000 British homes and could be used industrially .
The inventors predict a series of them linked on the same river course could create enough electricity to power a small town or large hospital .
Mr Gilmartin said he came up with the idea after giving up work to look after his son , who had epilepsy .
" There was nothing available on the market to recover any sensible amount of energy from low ( pressure ) heads , so in wanting something to think about at the time , I thought of the idea of having revolving buckets to recover energy .
" While we cannot say this provides free electricity , because of the initial cost of buying the machine , it is expected to pay for itself within two years and then greatly reduce the owner 's electricity bills after then .
Because what we are doing is cheap to make , the pay - back is very quick . "

Yoghurt Pot Generator Could Revolutionise Energy Production
A revolutionary new invention that uses yoghurt pot plastic to generate electricity could be a significant new step towards increasing the UK 's reliance on renewables .
The Beck Mickle Hydro project uses the plastic device to generate electricity from shallow waters such as rivers and streams to a depth of just 20 cm .
" We could be looking at significant changes to power production , " explained the inventor of the device , Ian Gilmartin .
" We want to generate energy from water between 20 cm and two metres deep .
No one else has attempted anything like this in such shallow water . "
Mr Gilmartin hopes that the invention , currently being developed at Lancaster University , will translate into a device that could generate enough electricity to power a house .
Homeowners could then buy the machine for around £ 1,000 to achieve their own renewable microgeneration .
The device could also reportedly be used to provide drinking water and in air conditioning .
The project has received funding from the Lake District National Park Authority 's sustainable development fund .
It is believed the device , once developed , could be used in up to 100,000 sites across the UK .
http://www.beck-mickle-hydro.co.uk/index.php?id=bmh_lancs_uni
Beck Mickle Hydro Ltd in Partnership with Lancaster University .
Local inventor and electrician lan Gilmartin has redesigned the water wheel for the 21st century to provide renewable inexpensive electricity from even tiny streams without harming fish or contributing to global warming .
This unique patented technology makes use of recycled plastic and can even provide power from becks that are no more than a trickle .
It is envisaged units that are scalable will be sold as white goods that can easily be approved and installed before simply being plugged in .
Following a referral from Business Link Cumbria , lan has been working with the Enterprise and Business Partnerships ( EBP ) Team of Lancaster University 's Environment Centre to assess the environmental impact of this technology , identify its market potential and strengthen its patent protection .
The environmental impact assessment focused on the use of food - grade recycled plastics within the water wheel , to support a possible demonstration at the National Trust 's St Catherine 's site in Winder - mere .
This was contracted out to CookPrior Associates Ltd , a local consultancy experienced in such assessments , which identified a low risk of any organic chemicals leaching from the plastics to be used , but recommended a series of leaching trials to ensure that no unforeseen problems arose .
Through a variety of literature searches , internet searches and personal contacts with organisations such as the : NERC , Environment Agency and Land Registry , the EBP team have identified several reports providing information on potential sites for low - head hydro generation and the proportion of the UK meeting minimum gradient and flow requirements .
However , further work remains to be done , in particular the development of a comprehensive business plan to successfully attract investors .
Therefore , a team of four MBA students undertaking a business planning module in the University 's Management School , have been recruited .
The team have enthusiastically accepted the challenge of pulling together the market information so far obtained and producing a first draft business plan for delivery in mid December .
During the business planning project , EBP have continued to investigate a means of actively identifying potential customers , rather than relying solely on passive internet - based advertising .
This has now led to discussions with the University 's Geography
Department regarding the possible development of an automated system for analysing 1 in 10,000 scale maps and providing the postcodes of potential customers for use in targeted mail shots , possibly along with their electricity bills .
EBP are also working closely with lan using the group 's patent and intellectual property experience , to strengthen Beck Mickle Hydro 's patent position and ensure appropriate confidentiality agreements are in place across their numerous contacts .
Beck Mickle Hydro have also been working closely with the Lancaster University Renewable Energy Group ( LUREG ) to evaluate their technology against siphon technology LUREG are developing as an alternative means of low - head hydroelectric generation .
LUREG , which has significant expertise in low head hydroelectric generation in both tidal and non-tidal environments have adopted lan 's technology and are working closely with him to establish a number of demonstration sites for both technologies .
The EBP team with the financial support of the NorthWest Development Agency and Higher Education Innovation Fund helps companies across the NorthWest to access the environmental and science expertise of Lancaster University .
This is accomplished via company visits to identify areas where assistance would be beneficial , small pieces of free consultancy , technical and business based student projects and facilitating the formation of affinity groups between companies to resolve common issues through collaborative research partnerships .
The EBP team also serve as the prime contact for the Lancaster Environment Centre , which is the largest of its kind in Europe and brings people together from across the university together with the NERC's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology .
JERUSALEM , June 15 ( Reuters ) - Israel has tightened rules for Palestinian staff of the United Nations who travel in and out of the occupied West Bank , increasing tensions with the world body , internal U.N. emails and aid workers said on Sunday .
The Israeli army informed U.N. officials in Jerusalem that Palestinians using the main checkpoint for the West Bank city of Ramallah were required to cross on foot through a terminal for inspection rather than drive through in their U.N. vehicles , a U.N. email said .
The message , sent to employees last week and obtained by Reuters on Sunday , directed Palestinian staff members to use another crossing .
U.N. Palestinian staff have also been asked at three checkpoints to sign a form used by police in conducting searches and making arrests .
Another internal U.N. email told staff not to sign the form .
Israeli officials had no immediate comment .
An aid worker said the tightened restrictions had " ratcheted up tensions between Israel and the NGO ( non-governmental organisation ) community " .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who is visiting Israel and the West Bank this week , criticised Israel for not doing enough to ease restrictions on Palestinians in the West Bank .
Several thousand Palestinians work for U.N. agencies in the West Bank .
Thousands more work in the Hamas - controlled Gaza Strip .

Methodology
The bar - charts are prepared from the BERR forecast shown below ( slide 57 of the presentation ) .
United Kingdom continental shelf ( UKCS ) production of oil and natural gas are forecast to continue their decline from their respective production peaks in 1999 and 2000 .
The decline rate is not given , but it appears to be around 8 % which seems about right .
Chart modified from slide 57 of the BERR presentation .
Click on chart to enlarge .
Historic oil prices shown on this chart are the annual average for Brent Blend taken from the BP statistical review of World Energy 2008 .
This year to date ( YTD ) is about $ 110 and the forecast uses an annual rate of increase of oil and gas prices of 25 % per annum .
It is of course near impossible to forecast future oil and gas prices , but with international demand for oil and gas continuing to rise against near static supply , the trend of increasing prices seen in recent years seems set to continue .
BERR forecasts consumption of oil and gas to remain relatively flat .
This seems a reasonable first order assumption to make .
However , in the real world , escalating fuel and domestic energy costs will lead to widespread conservation .
The well - off will insulate their homes and buy more fuel efficient cars .
The poor will switch off their heating and take the bus .
It is near impossible to forecast the scale of energy demand destruction that will take place in the UK .
Oil and gas are assumed to have equivalent price .
Millions of tonnes of oil equivalent are converted to millions of barrels by multiplying by 7.33 .
From riches to rags
The bar chart up top indicates the cost of importing oil and gas to the UK ballooning to about $ 200 billion ( £ 100 billion ) per annum by 2013 - just 5 years away .
This completely dwarfs the riches of North Sea oil and gas production the UK enjoyed up to 2004 , which were exported at rock bottom energy prices .
The chart is indicative since it is unlikely that this will ever come to pass .
It is unlikely that the UK will be able to source or pay for this ever rising energy bill on the international markets .
Left to market forces , the problem will be solved by spreading energy poverty throughout the UK population .
The wealthy who can afford the small amount of expensive energy on offer will be fine whilst the poor will just have to go without - personal transport , heat , light and power .
The charts below show the gross cumulative and per capita cumulative surplus / deficit from 1998 which is when the BERR chart begins , which coincides roughly with when the New Labour government ( Blair - Brown ) came to power .
We are currently at the fulcrum of surplus turning to deficit .
By 2013 , the UK may well run up a cumulative deficit in oil and gas imports in excess of $ 500 billion - if we can find countries that will sell us oil and gas on credit .
This equates to an energy debt over $ 8000 for every man , woman and child in 5 short years .
This is in addition to the already dreadful debts we have run up as a country importing consumer goods on credit ( see below ) .
Mervyn King , Governor of the " independent " Bank of England ; -)
Gordon Brown , the most confused man in the world ?
On his way to Saudi Arabia to beg for more oil to combat global warming whilst promising a green energy revolution at home founded on nuclear power .
Population data from The United Nations .
A state of emergency
We should hopefully by now have reached a point where all stake holders in UK , European and Global energy are able to grasp the simple fact that we are now in the early stages of a full blown global energy crisis .
The focus is currently on oil but this will soon turn to concerns over natural gas and coal supplies .
This crisis has been turned into a state of emergency by the indifference of political leaders in the UK ( and throughout the world ) , fluttering in the wind of poorly informed public opinion while they have prevaricated about expanding renewable energy resources and building new nuclear power stations .
All warnings of this pending energy crisis have been ignored in favor of pursuing popular policies that created the illusion of prosperity whilst the fundamentals of our nations security and well being have been draining away .
The chart below shows the current state of the UK trade balance .
This is the position at the end of the good times North Sea oil and gas have provided .
The situation now is about to get a whole lot worse as our energy surplus turns into a crippling deficit with no plan on the horizon of returning the books to balance .
Data from National Statistics Online , table 5050646091.csv , column ikbj .
I have not attempted a forecast since some major changes to UK trading status are to be expected .
Higher food , fuel , domestic energy and bank interest bills will squeeze the disposable income of many individuals and families .
Thus , instead of buying consumer goods and going to Spain on vacation , families will instead spend this money on food and energy .
Thus we can expect the deficit in goods and tourism to reduce while the deficit in energy balloons .
The future
The exchange last week between Mervyn King ( Governor of the Bank of England ) and Alistair Darling ( Chancellor of the Exchequer ) suggests that they plan to do nothing about this presuming that the upwards tick in energy and food prices ( that began in 2002 ) will drop out of the annual inflation statistics a year from now .
True rabbits caught in the headlights .
They have created a perilous situation for the UK economy that they seem not to understand let alone know how to fix .
Here are a few pointers to what I think we can expect in the next 18 months :
Forever rising energy import bills will pressure Sterling which will continue to fall , pushing up the cost of energy , food and consumer goods even more .
Public sector workers , no longer able to borrow to supplement income will begin to strike once they discover that 3 % wage increases do not come close to covering the rise in the cost of living ( the great inflation lie will be found out ) .
Unemployment will begin a steady rise as financial services , banks , building sector , airlines , airports , leisure and retail come under severe pressure .
They will be joined by public service workers as the government struggles to fund public services with falling tax receipts , spiraling debt and a falling pound .
( already happening in Aberdeen with deep cuts in education spending across the city and teacher numbers being slashed ) .
I wo n't go into the spiraling and compounding nature of this on the property market since this is an article about energy .
The elderly and poor will really struggle this winter to pay their energy and food bills .
If the weather is cold , the grid might fail and the vulnerable will begin to die from cold and starvation .
Following that things will begin to get worse as the UK discovers that it is struggling to secure sufficient natural gas at any price , on the liberalised market they helped create .
Society becomes more polarised into those who can still afford to drive an SUV , live in comfort and warmth and fill their bellies with prime Aberdeen Angus steak set against a new under class who struggle to feed and heat their families .
Welcome to Britain in 2010 .
The End

France is about to enact laws that penalise persistent file - sharers Europeans suspected of putting movies and music on file - sharing networks could be thrown off the web under proposals before Brussels .
The powers are in a raft of laws that aim to harmonise the regulations governing Europe 's telecom markets .
Other amendments added to the packet of laws allow governments to decide which software can be used on the web .
Campaigners say the laws trample on personal privacy and turn net suppliers into copyright enforcers .
Piracy plan MEPs are due to vote on the so - called Telecom Packet on 7 July .
The core proposals in the packet were drawn up to help European telecoms firms cope with the rapid pace of change in the industry .
Technological and industry changes that did not respect borders had highlighted the limitations of Europe 's current approach which sees national governments oversee their telecoms markets .
" The current fragmentation hinders investment and is detrimental to consumers and operators , " says the EU document laying out the proposals .
But , say digital rights campaigners , anti-piracy lobbyists have hijacked the telecoms laws and tabled amendments that turn dry proposals on industry reform into an assault on the freedom of net users .
... Skype or even Firefox might be declared illegal in Europe if they are not certified by an administrative authority
Benjamin Henrion , FFII
Among the amendments are calls to enact a Europe - wide " three strikes " law .
This would see users banned from the web if they fail to heed three warnings that they are suspected of putting copyrighted works on file - sharing networks .
In addition it bestows powers on governments to decide which programs can be " lawfully " used on the internet .
A coalition of European digital rights groups have banded together to galvanise opposition .
" [ The amendments ] pave the way for the monitoring and filtering of the internet by private companies , exceptional courts and Orwellian technical measures , " said Christophe Espern , co-founder of French rights group La Quadrature du Net ( Squaring the Net ) in a statement .
The UK's Open Rights Group said the laws would be " disproportionate and ineffective " .
The Foundation for a Free Internet Infrastructure ( FFII ) warned that if the amendments were accepted they would create a " Soviet internet " on which only software and services approved by governments would be allowed to run .
" Tomorrow , popular software applications like Skype or even Firefox might be declared illegal in Europe if they are not certified by an administrative authority , " warned Benjamin Henrion , FFII representative in Brussels , in a statement .
" This is compromising the whole open development of the internet as we know it today , " he said .
MEP Malcolm Harbour , rapporteur for users rights and the e-privacy directive who has helped oversee the Telecoms Package , challenged the rights groups view of the amendments .
" The intention of the directive is nothing like direction they are claiming , " he said .
The reforms to the package would likely improve rights for consumers , he said adding that there was no mention of specific anti-piracy measures in the Package .
It is not clear yet whether the amendments will be accepted in full .
In April 2008 European politicians voted against similar proposals that would have seen suspected file - sharers thrown off the net .
Susan Hall , media partner at solicitors Cobbetts LLP said : " The amendment will cause several problems , firstly , many broadband users routinely transfer large files which are encrypted .
" Many of these are acting quite legitimately and in order to determine whether or not such large files are or are not the produce of illicit file sharing the ISP will have to carry out an unprecedented degree of analysis of its customers ' traffic .
" Furthermore , computers are frequently shared - within offices , within homes , within educational institutions and inadvertently , where wrong - doers " piggy back " on an inadequately secured Wi -Fi connection .
" All this raises the spectre of people losing internet access - for reasons which are no fault of their own . "

What are these ?
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Environmentalists pulled opposition to an expansion of what will be the biggest coal - fired power plant in Wisconsin after gaining concessions from We Energies and two smaller utilities , environmental and utility officials said on Wednesday .
We Energies , the principal unit of Wisconsin Energy Corp , Madison Gas & Electric and Wisconsin Public Power now expect to open the first of two new 615 - megawatt units in fall 2009 at the Oak Creek Power Plant on Lake Michigan south of Milwaukee .
We Energies will own 86 percent of the new units and have that share of the generation , with each of the other two utilities owning 7 percent .
We Energies fully owns the existing four coal - fired units at Oak Creek , which were built from 1959 to 1967 .
The second 615 - MW unit is to open in 2010 , We Energies said .
After the $ 2.1 - to $ 2.2 - billion expansion , Oak Creek will be the biggest coal power plant in the state .
Oak Creek ’s production capacity will rise to about 2,300 MW capable of serving about 1.8 million homes .
The Sierra Club and Clean Wisconsin agreed to drop legal challenges regarding Oak Creek ’s once - through cooling system after the utilities agreed to concessions including retirement by 2012 of two older coal units at the We Energies Presque Isle Power Plant in Michigan ’s Upper Peninsula .
The three utilities agreed to support state legislation to push up to 2013 from 2015 Wisconsin ’s renewable energy standard to 10 percent of electricity generation and to increase that standard by 2025 to 25 percent .
The utilities will also seek state regulator approval to dedicate about $ 100 million over 25 years to protect Lake Michigan .
Bruce Nilles , an attorney who leads the Sierra Club ’s national fight against coal power and is based in Wisconsin , said environmentalists got as much as possible .
“ We ’ve been fighting ( Oak Creek ’s expansion ) for more than seven years , and , despite our best efforts , it is under construction , ” said Nilles .
“ It ’s time to put this one behind us and focus on the other ones that are in the pipeline , ” said Nilles .
That focus in Wisconsin is now on the proposed Alliant Energy 300 - MW coal / biomass unit at the Nelson Dewey coal plant in Cassville .
Alliant has promised to retire an old coal - fired plant , add more wind power and increase the biomass portion of the plant in Cassville if the state agrees to approve it .
Alliant wants to open the new $ 1.2 billion Cassville unit in 2013 .
We Energies has more than 1.1 million electricity customers in Wisconsin and Michigan .
Madison Gas & Electric has 136,000 power customers in the Madison , Wisconsin area .
Wisconsin Public
Power is a regional power company serving 49 of the state ’s 82 municipal utilities , and has 190,000 customers .
WASHINGTON ( AP )  American voters should know this week who will join Barack Obama as No. 2 on the Democratic presidential ballot , a critical decision for the first - term senator who is fighting off Republican John McCain 's bid to paint off him as untested and unready for the White House .
Democrats open their national convention a week hence in Denver , and Obama 's choice of a running mate remains the primary unanswered question as the party gears up for the final push to oust the Republicans from the executive mansion .
Top contenders for the vice presidential spot were Evan Bayh , a middle - of - the - road Indiana senator with an extensive Democratic pedigree ; Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine , who leads a Republican - leaning state that Obama needs to put in his column in the Nov. 4 election , and long - serving Delaware Senator Joseph Biden , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee who undertook a weekend trip to Russian - occupied Georgia .
POLITICS BLOG : Obama VEEP stakes
The crisis in Georgia , a U.S. - allied country that broke free from Russian domination after the Soviet empire collapsed in 1991 , underlined Obama 's need for a running mate with foreign policy gravitas to counter McCain 's four terms in the Senate where he has served as Armed Services chairman and traveled extensively abroad .
Biden said he was invited to Georgia by its president , Mikhail Saakashvili , whose forces launched an attack to regain control of the breakaway South Ossetia region Aug. 7 but were overwhelmed and driven back by Russian troops , armor and attack air craft .
Russia then took control of most of Georgia but said on Monday it was pulling its troops out under a European Union - negotiated agreement .
McCain has not yet named a running mate either .
The Republican convention is Sept. 1 - 4 .
Former Pennsylvania Gov.
Tom Ridge , who supports abortion rights and whose name has been floated by McCain as a possible running mate , said he thought the Republican Party would accept a so - called pro-choice vice presidential candidate .
McCain riled some conservatives last week when he suggested his running mate could — like Ridge — support abortion rights .
" What he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view , " Ridge said on Fox television .
" He 's not judgmental about me or my belief .
He just disagrees with me . "
Ridge spoke on a weekend television talk show a day after McCain assured evangelical Christians during a forum on faith in California that he had a long record in opposition to abortion and would not change that stand .
The abortion issue drew one of the starkest lines under policy differences raised Saturday night when both McCain and Obama were questioned separately by pastor Rick Warren in his Saddleback Church , a California megacongregation that claims 23,000 members .
As Obama was leaving the stage and McCain was taking his place , the two men shook hands and embraced briefly in the jam - packed church .
But by Sunday , Obama had taken off the gloves and was again battering McCain as little different from unpopular President George W. Bush , a fellow Republican .
Obama also laid into McCain 's campaign team for using " the same old folks that brought you George W. Bush " to paint Obama as unpatriotic and weak .
McCain spokesman Brian Rogers responded , " John McCain has never questioned Sen .
Obama 's patriotism , but he clearly does question Sen.
Obama 's experience and judgment . "
Obama , who has been put on the defensive by a series of attacks on his character , experience and readiness for the presidency , has been responding to the McCain accusations blow for blow .
McCain has sought to make the 2008 presidential contest a referendum on Obama , while trying to duck his associations with Bush , who has become deeply unpopular with voters disenchanted with 5 1/2 years of war in Iraq and a badly stumbling economy .
McCain was in Florida , meanwhile , for a fundraising event which was canceled as Tropical Storm Fay moved toward the state .
The Republican candidate was briefed on the storm .
On Monday , McCain was to address the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Orlando , which should provide a warm reception to the former fighter pilot who spent 5 1/2 years as a prisoner in North Vietnam .
Obama was scheduled to speak on Tuesday , followed by Bush on Wednesday .
On Sunday night , Obama raked in $ 7.8 million at three separate fundraisers in San Francisco .
Some individuals paid $ 28,500 to attend .
" John McCain , all he wants to do is talk about me , " Obama told supporters .
" They know they can't win on the issues .
So what they 'll do is they 'll try to scare people : ' He 's risky .
He 's risky .
We 're not sure . " '
In April , at another fundraiser in this prosperous , liberal city in Northern California , Obama made his infamous remarks about bitter small town voters who " cling " to guns and religion .
Rivals used those comments to brand him as elitist .
Obama avoided any such characterizations this time but did say many voters are angry and confused .
" The fact of the matter is , at a certain point , when government has not been serving the people for this long , people get cynical , " he said .

Senior executives at Royal Caribbean had a dilemma .
The short term demand for cruises was growing rapidly , and with cruise ships running at full capacity , the cruise line could n't take as many customers as it wanted , essentially leaving easy profits on a table .
One option was to order new ships , but new ships generally take few years to build and cost a fortune .
The other option , which was never tried before , was to take one of their ships , cut it in half at the middle , and enlarge it by adding a new block of rooms .
At the end , the management decided to take the second option and chose Enchantment of the Seas - a huge 12 - story , 916 ft ship - for overhaul and for adding extra passenger capacity .
The enlargement process was done in 3 stages .
During the first stage , circular saws and torches were used to cut the ship .
The construction crew cut through pretty much everything , including the outer hull ( which was made from steel ) , the inner hull ( which was constructed to be absolutely watertight ) , the ventilation system as well as thousands of cables and pipes .
That whole process took two days , and when it was done , one could see a narrow line of light that traveled from the top of the ship all the way to the bottom .
During the second stage , the engineers moved the two sections of the ship away from each other and positioned a large 2,500 ton , 73 - foot section with 151 furnished rooms between them .
In the third and final stage of the process , the construction crew reattached all the pipes , cables and everything else that was cut , thereby uniting the 3 pieces of the enlarged ship .
At the end of this process , the cruise ship grew from 916 feet to 990 feet .
It cost Royal Caribbean about $ 60 million to complete the enlargement and currently the Enchantment of the Seas is able to enchant 300 additional vacationers on each of its journeys .

Rising energy prices are now squeezing consumers from a different direction : their utility bills .
Consumers from California to New York are facing rate increases of as much as 30 percent .
Average homeowners ' electric bills are now heading towards $ 70 to $ 80 a month in some states .
And low - and middle - income residents are having trouble paying their bills as evidenced by a large increase in disconnect notices .
" Electricity 's been cheap for a long time , it 's just catching up , " says Mark Wolfe , executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors ' Association in Washington .
On a national basis , the federal Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) estimates that electric bills will rise 5.2 percent this year .
But next year , they 're expected to rise 9.8 percent .
" In the last two months , 20 to 30 utilities started requesting to have their rates increased , " says Tyler Hodge , an electricity analyst at EIA in Washington .
" With the rise in fuel costs , other utilities will follow suit pretty soon . "
The fuel cost that has risen the most so far is natural gas , up about 40 percent in the past year .
Last year at this time , the spot price of natural gas was $ 6 per million BTUs .
Thursday morning , the price was $ 9.85 per million BTUs .
In early July it reached as high as $ 13.31 .
The rising price of natural gas is one of the reasons why Southern California Edison , the largest utility in California , recently warned customers it would be requesting a sharp increase in rates .
Mid to high use residential customers can expect a rate hike in excess of 30 percent .
For their overall system of 4.8 million customers , the average rate increase will be 25 percent .
" On August 1 , we normally make a filing to the California Public Utilities Commission that will highlight what we feel our fuel and power costs will be , " says Gil Alexander , a spokesman for the utility .
" Last week we issued an early warning because of spiking natural gas prices . "
The giant utility uses natural gas for 60 percent of the energy that it generates or buys since it is one of the cleanest fuels .
" The price has doubled over the last twelve months , and we are quite vulnerable , " says Mr. Alexander .
But , coal has also been climbing .
In the past 18 months , the spot price of coal has doubled , says Jim Owen of the Edison Electric Institute , which represents the investor - owned utilities in Washington .
" One of the main drivers is global demand .
People , especially in China and India , are buying coal here .
And in the US , demand for coal continues to grow , " he says .
The increasing price of coal is showing up in filings for fuel adjustments .
For example , American Electric Power ( AEP ) recently filed for a 12 percent increase for its Appalachian Power subsidiary that services 500,000 customers in western Virginia .
Not only are coal prices rising , but utilities are now asking for rate increases for the equipment they have installed to remove pollutants from power plant smokestacks .
AEP , which operates in eleven states , has asked for a 17 percent rate increase in West Virginia partly to pay for the new emission reduction equipment .
Some of the rate increases reflect the rising cost of commodities such as copper and the rising cost of gasoline and diesel for utilities ' large vehicle fleets .
Utilities are trying to pass on these rising expenses .
For example , AEP in Virginia has asked for a 24 percent increase ( on top of the 12 percent fuel adjustment ) .
" Power poles are up 39 percent since 2003 , copper wire has more than doubled since then , " says AEP spokeswoman Melissa McHenry in Columbus .
Ohio .
Not all of the rate increases are in the double digit range .
There are also many smaller 3 to 4 percent increases such as 4.5 percent at Pacific Gas & Electric , 2.5 percent at ComEd in Chicago and 2.85 percent at Connecticut Light & Power .
Tyson Slocum of Public Citizen says his organization has found rate increases are higher in deregulated utility markets .
" In a deregulated market , the prices are set by the cost of the last kilowatt of power , " he says .
" In a fully regulated market , prices are set by the average of all costs . "
However , John Shelk , the president of Electric Power Supply Association , which argues for utility deregulation in Washington , says his organization 's surveys have found the rate of increase is the same for both regulated and deregulated utilities .
The difference is that regulated utilities face a lag in getting back their rising fuel costs .
" The rate of increase ( of the price of electricity ) is 30 percent in both deregulated and regulated types of states , " he says .
In the June Consumer Price Index , the Bureau of Labor Statistics found natural gas and electric prices were 10 percent higher than a year ago .
Washington - based economist Richard DeKaser of National City Corporation estimates the rising rates have trimmed about 0.5 percent off household discretionary income .
" If it 's in isolation , it 's manageable , " he says .
" But it 's not in isolation , it 's part of a larger trend of rising energy prices . "
In fact , for some consumers the utility rate hikes are just too much .
" In the summer it used to be that 1 percent to 2 percent of consumers were shut off for not paying their bills , now it's in the range of 5 percent , " says Mr. Wolfe of NEADA , which lobbies for federal aid to help low income families with their heating and air conditioning bills .
" What 's happened is that it 's moved from a problem for the poor to the middle class .
When people are living paycheck to paycheck higher energy costs become more significant . "
Google has announced the official release of Desktop Gadgets for Linux and is distributing the source code under the open - source Apache software license .
Although there are still bugs and the implementation is not yet entirely complete , it works well enough for day - to - day use .
Desktop Gadgets is one of the primary features of the Google Desktop suite , which also includes a search mechanism .
Gadgets are small , interactive , web - oriented applets that the user can place on the desktop or in a sidebar .
Google publishes a complete Gadgets API that enables third - party software developers to create components for the platform .
It also supports Google 's web - based widgets .
Google issued a somewhat lackluster release of its desktop search tool for Linux last year , but did n't support Gadgets on the open - source operating system until now .
Although somewhat incomplete , this early Gadgets release reflects a much stronger understanding of the expectations and requirements of Linux users .
Source code is available for the entire program , and it leverages widely - used open - source libraries and toolkits .
A particularly nice touch is full support for both GTK + and Qt , which means that it is designed to play nicely with the two major Linux desktop environments .
Consistent with standard Linux development practices , the program is being developed out in the open in a very transparent way .
Users can retrieve the latest source code from the project 's subversion repository or download a source tarball of the 0.9.1 release .
Google is n't providing binaries and has opted to leave packaging to the Linux distributors .
Major Linux distributors will likely make it available to users through their own standardized package management systems , but users who want to test it right now will have to compile the source or find unofficial packages .
I compiled it for testing on Ubuntu 8.04 in a GNOME environment .
Google provides detailed build instructions that explain the process .
Users will require several dependencies , all of which were easily accessible from the Ubuntu package repositories .
I tested several gadgets and did n't encounter any serious problems .
Not all gadgets are available or fully functional yet , but this is a pretty strong start .
The sidebar worked fine and I was able to drag gadgets between it and the desktop .
There seems to be a minor bug that causes a regular window frame to be drawn around gadgets sometimes when they are dragged from the sidebar to the desktop , but this problem does n't show up frequently .
Gadgets can be installed from the Gadget Browser interface , which also allows users to search for gadgets and filter them by category .
A Google Gadgets icon that is displayed in the notification area when the program is running provides easy access to the Gadget Browser and can be clicked to toggle Gadget visibility .
The implementation is structured so that the Gadget rendering and runtime functionality is encapsulated in its own library that is separate from the actual Desktop Gadget host program .
This will make it easy for existing Linux - based desktop widget systems to integrate full support for running Google Gadgets .
Although I 've been extremely unimpressed with the poor system integration of Google 's previous Google Desktop offerings for Linux , I 'm pleased to say that the Gadgets release is a big turnaround .
Google appears to have gotten everything right this time , from the process to the implementation .
It seems like Google is finally beginning to understand that supporting Linux means embracing the culture , ecosystem , and methodology , not just offering compatible programs .

After a brief bidding war between two phone bidders , an unknown buyer snapped up the painting at the Deutscher - Menzies auction house in Sydney .
The price included a buyer 's premium .
Most Australian auction houses would send a work of such value to Europe or the US .
But this painting belonged to Deutscher - Menzies director Rod Menzies .
He paid $ US4,608,000 for it in 2006 , which was the equivalent of about $ A6.2 million at the time .
Mr Menzies , an aggressive competitor in the auction business , hopes the sale will boost his company 's profits and reputation .
" This sale does give us the opportunity to extend our bottom line , " said Tim Abdallah , the national head of art at Deutscher - Menzies .
" There is a risk for the vendor ( in selling it in Australia ) but we want to explore the possibility of expanding our market by selling paintings of this calibre in this country . "
To promote the sale internationally , Deutscher - Menzies spent $ 20,000 placing advertisements in newspapers all over the world .
" We had interest from a private collector in New York , from two sources in London and a nibble from Hong Kong , " Mr Abdallah said .
" If people know there is a well - priced picture on sale , the buyers will find it , no matter where it is . "
The managing director of Sotheby 's Australia , Lesley Alway , said valuable international works usually fetched more in London , New York and Hong Kong .
" That way they get included in major international catalogues and get seen by a broader group of serious collectors , " she said .
By selling the painting in Australia , Deutscher - Menzies made it more difficult for international buyers to view the work before the sale .
" The home market ( for a Picasso oil painting ) is not here , " said Michael Reid , and art market analyst and dealer .
" But Rod ( Menzies ) has considerations beyond that .
He wants an increase in turnover .
He wants to be seen to sell major pictures and to add interest to what is otherwise a fairly run -of - the - mill auction . "
The auction coincides with an exhibition of Picasso's work at Brisbane 's Gallery of Modern Art. Mr Abdallah denied the company was cashing in on the publicity for the exhibition in Queensland .
" We know that survey exhibitions can have a dramatic effect on prices , but the timing was just a happy coincidence , " he said .
The Picasso sale broke the country 's previous record of $ 3.48 million , paid for a work last year by the late Australian painter Brett Whiteley .

There 's no doubt that we live in political times that are highly charged ;
Right - wing pundits dominate the radio and TV while the majority of Americans believe that America is heading in the wrong way by a whopping 81 % , yet what we are assailed with on a regular basis are the 19 % that support the Bush administration and seem intent on starting another war - proof positive that the White House 's propaganda machine and corporate America are bound and determined to have their way in spite of overwhelming condemnation from the majority of America .
It seems that " the people " - no longer have a voice , ignored by Congress and the Presidency - and a Speaker of The House that for all practical purposes , appears to be a rabid Bush supporter rather than a Democrat - a symptom that America is definitely headed on the wrong path , compliments of a Congress and Judiciary that have turned their back on their oaths of office and seem intent on destroying our economy , our belief (s ) in the constitution , and the rule of law .
To the rest of the world , it must appear that America is imploding from within - and our enemies , who are real and standing on the sidelines wondering how to deal with a military giant that seems out of control , are likely in hushed meetings and conferences asking themselves how 19 % of the population have obviously taken control over what used to be the world 's premier superpower which now is in disarray and chaos ; our Congress is rubber - stamping whatever the Bush administration wants , and Democrats like Pelosi and Hoyer are giving in to a lame - duck that still has the ability to plunge the US into another war that could thrust the Middle - East into a " ball of fire " - .

El Baradei : Mideast could burn if Iran attacked By ALI AKBAR DAREINI , Associated Press Writer
Sat Jun 21 , 11:59 AM ET DUBAI , United Arab Emirates - The U.N. nuclear watchdog chief warned in comments aired Saturday that any military strike on Iran could turn the Mideast into a " ball of fire " - and lead the country to a more aggressive stance on its controversial nuclear program .
The comments by Mohamed ElBaradei , head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , came in an interview with an Arab television station aired a day after U.S. officials said they believed recent large Israeli military exercises may have been meant to show Israel 's ability to hit Iran 's nuclear sites .
" In my opinion , a military strike will be the worst " - it will turn the Middle East to a ball of fire , " - ElBaradei said on Al - Arabiya television .
It also could prompt Iran to press even harder to seek a nuclear program , and force him to resign , he said .

I support www.votestrike.com, but they propose to strike on September the 11th , and if you read the news the MSM wo n't reveal , it indicates that September the 11th may be too late to stop the carnage that Bush and Cheney are planning while our Congress refuses to honor their oath of office and impeach the traitors that are attempting to destroy the American way of life !

In this article published in India in the summer of 2001 the Indian Government announces that it will support America 's PLANNED military incursion into Afghanistan .
India in anti-Taliban military plan
India and Iran will " facilitate " the planned US - Russia hostilities against the Taliban .
By Our Correspondent
26 June 2001 : India and Iran will " facilitate " US and Russian plans for " limited military action "
against the Taliban if the contemplated tough new economic sanctions do n't bend Afghanistan 's fundamentalist regime .
The Taliban controls 90 per cent of Afghanistan and is advancing northward along the Salang highway and preparing for a rear attack on the opposition Northern Alliance from
Tajikistan - Afghanistan border positions .
Indian foreign secretary Chokila Iyer attended a crucial session of the second Indo - Russian joint working group on Afghanistan in Moscow amidst increase of Taliban 's military activity near the Tajikistan border .
And , Russia 's Federal Security Bureau ( the former KGB ) chief Nicolai Patroshev is visiting Teheran this week in connection with Taliban 's military build - up .
Indian officials say that India and Iran will only play the role of " facilitator " while the US and Russia will combat the Taliban from the front with the help of two Central Asian countries , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan , to push Taliban lines back to the 1998 position 50 km away from Mazar - e - Sharief city in northern Afghanistan .
At The New York Times , a moderator must approve each comment before it appears online , encouraging germaneness while discouraging the rabble - rousing of “ flamers . ”
The time lag before comments appear discourages highly referential back - and - forths .
On The Caucus , the paper ’s main political blog , editors are constantly walking the tightrope between moderation and censorship .
“ Do you just let some of this up online so people understand that there are a lot of prejudices are out there ? ” asks Kate Phillips , the Times ’ online politics editor .
“ It is a struggle for all of us to figure out how much do you permit to permeate the space you ’ve created that is supposed to be respectful , but not dominated by the PC police . ”
At the left - leaning HuffingtonPost.com , which got 600,000 comments last month , the site has a paid staff of 30 full - time and part - time moderators who work in shifts around - the - clock to filter each blog comment .
They also “ post - moderate ” the comments attached to news stories appearing on the site .
While there are certain computer technologies that can flag inappropriate comments based on key words , Huff Post Editor in Chief Arianna Huffington says that it still requires a human eye to keep the comments in line with her site ’s posting policies .
“ There are certain obvious things we have , certain specific things , ” says Huffington .
“ Conspiracy theories — we do n’t allow conspiracy theories .
If you thought Sept. 11 was caused by the Bush administration , your comment is not going to appear unless it is a mistake . ”
“ Once it is clear that everything is moderated , ” she said , “ a lot of trolls disappear . ”
Not surprisingly , there are those bloggers and administrators who have simply tired of the struggle and done away with comments altogether .
The Atlantic ’s Marc Ambinder is one , having gotten rid of his comment section , reinstated it and then finally excised it for good .
“ I do n’t get comfortable censoring speech , even if it is offensive , and there is no need for me to subject myself to those decisions , ” Ambinder says .
The ever - increasing volume of comments has had a vaguely anesthetizing effect for readers and writers , newbies and veterans alike .
“ I ’m not sure what good hundreds of thousands of comments or message boards do for anybody , ” says Artley .
“ I have never known anybody to just read through all of that and think it ’s worth revisiting .
It ’s our job as editors to find a better solution . ”
Layne , though , is n’t sure news outlets will keep giving them a forum to talk to one another : “ I think it will become a crazy memory that a paper like The New York Times was letting any dingbat come in and write [ almost ] anything on its website . ”
NON - LINEAR DC ANALYSIS CIRCUIT
Using Nodal Analysis , you can find the voltage at every node in a DC linear circuit .
But the technique runs into a brick wall if any non-linear components , such as a diode , appear in the circuit .
Turns out , the solution is still within reach .
The secret lies in first transforming the non-linear components into something usable by Nodal Analysis .
The technique requires a little guessing , and a lot more trips to the nodal equation solver than is needed by a linear circuit .
DIODE MODEL
As an example , let 's look at a very non-linear component , a diode .
Its current versus voltage relationship is described by where IS is the saturation current and Vt the thermal voltage .
Using a little tunnel vision around an operating voltage Vdo , you can approximate the behavior by a line tangent to its ideal curve .
Diode characteristic curve and tangent line .
How does the tangent line help circuit analysis ?
A straight line can be modeled using linear components - a parallel combination of a conductance Geq and a current source Ieq !
The conductance Geq is simply the slope of the tangent at the operating point Vdo .
The term Ieq is the point where the tangent slices through the y - axis .
Here 's the non-linear diode transformed into its linear companion model .
NODAL ANALYSIS
Now , we can treat the diode like any other linear component in the circuit and develop the nodal equations .
( See Nodal Analysis for quick review . )
We can easily solve for V1 and V2 .
First , to simplify bookkeeping , let G 11 = 1/R1 + 1/R2 , G 12 = -1/R2 , G 21 = -1/R2 , G 22 = 1/R2 +Geq , I 1 = Is and I 2 = - Ieq .
The equations reduce to Then work the equations directly to get Finally , stick the calculated V2 value into the next equation to get V1 .
( We 'll use these later in our Excel spreadsheet . )
REPEAT NODAL ANALYSIS AS NEEDED
( NEWTON'S METHOD )
Remember , the diode 's linear companion model was created at some operating point .
But , which operating point ?
Well , initially we do n't know - we can only guess at a trial operating point .
After solving the Nodal equations , the voltage found across the diode serves as the next trial operating point and a new companion model is created .
Again , the nodal equations are solved and the next trial operating point is found .
Repeat as necessary until it converges to a solution .
How do you know when you 've reached a solution ?
If the changes in circuit voltages and currents , between one iteration ( n ) and the last iteration ( n - 1 ) , are smaller than some limit , then you 've arrived at a solution .
The whole thing looks like this : Step 1 .
Guess at the diode 's initial trial operating point .
Step 2 . Create linear companion models .
Step 3 . Solve Nodal Equations .
Step 4 . Convergence ? | V( n ) - V( n - 1 ) | < VLIMIT and | I ( n ) - I ( n - 1 ) | < ILIMIT ?
No -
Use the calculated diode voltage as new trial operating point
for another iteration .
Start again at Step 2 .
Yes - Jump to Step 6 . Step 6 .
Stop iterations , solution reached !
And there in a nutshell is Newton 's method ( or the tangent method ) of solving non-linear equations Top ↑
NON - LINEAR DC ANALYSIS
Let 's jump in the non-linear waters with an Excel spreadsheet for our diode circuit .
Download and open the spreadsheet NON - LINEAR_DC_ANALYSIS.XLS .
Under the variables shaded in light blue , enter the diode 's reverse current IS and thermal voltage Vt at 27 ° C .
Next , enter the resistors R1 , R2 and current source Is .
IS Vt R1 R2 Is 1E - 15 0.025875 100 10000 0.1
How much voltage would you estimate at node 1 ?
You can expect V1 = Is ∙ R1 =
0.1 A ∙ 100 Ω = 10 V .
That ’s because R2 = 10 k Ω and the diode will have little effect on R1's 100 Ω .
Now , it 's time to enter your guess at a trial operating point for the diode , say 0.9V .
From this guess , Excel calculates the diode current Id and its companion model values Geq and Ieq ( see equations above ) .
Vd Id Geq Ieq 0.9 1.28 4.93E+01 - 4.31E+01
Just to the right , the spreadsheet calculates the conductance matrix G according to the equations G11 G21 G12 G22 1/R1 + 1/R2 -1/R2 -1/R2 1/R2 + Geq
Finally , the current vector is formed I1 I2 Is - Ieq Okay , here comes the main objective - solve the equations for V1 and V2 .
The voltages are calculated using the equations found in the Nodal Analysis section above .
V1 V2 9.91 0.8741
Notice the next row .
The diode voltage V2 from the previous row is placed in column B as the new trial operating voltage !
Another round of calculations then begins .
How do you know if V1 and V2 are correct ?
Just look at the change in the diode voltages and currents during the last iteration .
The last 2 columns holds these values .
As you can see , by the 8th iteration the change is small and getting smaller .
You can say , the solution is converging !
ALGORITHM INSIGHT
The number of iterations it takes depends a lot on your initial guess at the diode voltage .
Try another initial guess like 0.65 or 0.95 V .
How many iterations did it take ?
Try changing Is , R1 and R2 .
What effect does it have on the voltages and number of iterations ?

THE SPICE CIRCUIT
To verify our results , you can run a simulation of NON - LINEAR_DC_ CKT .CIR .
Download the file or copy this netlist into a text file with the *.cir extension .
NON - LINEAR_DC_CKT.CIR - SIMPLE NON - LINEAR CIRCUIT * IS 0 1 DC 0.1A * R1 1 0 100 R2 1 2 10 K D1 2 0 DNOM * .

PROBE .END
Although the SPICE file runs a Transient Analysis , it essentially computes a Non-Linear DC Analysis because no significant charge - storage devices exist in the circuit .
Plot V ( 1 ) and V ( 2 ) .
Use the cursor , if needed , to get an accurate measurement .
Do the voltages from SPICE and Excel agree ?
Top↑
CONVERGENCE
Well , pass the bubbly - the companion models have been created , the voltage and current changes have fallen below their limits , and a solution has been found !
But wait , what are these limits of voltage and current change ?
The limits are actually calculated by | V( n ) - V( n - 1 ) | < VLIMIT = V(n ) ∙RELTOL + VNTOL | I ( n ) - I ( n - 1 ) | < ILIMIT = I(n ) ∙RELTOL + ABSTOL
By default , RELTOL is set to 0.001 or 0.1 percent .
So if your expected voltage is 5V , the change in node voltage must fall below 5 V ∙ 0.001 = 5 mV to reach a solution .
However , if your voltage swings near zero , such as 0.1 mV , then the voltage change has to fall
below 0.1 μV for convergence - a ridiculous demand on accuracy !
That 's where VNTOL enters the picture .
At a default of VNTOL = 1 μV , it ensures that the limit does n't get too small if voltages approach 0V .
( Some suggest that the default of 1 μV is too small for most simulations . )
RETOL and ABSTOL play a similar role for the current change limits .
The default for ABSTOL is 1 pA .
Some of you may recognize RELTOL , VNTOL and ABSTOL as parameters that can appear in the .OPTIONS statement of the netlist .
You , as a SPICE user , have control over these parameters .

From a mailing list Peter and I are on ...
As a professor , a software developer and an author I 've spent a career in software security .
I decided to conduct an experiment to see how vulnerable people 's accounts are to mining the Web for information .
I asked some of my acquaintances , people I know only casually , if with their permission and under their supervision I could break into their online banking accounts .
After a few uncomfortable pauses , some agreed .
The goal was simple : get into their online banking account by using information about them , their hobbies , their families and their lives freely available online .
To be clear , this is n't hacking or exploiting vulnerabilities , instead it 's mining the Internet for nuggets of personal data .
Here 's one case .
I share it here because it represents some of the common pitfalls and illustrates a pretty serious weakness that most of us have online .
Setup :
This is the case of one subject whom I 'll call " Kim . "
She 's a friend of my wife , so just from previous conversations I already knew her name , what state she was from , where she worked , and about how old she was .
But that 's about all I knew .
She then told me which bank she used ( although there are some pretty easy ways to find that out ) and what her user name was .
( It turns out it was fairly predictable : her first initial + last name . )
Based on this information , my task was to gain access to her account .
Step 1 : Reconnaissance : Using her name and where she worked , I found two things with a quick Google search : a blog and an old resume .
Her blog was a goldmine : information about grandparents , pets , hometown , etcetera ( although it turns out I did n't need to use most of this ) .
From the resume I got her old college e-mail address and from her blog I got her G - mail address .
Step 2 : Bank Password Recovery Feature :
My next step was to try the password recovery feature on her online banking site .
The site did n't ask any personal questions , instead it first sent an e-mail to her address with a reset link which was bad news , because I did n't have access to her e-mail accounts .
So e-mail became my next target .
Step 3 : G - mail : I tried to recover her G - mail password , blindly guessing that this was where the bank would have sent its password - reset e-mail .
When I tried to reset the password on her G - mail account , Google sent its password reset e-mail to her old college e-mail account .
Interestingly , G - mail actually tells you the domain ( for example , xxxxx.edu ) where it sends the password reset e-mail to , so now I had to get access to that …ugh .
Step 4 : College E-Mail Account :
When I used the " forgot my password " link on the college e-mail server , it asked me for some information to reset the password : home address ?
( check — found it on that old resume online ) ; home zip code ?
( check — resume ) ; home country ?
( uh , okay , check — found it on the resume ) ; and birth date ?
( devastating — I did n't have this ) .
I needed to get creative .
Step 5 : Department of Motor Vehicles : Hoping she had gotten a speeding ticket , I hit the state traffic courts '
Web sites , because many states allow you to search for violations and court appearances by name .
These records include a birth date ( among other things ) .
I played around with this for about 30 minutes with no luck when I realized that there was probably a much easier way to do this .
Step 6 : Back to the Blog :
In a rare moment of clarity I simply searched her blog for " birthday . "
She made a reference to it on a post that gave me the day and month but no year .
Step 7 : Endgame ( or How to Topple a House of Cards ) : I returned to the college e-mail password recovery screen and typed in her birth date , guessing on the year .
Turns out that I was off on the year of birth but , incredibly , the university password reset
Web page gave me five chances and even told me which field had inaccurate information !
I then changed her college e-mail password , which gave me access to her G - mail password reset e-mail .
After clicking the link , Google asked me personal information that I easily found on her blog ( birthplace , father 's middle name , etcetera ) .
I changed the G - mail password , which gave me access to the bank account reset e-mail , and I was also asked for similar personal information ( pet name , phone number and so forth ) that I had found on her blog .
Once I reset the password , I had access to her money ( or at least I would have ) .
Needless to say , Kim was disturbed .
Her whole digital identity sat precariously on the foundation of her college e-mail account ; once I had access to it , the rest of the security defenses fell like a row of dominoes .
What 's striking about Kim 's case is how common it is .
For many of us , the abundance of personal information we put online combined with the popular model of sending a password reset e-mail has our online security resting unsteadily on the shoulders of one or two e-mail accounts .
In Kim 's case some of that information came from a blog , but it could just as easily have come from a MySpace page , a sibling 's blog ( speaking of their birthday , mom 's name , etcetera ) or from any number of places online .
Battling this threat requires us to make better choices about how we prove who we are online and what we make available on the Internet .
Go and do a self - check .
Try to reset you passwords and see what questions are asked to verify your identity .
Some questions are better than others .
Date of birth , for example , is bad .
In addition to the DMV , there is a wealth of public records available online where folks can track down when you were born .
Most account reset features give you a choice of questions or methods to use .
Go for questions that ask about obscure things that you wo n't forget ( or can at least look up ) , like your favorite frequent flyer number .
Avoid questions that are easy to guess , such as which state you opened your bank account in .
All of these are , of course , stopgap measures until we find better ways to prove our identities online .
It 's also critical to remember that once you put data online , it 's almost impossible to delete it later .
The more you blog about yourself , the more details you put in your social networking profiles , the more information about you is being archived , copied , backed up and analyzed almost immediately .
Think first , post later .
As for Kim , she 's still blogging , but now she 's a little more careful about the information she volunteers and has cleaned house on her old passwords and password reminder questions .
Next time I do this , I 'll have to figure out the name of her favorite primary school teacher .
Sounds good

Here 's a real tragic story .
Man , this is just stupidity compounded by negligence compounded with nothing short of evil .
Excerpt :
" Katelynn Sampson , 7 , looked as though she might have been abused for some time , police said Tuesday .
...
Ryan said when emergency workers found Katelynn 's body in an apartment in the west - end neighbourhood of Parkdale , there was evidence the Grade 3 student had been sleeping on the floor and had been subject to poor living conditions that he did not want to discuss .
...
Katelynn 's legal guardian , 29 - year - old Donna Irving , has been charged with second - degree murder in connection with the girl 's slaying .
Ryan confirmed that Irving has been charged and convicted of violent crimes in the past .
...
According to Ryan , Irving was granted sole custody of Katelynn in January , although she has had contact with the girl since May 2007 .
...
Child services agencies are investigating whether they played any role in placing Katelynn in Irving 's care , Ryan said . "
We recently wrote a blog about Malware is at an all time high , totaling more blocked in July than in all of 2007 according to SaaS vendor ScanSafe .
Every time you turn around , there is another phishing scam , email disguised as a FedEX notification , or outlandish news headline .
Of course , all of these are simply cover ups to entice unsuspecting users into compromising their computers .
Even though there are a lot of fantastic ( and free ) tools to keep your computers malware - free , most people do not take the time or expend the effort to protect themselves .
A well trained user is unlikely to be infected by most malware as there are some very simple things you can do to avoid it .

I just finished the lecture on streams in SICP .
Python has generators , which are quite lovely .
However , it 's fun to imagine reimplementing generators in various ways from scratch using some of the approaches in SICP .
First of all , there are promises .
A promise says that you 'll do something later .
In Scheme , you create a promise with " delay " and you invoke that promise with " force " :
Here 's one way to translate that to Python : Easy :) Now , let 's take a look at a generator .
Here 's a simple counter : Clearly , you can do this with an iterator class .
However , let 's instead use a closure and continuation passing style .
The syntax is n't the most beautiful in the world , but it definitely does the trick ;)
Whenever the subject of Israeli spying in the U.S. comes up , the journalistic handle is always the same : the infamous Jonathan Pollard .
His ghost hovers over the increasingly troubled " special relationship "  and he is n’t even dead yet .
Convicted of espionage in 1986 , Pollard did such damage to U.S. national security that top intelligence officials threatened to resign if Bill Clinton acceded to Israeli demands to pardon him .
He is serving a life sentence for stealing secrets deemed so valuable that the Soviet Union reportedly agreed to trade them for the release of tens of thousands of Russian Jews for resettlement in Israel .
Pollard had top - secret clearance and was able to procure a long list of documents for his Israeli handlers , but what baffled  and alarmed  top intelligence officials was that he had known the titles and in some cases the serial numbers of specific documents .
These could only have been provided by someone in a much higher pay grade  a top official privy to ultra- sensitive , need - to - know secrets .
This was the basis for the long - standing suspicion that Pollard was but the outer layer of a deeply - entrenched Israeli spy ring .
In addition , a May 7 , 1997 story in the Washington Post reported the National Security Agency had intercepted a communication between an Israeli embassy official and the head of Israeli intelligence that strongly implied the presence of a top - level mole in the U.S. government .
During the course of the conversation , according to the Post , the embassy official  eager to gain access to certain communications between Warren Christopher and Yasser Arafat  wanted to " go to Mega " for the goods .
The Mossad chief , Danny Yatom , remonstrated with him , averring , " This is not something we use Mega for . "
What did they use him for , then ?
One shudders to think about it , but apparently someone in the FBI has been thinking about it all these years , as indicated by the arrest of Ben - Ami Kadish , an 84 - year - old retired engineer who worked at the Picatinny Arsenal in northern New Jersey , for 27 years .
The four - count indictment against him charges he stole nuclear secrets , Patriot Missile specifications , and information on F - 15 fighter planes of the type we sold to Saudi Arabia .
He did this at the command of one " Yossi Yagur " ( not his real name ) who was also the New York Israeli consular officer who handled Pollard .
Yagur is or was a top official with the Office of Science Relations , known as Lakam , devoted to industrial espionage and now supposedly disbanded .
Yagur , identified in the indictment only as " CC - 1 " ( " Co-conspirator 1 " ) gave his henchman a list , and Kadish would go check out the requested documents from the Arsenal ’s classified library .
He would then sneak them out of the facility and bring them home , where Kadish would photograph them in the basement .
Documents were promptly replaced , and no one was the wiser .
Yagur fled to Israel when Pollard ’s treason was uncovered , but he has been in touch with Kadish over the years .
According to the indictment , Kadish went to visit him in 2004 .
No one caught on to Kadish for over 20 years .
So how did the Feds uncover this forgotten angle of the Pollard case ?
Newsweek cites one official as saying " the information that identified Kadish came from super - secret intelligence monitoring related to ongoing inquiries about the Pollard case . "
Ongoing inquiries  after all these years ?
The Newsweek piece avers that some U.S. intelligence officials had good reason to suspect a high - level " mole "  except that " investigators never discovered whether such a high - level Israeli source existed ; nor did they try very hard to find him . "
What revived  compelled  their interest ?
Philip Giraldi , over at The American Conservative blog , has the scoop :
" Israeli sources are reporting that the FBI investigation of the Ben - Ami Kadish spy case resulted from a leak coming from inside the government of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
The information on Kadish and on a number of other Americans who have spied for Israel was provided to the FBI anonymously , leading to the Bureau ’s opening of a full investigation .
One source reports that the National Security Agency was provided with Yosef Yagur ’s current phone number and address and was able to obtain corroborating information on the case by tapping the phone . "
The FBI paid Kadish a visit , and Yagur called him shortly afterward , on March 20 , after his initial interview with the Feds : “ Do n’t say anything , ” Yagur told him .
“ Let them say whatever they want .
What happened 25 years ago ?
You did n’t remember anything . ”
However , it was too late for that : according to the indictment , Kadish had already remembered a lot , confessed to stealing secrets , and stated that his only reward was a few modest meals here and there and the knowledge that he was helping Israel .
The suspicion that Pollard was far from alone has been confirmed , in spades , by the Kadish indictment , but that is just the beginning .
The Israeli spy network that not only persists but flourishes to this day may be about to unravel .
According to Giraldi , the Feds are " investigating a number of U.S. citizens , including an individual who held very senior security positions in the Clinton and Bush White Houses . "
There has been much talk of the Israel Lobby and its distorting effect on U.S. foreign policy , especially in regard to the Middle East .
What is never talked about is the extent to which the Lobby is part of Israel ’s very active and efficient intelligence - gathering operation .
The aboveground pro-Israel movement and the covert fifth column are often intermingled organizationally : that ’s what the indictment [ . pdf ] of AIPAC honchos Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman is all about .
Back in 2004 , I characterized the Rosen - Weissman case as follows :
" Like a dorsal fin poking just above the water , the trial promises us a glimpse of a creature much larger than appears at first sight .
Whether the trial will draw it up to the surface remains to be seen .
In any case , the magnitude of the problem posed by the covert activities of our ally  heretofore ignored or covered up  is all too clear . "
As in the case of Kadish , the origin of the Rosen - Weissman prosecution is an enigma wrapped in a mystery .
The Feds were watching two Israeli officials , including Naor Gilon , the Washington embassy ’s top political officer , as they ate lunch in a McLean , Va. , restaurant , when Larry Franklin , the head of the Pentagon ’s Iran desk , walked in on the Israelis and started spilling secrets left and right .
Which raises the question : why were the Feds watching the Israelis ?
According to Knight - Ridder ’s Warren Strobel , reporting in 2004 , the investigation into Israeli spying had " been going on for more than two years . "
Richard Sale reported for UPI that " In 2001 , the FBI discovered new , ‘ massive ’ Israeli spying operations in the East Coast , including New York and New Jersey , " and they began watching Gilon , who eventually led them to Franklin . "
The Jewish Telegraphic Agency dates the beginning of the inquiry at precisely that crucial juncture : " Information garnered during the investigation into alleged leaks from a Pentagon analyst to the two former AIPAC staffers suggests the FBI began probing AIPAC officials just before the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . "
The Israeli spy network embedded in our government is deeply burrowed into the neoconservative apparatus that lied us into war .
Exhibit A : the Office of Special Plans .
At least two Pentagon employees engaged in this cherry - picking " intelligence " unit set up by former assistant secretary of defense Douglas Feith were reportedly under investigation " on suspicion that one of them passed highly classified U.S. military information to the government of Israel , according to federal law enforcement officials . "
This was the outfit that promoted fraudster Ahmed Chalabi and utilized his phony " evidence " of Iraqi WMDs to goad the U.S. into war .
Chalabi , it turned out , was passing U.S. secrets to Tehran  including the fact that the Americans had broken the Iranian code .
Espionage surrounds the neocons like a cloud of smoke , and has for years .
There ’s got to be some fire there .
What is striking about all this is the sheer size and ambitious scope of the Israeli underground in America .
Pollard , Kadish , Rosen , Weissman , Franklin , that holder of " very senior security positions in the Clinton and Bush White Houses "  all worked in tandem with , and sometimes inside of , the aboveground Israel Lobby .
These fifth columnists are bold to the point of brazenness and have operated relatively freely up until now .
Their ability to cover their tracks  and cry " anti-Semitism " in answer to rude inquiries as to the treasonous nature of their activities  has so far served them well : their luck , however , may be running out , along with Uncle Sam ’s patience .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
More commentary on the Kadish spy case over at Taki ’s Magazine .
Check it out .
If you ’re not reading my occasional " morning links " column over there , then you ’re missing out on all the fun I ’m having writing it .
And over at The American Conservative blog , I once again raise the question : when is Andrew Sullivan , as part of his ongoing recantation of his former pro-war views , going to repudiate his infamous call to launch a nuclear strike against Iraq ?
I ’ll be speaking at the third - annual meeting of the Property and Freedom Society , which will take place May 22 - 26 , 2008 , in Bodrum , Turkey , at the Karia Princess Hotel .
My topic is “ The Ron Paul Phenomenon and the Prospects for Liberty in the U.S. , ” more specifically , the state of the libertarian movement in the U.S. , which I hope will prove informative to the decidedly international cast of participants , who will be coming from every part of Europe in what promises to be a most enlightening convocation and exchange of views .
Set against the backdrop of what used to be known as Halicarnassus , home of Herodotus , we ’ll hear from a great variety of speakers , including John Laughland , whom I ’ve always greatly admired , as well as conference organizer Hans Hermann Hoppe , Paul Gottfried , Peter Brimelow , Tom DiLorenzo , the British libertarian activist Sean Gabb , and a host of other academics and activists .
I greatly look forward to this , and urge you  especially my European and Middle Eastern readers  to investigate attending .
The conference is going to be fascinating , and Bodrum , I hear , can be quite a lot of fun .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SAN JOSE , CA - In a first - of - its - kind ruling , a federal court today held that the U.S. Constitution bars deliberate subversion by the federal government of state medical marijuana laws .
" Utilizing selective arrests and prosecutions , the federal government has sought to sabotage California ’s reasoned approach to medical marijuana use , " said Graham Boyd , Director of the ACLU Drug Law Reform Project .
" For the first time , a court has recognized that a calculated plan by the federal government to undercut state medical marijuana laws is patently unconstitutional .
Today ’s decision forecasts an end to any organized federal effort to sabotage state medical marijuana laws . "
While previous high - profile cases affirmed the federal government ’s power to enforce federal drug laws against individual medical marijuana patients and providers on a case - by - case basis , today ’s ruling clearly recognizes that a calculated pattern of federal enforcement can render state medical marijuana laws effectively inoperable , which would violate the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution .
" It is obvious to anyone paying attention that federal officials have gone to great lengths to sabotage state efforts to allow for appropriate medical marijuana use , " said Boyd .
" The court made clear that this deliberate interference - once proved - would be unequivocally unconstitutional . "
The case , County of Santa Cruz v. Mukasey , originated in 2003 when Bingham McCutchen LLP and the Drug Policy Alliance , along with private attorneys Gerald F. Uelmen and Benjamin Rice , sued the federal government for raiding a Santa Cruz - area medical marijuana cooperative , the Wo / Men ’s Alliance for Medical Marijuana .
The ACLU and others argued , and the court agreed , that the U.S. Constitution permits states to determine for themselves what is legal and what is illegal under state law , and that the federal government may not deliberately undermine this process .
" The federal government has purposely set out to systematically subvert California ’s medical marijuana program , " said Daniel Abrahamson , director of legal affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance .
" Let us hope that this ruling leads to the merciful end of the federal government ’s cruel war on sick and dying medical marijuana patients . "
In today ’s ruling , which rejected the federal government ’s motion to dismiss the case , Judge Jeremy Fogel of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California , San Jose Division , relied on U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Chief Judge Alex Kozinski ’s opinion in Conant v. Walters , which stated , in part , " Applied to our situation , this means that , much as the federal government may prefer that California keep medical marijuana illegal , it cannot force the state to do so . "
In addition to U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey , the lawsuit names as defendants U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) agents involved in the raid of WAMM , and administrators of the DEA and Office of National Drug Control Policy .
The court ’s ruling is available online at : www.aclu.org/drugpolicy/medmarijuana/36494lgl20080820.html
FBI to probe police actions in drug bust gone wrong RAW STORY
Published : Friday August 8 , 2008
Print This Email This
The FBI has begun an investigation into the actions of police officers who raided the home of a Maryland mayor , killing his dogs and tying up his family , The Washington Post reported Friday .
The police cleared the mayor and his wife of all charges Friday , but it is unclear whether that development will end the FBI 's probe of possible violations of the couple 's civil rights .
The agency 's investigation was a request from Berwyn Heights Mayor Cheye Calvo and his wife Trinity Tomsic , who said that the unwarranted attack by law enforcement officials illustrates the deeper problems with county police .
" We have witnessed a frightening law enforcement culture in which the law is disregarded , the rights of innocent occupants are ignored and the rights of innocent animals mean nothing , " Calvo said .
" A shadow was cast over our good names .
We were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us . "
County police said they would cooperate with the investigation .
" We 've tried to establish a pattern of transparency and clarity about the way in which we do our work , and I 'm sure the chief will be cooperative and forthcoming in any investigation , " Prince George 's police spokeswoman Sharon Taylor said yesterday .
The FBI has already begun " reviewing the events that occurred at Mr. Calvo 's residence , " said Richard J. Wolf , spokesman for the FBI in Baltimore .
Those events occurred on July 29 , when a SWAT team stormed Calvo 's home after he took a package inside his home that undercover police had left on his doorstep .
The box contained 32lbs. of marijuana , which a drug dog had sniffed out at a regional shipping center .
Though addressed to Mrs. Calvo , the family said they had no prior knowledge of the delivery .
While changing his clothes , a SWAT team raided the house and shot his two Labradors , then dragged the disrobed mayor downstairs , bound and at gunpoint , to be interrogated along with his mother - in - law .
In spite of his repeated claims that he 's the town 's mayor , and not a drug dealer , police persisted with the interrogation .
" They told a detective that I was crazy , until he told the local police , " said Calvo during an August 8 interview on CNN .
" The chief did call me at my home and cleared us [ of any wrongdoing ] , " said the mayor during the interview .
His wife sobbed about the death of the couple 's dogs during a press conference that was widely televised Friday , recounting the moment when a neighborhood girl came over to express her condolences over the death of the dogs .
" A little girl came to our house after this happened , the next day .
I did n't know who she was .
She did n't know us .
But she saw us walking the dogs every day , and waving at her , " the mayor 's wife told a news conference .
" And she came in , she gave me a big hug and she said to me , she said , ' If the police shot your dogs dead and did this to you , how can I trust them ? ' "
Police have since arrested two people allegedly involved with the drug operation , in which a delivery service would leave packages containing marijuana outside unsuspecting people 's houses , then another member of the ring would come by and pick them up .
Around 121 pounds ( 50 kilograms ) of marijuana have been collected by police , who have not apologized to the mayor for their actions .
Calvo said he hopes that others who have experienced similar abuses by police will benefit by his speaking out .

A weight washer makes short work of enormous cleaning tasks ( and little ones as well ) .
Since water showers from a washer ’s spout with such power , it can lift up and expel soil , buildup , and grime that a customary nursery hose basically can’t deal with Best Electric Pressure Washer .
Weight washers are regularly helpful for cleaning decks , garages , house siding , wall , vehicles , and porch furniture .
Maybe the absolute most mainstream pressure washer extras are new spouts or shower tips .
There are uncommonly planned spouts that change the size and force of the shower , permitting you to handle progressively exact employments or spread more zone immediately .
To really sweeten the deal , these extra spouts or splash tips are commonly very reasonable .
Another well known adornment is the surface more clean .
This connection includes a round deck on wheels , commonly furnished with pivoting shower spouts , that lets you clean an assortment of floor surfaces rapidly and all the more proficiently .
Furthermore , there are an assortment of other weight washer connections , for example , brushes and surface cleaners that can assist you with handling explicit employments .
The auto fire up and shutdown include likewise dispenses with siphon harm brought about by broadened sitting .
We did n’t care for the cleanser infusion framework since it utilizes exclusive cleanser bottles that are accessible just at Sears .
Be that as it may , you can retrofit the unit with a standard siphon tube / channel .
Since the battery must be connected all year , you ’ll need an AC outlet in your capacity region .
It ’s fueled by a Briggs and Stratton vertical - shaft motor with a programmed gag .
We suggest a weight washer with a metal shower wand instead of a plastic one .
A metal wand is increasingly solid over the long haul and makes purchasing extra extras simpler .
The shower design on a metal wand is dictated by a removable tip that you essentially click into the wand ’s end .
These tips go from structures that center the water for an extraordinary 0 - degree pinpoint to 40 - degree tips that make a scattered shower for washing .
The RY142300 has an enlistment engine , which is discovered uniquely on top of the line models ( as a rule around the $ 200 imprint ) and includes various points of interest .
To start with , enlistment engines are demonstrated to last longer than the littler general engines of most of private weight washers .
Second , because of the plan of an enlistment engine , it is a lot bigger and heavier .
Since pressure washers can be unsteady , the additional weight settles the RY142300 .
Ryobi has improved this perspective further by structuring this model with an extremely low focal point of gravity ; in any event , when we gave the hose a decent pull , we could n’t spill the unit .
Enlistment engines are additionally calmer than all inclusive engines , as they will in general murmur as opposed to cry .
The Ryobi engine makes a genuinely harmless sound the extent that washer engines go .
One thing to note is that when the Ryobi engine is fueled on , it runs continually , as on a gas pressure washer .
The other electric washers in our experimental group cycled on just when we pulled the shower trigger .
The advantage here is that the RY142300 consistently has its full weight prepared and pausing , though the other electric models need a moment or two to increase to full weight .
Except if you were utilizing your washer constantly , you would n’t generally see any distinction .
Electric weight washers by and large convey around 1.4 to 1.5 GPM , and you would be unable to locate a model which conveys more than that .
I was somewhat confounded by this since it is conceivable to get progressively out of electric weight washers .
I speculate this is on the grounds that more GPM would require the utilization of increasingly costly materials , and that would drive the cost up .
Electric weight washers have the edge with regards to measurements , weight , support and convenience .
They are little , light , and a breeze to utilize .
The main restricting variable with regards to their movability is the reality they must be snared to a wellspring of power .
Electric weight washers are additionally clear champs with regards to indoor use since they do n’t deliver any unsafe exhaust .
They ’re likewise a lot calmer .
On the off chance that your electric weight washer continues cycling on and off , it could be a weight issue instead of a motor issue , particularly if the water is by all accounts gradually blurring on and off as opposed to out of nowhere removing .
Check for clear water spills in the hose and washer casing to ensure that no water is depleting out and making the weight drop .
On the off chance that you discover one , either supplant the hose or fix it with something waterproof , similar to elastic fix tape .
On the off chance that there ’s no break , you may need to check the motor and check whether there ’s some kind of problem with one of the associations , or take a gander at the spot it ’s attracting power from to check whether it ’s really staying aware of the interest .
It speaks to how much power is given by the weight washer .
While investigating this factor , recollect that , more weight demonstrates all the more cleaning power .
It is estimated in pounds per square inch .
Purchaser pressure washers are accessible from 1,300 to 1,800 PSI .
They are reasonable for little private employments like cleaning shades , washing grass furniture , washing vehicles , and spot cleaning mold .
Substantial weight washers originate from 2,000 to 3,000 PSI .
They are appropriate for garages , expelling intense stains , carports and cleaning house sides .
At last , proficient evaluation electric weight washers accompany 3,000 + PSI .

Sports contracts over the years have gotten so extreme that they make even wealthy people envious .
It was n’t always like this , this era of contracts started in the late 80’s with Kirby Puckett being the first player to receive a $ 3 million dollar contract in 1989 according to the Sporting News .
That might not seem like a lot , but for MLB , it was a great deal at that time .
And it did not stop there .
That was just what opened the flood gates .
Here ’s a detailed breakdown of the 25 biggest and most expensive sports contracts ever signed ( in descending order ) .
1 – Jason Giambi – New York Yankees – Baseball – $ 120,000,000
These days , Jason Giambi seems more of a DH than a power hitting first baseman .
That said , he was once the power hitting first baseman for the Oakland Athletics , but when Mark McQuire was traded in 1997 , Jason became the first baseman .
In 2003 , Giambi was named in the Balco investigation , blemishing his otherwise promising career .
Since then , he apologized to the organization as well as the fans and promised to return to his previous form .
2 – Shaquille O’Neal – Los Angeles Lakers – Basketball – $ 120,000,000
Shaquille O’Neal originally played college basketball for the LSU tigers .
He is probably one of the biggest players in the NBA to come along since Kareem Abdul - Jabbar or Wilt Chamberlain , and we ’re not referring to his stature .
The contract in question was signed in 1996 and ran through the 2003 season and made NBA history .
Shaq , as he is endearingly called , spent the first 4 years of his career with the Orlando Magic where he helped them win 20 more games than in the previous year , and made his first NBA All - Star game in1993 .
Shaq is also one of the few players that has a better average shooting field goals ( .581 lifetime ) than he does with free throws ( .524 lifetime ) .
3 – Mike Hampton – Colorado Rockies – Baseball – $ 121,000,000
Mike Hampton signed an 8 year deal with the Colorado Rockies worth $ 121,000,000 in 2001 .
What ’s interesting about this deal is that Hampton has n’t even pitched extensively since August 19 , 2005 .
He faced several injuries in 2005 , and underwent Tommy Johns surgery to repair his throwing arm .
In 2002 , a year after the contract was signed , the Rockies traded him to the Florida Marlins , who then proceeded to trade him to the Atlanta Braves .
Once in Atlanta , Mike was able to work with then pitching coach Leo Mazzone who helped him get out of the funk he had gotten himself into while in Colorado .
4 – Tim Duncan – San Antonio Spurs – Basketball – $ 122,007,704
Tim Duncan ’s contract runs through the 2010 season with the San Antonio Spurs .

Duncan was originally picked in the 1997 draft by the Spurs after a stellar college career for the Wake Forest Demon Decons .
Tim Duncan ’s entire professional career has been with this one team , which in today ’s sports , is remarkable in itself .
Tim holds many awards , including the 1998 NBA Rookie of the year , 2002 and 2003 NBA MVP , 1999 , 2003 , and 2005 NBA Finals MVP , and a 4 time NBA Champion .

In the 1993 draft , he was selected by the Orlando Magic who then proceeded to trade him to the Golden State Warriors .
Chris played there through 1994 when he was traded to the Washington Bullets where he played until 1998 .
In May of that year , Chris was traded again ; this time he was going to the Sacramento Kings .
In 2001 , the Kings locked him into a 7 year deal , but traded him once again in 2005 , this time to Philidephia .
Chris is still playing today as he has come full circle , playing in 2008 for the Golden State Warriors .
6 – Alexander Ovechkin – Washington Capitals – Ice hockey – $ 124,000,000
This is by far the longest contract that made this list .
In 2008 the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League signed Alexander Ovechkin to the biggest contract of the league .
He was originally drafted by the Capitals in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft first overall .
Due to the 2004 - 05 NHL lockout , Ovechkin did not start playing in the NHL until the 2005 season , but when he did start playing , he became the first rookie that was named to the NHL First All - Star Team in 15 years .
Overchkin ’s performance , and therefore his value continued to rise the more he played and continued to set records and collect rewards .
On January 13 , 2008 , ESPN reported that Ovechkin and Washington Capital had come to terms on this 13 year contract for $ 124 million .
7 – Michael Schumacher – Ferrari – Auto racing – $ 124,000,000
In 1996 , Michael Schumacher and Ferrari came to an agreement on a 4 year contract .
One of the most amazing things was that out of the 7 championships that Schumacher won , none of them was during this span .
His first two championships were 1994 and 1995 and his last 5 were 2000 – 2004 .
The first titles he was racing for the Benetton - Ford team .

Rashard has averaged 16.8 points a game over his 10 year career .
Rashard never played college ball as he opted out and went into the 1998 NBA draft .
He was selected by the SuperSonics in the third pick of the second round that year , making him the 32nd pick overall .
Lewis has been to the playoffs a total of 4 times , three times with Seattle and the last time ( 07- 08 season ) with Orlando .
He holds an average of 17.1 points during the playoffs
9 – Vernon Wells – Toronto Blue Jays – Baseball – $ 126,000,000
December 15 , 2006 saw Vernon Wells locked in with the Toronto Blue Jays on a seven year contract that would pay him $ 126 million dollars over that time .
This contract will take him through the 2014 season and includes a “ no trade ” clause in it as well to protect the interest of Wells .
Vernon broke into pro baseball when he entered the amateur draft in 1997 and was selected by Toronto in the first round as the fifth overall pick .
He bounced through the organization until he got his shot in 2002 with the Major League club .
He belongs to the Top 500 home run hitters of all time list .
10 – Barry Zito – San Francisco Giants – Baseball – $ 126,000,000
Barry Zito locked into a 7 year deal with the San Francisco Giants worth $ 126 million dollars .
Barry has become one of the dominant left - handed pitchers of the decade .
He was originally drafted in 1996 by the Seattle Mariners and again in 1998 by the Texas Rangers , but did not sign with either of these teams .
Instead , he finished his college days at USC after transferring from Los Angeles Pierce College ( and UC Santa Barbara before that ) .
Barry was drafted again by the Oakland Athletics in 1999 and made major league debut against the Anaheim Angels on July 22 , 2000 .
He pitched for the Athletics from 2000 to 2006 .
11 – Kevin Garnett – Minnesota Timberwolves – Basketball – $ 126,000,000
Kevin Garnett is currently playing for the NBA ’s Boston Celtics .
When he was with the Minnesota Timberwolves , he had signed a seven year deal with the Timberwolves that would pay him $ 126 million dollars .
Garnett was originally drafted in the 1995 NBA draft and was the first player since Moses Malone to be drafted right out of high school since 1974 .
Minnesota decided that this would be their Franchise Player but they became increasingly frustrated with him starting in 2004 and through 2007 due to issues with the team and their inability to win .
On July 31st of 2007 , all of that was remedied as Kevin was traded to the Boston Celtics .
Ironically enough , he would go on to win a NBA Championship with the Boston Celtics in 2008 .
12 – Jermaine O’Neal – Indiana Pacers – Basketball – $ 126,558,000
Jermaine O’Neal is another player that never graced the floor of a college basketball team .
A 6 ′ 11 ″ , he declared his NBA eligibility in the 1996 draft .
He was taken 17th overall by the Portland Trail Blazers that year .
From the day O’Neal entered the league , till the time he was traded to the Indiana Pacer , O’Neal believed that he was treated unfairly .
O’Neal spent most of his time in Portland on their bench and was eventually traded to the Pacers where he debuted as a starter in the 2001 season .
The Pacers were so impressed with O’Neal that on Jul 16 , 2003 , they decided to give Jermaine a six year deal that held a value of $ 126,558,000 .
13 – Peyton Manning – Indianapolis Colts – Football – $ 132,500,000
Peyton Manning got his long term contract in 2005 when he signed on with the Indianapolis Colts .
Peyton had already spent 7 years in Indianapolis as the Colts quarterback , and in 2004 he would have a record setting season ( which was one of the main reasons the Colts wanted to desperately lock him in for the remainder of his career ) .
While still in college , Manning had amassed 11,201 yards and 89 touchdowns , winning 39 of 45 games as a starter , and becoming the Volunteer ’s all - time leading passer .
His highlights , records , and awards would not stop there though .
In 2006 , the Colts had their best season yet as Peyton led them to a Superbowl Championship against the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI .
14 – Alfonso Soriano – Chicago Cubs – Baseball – $ 136,000,000
Alfonso Soriano has made a name for himself during the New York Yankee years as their lead off hitter .
He has made the 30 - 30 club , the 40 - 40 club , and is part of the Top 500 home run hitters of all time just to name a few of his achievements so far .
2001 was Soriano ’s rookie year and he finished third in the Rookie of the Year award .
In 2004 , Alfonso was traded to the Texas Rangers along with a minor leaguer for Alex Rodriguez and a cash compensation of $ 67 million .
Soriano played in Texas through the 2005 season when in December , he was traded again .
The Chicago Cubs also offered him an eight - year contract worth nearly $ 136 million dollars which he accepted .
15 – Kobe Bryant – Los Angeles Lakers – Basketball – $ 136,400,000
Kobe Bryant ’s 7 - year contract with the Los Angeles Lakers gives him the title of the most expensive Basketball contract of all time .

He made history when he became the first guard to ever be drafted out of high school in 1996 , giving him instant notoriety .
Kobe ’s contract came around the same time that the Lakers decided it was time to part ways with Shaquille O’Neal in favor of building their team around Kobe .
Unfortunately , the Lakers have not won another NBA Championship since then ( even as Kobe has ammassed numerous awards and achievements ) .
16 – Johan Santana – New York Mets – Baseball – $ 137,500,000
Johan Santana had one of the biggest and most talked about trade potentials in baseball ’s off season .
The New York Mets signed him to a 6 - year , $ 137 million dollar contract that would make him the highest paid pitcher in the Major Leagues .
And well - deserved when you look at what he can do to an offense .
Santana debuted with the Minnesota Twins on April 3 , 2000 and came out of the bullpen against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays , as they were known then .
He got his first major league start against the Kansas City Royals on August 7 , 2000 .
Santana holds a 3.29 career ERA that teams lovem and opponents are batting just .219 lifetime against him .

Miguel Cabrera busted on the scene in 2003 in style with the Florida Marlins by hitting a walk off home run in his first major league game on June 20 , 2003 .
He was just 20 years old .
His bat was so good that he was very instrumental in the playoffs for the Florida Marlins and was a huge part of them beating the Yankees that year .
Miguel would end up on the cover of the ESPN magazine during the off season due to his exceptional statistics which showed no signs of tapering off .
In December of 2007 , the Marlins agreed on a deal that would send Cabrera and team mate Dontrelle Willis to the Tigers for 6 players .
In March of 2008 , Miguel Cabrera and the Detroit Tigers came to an agreement on his most impressive contract of his still young career .
It is an 8 year deal that will take him through the 2015 season .

2007 saw Ferrari snap up one of the best drivers in Formula One Racing and giving him the second largest contract in racing history .
Kimi Räikkönen busted on the scene in 2001 with the Sauber Formula

The other 3 years saw a 6th place finish in 2002 , a 7th place finish in 2004 , and a 5th place finish in 2006 .
Kimi did not see success until 2007 when he moved to Ferrari .
He was able to capture a 1st place finish in 2007 and currently is 2nd in 2008 .
His career was plagued with technical problems which caused 38 % of his races to end in retirement .
20 – Fernando Alonso – McLaren – Auto Racing – $ 160,000,000
Even though McLaren™ decided to make Fernando the highest paid driver on the Formula One circuit in 2007 , Alonso did n’t stick around for the 4 years of the contract due to an “ on again , off again ” relationship over the next two years .
Alonzo started his F1 career with Minardi in 2001 , as the third youngest driver ever to start a Formula One race when he debuted at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix .
On August 24 , 2003 , Alonso would be the youngest driver ever to win a Formula One race when he took the checkered flag at the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix .
On December 19 , 2005 , Alonso announced that he would be moving to McLaren in 2007 after his contract expired with Renault .
In 2008 , Alonso would be back in a Renault owned car .
21 – Manny Ramirez – Boston Redsox – Baseball – $ 160,000,000
When Manny Ramirez signed this contract , it made him the highest paid Red Sox player of all time .

22 – Michael Vick – Atlanta Falcons – Football – $ 167,000,000
Michael Vick had a celebrated career at Virginia Tech prior to be drafted by the Falcons in 2001 .
He joined Tommy Nobis , Steve Bartkowski , and Aundray Bruce as the Falcons only # 1 overall picks in all of club history .
Michael ’s contract was short lived as he is currently serving a sentence for issues relating to his property in Virginia .
His contract was signed in 2005 and extended to 2014 .
It remains to be seen if he can come back to the Falcons and even if he can , will he still have the effect that he once had .
23 – Derek Jeter – New York Yankees – Baseball – $ 189,000,000
One of only 2 baseball players with a 10 - year contract , Derek Jeter started his career as a Yankee in 1992 as he was drafted 6th overall and has always worn the pinstripes .
He has earned himself the name of Mr. Yankee , and is currently listed as the Yankees ’ captain .
He has also played in 9 All - Star games representing the New York Yankees and ranks in the top ten in the production catergories of hits ( second ) , runs ( fourth ) , and batting average ( seventh ) .
Derek signed his new 10 - year contract in 2001 .
It currently runs through 2011 .
24 – Alex Rodriguez – Texas Rangers – Baseball – $ 252,000,000
Alex received his first major contract in Texas when he became a free agent after the 2000 season was over .
The Texas Rangers needed someone to build their team around after hitting rock bottom , and Alex seemed like the perfect player for the job .
Unfortunately , however , A - Rod did not seem to be working for Texas as in 2001 and 2002 they still finished in the cellar of their division .
It was time to let Alex go , and Texas did exactly that , right before the start of the 2004 season .
25 – Alex Rodriguez – New York Yankees – Baseball – $ 275,000,000
One of only 2 baseball players with a 10 year contract , Alex was originally traded to the Yankees on February 15 , 2004 to replace a void created when then third baseman Aaron Boone injured his knee in a pick - up game of basketball .
This injury put him out for the entire year .
Furthermore , Texas had already been looking for a place to dump Alex and his enormous salary and this was just the opening that they had wanted .
The re-signing of Rodriquez was strange to say the least as he would be opting out of his $ 252 million dollar 10 - year contract .
Lucky for him , the New York Yankees picked him up soon after , and signed him to a new 10 - year contract worth $ 275 million .
Interview with Gary Wang and Marc Van der Chijs , founders of Tudou.com - China 's most popular video sharing site .
( Tipped off by Startupplay.com According to Gary Wang Tudou.com is already streaming more minutes of video content every month than YouTube ( 15 billion minutes per month vs. 3.5 billion ) .
As Wang says , " those numbers are never accurate " , but considering the fact that Chinese video sharing sites have become magnets for full - lenght movies from around the world ( Read : " Chinese sharing movies for the world " ) , I can imagine that they are streaming many , many minutes of video content .
Take , for instance , a couple who buy a $ 500,000 home and make a down payment of 20 percent , or $ 100,000 .
With a 6.43 percent interest rate on a 30 - year fixed loan , their monthly payment would be $ 2,510 .
Over the 30 - year life of the mortgage , they would pay a total of about $ 1 million for the home , including the down payment .
But what if that couple had waited and the home price dropped 9 percent to $ 455,000 but mortgage rates rose to 7.01 percent ?
Now , the 20 percent down payment would be $ 91,000 , and the monthly payments $ 2,424 .
The buyers would end up paying a total of about $ 964,000 for the house , or nearly 4 percent less .
If the buyers were able to refinance to a lower rate a few years later , the total cost could be even lower .
The calculations change , however , when mortgage rates go even higher .
Once the rates move above 7.36 percent , they begin to lose the benefits of the 9 percent drop in the house price .
If you are looking for an apartment in Manhattan , where prices are near their highs and are not expected to fall as much has they have elsewhere , the rise in mortgage rates quickly starts to affect how much you can afford .
A $ 500,000 apartment ( which could be a studio , since this is Manhattan we ’re talking about ) with a $ 100,000 down payment at a 7.01 percent rate means your monthly payments would be nearly $ 2,664 .
The total cost of the property , including down payment , would be $ 1.06 million .
“ Prices have come down quite a bit since the top of the market , and home values are better than they were a year ago , ” Ms. Chen said .
“ But I am still cautioning to wait and see how much further prices will fall , particularly in regions that were most overblown during the housing boom .
If you ’re looking for bargain basement prices , I do n’t think we ’re there yet . ”
Mortgage rates , on the other hand , may be even less predictable .
For all we know , “ they might go down next week or the week after , ” she added .
“ In the longer term , rates are still relatively attractive to where we think they might be next year . ”
That is why it may be wise for homeowners looking to refinance out of , say , an adjustable - rate mortgage , to lock in a rate now .
If your house drops in value , and rates continue to balloon , you may be out of luck .
Windows 3.11 Reaches End -Of - Life ( Seriously )
Nope , I ’m not kidding on this one .
Apparently Microsoft has still been selling this OS in the embedded systems market for quite some time .
That must be why the simulators at Star Trek :
The Experience are using the OS to run their systems ( maybe that ’s why they ’re closing this September ) .
But according to Microsoft ’s John Coyne , it ’s finally the end of the road for this killer operating system .
It ’s truly the end of an era .

Should Congress Go Into Special Session For Impeachment Hearings ?
Congress went home for their August recess but they left town without letting the American people witness impeachment hearings exposing the alleged high crimes and misdemeanors of the Bush administration .
39 Articles of Impeachment are pending in the House Judiciary Committee , H. Res. 333-3 , H. Res. 1258-35 , and H. Res. 1345 - 1 , presented to Congress by Rep Dennis Kucinich , and each and every Article is " privileged " , which , according to Jefferson 's House Rules , requires immediate action by the full House over and above all other business , including a scheduled recess in August .
By going into Special Session , Congress would have ample time in August for impeachment hearings and voting on each and every Article of Impeachment , rather than coming back in September and announcing they have no time for impeachment hearings .
NO , Congress should not be called into Special Session for impeachment hearings
YES , Congress should be called into Special Session for impeachment hearings

In contrast , Mr. McCain ’s relationship with evangelicals has long been troubled .
In 2000 , when he was running against Mr. Bush for the Republican nomination , Mr. McCain castigated Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell as “ agents of intolerance . ”
In a sign of the lingering distrust , Mr. McCain finished last out of nine Republican candidates in a straw poll last year at the Values Voter Summit in Washington , a gathering for socially conservative activists .
James C. Dobson , the influential founder of the evangelical group Focus on the Family , released a statement in February , when Mr. McCain was on the verge of securing the Republican nomination , affirming that he would not vote for Mr. McCain and would instead stay home if he became the nominee .
Dr. Dobson later softened his stance and said he would vote but has remained critical of Mr. McCain .
“ For John McCain to be competitive , he has to connect with the base to the point that they ’re intense enough that they ’re contagious , ” said Tony Perkins , president of the Family Research Council .
“ Right now they ’re not even coughing . ”
The balancing act Mr. McCain faces in appealing to both moderate voters and evangelicals was starkly illustrated last month when he rejected the endorsements of the Rev. John Hagee and the Rev. Rod Parsley , prominent evangelical leaders , after controversial statements by the two came to light .
Mr. Parsley has been vocally anti-Islam and Mr. Hagee , in a sermon , said Hitler and the Holocaust had been part of God ’s plan to drive the Jews to Palestine .
Mr. McCain ’s actions complicated his relationship with evangelical leaders , some of whom said in interviews that the senator ’s actions contributed to the impression among some evangelicals that he did not know or understand them .
They argued that he should have stood by them , while making clear that he did not necessarily agree with all of their views .
“ I think that was a stumble that will add to the challenges here , ” said Gary Bauer , president of the group American Values , who in February became arguably the most visible evangelical leader to begin actively working on Mr. McCain ’s behalf .
“ Those are both very influential men and it will just make things more challenging to accomplish between now and November . ”
President George W. Bush , who played baseball , coached Little League , owned a big league team and watches the Texas Rangers at every opportunity , can't stay away from the U.S. teams at the Beijing Olympic games .
Today , as the busy crowd over at our Olympics blog notes , after an hour 's brisk bit of mountain - biking himself , Bush paid another visit to the American athletes , watching the women warm up for softball , regretting the disappearance of that sport from the next Olympics ( " It 's good for the world to have girls playing softball and these women are going to show young girls how to win " ) and trying his hand , so to speak , at volleyball .
Bush knuckled off a couple of lobs , but defending gold medalists Misty May - Treanor and Kerri Walsh gave the chief executive some pointers .
Then after a good play , in the tradition of female volleyballers , May - Treanor turned , bent over slightly and offered her bikinied rear - end for the 43rd president to slap .
" Mr. President , " she said , " want to ? "
Want to has nothing to do with it in public life .
As the son of a president , a husband of nearly 37 years , the father of two daughters , the subject of some attempted tabloid exposes and a seasoned political veteran , who is not a female athlete but knows that every camera for a half - mile is trained on him , Bush wisely chose instead to brush his hand across the small of May - Treanor 's back .
( See photo . )
Darn !
That did , however , lead to a hilarious Reuters photo caption and immediate correction ( hat tip to Mike Allen 's Saturday Playbook ) .
Original photo caption : “ U.S. President George W. Bush playfully pats the backside of U.S. Women 's Beach Volleyball team player Misty May - Treanor ( L ) at her invitation while visiting the Chaoyang Park Beach Volleyball Grounds at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing , China , August 9 , 2008 .
Team mate Kerri Walsh ( R ) watches . ”

That English language can be tricky , can't it ?
" Back " and " backside " are so similar but seem to have completely different connotations .

Homes McCain does n't remember having worth nearly $ 14 million

Even though John McCain can't remember how many houses he and his wife own , his political opponents have been keeping track of the multi-millionares ' holdings .
All told , the seven properties at which the McCains can rest their weary heads after long days on the campaign trail are valued at nearly $ 14 million , according to two separate research documents obtained by RAW STORY .
Perhaps we should cut the Republican presidential candidate some slack , though , for his fuzzy memory when it comes to counting his houses .
With so many ranches , condos and beachfront properties spread across the country , keeping track could prove a little tricky .
" I think -- I 'll have my staff get back to you , " McCain told two curious Politico reporters Wednesday .
The gaffe has set Democrats on a new populist offensive trying to paint McCain as an out - of - touch elitist .
Democratic candidate Barack Obama quickly released a Web ad hitting McCain over the home controversy , and he and his surrogates were on the offensive throughout the day Thursday .
" I guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make $ 5 million and if you do n't know how many houses you have , then it might not be surprising that you think the economy is fundamentally strong , " Obama said .
" But if you 're like me and you 've got one house , or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they do n't lose their home , you might have a different perspective . "
Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine , a top prospect to become Obama 's running mate , joked to CNN that McCain could n't say how many homes he had because " he could n't count high enough . "
( Video of Obama and Kain is posted below . )
Outside groups like the AFL - CIO and Brave New Films have been making the same argument in recent weeks .
McCain 's staff seemed to lowball the family 's property holdings , telling Politico they have " at least four " homes in Arizona , California and Virginia .
And a worried campaign spokesman lashed out , reciting some of the GOP 's favorite attempts to paint Obama as the out - of - touch elitist .
" Does a guy who made more than $ 4 million last year , just got back from vacation on a private beach in Hawaii and bought his own million - dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses ? " asked McCain spokesman Brian Rogers .
" Does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people ' cling ' to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular Americans ?
The reality is that Barack Obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average Americans . "
Estimates of how many homes McCain owns based on examinations of property records in those states put the number between seven and 10 , but a precise number is difficult to pinpoint depending on how one defines a distinct home .
The properties often are owned by holding companies or trusts controlled by McCain 's wife Cindy , an heiress to her father 's beer distributorship fortune believed to be worth up to $ 100 million .
The McCains famously like to vacation on their Sedona ranch -- in fact , the Arizonan senator is heading there this weekend for a few days away from the campaign trail .
The 15 - acre ranch where McCain hosted members of his press corps this year holds six separate houses , so does that count as one home or six ?
In Phoenix , the McCains ' primary residence is a nearly 7,000 square foot condominium worth about $ 4.66 million .
The McCains purchased two condos in 2006 and knocked down some walls to create the massive space in a high - rise that features valet parking , a rooftop swimming pool , personal spa services and on - staff housekeepers , among other amenities .
Whenever John or Cindy want some sun , sand and surf , they simply need to jet off to either of their two beachfront condos in Coronado , CA , worth a combined $ 4.8 million , according to property records .
Coronado , a small island near San Diego boasts the second best beach in the country .
If they need a different view of the Pacific than Coronado's , the McCains simply have to head about 15 miles up the coast to La Jolla , CA , where they own another condo estimated to be worth about $ 1.1 million that 's been in Cindy 's family since the early 1970s .
The senior senator from Arizona , McCain is needed on Capitol Hill from time to time .
But fret not , dear constituents , he 's not living under some bridge , or squeezing himself into a Capitol Hill row house like some common Democrat .
Thanks in large part to Cindy 's fortune , the McCains sleep easy in Washington 's quiet suburbs whenever Capitol Hill beckons .
The Cindy Hensley McCain Family
Trust puts them up in an $ 847,000 condo in Arlington , where the couple has lived while in Washington since 1993 .
There 's also the matter of the McCains ' daughter , 23 - year - old Meghan .
While many 20 - somethings are lucky if they get a car for a college graduation gift , Meghan 's present for finishing at Columbia University was a $ 700,000 loft in a hip section of downtown Phoenix .
A GQ profile of Meghan McCain , whose only job at moment seems to be blogging on her father 's behalf , described the loft 's interior as looking " like a spaceship furnished by West Elm . "
Wooden block letters arranged above McCain 's kitchen cabinets spell the word indulge .
One wonders if this is a lesson the young McCain learned from her parents , who , by the way , according to property records , paid for the condo in cash .

willyloman.wordpress.com — ( CNN , the same network that smeared George Carlin ’s memory the day he died by calling him “ indecent ” in it ’s headline about his passing , and owned by massive conglomerate Time - Warner / TBS - AOL , has posted a horribly biased and very brief blurb about the “ impeachment ” hearing today that would make the fiction writers at Fox News green with envy .
They chose this picture of Rep. Dennis Kucinich that can only be described as attempting to make him look either demented or mentally handicapped .
What follows is their article , in it ’s entirety .
Though they claim Dennis was “ the star witness ”  , Kucinich only spoke twice .
The real star witnesses were Vincent Bugliosi , Liz Holtzman and Bruce Fein .
But I guess CNN does n’t want people searching YouTube for their names right now .
The article , from start to finish , is disingenuous at best and at worst , complete corporatist shill .
During the “ impeachment ”  hearing some great speakers put forth clear and compelling reasons to impeach for the greater good of this country .
And this is what CNN , a “ reputable ”  news source puts up ?
It ’s a good thing they were n’t around during the Nixon administration .
CNN is no better than Fox News . )
At a crowded Judiciary Committee hearing today , House Democrats talked about impeaching President Bush ” ¦. to the disgust of the committee ’s Republicans .
It was purely stagecraft .
The day ’s star witness , Ohio Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich , received a noisy ovation filled with cheering , clapping and whistling as he walked into the hearing room .
Kucinich , who has introduced articles of impeachment , exhorted the committee to “ support and defend the constitution that has been trampled time and again over the last seven years . ” 
The hearing , technically , was not about impeachment but about executive power and its constitutional limitations .
Judiciary Chairman John Conyers , D - Michigan , ticked - down a list of items that included , in his words , “ the politicization of the Department of Justice , the misuse of signing statements , the misuse of authority with regard to detention , interrogation and rendition , possible manipulation of intelligence regarding the Iraq war , improper retaliation against critics of the administration ” ¦ and excessive secrecy . ” 
While Conyers called the evidence “ both credible and substantial , ”  Republicans scoffed .
Texas Rep. Lamar Smith , the senior Republican on the committee , dismissed the hearings as “ an anger management class . ” 
“ This hearing will not cause us to impeach the president ; it will only serve to impeach Congress ’s credibility , ”  Smith said .
Rep. Trent Franks , R - Arizona , went further with his criticism , saying Friday ’s session “ amuses our terrorist friends greatly , ”  and “ would make Alice in Wonderland roll her eyes . ” 
In the end , the committee took no action toward beginning an impeachment inquiry .
I was reading this Smalltalk tutorial the other day .
I found it excessively pedantic , but one turn of phrase caught my eye : the author claims that Smalltalk is a " foundational " programming language .
I agree with him , but what does this term mean ?
I would say that to me , a foundational language is one which is such a good exemplar of a particular programming paradigm that it can be seen as the embodiment of that paradigm .
Furthermore , foundational languages are worth learning even if you never program any substantial applications in them , because they will expand your mind and thus make you a better programmer .
That being the case ( says I ) , what are the foundational languages ?
I would say that the foundational languages certainly must include these :
C C is foundational because it is the canonical low - level imperative language with direct access to hardware .
It is n't particularly elegant or pleasant to program in , but it 's simple , and a lot of other languages are implemented in it ( in whole or in part ) .
Knowing C is for a programmer the equivalent of learning to tie your shoelaces -- it 's just basic knowledge that you are going to need sooner or later .
As curricula have moved away from C in favor of Java , I think a lot of students are going to lose sight of the underlying machine model that is vividly exposed in C but is hidden in other languages , and that 's a shame .
Scheme and Lisp Scheme ( and , by direct inheritance , Lisp ) is foundational for a number of reasons .
Lisp was the first language to support functional programming ( FP ) , and Scheme is a purified version of Lisp , which means among other things that it supports FP in a cleaner manner than Lisp itself does .
Scheme and Lisp also have very powerful syntactic macros ( the Scheme system is IMO nicer and more powerful than Lisp's , but I have n't used either system extensively ) ; this will completely blow your mind if you 're used to C's impoverished notion of macros .
Finally , Scheme supports continuations as first - class data values , and was the first well - known language to do so as far as I know .
A continuation captures the state of a computation so that it can be replayed later on ; this is an immensely powerful feature that can be used to model exception handling , backtracking , arbitrary control flow , and so on ( it also turns out to be useful in web programming ) .
Common Lisp has a very powerful object - oriented extension called CLOS ( Common Lisp Object System ) which AFAIK was the first object system that was based around multiple - dispatch ( multimethods ) instead of single dispatch .
This is a very cool feature that makes object - oriented programming more powerful and less kludgy than with conventional object systems ( though there are tradeoffs , as always ) .
Smalltalk Smalltalk is foundational because it is a pure object - oriented language all the way down .
Everything is an object , and objects can only talk to other objects by sending messages to each other ( Alan Kay , the designer of Smalltalk , has stated that messages are what is really important in Smalltalkk , not objects per se ) .
The significance of a message is that it can be interpreted in completely different ways by different objects .
So , if you send the " print " message to a number , it will print that number ( which will require some code to be executed ) , but if you send the " print " message to e.g. a list , that will cause quite different code to be executed .
Smalltalk also has an interesting structure whereby classes ( which are templates for objects ) are themselves objects , and can also respond to messages .
Classes are actually instances of metaclasses , which is another cool concept .
Furthermore , the Smalltalk system is naturally open and reflective ; you can query objects to learn more about them , you can construct messages on - the - fly and then perform them , and you can add methods to classes any time you want .
This gives rise to a very different way of thinking about programming than you 'd get in e.g. Java or C ++.
Erlang Erlang is a mostly - functional dynamically - typed language that is geared towards massively concurrent and distributed programming .
An Erlang program is a collection of smallish processes , each of which has its own state and communicates with other processes by sending asynchronous messages to them .
I have n't worked much with Erlang , but it's on the top of my to - learn list .
Those people who have worked with it seem quite enamored of it .
One thing Erlang offers is an alternative model of concurrency not bound to the traditional threading model ( which I 've always hated because it 's so hard to get a program working right ) .
In additional , distributing a concurrent program over a cluster of computers instead of one computer is very little extra work , which is important if you 're doing e.g. web programming and your web site becomes popular enough so that it needs to scale beyond a single machine .
Haskell Haskell is a purely functional , non -strict language .
If any language can claim to be foundational , this one can .
It would take pages to cover all the profound concepts that are in Haskell , and I do n't have enough patience to write that much , so I 'll just direct you to the Haskell home page .
Haskell is by far my favorite programming language .
Prolog Prolog is the canonical logic programming language ( or relational programming language , if you prefer ) .
In Prolog , you basically tell the system what you want , and it figures out how to compute it .
Thus , it 's a " declarative " programming language .
Of course , the reality is more complicated than this , but that 's the idea : to take a specification of a program and make it the program .
There are newer logic programming languages like Mercury that add static typing features to Prolog , and there are many extensions of Prolog to do e.g. constraint programming .
I 'm no expert on this area , but I find it fascinating as a glimpse of where programming may be headed in the future .
Certainly , every good programmer should learn Prolog .
Of course , there are probably other foundational languages I do n't know about yet , or do n't know well enough to comment on .
There are also cool languages like Forth , Icon and APL ( or its more modern successor J ) that have many neat features but which I do n't consider fundamental enough to be called foundational .
I could also make a case that SQL is sorta - kinda foundational , but since it is n't a Turing - complete language it does n't really qualify .
I also do n't consider assembly languages to be foundational in any serious sense , though they 're certainly the " foundation " of other languages in an implementation sense at least .
Also , there are some very good languages that I do n't consider foundational ; Python and Ocaml come to mind .
So the fact that a language is n't foundational is not an indictment of the language ; some good languages are " consolidators " which bring together known good ideas into a single package .
Nothing wrong with that .
Then there are also lots of languages which I consider flawed and / or mediocre ( Java , Ruby , C++ and C# come to mind ) , or languages I really do n't like at all ( PHP and Perl come to mind ) which ( no surprise ) are also not foundational .
Canada to deport another Iraq war resister to the US
By John Mackay
19 August 2008
The Canada Border Service Agency last week ordered Jeremy Hinzman , the first US soldier to refuse to serve in Iraq and apply for political refugee status in Canada , to be deported back to the US .
The ruling was handed down one month after Robin Long became the first US war resister to be deported from Canada .
Long is now being held at a county jail in Fort Carson , Colorado and will be tried by court martial in early September .
Hinzman , 29 , has a wife and two small children , the youngest just 3 months old .
They have all been ordered to leave Canada by September 23 .
Hinzman was handed a deportation order after a Citizenship and Immigration officer decided his application , filed under the pre-removal risk assessment program , did n’t qualify .
The program evaluates the risk a claimant will face if he or she is sent back to the country of origin .
Hinzman ’s final appeal of the rejection of his application for refugee status had previously been denied .
It was deemed that the US had a fair justice system and Hinzman ’s First Amendment right to free speech was protected .
Citizenship and Immigration also judged that President Bush ’s “ no child left behind ” program assured that his son would be able to get a good education .
Upon returning to the US , Hinzman will likely be detained and face court martial and a similar fate to that of Robin Long , which could include a five - year prison term for desertion .
While his attorneys plan to appeal the deportation order , Hinzman is not hopeful .
In an interview with the “ Democracy Now ” program , Hinzman said , “ This turns our lives upside down . ”
Hinzman joined the US Army in early 2001 , partly out of a sense of patriotism and adventure .
However , he was primarily attracted by the promise of financial support for a university education .
He says that more than a year after joining , he realized that he could not become a killer .
He felt he could not dehumanize the people he was supposed to shoot .
He applied for conscientious objector ( CO ) status in August 2002 , but his command threw his application away .
Hinzman subsequently reapplied while serving in Afghanistan , only to have his application turned down .
In Afghanistan , while his CO application was being processed , Hinzman played a non-combatant role as an assistant to Haliburton employees serving meals to soldiers .
Upon denial of his application for CO status , Hinzman was ordered to return to active duty .
When his unit returned to the US with the understanding that they would soon be sent to Iraq , Hinzman deserted , crossing the Canadian border in January 2004 with his wife and young son and claiming refugee status .
In December 2004 , Canada ’s Immigration and Refugee Board ( IRB ) rejected his request for refugee status , stating that he did not fit the criteria .
At that time , the Liberal government of Prime Minister Paul Martin intervened in the hearing to block discussion of the legality of the US invasion and occupation of Iraq .
The solicitor general argued that the legality of the war was beyond the purview of Canada ’s IRB .
It was deemed that the International Court of Justice in The Hague was the only body with the authority and competence to hear arguments concerning the war ’s legality .
Hinzman argued that he should be granted refugee status as the Iraq war had been condemned by the international community , and the Bush administration had lied about Saddam Hussein ’s regime having weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda .
However , the IRB argued that this was irrelevant to a refugee claim .
Major Canadian newspapers such as the Globe and Mail and the National Post editorialized that Hinzman was a “ deserter , ” not a “ refugee . ”
In November 2007 , the Supreme Court of Canada refused to hear a case involving Hinzman and another resister , Brandon Hughey .
The Court gave no reason for its refusal .
Prior to this , following Hinzman ’s initial appeal for refugee status , the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal had also refused to review the case .
While the Canadian government chose not to be involved in the Iraq war directly , these actions are symbolic of complicity in the form of political support for the US occupation .
Canada is actively involved in the war in Afghanistan , where 90 Canadian troops have been killed in combat since deployment in 2002 .
Support for the deportation of US soldiers who are seeking refuge contrasts with Canadian policy during the Vietnam War , when more than 50,000 Americans who fled the draft or service in the military found refuge in Canada .
Like the Martin Liberal government before it , the current Conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper does not wish to antagonize the US by repeating Canada ’s past as a destination of asylum for US soldiers .
This position is in keeping with the Canadian ruling elite ’s refusal to question the legality of the Iraq war , and its more general assault on the rights of asylum seekers .
This posture conflicts with the fourth Nuremburg principle , which holds that all persons are obliged , if there is any possibility of doing so , to defy government and military orders violating international law .
It also defies the position of United Nations High Commission on Refugees , which holds that a deserter can be deemed a refugee if the military action is condemned by the international community as being in violation of elementary human principles .
The actions of the Canadian government stand in stark contrast to the sentiments of most Canadians , as revealed by a poll published in July which found that two - thirds support giving defecting US soldiers permanent resident status .
In June , the opposition parties in Canada attempted to appease popular sentiment on the Iraq war and broad opposition to Canada ’s involvement in Afghanistan by passing a non-binding resolution to freeze the deportation of conscientious objectors .
As it is non-binding , the minority Harper government is not committed to act on the resolution , leaving it as a “ symbolic ” gesture that does nothing to prevent the deportation of Hinzman and his family .
Michelle Robidoux , a spokesperson for the Toronto - based War Resisters Support Campaign , said , “ This sends a chilling message to those going through the same process . ”
She continued , “ It ’s creating a wave of stress among everybody .
If Jeremy Hinzman , who has a wife and kids , can be kicked out , what about the single guys who have been here for a shorter period of time ? ”

Russia sent troops and tanks into the breakaway Georgian province of South Ossetia today as Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin declared " the war has started " .
Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said : " War started today in South Ossetia when Georgia attacked Russian peacekeepers in the disputed region . "
Earlier an official in Georgia 's National Security Council said Russia invaded Georgia .
Kakha Lamaia said : " If it 's not war , then we are very close to it .
The Russians have invaded Georgia and we are under attack . "
Georgian President Mikhail Saakasvili told CNN : " Russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory .
" This is a clear intrusion on another country 's territory .
We have Russian tanks on our territory , jets on our territory in broad daylight . "
Saakashvili accused its neighbor of a " well - planned invasion " and called on reservists to sign up for duty .
He said " 150 Russian tanks , armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles " had entered South Ossetia .
The president of the Georgian breakaway region , Eduard Kokoity , was quoted as saying : " About 1,400 people have died .
We will check these figures , but the order of the numbers is around this .
We have this on the basis of reports from relatives . "
Witnesses claim Tskhinvali is devastated .
" I saw bodies lying on the streets , around ruined buildings , in cars , " said one .
" It 's impossible to count them now .
There is hardly a single building left undamaged . "
The Georgian government said it will try to protect Russian peacekeepers who are in the disputed region .
However Russia claims 10 Russian peacekeepers have already been killed .
As the fighting escalates Georgia says it will withdraw 1,000 troops from Iraq and redeploy them to the region .
Nato , the US and the EU are calling for an immediate end to hostilities .
Georgia claims to have shot down five Russian war planes as the two countries fight for control of the breakaway province of South Ossetia .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has vowed to protect Russian citizens in the region .
Medvedev said : " In accordance with the constitution and the federal law , I , as president of Russia , am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of Russian citizens wherever they are located , " Mr Medvedev said in televised remarks .
" We wo n't allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished . "
Georgian troops are currently observing a three - hour ceasefire to let civilians leave the besieged capital , Tskhinvali .
Saakashvili said most of South Ossetia had been " liberated " in an overnight offensive .
" Most of South Ossetia 's territory is liberated and is controlled by Georgia , " Saakashvili said in televised comments today .
" Russian flights are ongoing in the centre of Tskhinvali ( the South Ossetian capital ) ...
I demand Russia stop bombardment of peaceful Georgian cities . "

Georgia launches offensive in South Ossetia
By Shaun Walker in Moscow
According to the Russian agency Interfax , a large group of Georgian soldiers moved towards the breakaway capital , Tskhinvali , late yesterday evening .
The separatist President , Eduard Kokoity , told the agency that " the storming of Tskhinvali has started " and said that separatist forces were engaged with the Georgian army on the roads into the city .
A statement on the separatist government 's website said : " The assault is coming from all directions . "
The fear is that Russia could be drawn into the conflict , with previous foreign ministry statements saying that Russia could not remain " indifferent " to an armed skirmish on its southern border .
Already late last night there were reports that hundreds of volunteers were on their way from North Ossetia , which is part of Russia , through the Caucasus Mountains to join their ethnic kin in South Ossetia .
The leadership of Abkhazia , Georgia 's other breakaway state , said that 1,000 volunteers from Abkhazia were also on their way .
Where is Georgia ?
View Larger Map
South Ossetia is a tiny territory with a population of around 50,000 , which broke away from Georgia after the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Most of the region is under the control of separatist authorities but the central Georgian government in Tbilisi controls several villages .
Tensions have been high in recent months , with frequent exchanges of fire between the sides , but so far all - out war has been avoided .
An exchange of fire on Wednesday night left at least one person dead and many injured .
The West has supported Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili , who wants to bring his country out of Russia 's orbit and into Nato , in his drive to reintegrate the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia into Georgia 's fold .
However , any military action could harm the country 's chances of Nato accession .
Russia has provided financial support to the separatist authorities .
It now seems the Georgians may have tired of negotiations and decided to take matters into their own hands .
But the timing is bizarre .
Negotiations between the separatist authorities and a Georgian minister were planned for this afternoon , and the attack on Tskhinvali came just hours after Mr Saakashvili had announced a unilateral ceasefire on live television .
" I want to acknowledge that several hours ago I , as a supreme commander , have issued a very painful order not to return fire in response to a very intensive shelling [ of Georgian villages ] , " said the Georgian President yesterday evening .
But the ceasefire lasted only hours and Mr Kokoity called Mr Saakashvili 's ceasefire a " despicable and treacherous " ruse .
" Despite our call for peace and a unilateral ceasefire , separatists continued the shelling of Georgian villages , " said Georgian commander Mamuka Kurashvili .
" We are forced to restore constitutional order in the whole region . "
And Moscow reacted furiously to the news .
" The actions by Georgia in South Ossetia bear witness to the fact that the leadership of that country can no longer be trusted , " said a foreign ministry statement .
The Georgian government said it had information about " hundreds of mercenaries , tanks and other equipment " entering South Ossetia through the Roki tunnel from Russia .

Having arrived back in Britain , I have hit the ground running and have spent the past eight weeks writing a book on the series plus I ’ve been filming a new series of QI here in London .
In the meantime I gave a speech about the BBC and the future of broadcasting recently and for the moment , what I spoke about is all I can offer you .
Please stay tuned for in the coming weeks I will have a new podgram plus news on exciting developments for the next version of Stephenfry.com .
The Future of Public Service Broadcasting
Some thoughts
Stephen Fry
Before I can even think to presume to dare to begin to expatiate on what sort of an organism I think the British Broadcasting Corporation should be , where I think the BBC should be going , how I think it and other British networks should be funded , what sort of programmes it should make , develop and screen and what range of pastries should be made available in its cafés and how much to the last penny it should pay its talent , before any of that , I ought I think in justice to run around the games field a couple of times puffing out a kind of “ The BBC and Me ” mini- biography , for like many of my age , weight and shoe size , the BBC is deeply stitched into my being and it is important for me as well as for you , to understand just how much .
Only then can we judge the sense , value or otherwise of what I am saying .
It all began with sitting under my mother ’s chair aged 2 as she ( teaching history at the time ) marked essays .
It was then that the Archers theme tune first penetrated my brain , never to leave .
The voices of Franklin Engelman going Down Your Way , the women of the Petticoat Line , the panellists of Twenty Questions , Many A Slip , My Word and My Music , all these solid middle class Radio 4 ( or rather Home Service at first ) personalities populated my world .
As I visited other people ’s houses and , aged 7 by now , took my own solid state transistor radio off to boarding school with me , I was made aware of The Light Programme , now Radio 2 , and Sparky ’s Magic Piano , Puff the Magic Dragon and Nelly the Elephant , I also began a lifelong devotion to radio comedy as Round The Horne , The Clithero Kid , I ’m Sorry I ’ll Read That Again , Just A Minute , The Men from The Ministry and Week Ending all made themselves known to me .
This was a world in which the BBC had a cosy and almost complete monopoly of radio .
There were things called pirate radio ships , about which Richard Curtis has just written a feature film I believe , and these gave rise to Radio 1 and a whole generation of disk jockeys , but this was pop music , something that frightened and upset me then and frightens and upsets me now .
That ’s not generational , I ’m from an entirely pop-literate , pop-loving generation , it is personal .
For me comedy was all I wanted , whether in the surreal world of Goon Show reruns , the insinuendo - laden filth of Kenneths Williams and Horne , or in the grown up wit of Frank Muir and Dennis Norden .
Many of the names that meant so much to me are now all but forgotten by the general public : Steve Race , Ian Wallace , Anthony Quinton , John Ebden , James Cameron , Kenneth Robinson .
And in the past few years a cruel swathe has been cut through the once lush grass of great radio personalities : Alastair Cooke , Linda Smith , John Peel , David Hatch , Ned Sherrin , Alan Coren and finally , I was only yesterday at the funeral of the great Humphrey Lyttleton .
Maybe this cruel swathe will be used as an excuse radically to reinvent radio .
Radio 4 in particular is radically reinvented every five years or so , fortunately with no result whatever .
Radical reinvention is not something that comes naturally to the British institutional mind .
Indeed if you have an institutional mind , a change of stationery is seismic and upsetting enough to qualify as root and branch restructuring .
Thus , altering the time slot of Woman ’s Hour , allowing Gardeners ’ Question
Time to be independently produced and other such cosmic storms have constituted the radical and fundamental changes to Radio 4 that have allowed it slowly to evolve over the decades , matching and paralleling its core audience and providing a service so incomparable in its variety and quality as to be an actual reason for some to live in Britain .
But it is ‘ only ’ radio : necessary to its survival has been the fact that the Associated Press , media tycoons and the political classes do n’t care that much about it .
Thus it has thrived .
Thriven .
Throven .
Bethrived .
I have to turn now to TV .
I may have grown up just as the Golden Age of Radio had passed , but the Golden Age of Television , that grew with me .
When I was 7 my parents moved house .
Well , we all moved house as a family , I do n’t mean my parents left me behind , though who would blame them if they had ?
We owned , in those days , a television that disguised itself as a mahogany drinks cabinet , in the way they did – and they were never called just televisions , by the way , they were television sets .
This one ’s screen was , of course , black and white , it boasted one channel , the BBC ( what we ’d now call BBC1 ) and had a knurled volume knob in dark brown Bakelite .
The set smelled the way dust always did when it was cooked on Mullard valves as they warmed up .
It slid about on castors and had doors that closed with a satisfactory snick as a ball bearing rolled into its slots to secure it .
The week before we moved , the BBC started a new drama , starring William Hartnell .
An old man , whose name appeared to be Grandfather or the Doctor , had a police phone box of the kind we saw in the street all the time in those days .
It turned out to be a magical and unimaginably wonderful time machine .
My brother and I watched this drama in complete amazement .
The first ever episode of Doctor Who .
I had never been so excited in all my life .
A whole week to wait to watch the next instalment .
Never have seven days crawled so slowly by , for all that they involved a complicated house move from Buckinghamshire to Norfolk .
A week later , in that new house , my brother and I turned on the good old television set in its new sitting room , ready to watch Episode 2 .
The TV had been damaged in transit and was never to work again .
We missed that episode and nothing that has transpired in my life since has ever , or could ever , make up for that terrible , terrible disappointment .
There is an empty space inside me that can never be filled .
It is amazing neither of us were turned into psychopathic serial killers from that moment .
The years passed and brought with them for children Blue Peter , every Oliver Postgate from Noggin the Nog to Ivor the Engine by the way of the Clangers and Bagpuss .
Mr Benn , Play School , Play Away , Rent - a - Ghost , Grange Hill and the Multi Coloured Swap Shop .
How lucky our generation was .
How spoiled .
ITV played its part , of course it did , with Magpie and How and much else .
This was a period of revolutionary drama from directors and writers such as Alan Clarke , David Mercer , Kenneth Loach , Mike Leigh , Alan Plater , Michael Apted , Stephen Frears , Dennis Potter .
Play of the Month , Play of the Week , Play for Today .
Cathy Come Home , Edna The Inebriate Woman , Pennies From Heaven , I Claudius , Tinker Tailor .
Popular drama from Z Cars to Colditz .
And comedy : Peter Cook and Dudley Moore , Monty Python , Up Pompeii , The Goodies , Dad ’s Army , Dick Emery , Morecambe and Wise , The Likely Lads , The Two Ronnies , Porridge , Reggie Perrin , Fawlty Towers .
… ITV gave us Rising Damp , and those definite article ITC adventures from Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner : The Avengers , The Champions , The Adventurer , The Baron , Man in a Suitcase , The Prisoner , The Persuaders , The Protectors and of course The Sweeney and The Professionals .
And during this time BBC 2 had arrived and with it Civilisation , The Ascent of Man and the full realisation of its first controller , David Attenborough , as the world ’s natural historian .
A succession of progressive , imaginative , tolerant , liberal in the loosest sense , and amiably hands - off TV executives from those legendary BBC Chairmen , Hugh Carleton - Greene and Lord Hill , downwards had created , or presided over , a cultural revolution of astounding depth , variety , imagination and dynamism .
And then , just as I was leaving prison , starting simultaneously my period on probation and at University , the way you do , the wind changed and Margaret Thatcher , the new Mary Poppins , descended into Downing Street , with new medicines for us to take , but very few spoonfuls of sugar to help them go down .
I am not going to blame her or make political points .
The wind had changed and she blew in with it and would one day be blown away by another change .
But here she was and fundamental questions were asked , genuinely radical unthinkable thoughts were thought in an age of privatisation and anti-dirigiste , anti-statist conservatism .
The first few years of that long administration in fact changed nothing .
Her government was busy with a terrible recession and the Falklands war , fighting miners , that kind of thing .
During exactly this time , I left University and began on what , for want of a better word , I shall call my career .
Comedy was my point of entry into television .
Comedy had been my rock and roll as a child and now I was allowed to do it for a living .
There is an argument that comedy is a greater public service than any other genre of art or culture : it heals divisions , it is a balm for hurt minds , it binds social wounds , exposes real truths about how life is really led .
Comedy connects .
The history of BBC comedy in particular is almost a register of character types , a social history of the country .
Hancock , Steptoe , Mainwaring , Alf Garnett , Basil Fawlty , Baldrick , Victor Meldrew , Alan Partridge , Ali G , David Brent , the matchlessly great General Melchett – it is much harder to list character types from serious drama who have so penetrated the consciousness of the nation and so closely defined the aspirations and failures of successive generations .
A public service broadcasting without comedy , is in danger of being regarded as no more than a dumping ground for worthiness .
Seriousness is no more a guarantee of truth , insight , authenticity or probity than humour is a guarantee of superficiality and stupidity .
Angels can fly because they take themselves lightly .
Meanwhile , back to history , for a moment .
What was happening to broadcasting during the time I was cutting my comedy teeth ?
In drama , the word “ play ” had been all but banned .
It was Film Four and Screen Two .
The multi camera studio drama , such as I Claudius , had become a thing of the past , the way led by Brideshead and other single camera filmed pieces .
‘ Yoof ’ TV made an appearance thanks to Planet 24 and Janet Street - Porter and the Peacock Report appeared .
The Peacock Report , referred to by broadcast professionals in that way they have , as Peacock , came less than ten years after the Annan Report , which the great Noel , Lord Annan had submitted to parliament in 1977 .
Annan had been the first to detect a caterpillar in the perfect garden salad of the BBC ’s golden age .
He thought television as run by ITV and the BBC needed a shake up , it lacked a kind of diversity , plurality and edge , all happily unfamiliar words in those days .
For the first time the founding Reithian tenets of authoritative patriarchal broadcasting were challenged : the de haut en bas principle in which the educated producer , presenter , writer knew what was good for the country and for the audience was under fire .
The first and most direct result was Channel 4 three or four years later , specifically charged to speak for minorities and sections of society who did not want to be spoon - fed by the supercilious educated classes .
The arts and documentaries , drama and comedy were still presented but in a kind of punked up style , all attitude and in - yer - face .
TV went from Oxbridge to concrete , missing out red brick altogether .
But the words ‘ radical ’ and ‘ reform ’ meant something quite different to a new and ideologically fired government and so in 1986 a new report emerged : Peacock .
Here was a report that really delivered a blow to the BBC ’s solar plexus .
Peacock began to foresee the possibility of digital diversity on an unimagined scale , it also put forward the ideas of a consumer - led , market driven broadcasting world , one in which the very principles of a licence fee funded public service broadcasting system would naturally be seen as obsolete .
This suited the tenor of the times : deregulation , privatisation and a rigorous dismantling of the frontiers of the state – it was happening in the city and in industry and the utilities , why not broadcasting ?
The BBC , long seen as harbouring tendencies and personnel that were socialistic at best , Marxist at worst , was suddenly no longer a secure and unassailable acropolis .
It was no secret that Norman Tebbit and some of the more fundamentalist free - marketeers and red-baiters of the administration would have been very happy indeed to dismantle the entire structure of the BBC .
Peacock prevaricated and the charter appeared safe , but at a great price .
Nothing would ever be the same again , the old certainties were dead and the harsh realities of capitalism arrived at Wood Lane and Portland Place .
Whole departments were razed and working practices abolished , and something called an internal market was put in place .
Radio Times was outsourced , the permanent make - up staff went , engineers , editors and set - designers were suddenly out of a job .
Twenty - five percent of the BBC ’s output was commanded to be produced from outside sources and a whole new independent sector was born .
Companies like Hat Trick and Talk Back achieved almost instant success .
Peter Bazalgette , who had been a typical BBC producer , starting life as a That ’s Life researcher , then making Food and Drink and other such innocent programmes , started on the path that would lead him to Endemol and unimagined reach and riches .
Men and women who had spent their whole lives dreaming up formats and broadcasting ideas as part of their job , suddenly had those ideas outside BBC premises , in their own time , because producers could now become entrepreneurs .
There was money to be made and such a thing as loyalty to this new BBC was now a preposterous idea .
The smell of Hugh Wheldon ’s pipe smoke and tweed was finally expelled from every office , every corridor and every meeting room in the BBC .
But at least the charter was safe , the licence fee was safe and the radio stations and the World Service and the general face and form of the BBC were safe and familiar .
There was still Blue Peter and the Cup Final and Only Fools and Horses .
The spinning globe and the logo were outsourced to Lambie Nairn , but the Beeb was still alive .
David Attenborough and Bristol continued to make outstanding natural history programmes , the BAFTAs and Emmys continued to roll in for the innovative new drama and comedy .
And now … well , we know what has happened since .
Satellite , digital TV , Freeview and now Freesat , the Internet and mobile telephony , BBC iPlayer for the iPhone , Mac and PC , a plethora of outlets so vast , complicated and fast - moving that audience numbers for traditional TV have plummeted .
3 million is now considered a good rating for a BBC 1 drama .
Meanwhile of course ITV has morphed into a new kind of entity , more answerable to shareholders than ever before and Channel 4 , always an uneasy hybrid of public duty ideals and free market commercialism , is finding it hard not to descend to freak show documentaries : “ The Man With a Nose Growing Out of His Bottom ” , “ The Girl With Fourteen Nipples ” and that kind of embarrassment for all concerned .
So much so that C4 ’s very existence and right to continue is being questioned .
And we have a BBC that broadcasts through four major adult channels and a number of cb bb bb cb children ’s channels , it has a news channel , a parliamentary channel , an HD channel ( on which you will be able to watch this on Saturday !!! ) .
It also has a news channel in the form of its news .bbc.co.uk website , one of the most popular in the world .
It has the iPlayer on its site too , streaming content to UK users only .
But hell , there ’s ways round that .
Streaming ?
Hardly : anything that can be played on your computer can be stored on it and shared .
A digital copy is a perfect copy .
Once on the net it ’s out there and will be bit torrented and Limewired and Gnutella-ed and otherwise P2P distributed .
The BBC is making a lot of enemies giving away free programmes to an internet that everyone else is trying to “ monetise ” ; at the moment it ’s relying on the fact that you have to be slightly dorky to record from the iPlayer , but believe me that will change .
It will soon be the work of a moment for my mother to get an iPlayer programme off her computer and onto her iPod , iPhone , or whatever device she chooses .
In its digital doings , from interactivity through to HD and online resources , the BBC has been pretty much in the forefront of development , but also in the forefront of annoying those without its advantages .
Meanwhile I have continued to enjoy a happy career as actor , performer , broadcaster documentary maker and now , with an independent production company of my own , producer , so it is clear that I have had nothing to complain about : the old system was easy for my benighted Oxbridge self and the new system has worked for me too .
I may be white and middle class , but hey , I ’m gay and Jewish , so all kinds of minority compliance boxes are ticked by my very presence , are n’t they ?
Well do gay and Jewish do n’t count as minorities in this business ?
Do you remember that scene in Mel Brooks ’s To Be Or Not To Be .
He and his wife Anne Bancroft play , if you remember , a theatrical couple in Poland at the outbreak of the war .
As the Nazis move in more members if his company get taken away .
One day his wife ’s rather camp dresser , Sasha disappears .
Brooks ’s character really loses it .
He slams his palm into his fist .
‘ Enough is enough .
First the Jews , then the gypsies , now the faggots .
Do n’t they realise that without Jews , gypsies and faggots there ’s no such thing as show business ? ’
Anyway the point is …
The point is I have of course , a kind of vested interest in the status quo .
Or if not the status quo , it might easily be seen that any view I have about broadcasting is that of an insider .
A member of the Oxbridge cosa nostra , the gay cosy nostra and indeed the kosher nostra .
An insider moreover , who even if he had never stepped into broadcasting would , by virtue of that upbringing I told you about , be destined always to have in his heart a huge place for public service broadcasting as exemplified by the BBC .
And we most of us , looking around this room , have this problem , do n’t we ?
We are likely , whatever our professions , to have an attachment to the kind of broadcasting we grew up with , a fierce pride in the staggering history of quality and innovation that has characterized British television and radio for fifty years .
A pride , a sentimental loyalty that causes us to raise our well modulated , well educated voices loudly against any perceived barbarians at the gates .
At a price , we saw off the Tebbit and print media attacks on our ramparts , a price that included many of us becoming extremely rich – damn you capitalism !
– and now there is another attack imminent , at least a new report is beating its wings above us and stirring the air once more .
And so once more we have to think not of how things have gone on , and how they are going on , but how they will go on .
The future beckons .
What will happen .
As Neils Bohr , the great Danish physicist once said , “ prediction is very difficult , especially about the future . ”
This new report is not from a grand panjandrum like my lords Annan or Peacock , but rather – o tempora o mores – it is an Offcom Review of Public Sector Broadcasting .
A new kind of cat has been put among the pigeons .
There is nothing ideologically gross for us to moan at , nothing personal , philistine or crassly commercial to deprecate with elegant disdain , but a simple honest proposal .
If we still want the broadcasting landscape in this country to be dominated by grand mountains and valleys of quality programming that can inform , entertain , educate and enlarge the horizons of the British viewer then perhaps we should accept a new ‘ model ’ for the financing and husbanding of such a landscape .
Let the income from the licence fee now be shared amongst the BBC and its rivals .
Let it be sliced , as the jargon has it .
Wow .
A beguiling thought .
Neat .
And how appealing to our political masters .
The Blairite / Brownite benisons of public / private interbreeding can be allowed to combine with the wholly reasonable recognition that in this fierce new world of rich - spectrum , multiple - bandwidth broadcasting , resources must be shared – all must be allowed to wet their beaks .
I said earlier that Peacock ‘ prevaricated ’ in not creating a wholly commercial landscape ; it might be truer to say that the BBC won part of the argument back then because it was successfully proposed , by Andrew Graham and Gavyn Davies , inter alia , that broadcasting is a special case , that the rules of the market place do n’t apply .
As in the armed forces , coastal defence , policing and other fields , capitalism red in tooth and claw cannot be unleashed here .
If we stopped husbanding the Yorkshire Moors or the Lake District the result would be weeds , scrub or desertification , not more efficient productive landscapes from Germany or South Korea providing consumer choice and real competition .
If innovative , cutting - edge , new and risky programming is not subsidised , the weeds will blow in too .
This was the argument and it prevailed .
But .
But it was ultimately an argument that applied to a spectrum poor , low bandwidth broadcasting world .
Gavyn Davies and others were able to argue that there would be no real diversity and choice in a free market dismantling of the licence fee because it was not foreseen how staggeringly multifarious the technical possibilities of programme rediffusion , distribution , ownership and rights management would be twenty or so years later .
Private competition meanwhile continued to hammer home its counter - message .
‘ Actually the market does work , it only does n’t work when it ’s unfairly dominated by subsidised monoliths like the BBC .
Take away their distorting effect on the market and all will be well .
Choice and diversity will reign . ’
I remember Hugh and I wrote a sketch in which I played a waiter who recognised a diner in my restaurant as a Tory broadcasting minister .
I clapped him on the shoulder and told him how much I admired his policies of choice , consumer choice , freedom of choice .
I then was horrified to notice that he had only a silver knife and fork for cutlery at his table .
‘ No , no , they ’re fine , ’ said the puzzled politician .
But my character the waiter raced off and soon returned with an enormous bin liner which I emptied over his table .
It contained thousands and thousands of those white plastic coffee - stirrers .
‘ There you are , ’ I screamed dementedly at him , virtually rubbing his face in the heap of white plastic , ‘ now you ’ve got choice .
Look at all that choice .
They may all be shit , but look at the choice ! ’
The sketch ends with me trying to strangle him .
Heavy handed satire perhaps , but that was how it looked to me we were in danger of going : thirty or forty channels but all filled with drek .
Peacock had been made to see the danger of that too and the BBC ’s unique funding model was safe – for the time being at least .
Meanwhile the free market is great , it has proved just how greedy for money even the most socialistic TV programme maker is – just watch them scrabble for the millions as their production companies are floated .

And as for broadcasting , well after a mad diversion of believing that it was all about distribution , every media boss now repeats the mantra Content is King .
‘ We repent , ’ they seem to be saying , ‘ being a media boss is no longer about owning as many stations , networks , nodes , outlets and ports as possible – it ’s about production , about making things .
I see that now . ’
‘ Hurray , ’ shout the programme makers , ‘ finally you ’ve understood .
So , give us the money then . ’
‘ What money ? ’ say the media executives , ‘ there is no money .
We spent it all buying up companies and their back catalogues .
We needed content in a hurry , because – in case you were n’t aware … content is king , you know . ’
‘ Doh .
Hang on … but what about new content ? ’
‘ Good lord no .
Are you mad ?
Far too expensive .’
The arguments for keeping the funding structures in place might be considered compelling : despite everything , the BBC is still doing what it has always been charged to do .
It actually makes programmes .
It pioneers comedy and popular entertainment , it reveals some of our cultural heritage to us in the form of costume drama , documentary , history and science programming ; it informs , educates and entertains , it tells us about the human heart and the cosmos , the wide globe and the narrow street , it responds to new technologies and still manages to retain some sense of being the nation ’s fireplace .
If it were to be forced to turn commercial , who would benefit ?
How would consumer choice and quality be maintained ?
What systems overseas provide tempting paradigms to imitate ?
None .
Let ’s stay the way we are .
All of which is arguable when looking at the BBC alone .
But Offcom has wider responsibilities of course , as does government .
They must balance public provision with private competition across the whole of an industry of converging technologies and diverging missions .
They look at the plight of ITV struggling with its miserable ever - widening Mr Micawber gap between expenditure and income and , specifically at Channel 4 with its ambivalent position as a commercial operator with an often countervailing non-commercial remit .
How ironic .
Channel 4 is the perfect example of the glories of private and public and yet far from freeing it up , it ’s been hamstrung by its unique constitution .
How can we ensure a healthy , post digital switchover future for such networks ?
Where will the funding come from ?
And what about other private companies who want to invest in the fabulous opportunities offered by online broadcasting : how can they compete with the BBC and its unfair subsidy ?
The days of claiming that the market cannot work are over , and it ’s time to look at broadcasting in a new way .
Thanks to TiVo , Apple TV , Sky Plus , Elgato and other forms of personal video recorder , televisions are now audio visual retail outlets that know about and respond to the consumer .
Real market choice is here , there is no national fireplace , the individual with his remote , connected as he or she is , has no stake in station loyalty , no interest in network branding : show them the list of content , in categories including action , adult , arts , children ’s , documentaries , drama , films : in sub-categories and nested sub- sub - categories , special interest according to age , religion , ethnicity and sexuality – who says the market place can’t tick the boxes for plurality , diversity and inclusivity ?
Control is – or soon will be – the consumer ’s : there is no need for a front end branded One Two Three Four , whether BBC or ITV .
No need for anything but content .
And if you want content to be anything more , any scintilla of a soupçon of a hint more than what market forces demand , if you sincerely want content to be occasionally uplifting , ennobling , educative , innovative , top down , nourishing and of bountiful , beautiful benefit to Britain and its citizenry , then yes , absolutely , the only source of financing for that is the licence fee .
So long as the playing field is level , the market will take care of the set top boxes , the distribution systems , the digital pipelines to the audio - visual retail outlet that is the consumer ’s television , while the licence fee can – if it must and likes the idea – pay for content that ca n’t pay for itself in the normal cut and thrust of the marketplace .
And if Channel 4 wants to ( or must because of its remit ) make that kind of public service programme as well as Hollyoaks and The Girl Whose Breasts Talk German , then the licence fee should cover that as well .
The days of the BBC as a national institution , hosting and front - ending publicly funded content are over .
The mighty oak must have some of its branches lopped off to light in on the smaller trees around it .
Public Service Broadcasting is now merely the management of licence fee monies : we do n’t need a BBC for that , or rather the BBC we need is a slimmed down BBC .
It does n’t need to try to be all things to all people , it can concentrate on public service and leave the commercial populist programming to the private sector .
Wow !
Radical .
And tempting .
Perhaps .
Perhaps tempting .
Not to me , I have to say , but then I am not Britain or an average Britain .
This image of the consumer ’s home as a kind of electronic bookshop , as outlined by media business guru Barry Cox , where we move from passive viewer to active consumer may seem beguiling to some , but actually we already know that model .
We know it from hotel rooms and aircraft entertainment systems .
It ’s technically doable , especially when cleverly finagled with PVRs , but is it broadcasting , is it , actually , what anyone wants ?
Well actually , it exactly is n’t broadcasting , it ’s narrow - casting .
But is it wanted ?
I do n’t know , I ca n’t speak for Britain , I ca n’t second guess polls , though I can imagine how easily they will return the results wanted by either side , according to the way the questions are framed .
“ Do you want to see the BBC dismantled so that you have to choose and pay for all your programmes like a hotel room film menu ? ” NO .
“ Do you want to stop paying the licence fee and being forced to watch poncey documentaries and have access to thousands of films and saucy programmes at the click of a button ? ” YES .
GIGO , as they used to say in the early days of computing : garbage in , garbage out .
But that is nothing , nothing to the real problem .
Content .
Production .
Programme making .
TV programmes suffer from the embarrassing necessity of having to be written and made .
Unlike Yorkie Bars or tennis balls or mobile phones you ca n’t just gear up the machinery and stamp them out in perpetuity .
Every damned new programme has to be developed , nurtured , and tried out .
Relationships have to be forged with writers , performers , presenters and directors , failures have to be accommodated and accepted .
How this is achieved in a brave new world of post switchover root and branch restructuring , I do n’t know .
Even the most immoderately free market media analyst or commentator I have heard or read would concede that there is a need for good impartial news coverage ; that a nation deserves access to programmes that reveal truths about themselves and the world .
But mostly they would argue too that if that is what the BBC is to provide , it can be slimmed down , the corporation can lose the need to make its Doctor Who and Strictly Come Dancing , its populist forays can be taken care of by ITV , whose audience share would concomitantly rise , narrowing its dreaded gap , while money would be freed from retrenching the BBC ’s ambitions in the digital world , in film - making , in popular TV , in sporting occasions , money that could create better PSB programming and allow Channel 4 access to money that would spare us more The Boy Whose Testicles Play The Harpsichord .
Or perhaps a PSB system can be implemented on the American model of public subscription , or on the New Zealand and Singaporean models , based on a kind of central funding body .
Neither of these can really be deemed especially successful , but again they free up money which can be thrown at as much public service broadcasting as anyone wants , and let real commercial players get on with making real commercial stuff .
But what would that BBC then be ?
Who would watch it ?
How could an audience be brought to a channel that showed nothing but worthy programming , no matter how excellently produced .
Is n’t the whole point of the BBC as a major channel , a real player in TV production across the spectrum of genres and demographics , is n’t the whole point of that BBC its ability to draw audiences into PSB programming by virtue of their loyalty and trust in a brand that provides entertainment , pure and simple ?
Is n’t the slide scheduling from BBC4 to 2 or BBC3 to 1 an example of that , just as it can be from BBC2 to 1 ?
I have been involved in programmes that have made that journey .
Who Do You Think You Are ? started on 2 and went to 1 , like Have I Got New For You and a documentary I made recently on Gutenberg started on 4 and then screened on 2 , getting I am told very good figures indeed , and staying in the top 3 on the iPlayer top ten for a week .
It would not have been possible to get that audience , for what I am persuaded ( well I would be ) was an important and almost copybook example of PSB programming , without the cross channel trailing and station loyalty that the present all - encompassing nature of the BBC allows .
In a sense the nature of the BBC as it is , ‘ gives permission ’ to all kinds of people to watch programmes they otherwise might not .
What is the alternative , a ghettoised , balkanised electronic bookshop of the home , no stations , no network , just a narrowcast provider spitting out content on channels that fulfil some ghastly and wholly insulting demographic profile : soccer mum , trailer trash , teenager , gay , black music lover , Essex girl , sports fan , bored housewife , all watching programmes made specifically for them with ads targeting them .
Is that what we mean by inclusivity ?
Is that what we mean by plurality ?
God help us , I do hope not .
And anyway , cannot it not be understood that what we call ‘ entertainment pure and simple ’ is neither .
It seems hardly necessary for me to rehearse the argument in comedy : Gervaise and Merchant , Lucas and Walliams , Mitchell and Webb , Catherine Tate , the Gavin and Stacey team , and before them Ali G , Steve Coogan , you name them , they all developed their arts over time , they all made minority failures , they all needed to be brought on .
No one but the BBC could have made Blackadder , especially after the expense and relative failure of the first series .
Does it count as entertainment or as public service broadcasting ?
Do we have to make a distinction ?
That ’s the point surely .
With all respect to OfCom and Barry Cox , and all the media analysts and broadcasting journalists who insist on one , do we really have to make a distinction ?
I have to be personal again .
I wanted to make a pair of films about bipolar disorder , did I have to believe that I was making a public service series ?
Could I not believe as I did , that I was making two television programmes that I hoped as many people as possible might watch ?
Just I would hope if I was making a drama or a comedy ?
Yes , those couple of films on manic depression may well have fulfilled a public service , one that could be uniquely followed up via the BBC ’s resources on radio , on websites and on help - lines , but the gratifying large audience that tuned in , did they do so because it was public service broadcasting ?
How insulting to everyone concerned is that ?
I was asked by the BBC to make this speech , if speech is the word .
They hoped I suspect , but in no way insisted , that I would fight their corner against cuts , against the slicing of the licence fee : at the very least they expected I might make a case for the public service aspects of comedy , and for its importance and for the need for it to be nurtured and fostered .
I have happy to do that , not out of eternal loyalty and belief in an institution that has , as much as any school or college made me who I am , but because I genuinely cannot see that the nation would benefit from a diminution of any part of the BBC ’s great whole .
It should be as closely scrutinised as possible of course , value for money , due humility and all that , but to reduce its economies of scale , its artistic , social and national reach for misbegotten reasons of ideology or thrift would be a tragedy .
We got here by an unusual route that stretches back to Reith .
We have evolved extraordinarily , like our parliament and other institutions , such is the British way .
Yes , we could cut it all down and remake ourselves in the image of Italy or Austria or some other notional modern state .
We could sharpen the axe , we could cut away apparently dead wood , we could reinvent the wheel , we could succumb to the natural desires of commercial media companies .
Although I have an axe to grind on this , you should understand that it is personal not professional .
Actually , if licence fee slicing and other radical plans do go ahead , I do not believe it would affect my career as either performer , presenter or producer , in fact I would probably profit more from the change .
It is simply that I do n’t want to live in a country that emasculates the BBC .
Yes , I want to see Channel 4 secure , but I do n’t believe that the only way to save it is to reduce the BBC .
We can afford what we decide we can afford .
You know when you visit another country and you see that it spends more money on flowers for its roundabouts than we do , and you think … coo , why do n’t we do that ?
How pretty .
How pleasing .
What a difference it makes .
To spend money for the public good in a way that enriches , gives pleasure , improves the quality of life , that is something .
That is a real achievement .
It ’s only flowers in a roundabout , but how wonderful .
Well , we have the equivalent of flowers in the roundabout times a million : the BBC enriches the country in ways we will only discover when it has gone and it is too late to build it up again .
We actually can afford the BBC , because we ca n’t afford not to .
UPDATE : It 's on CSPAN right now !

Chicago Tribune :
Rep. Dennis Kucinich , a former Democratic presidential contender , said Monday he wants the House to consider a resolution to impeach President Bush .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi consistently has said impeachment was " off the table . "
Kucinich , D - Ohio , read his proposed impeachment language in a floor speech .
He contended Bush deceived the nation and violated his oath of office in leading the country into the Iraq war .
Kucinich introduced a resolution last year to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney .
That resolution was killed , but only after Republicans initially voted in favor of taking up the measure to force a debate .
Rising gas prices are inspiring drivers to find new ways of protecting themselves against future increases — including buying gas in advance and investing in stocks that tend to rise along with the price of gasoline .
One new company , MyGallons.com , lets customers buy gallons ahead of time based on the current prices in their area — in theory , locking in a lower price — and then redeem those gallons at a later date , regardless of any price increases in the interim .
Consumers can also invest in oil companies , coal companies , and other stocks that are likely to benefit from more expensive oil .
" Look for companies that will benefit indirectly from oil prices and directly from increased energy efficiency , " says Paul Larson , editor of Morningstar StockInvestor .
That way , he says , consumers can balance higher expenses at the pump with higher returns on their investments .
At MyGallons.com , the company makes those investments itself .
Founder Steve Verona says that the company protects itself against future gas price increases through taking positions in the stock market .
That way , customers can enjoy the simplicity of purchasing and redeeming gallons for an established amount and avoid experiencing market fluctuations themselves .
Verona says the company does n't plan to make money on gas , but rather from the annual membership fee ( about $ 30 ) , the interest float on the money that is paid before the gas is redeemed , and advertising on its website .
For consumers interested in hedging their own bets , one option is investing in oil companies .
" When gas prices go up , generally oil prices have gone up , and that raises [ oil companies ' ] revenue , " Larson says .
He also suggests looking for companies that benefit indirectly from rising oil prices , such as railroads , which are a more energy efficient way of moving cargo over long distances than trucks .
" That 's why railroads are doing so well today , " Larson adds .
Oil exploration companies such as Southwestern Energy also offer a way of protecting oneself against future gas price increases , says Peter Cohan , president of a management consulting and venture capital firm that bears his name .
In addition , he recommends coal companies , including Walter Industries , Arch Coal , and Peabody Energy , since coal can be used as an energy source instead of oil .
Alternative - energy companies , on the other hand , tend to be overvalued right now , Cohan says , and he advises staying away from them .
Of course , gas prices could come down , which could turn any of these investment ideas into losing propositions .
As with all investments , says Tim Maurer , director of financial planning for Financial Consulate , a Baltimore advisory firm , consumers need to be prepared to stomach volatility .
In fact , his firm has recently limited its exposure to oil in expectation of a short - term market correction .
If prices do indeed fall , then what will happen to MyGallons.com customers ' prepurchased gallons ?
Verona says most people will simply hold on to them until prices go back up again .
But what if prices are currently at their peak and do n't go up again ?
Verona says that 's unlikely .
" Very few analysts expect prices to come down ... because current demand is increasing , while supply has stayed steady .
We 're talking years , if not decades , before [ proposed ] solutions have any impact .
In the interim , prices should continue to rise , " Verona says .
He adds that if customers opt to drop out of the program , they can get a refund for their purchased gallons .
Beer - heiress McCain to profit from foreign takeover of Anheuser Bush RAW STORY
Published : Monday July 14 , 2008
Print This Email This Cindy McCain , whose fortune from her father 's beer distributor has helped fund her husband 's political career , stands to get even wealthier once iconic American brewery Anheuser - Busch Cos. is sold to a Belgian company .
The Wall Street Journal reports McCain 's substantial holdings in the company , which is being sold to InBev for $ 52 billion .
McCain , the heiress to the third - largest Anheuser distributor , owns at a minimum $ 1 million in the American company , according to John McCains Senate financial disclosure forms , which dont offer any more information for large assets held by his spouse .
Under the deal , she and other stockholders will get a cash payout for the stock , which is owned through her company , Hensley and Co .
Anheusers stock price opened at $ 67.55 today , almost a 50 % gain over the near $ 47 price in February when the possibility of a deal was made public .
Cashing out could leave the McCains with hefty capital gains , which would be taxed at a rate of 15 % under the Bush tax cuts that John McCain opposed and now supports .
( Barack Obama has proposed raising the capital gains tax . )
Hensley and Co. , founded by Cindy McCains father , has an exclusive distribution deal for Budweiser and other products in the Phoenix area .
The merger is unlikely to affect that arrangement , and the company already sells InBev brands , including Stella Artois and Becks , through an existing agreement with Anheuser .
The Associated Press earlier this year examined McCain 's finances finding her fortune , which is at least $ 100 million , has allowed John McCain , the GOP presidential candidate , to enjoy trips on private jets and vacation homes around the country .
Anheuser - Busch Cos. said early Monday it had agreed to a sweetened $ 52 billion takeover bid from InBev , creating the world 's largest brewer and heading off what was shaping up as an acrimonious fight for the maker of Budweiser and Bud Light beers .
Inbev brands include Stella Artois , Beck 's and Bass .
The combined company will be called Anheuser - Busch InBev .
As of the end of last week , InBev said it would be the world 's third largest consumer products company by market capitalization after Procter & Gamble of the United States and Nestle SA of Switzerland .
The Anheuser - Busch board accepted the higher takeover offer Sunday night from Belgian - based InBev , according to a joint press release .
The deal is expected to close by year - end .

As regular readers know , I funded a survey of over 500 economists to see which candidate for President of the United States has the most support from economic experts .
I will publish the results in a press release and in this blog late next week unless something slows me down , such as getting assassinated .
Voters say the economy is the most important issue to them .
Foreign affairs will keep dropping down the list of importance now that the current administration supports a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq .
So how does a voter decide which candidate would be best for the economy ?
Yesterday Reuters / Zogby announced a poll that showed , among other things , which candidate the voters think would manage the economy better .
This is like asking people who have hemorrhoids the best way to treat a brain tumor .
Should n’t we be asking brain surgeons ?
Forgive me for not caring what your grandma thinks of NAFTA .
I want to know which economic policies seem best according to the majority of economists .
I got tired of waiting for someone else to give me some useful information and decided to go get it myself .
Democracy without useful information is random .
This is n’t a good time in history to be making random decisions .
I woke up this morning with the strange feeling that I might own the most important information in the world .
Although 90 % of voters have made up their mind , the race is so tight that the remaining 10 % will settle things .
If the media reports the results of my survey of economists , will it influence independent voters and thus the arrow of history ?
Probably not .
But you ca n’t rule it out .
When I announce the results I will include all the disclaimers about its accuracy and usefulness , and there will be plenty .
But if you ignore the opinions of 500 economists you are either a well - informed genius who needs no advice , or an idiot who does n’t realize it would be helpful .
( Those two conditions feel exactly the same . )
For those in the middle , I would think you ’d care what the experts think .

We can read some interesting things about the future of Aptana Jaxer in a blog post from Paul Colton ( CEO of Aptana ) announcing the hiring of Ajax gurus Greg Murray and Ryan Johnson .
Apart from the fact that the Jaxer 1.0 release candidate will be available in a matter of days , we also learn that Jaxer will support " ActiveRecord - like JavaScript ORM for Jaxer that promises to make working with JavaScript data a pleasure " .
Jaxer is a server side technology which is defined by its creator as " the world 's first true Ajax server " .
The Jaxer home page indicates that " HTML , JavaScript , and CSS are native to Jaxer , as are XMLHttpRequests , JSON , DOM scripting , etc .
And as a server it offers access to databases , files , and networking , as well as logging , process management , scalability , security , integration APIs , and extensibility " .
Prior to Jaxer , Aptana picked up the development of the Radrails IDE which later got included in the Aptana Studio suite .
The eclipse - based IDE provides an easy way to create and debug Ruby on Rails applications , as the whole Ruby on Rails commands and documentation are encapsulated in fancy looking windows and other visual helpers .
This comes to no surprise that , with the extensive Ruby on Rails knowledge the Aptana team acquired while building Radrails , Jaxer might get some of the nicest features from the framework .
Whether Rails will ever be " eclipsed " by the Jaxer technology remains to be seen but its future certainly looks interesting .
Let 's see how Aptana will transpose those rails - inspired niceties to Javascript and how well it will be promoted first ...

The average person might believe that the worldwide push to “ go green ” is coming solely from politicians and concerned citizens .
In fact , this is not the case !
In recent years , many big - name companies have realized their way towards more sustainable and eco-friendly business practices .
Following are 25 well - known companies that are leading the green revolution .
In some cases willingly , in other cases somewhat unwillingly , but in all cases green .
1. Bank of America
Bank of America is proving that eco-friendly operations can coexist with business growth .
According to their corporate website , the company reduced paper use by 32 % from 2000 - 2005 , despite a 24 % growth in their customer base !
Bank of America also runs an internal recycling program that recycles 30,000 tons of paper each year , good for saving roughly 200,000 trees for each year of the program ’s operation .
As if that were n’t enough , the company also offers employees a $ 3,000 cash back reward for buying hybrid vehicles .
2. Ceres
While not technically a business itself , Ceres has advised some of the nation ’s biggest corporations and investors on the environmental impact of their operations .
Having billed themselves as “ the largest coalition of investors , environmental and public interest organizations in North America “ , the organization is primarily focused on ensuring that companies accurately disclose the environmental aspects of their business practices to investors and shareholders .
Major achievements thus far include persuading Dell Computer to support national product “ take back ” legislation and convincing Bank of America to spend $ 20 billion on the growth of eco-friendly business practices .
3. General Electric
General Electric ’s presence on this list might surprise you , but the steps they have taken toward green operations are undeniable .
Since 2006 , the company has sold over $ 12 billion of its Ecomagination products ( including solar panels ) .
For those who are still upset at GE ’s polluting of the Hudson River with polychlorinated biphenyls , the company is also making headway on an ambitious cleanup of that area .
Barring further setbacks , the river should be cleaned up to a much better state in just a couple of years !
4. Dupont
Dupont is another company that has drawn the ire of green advocates for many , many years .
However , it now seems that they are taking strides toward more sustainable operations .
In addition to drastically lowering its emissions of airborne carcinogens and greenhouse gases , Dupont has appointed an ex-Greenpeace head as an adviser to the board .
And true to its word , the company successfully reduced greenhouse gas emissions during the 90’s by 63 % – far ahead of the timetable set forth in the controversial Kyoto Protocol .
5. Innovest
Innovest has boldly set out to “ reengineer the DNA of Wall Street ” , according to executive managing director Matthew J. Kiernan .
As William Grieder explains in his book “ The Soul of Capitalism ” , Innovest grades publicly traded companies for such things as its track record in hazardous waste disposals and past pollution .
The overall goal is to give investors a quick gauge on the true eco-friendliness of the companies they are investing in .
Interestingly , early data seem to indicate that companies with higher “ EcoValue ” rankings outperform lower ranked companies as stocks , boasting returns 1.5 to 2.4 percent higher .
6. McDonalds
Time was not long ago when McDonalds would n’t have come within striking distance of making this list .
However , the increasing public shift toward greener living has sent a clear signal to the powers that be at the popular fast - food chain .
Instead of ravaging the natural habitats of animals , McDonalds now works in close collaboration with PETA on systematically reforming its business practices to be more humane and friendly to the environment in which they operate .
7. Home Depot
Home Depot is another ex-offender who has taken great pains to turn things around .
Once the Rainforest Action Network identified the company as the world ’s largest retailer of old - growth wood products , demonstrations and protests unfolded at Home Depot stores around the nation .
When the outcry reached the point of 45,000 customer calls and letters , the bigwigs at Home Depot decided that enough was enough .
Within months , the company rolled out a new “ no old - growth sales ” policy to ensure consumers and activists that the days of harvesting trees from old - growth rainforests were over .
8 . Anheuser - Busch
Most people do n’t expect much in the way of environmental awareness from their beer company , but that has n’t stopped Anheuser - Busch from delivering .
In his landmark text “ Natural Capitalism ” , author Paul Hawken shines light on the fact that Busch now saves 21 million pounds of metal per year by trimming an eigth of an inch off the diameter of its beer cans .
The best news for beer enthusiasts ?
“ The trimming does n’t reduce the volume of beer one bit ” , says Hawken .
9. Pratt & Whitney
Pratt &
Whitney offers another inspiring story of how much raw materials can be saved – and pollution avoided – with a little old - fashioned , hard - nosed ingenuity .
As “ Natural Capitalism ” explains , Pratt & Whitney used to scrap 90 percent of its ingots ( that ’s right , almost all ) in the process of manufacturing jet engine blades .
This massive waste continued unabated until someone at Pratt & Whitney had the bright idea to have the supplier simply cast the ingots into ready - made blade - like shapes .
This one seemingly small change proved to be transformative , and has lowered the amount of wasted ingots and factory emissions a great deal .
10 . Starbucks
Starbucks has green advocates smiling about its “ bean - to - cup ” approach , which stresses top efficiency at each link of its global supply chain .
By all measures the program appears to be a great success , with the company ’s decision to use coffee cup sleeves made of recycled paper saving roughly 78,000 trees per year since 2006 .
Starbucks has also partnered up with many environmental organizations , from Conservation International to the Earthwatch Institute , in efforts to do right by the communities it operates in .
11 . Wal - Mart
Possibly the most hated name in the entire green movement , Wal - Mart is now positioned to make all but the most dogmatic of its detractors eat their words .
According to Sustainablog , Wal - Mart has launched an ambitious long - term plan to eventually power each and every one its stores using 100 % renewable energy sources .
According to the company ’s executives , Wal - Mart is committed to using its waste - eliminating corporate philosophy to make its own operations more eco-friendly than ever .
12 . Tesla Motors
Funded by ex-Google and PayPal executives , Tesla Motors is a venture aimed at proving that cars can be environmentally friendly without sacrificing the blazing speed and power enthusiasts love .
A visit to their website reveals a tantalizing glimpse of what ’s ahead : a 100 % electrically powered car that goes from 0 - 60 in 3.9 seconds , getting the equivalent of 256MPG from its electric charge .
The overall cost of running this sleek , green driving machine ?
A paltry 2 cents per mile
13 . Coca -Cola
Coca -Cola has narrowed down 3 environmental goals on which to focus their efforts : water stewardship , sustainable packaging , and climate & energy protection .
Each of these initiatives is detailed and explained at their corporate website .
In just a few years , Coca - Cola has already gotten itself involved in community recycling programs and a complete , sustainability - focused overhaul of its packaging designs .
14 . Enterprise Rent -A- Car
A CNN Money piece tells the story of Enterprise Rent - A - Car ’s foray into more sustainable business practices .
Since January 2008 , Enterprise has boasted the world ’s largest fleet of fuel - efficient vehicles , over 440,000 of which offer drivers 28 MPG or better for highway travel .
Roughly 5,000 of those vehicles are gas / electric hybrids , while another 73,000 have the option of being powered on E85 ethanol .
In addition to these efforts , Enterprise has promised to plant fifty million trees across America ’s forests .
15 . Toyota
Toyota is famous for offering the Prius , the world ’s first mass - market hybrid vehicle .
The popular car is now sold in over 40 countries The Environmental Protection Agency has recognized Toyota ’s efforts as well , crowning the Prius and its 48 MPG as the most fuel - efficient car available for purchase in the U.S. Similar authorities in the United Kingdom have applauded the Prius , namely the UK Department of Transport , who ranked the vehicle as the third least carbon - emitting auto in the country .
16 . Dell
Computer equipment has historically been one of the most difficult and costly products to safely dispose of .
Fortunately , one of the major leaders in that field has stepped forward to make the task less daunting .
Through its “ no computer should go to waste ” recycling program , Dell allows customers to return any Dell - branded product back to the company – for free .
The company has even gone so far as to establish programs that accept computers , monitors , or printers from other companies for safe disposal , as well .
17 . Target
While many retailers are launching plans to “ greenify ” their operations , Target is taking the fight straight to its store shelves .
In May 2008 , the company announced plans to launch an “ eco-clothing ” line at Barney ’s , New York .
Done in collaboration with eco-fashion designer Rogan Gregory , the clothing line is said to have been created using dynamic fabrics and has been available at Target locations since the end of May .
18 . Brooks
Brooks has joined the race to go green by cleverly rolling out a completely biodegradable running shoe .
According to a C / Net report , the $ 140 BioMoGo is just as durable during the time you wear them as any other mass - market shoe .
The decomposition does n’t begin until the shoes are stored in an active enclosed landfill , at which point they will biodegrade in just 20 years instead of the 1,000 years traditional , ethylene vinyl ecetate soles hang around for .
If Brooks ’ predictions are accurate , the BioMoGo will save up to 30 million pounds of landfill waste over those same 20 years .
19 . Honda
According to a CNN Money ’s “ 10 Green Giants ” piece , Honda has gone above and beyond in its environmental duties .
Going so far as to call Honda “ the most fuel - efficient auto company in the US ” , CNN tells the story of how Honda is hard at work on the hydrogen fuel cell powered “ FCX . ”
Honda is apparently also taking steps to create an entire infrastructure for hydrogen , looking forward to a day when – hopefully – more cars will be powered by that instead of gasoline .
In addition to all of this , Honda has pledged to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 5 % between 2005 - 010 , and that ’s not including that 5 % it already achieved from 2000 - 2005 .
20 . Continental Airlines
Continental Airlines has spent over $ 16 billion in the last decade to replace its entire fleet of airplanes with more fuel - efficient ones , in addition to installing fuel - saving “ winglets ” that cut emissions 5 % on its 737 model aircraft .
Beyond that , nitrogen oxide emissions from Continental ’s busy Houston hub have been sliced by an astounding 75 % since the year 2000 .
Continental might also be the only company with 12 full time “ staff environmentalists ” on the payroll who are constantly pairing up with engine manufacturers to design greener , more efficient processes into company operations .
And is if this were n’t enough , the company makes a point of sorting all of its trash to see what can be recycled .
21 . Tesco
This British grocery chain has enlisted its customer base in the fight to go green by offering savings to shoppers who bring reusable shopping bags to their stores .
The company has also turned each of its stores into wind - powered , high - recycling , biodiesel truck delivered epicenters of environmental sustainability , running at such high efficiency Ralph Nader would be beside himself .
In another major breakthrough , Tesco is aiming to estimate the “ carbon costs ” of each item it sells .
22 . S.C. Johnson
S.C. Johnson , maker of indispensable household products such as Windex , has gone on a mission to lessen the environmental impact of its products .
Through their use of the Greenlist Process ( a system that ranks your impact on the environment by evaluating the raw materials you use ) , the company has slashed 1.8 million pounds of volatile organic compounds from its Windex line of products .
Another 4 million pounds of polyvinylidene chloride has been eliminated from Saran Wrap , a major drop in harmful chemicals that seep into landfills when they are disposed of .
The company has also scaled back its coal - fired plants by working to replace them with natural gas and methane powered facilities .
23 . Goldman Sachs
Goldman Sachs was derided by Wall Street insiders for announcing an official environmental policy in 2005 , but to this point , it seems like the critics have been silenced .
The ultra - profitable bank has parlayed its new found green ethos into a bona - fide profit - center .
The firm ’s $ 1.5 million investment in solar , ethanol , and wind have paid off in spades , prompting companies like Kolhberg Kravis Roberts and Texas Pacific to consult Goldman on their own environmentally - focused projects .
It is also said that many of the bank ’s employees and executives are proud , hybrid - driving motorists .
24 . Hewlett - Packard
Another computing company staking its claim to greener pastures is Hewlett Packard .
The company has gotten out in front of the computer disposal issue by owning and operating enormous “ e- waste ” recycling plants that shred discarded , obsolete computer products into raw materials that can be recycled into the industrial food chain .
HP has also agreed to take back computer equipment of all brands , and taken steps to ensure that its own products are 100 % recyclable in the manner discussed above .
Furthermore , the company has promised to lower its energy consumption a full 20 % by the year 2010 .
25 . TJX Companies
The TJX Companies ( such as TJ Maxx , Marshalls , HomeGoods , and Bob ’s ) have kept their eye on environmentally sound business practices long before it was politically correct to do so .
As early as 1988 , TJX became an early adopter of electronic ballast technology , a practice that significantly lowered the use of electricity in the company ’s stores .
TJX also prioritizes lighting conservation at its distribution centers , which use T5 fluorescent bulbs that use 50 % less power than non-fluorescents .
Beyond lighting , TJX ’s distribution centers are purposely structured to recycle the corrugated carboard that comes in from vendors .
According to the company ’s website , “ virtually all our vendor corrugated cardboard is recycled or refused at our distribution centers . ”
That ’s the title of a paper by Michael Kremer and Benjamin Olken .
The bottom line is :
… a union that implements workers ’ preferences will not be evolutionarily stable .
The union that survives must either extract fewer rents for the workers ( thus lowering anti-union expenditures from the employer , or helping keep the employer in business ) or spend excess funds on organizing and bolstering union membership in the broader economy .
A union that spends on membership and organizing drives tends to spread from one firm to the next .
If a union were truly controlled by its members it would take lots of current rents with little concern for the longer - term future of the firm or for the longer - term future of the union .
Here ’s a neat paragraph :
The dynamics of unionization levels also bear a similarity to those under the Susceptible - Infected ( SI ) model of epidemiological dynamics …
In that model , new potential hosts are born uninfected ; the chance that they become infected increases with the number of hosts already infected ; and once hosts are infected , they stay infected until they die .
Note that this comparison is purely positive , not normative .
Yes the paper does offer some evidence but it is more interesting as a theory piece .
Here is an earlier ungated version , there is also 2001 version listed at NBER and here is the current version .
Is that USB or Firewire ?
Firewire has the power , but if those lightbulbs are 2.5 volt , then firewire would probably kill them .
My question is how did they pick it up so quickly .
Popcorn needs at least 212 F to pop .
That steel cup should have been burning hot .
At Valve 's mini-summit on the state of PC gaming in Seattle today , president Gabe Newell revealed that the company is not concerned about the threat of piracy in the PC market .
Responding to a question from Rock Paper Shotgun , Newell said , " When you list the things that we worry about in our business , piracy is not one of them . "
His sentiments run counter to those of many publishers , who feel piracy is killing their PC games business .
But , said Newell , Valve 's Steam distribution platform and the service it provides its customers protects it from that .
" We 've got great facilities that make it very hard for people to pirate , " he said .
" And more importantly , the service value of having an ongiong relationship with us is high enough that it causes people to not be very interested in piracy .
It 's a dangerous thing to pirate one of our games because later on , when we catch you , you lose all your games , or you can't play multiplayer . "
Earlier , Valve 's Jason Holtman explained why the company felt the fear of rampant piracy in emerging markets such as Russia and China was misplaced , and the problem easily solved .
He noted how famous the Russian market was for its piracy , and explained that this was a direct result of games releasing there six months after North America and Western Europe .
It was n't just Steam 's encryption technology , but the ease of simultaneous worldwide releases on the platform that solved the problem for Valve .
" We know that that 's the major place where this rampant piracy myth comes from , " Holtman said .
" Rampant piracy is just unserved customers .
" Russians have money , Russians like to play games and Russians have PCs .
They love going to stores and not having to use Bittorrent sties . "
WASHINGTON --
The Bush administration unveiled a plan to impose new tolls on freeways and encourage more private investment to finance road and mass - transit projects , a move aimed at stirring debate as lawmakers prepare for a major overhaul of transportation policy .
The White House says more tolls and public - private partnerships can solve perhaps the biggest problem confronting the nation 's aging infrastructure :
There are limited funds available to upgrade transportation networks and too many federal funds are doled out inefficiently through earmarks and pet projects that do little to improve mobility or reduce congestion .
The search for alternative funding sources is ramping up because Americans are driving less and shifting to more fuel - efficient vehicles .
That means they will be paying less in gasoline and diesel - fuel taxes , which traditionally have been the biggest source of federal funding for highway and mass - transit construction .
Many states are moving to increase existing tolls .
Pennsylvania , for example , is hoping to win federal permission for new tolls on a standing interstate .
Meanwhile , several states are turning to business consortiums to finance , build and operate new highways , bridges and tunnels , although a political backlash has slowed the push in recent years .
The administration 's proposal comes as Congress gears up to start work later this year on a six - year transportation spending bill that could cost well more than $ 400 billion .
The last multiyear bill , which expires in September 2009 , carried a $ 286 billion tab .
June 8 , 2008 – 10:54 am
An exotic black watermelon was auctioned off in Japan for a record shattering $ 6100
The “ Densuke ” watermelon is a 24lbs exotic black - skinned variety grown only on the northern island of Hokkaido .
The prized watermelon was the biggest selected from 65 from the season ’s first harvest .
An unnamed bidder is a marine products dealer who wanted to support local agriculture .
Normally , these watermelons go for $ 200 - $ 300 a pop .
Although not specific , the unbelievable price of this exotic watermelons were explained :
“ it ’s the unusual black skin and unparalleled taste , It ’s a watermelon , but it ’s not the same , ” said Kazuyoshi Ohira , a spokesman for the Tohma Agricultural Cooperative in Hokkaido
Here ’s the real kicker , though , the watermelon is a bargain compared to the $ 23,500 recently paid in Japan for a pair of ‘ Yubari ’ cantaloupes .
The fall of the Berlin Wall seemed to herald the end of the Cold War and the emergence of a single superpower .
A resurgent Russia 's actions in Georgia have shattered that illusion
When Gordon Brown sits down tomorrow at the conference table with the 26 other EU premiers in the glass - fronted Justus Lipsius building on Brussels 's Rue de la Loi , the significance will not be lost on any of those present .
The last time they sat in emergency session was in 2001 , immediately after al - Qaeda 's attack on America .
This time , they will be meeting to consider Russia 's military actions in response to Georgia 's attempt to retake South Ossetia .
Those present are likely to agree with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband who declared last week that a new era in international relations was upon us : the post - post Cold War , as former US Secretary of State Colin Powell originally framed it .
Russia 's intention to absorb both South Ossetia and Abkhazia into the Russian Federation is being treated as a move of that magnitude .
History , to reverse Francis Fukuyama 's pronouncement on its ending , has decisively begun again .
The ' new world order ' envisaged in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall , an order in which liberal democracies would proliferate across the world as the United States exercised a benign global hegemony , has proved to be a mirage .
First 11 September and then the debacle of Iraq shattered that happy illusion nurtured in the thinktanks of Washington .
Now , in the space of a few weeks , Putin 's tanks have buried it once and for all .
In the face of protests , exhortations and furious remonstrations , Moscow acted as it saw fit in what it considers the Russian backyard , and damned the consequences , assuming there would be none of any note .
This is no unipolar world , designed to Western specifications .
In Syria , Libya , even Turkey ( a US and European friend ) politicians and analysts have noted the consequences of the Georgian crisis - not for what Russia has done but for what the US , EU and Nato have been unable to do : exercise their power to protect an ally .
Trading of accusations has accelerated , with Russia 's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin charging - in language that would not seemed out of place coming from the lips of dour Soviet Cold War-era Minister for Foreign Affairs , Andrei Gromyko - that the US had armed Georgia for war , and suggesting that US military advisers may have been present during fighting .
' I do think this is a pivotal moment , ' says Stephen Flanagan of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , ' not least with Russia 's rapid recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
It puts into question one of the fundamental assumptions of the post - Cold War era - you do n't change borders .
Or at least you do n't if you 're one of the key stakeholders . '
Flanagan 's assessment is echoed by a senior European diplomat working on the Georgia crisis , who says : ' The widely held view among people who think about these things in Europe as well as Washington , was that Russia was determined to respect borders at the ending of the Soviet Union .
That is the major change . '
But if there is agreement that one era of diplomacy has passed , there is less agreement over the nature of the new period and how to negotiate its uncertainies .
For Ivan Krastev of the Centre for Liberal Strategies - and Republican presidential nominee John McCain 's foreign policy adviser , Robert Kagan - the Georgian crisis echoes the power plays of a century ago .
' Europe , ' he wrote soon after the fighting , 'has entered a new 19th century , vapourising the end - of - history sentiment that shaped European politics in the 1990s and replacing it with an older , geopolitical calculus in a modern form . '
On the surface , at least , the return to gun-boat diplomacy appears confirmed by the spectacle of the warships of five nations cluttering the Black Sea , and US and Russian troops competing over two of Georgia 's ports .
But if a new Cold War is coming it is clear it will not be much like the old - or even the brief outbreak of conflict in Georgia .
With a high oil price , £ 300 bn in its reserves , European dependency on Russian energy , and wider dependency on Russian co-operation in issues like Iran and the Middle East , Russia is already well - armed with the weapons needed to fight this war .
While many analysts have taken the Kagan / Krastev line , others are sceptical of describing the new era solely in terms of a competition between the democracies and the autocracies .
Clifford Gaddy of the Brookings Institution , who has met both Putin and George Bush on several occasions , believes that Georgia is a ' turning point ' but is more cautious about apportioning the blame entirely on Putin and his vision of Russia .
' The Georgia crisis is not unique in itself .
It has simply been the event that wakes people up to what has been already happening .
I really think that many leaders in the West failed to acknowledge what was happening .
I liken it to a financial bubble , and the implicit assumption was that Russia was weak .
We considered multiple models for Russia , except for the outcome where Russia became strong and " bad " as defined in our terms of ' good ' - which means " like us " .
No one considered this outcome because no one imagined oil at over $ 100 a barrel . '
Gaddy also rejects the idea that Russia is trying to re-establish an empire or bring back a Cold War similar in scope to the last .
Instead , he sees the current crisis as the inevitable reaction to the experience of Putin and those closest to him over the question of Russia 's ' security ' during the 1990s - when Russia veered towards becoming a failed state .
That concern , existential in Russian society , Gaddy believes was too easily discounted by the West as a rhetorical device of domestic politics : ' Russia in the 1990s was close to being a non-entity .
Survival as a grand power was an issue . '
Into this was interposed the issue of Nato expansion up to Russia 's very borders , sold first by President Bill Clinton and then George Bush , as a mechanism for ' democratisation ' that would guarantee security .
Gaddy says : ' That push was counter - productive and largely responsible for what is happening today .
If we push harder , [ as Gordon Brown suggests ] it will confirm Russia 's worst fear over what Nato is about .
That is what I am afraid of - by pushing ever - harder we end up in a dangerous place . '
The feeling that the world stands in the midst of a definitive reorganisation is shared in Russia .
' We are on the verge of a new Cold War , ' argues Sergei Karaganov , a former adviser to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and now deputy director of the European Studies Institute in Moscow .
' It seems like a Cold War .
I can only hope it will not be so deep . '
For Karaganov , the conflict between Russia and the West has been an inevitable consequence of a scenario that many American writers have recently turned their attention to - the relative decline in US power and the unipolar world that dominated throughout the 1990s - and the emergence of a multipolar world that US and British foreign policy has been slow to react to and acknowledge .
It is not just that the West and the EU has been losing infuence because of mistakes made in places like Iraq , says Karaganov .
' Russia has contributed to what is happening , too , by being too cocky in trying to restore its position in the world too quickly .
Not so long ago we were almost a failed state .
Now we are one of the world 's three big powers again . '
There will be much noise generated by tomorrow 's meeting in Brussels , the likely outcome is an agreement on a series of minor punishments - not enough to reverse what has happened in Georgia , but enough , it is hoped , to discourage Russia in the future .
Among them , it is expected , will be a review of joint Russian - EU partnership agreements ; a declaration of support for Georgia 's territorial integrity ( if not necessarily its President Mikheil Saakashvili , who launched the attack that led to Russia 's intervention ) ; and consideration of new visa restrictions for Russians wanting to come into the Schengen Area .
What none will be able to ignore , in a grouping that gets almost a quarter of its energy from Russia , is that the EU - like the US - has few weapons in its armoury to punish Russia , except by attempting to shame it at a time when Moscow appears determined not to be embarrassed , its President , Dmitry Medvedev , declaring the country is not afraid of a ' new Cold War ' .
There are a few unwilling to be drawn into comparisons with the last Cold War.
Zbigniew Brzezinski , former National Security Adviser to President Jimmy Carter , now a lecturer in US foreign policy , believes the solution to the crisis lies in old - fashioned capitalist economics , an influence notably absent in the days of the Soviet Union .
' It is serious , but it is neither fatal nor tragic .
It is serious because Russia is going through a post - imperial crisis of leadership inspired by post - imperial nostalgia .
It is not tragic or fatal , because Russia is not the Soviet Union .
It is vulnerable , as the flight of capital from its stock market has already shown .
' The difference between Stalin and Putin is that Stalin commited great crimes on a great scale .
Putin has committed petty crimes on a petty scale .
And what is certain is that Russia 's new business elite is not going to be happy if they think their bank accounts could be frozen or their children cannot study in the West .
What is required is calm , deliberate ostracism . '

It is becoming increasingly clear that we are living in a police state the likes of which Adolf Hitler would have approved of .
In the past week , a couple of disturbing news stories detailing extreme police brutality has been reported .
In Arkansas a young man was tasered 19 times while he was incapacitated on the ground injured with a broken back .
The young man had fallen off a bridge and instead of the police helping him , they decided it was necessary to taser him multiple times despite the fact that it was obvious he could n’t be any sort of threat .
In New York City , a cowardly police officer brutally assaulted a bike rider for no reason and to add insult to injury , the police charged the bike rider with assault and other crimes .
The police officers who have engaged in this behavior are cowardly pieces of trash who need to be taken away to prison .
If these cops think they are so tough , we should give them the opportunity to pick fights with hardened criminals in a maximum security prison .
Below is a clip taken from a local NBC News affiliate in the Arkansas area detailing how a young man fell from a bridge , broke his back and then was tasered 19 times by the cowardly authorities while he was incapacitated on the ground .
There is simply no reason to taser somebody who is injured on the ground with a broken back .
Someone who is injured on the ground with a broken back is certainly no threat to anyone .
There was no reason to taser the young man once let alone 19 times as was reported .
Whoever did this should be charged and put in prison immediately .
The young man and his family should sue the police department and the officers that were involved in this brutal assault .
In addition to that fiasco , another cowardly police officer was caught on tape assaulting a bike rider for no reason .
In the video clip , Officer Patrick Pogan assaults Christopher Long a bike rider who was merely trying to get around him by shoving him off his bike .
Long could have potentially broken his neck and even died from this vicious assault by the cowardly police officer .
Fortunately , Pogan has had his badge and gun stripped as a result of his actions .
The following is taken from a New York post report on this situation .
A rookie cop – the son of a highly respected New York City detective – has been stripped of his badge and gun after being caught on video viciously attacking a bicyclist who was part of a Times Square demonstration . ‘
The startling YouTube video shows Officer Patrick Pogan , 22 , apparently setting his sights on – and then tackling – a bicyclist as he pedaled along Seventh Avenue as part of last Friday ’s controversial Critical Mass ride .
The video footage clearly shows that Pogan ’s actions were unwarranted .
Of course the criminal complaint drafted by Pogan does not match up at all to what happened .
Pogan subsequently arrested Long for attempted assault in the third degree , resisting arrest and disorderly conduct even though the video shows that Pogan was the one that assaulted Long .
Below is another blurb from the New York Post report .
What the video does n’t show is Pogan arresting Long for attempted assault in the third degree , resisting arrest and disorderly conduct – charges that kept the Bloomfield , NJ , man behind bars for 26 hours before his release late Saturday .
Adding insult to injury , the criminal complaint drafted by Pogan bears little resemblance to what was witnessed by onlookers and recorded on video .
In court papers , Pogan accused Long of purposely swerving his bicycle to block traffic and then using it as a weapon to run down the officer , knocking him off his feet and causing a " laceration " on his forearm .
" You are pawns in the game .
I ’m going to have your job , " Long told Pogan , as he flailed and kicked his arms and legs , according to the complaint .
Even if you believe that the Critical Mass bike ride protests are an annoyance that does not excuse Pogan ’s actions .
The protests were authorized by the city which makes Pogan ’s actions all the more ridiculous .
All charges should be dropped against Long , where as Pogan should be put in prison for assault and perhaps even an attempt on Long ’s life .
Such an assault could have resulted in Long ’s death considering that Pogan pushed him over when he was in a defenseless position .
Of course this type of thing is becoming a regular occurrence in the United States of America .
This country is gone and is being slowly turned into a 21st century version of Nazi Germany .
As we see more and more of these types of news stories , it shows us that police departments around the country are being transformed into criminal enterprises .
Welcome to the 21st century police state .

US complains about joint - smoking Swiss soldiers : reports
by Staff Writers
Geneva ( AFP ) July 5 , 2008
The US embassy in Switzerland has complained to the authorities here about Swiss soldiers smoking joints and urinating against its mission 's walls during their guard duty , reports said Saturday .
" Out of boredom they smoke joints .
Then they are too lazy to look for a toilet , so they urinate whereever they see fit , " Swiss - German language tabloid Blick reported .
Swiss defence ministry spokesman Sebastian Hueber confirmed the report , telling Swiss news agency ATS : " What the embassy was unhappy about was the tendency of certain soldiers to urinate and smoke joints during their surveillance mission . "
But he said that the complaints were made last year , and that there had not been further complaints this year .
According to Blick , the US embassy had also complained about Swiss soldiers being negligent with their weapons on watch duty .
In March 2004 , one soldier had left his rifle against the embassy 's wall while he wandered off to urinate .
In another incident , a passer - by found two loaded assault rifles outside a building in Zurich where the US honorary consulate office is located , but the two soldiers responsible for them were missing , the paper said .
" How one must behave during embassy missions is now also a subject during their training , " said Hueber .

Last week we have presented first findings of our web forms survey .
The main objective of the survey was to provide designers and developers with some intuition of how effective web forms are designed ; we also presented some guidelines of how an effective and user - friendly web form can be achieved .
We have focused on sign - up forms as we wanted to consider further crucial forms ( e.g. checkout forms ) separately .
Afterward , we ’ve gone through each and every one sign - up form of the selected sites and analyzed the design approaches implemented in these forms .
Below we present the second part of our findings — the results of our survey among web - forms of 100 popular websites where web - forms ( should ) matter .
You might be interested in the following related posts :
Please notice that this post is not about checkout forms — that ’s a topic for another discussion , we may consider them separately in one of the upcoming posts .
We would like to thank Wufoo for providing us with a framework to conduct our survey .
3. Functionality of the forms
In the first part of our research we have considered the placement of the sign - up links and sign - up forms as well as on the visual appearance of forms .
However , no matter how nice a design looks like , if the form does n’t work properly , the completion rates will remain low .
Let us now consider the functionality of the sign - up forms as well as typical problems , patterns and solutions used when it comes to the design of these forms .
3.1 . Hover , active , focus - effects in use ?
Apparently , to improve form completion rates designers try to avoid all kind of distractions and offer a clear , unambiguous and simple web form .
This is essentially the reason why any visual effects are used very moderately — if used at all .
84 % of the web forms which we ’ve reviewed did n’t have any kind of hover , active or focus - effects ,
16 % used very subtle hover - effects .
3.2 . Help , support , tooltips : static or dynamic ?
Sometimes the label of the input fields is n’t specific enough ; however , users need to have a sufficient understanding of the information they need to provide .
Which characters are allowed in the username ?
How many characters should a password have ?
Does a provided e-mail automatically become login to use the service ?
Hints and tooltips provide assistance helping users to minimize the number of times an input should be reconsidered .
Besides , there is nothing more annoying that some input field that does n’t accept user ’s input although it seems to be entirely correct .
To avoid it , designers make use of ( usually ) unobtrusive and clear hints .
57 % of the reviewed web forms provided “ static ” help — tips that are supposed to explain what is expected from the user ’s input ; these tips are obviously placed next to the input field .
10 % of the tooltips appear on demand - usually , after some help icon is clicked or when the user is typing the information in the field of entry .
3.3 . Help , support , tooltips : where are they placed ?
When providing users with assistance , it is necessary to make sure not that the help is simply provided , but that it can be easily found and understood by users .
It is crucial to make sure that users do n’t make mistakes associating a hint to an input field .
To achieve it you need to know where users expect hints to appear .
So where are hints and help usually placed within the form ?
If hints and help appear , they appear …
below the field ( 57 % )
on the right side of the field ( 26 % )
above the field ( 13 % )
on the left side of the field ( 4 % )
We have observed a strong trend toward hints placed directly below the input field .
Usually such hints have a slightly different color , in most cases lighter than the main content .
3.4 . Input validation : static or Ajax ?
Although Ajax seems to have flooded websites with a rich user interaction over the last years , it still has n’t managed to reach a critical mass among popular web - services .
Surprisingly , we were n’t able to identify a trend toward Ajax .
The “ classic ” validation techniques that validate input after the user has clicked on the submit button are more popular than real - time - validation with JavaScript .
According to our research ,
30 % of the forms displayed only an error - message at the top of the form ( no input fields were highlighted ) ,
29 % had highlighted input fields with corresponding messages next to the input field ( no error - messages were provided at the top of the page ) ,
25 % used both error - messages and input fields ,
22 % used real - time validation with Ajax ,
14 % used JavaScript - error warnings ,
1 % used a system - message with a “ go back ” - link .
3.5 . Design of error messages
As you can see , we have identified six different types of error validation .
It is remarkable that 14 % of the forms still use Javascript - error - windows to communicate problems ( e.g. YouSendIt , Mail.ru , Newsvine , Clipmarks , Yandex , see screenshot below ) while only 22 % had at least partial Ajax - validation ( usually for checking available user names ) .
It is also remarkable that not a single site had no validation whatsoever .
Newsvine uses JavaScript - error warnings to communicate problems .
Usually designers tend to report mistakes using a ) error messages appearing after the submit - button is clicked and / or b ) highlighting “ incorrect ” input fields visually .
In the first case errors are usually bulleted and presented as a list at the top of the page , before the form .
In the second case usually the color of the border of the “ wrong ” input field is highlighted together with the label of the field ( in most cases with a red text color and red background color ) .
Sometimes designers combine both techniques and use error message as well as the input field highlighting .
For instance , consider the sign - up form on Ning ( see image below ) which combines both techniques .
Usually , red is used to indicate mistakes ; however it is not necessarily the case .
Tickspot , Mixx.com and Furl use yellow to communicate problems occurred during the form completion .
However , if any color is used at all to communicate a successful registration , then it is green .
It was the case in 97 % of web - sites where success was highlighted visually .
3.6 . Is it necessary to confirm the e-mail ?
Only in 18 % of the cases it was necessary to confirm the e-mail ( e.g. Odeo , Ning ) .
To be honest , we do n’t really see any rationale in asking users to re-type the e-mail — after all , users can see what they input because the e-mail field is not starred out ( updated ) .
Do you ?
3.7 . Is it necessary to confirm the password ?
It sounds reasonable to ask the user to confirm the input as the user does n’t see the information typed in ( he / she sees asterisks instead ) .
However , many sited decide to remove one input field to minimize the time required to complete the form .
In 72 % of the cases it was necessary to confirm the password .
However , many large sites such as Facebook , Friendster , LinkedIn , Stumbleupon , Pownce and Twitter do n’t require password confirmation .
3.8 . Is captcha in use ?
While users would definitely be glad if captchas were gone , they are necessary in practice , because web - sites need to make it impossible for spambots to create numerous accounts as otherwise they would need to filter spam accounts in the database .
According to our research ,
52 % of the sites do n’t use captcha ,
in 39 % of the cases it was impossible to reload the captcha without reloading the whole form .
This is really dramatic from the usability point of view .
However , we could n’t identify a trend toward sign - up forms with or without captchas .
In any case , if you use a captcha , please make sure that it is either always easily readable or users can reload the image in case it is not readable .
Some sites have n’t offered the possibility to reload the captcha , but Digg , AOL , Slashdot , Google and Last.fm have made it possible to the users to listen to it in case it is hard to recognize .
3.9 . Cancel button in use ?
When we were coming up with the design problems to consider when designing web forms , we have expected sign - up forms to not have a cancel - button , as it does n’t really make much sense for the users to abort the form completion after all fields have been typed in .
Yet we were partly wrong .
The cancel - button was used only in 8 % of the cases .
In some of these cases the “ cancel ” - button came right after the “ terms and conditions ” - section ( e.g. Zoho Writer ) .
Consequently , if users do not want to agree to the service conditions , they could abort the process .
On the other side , some services offer a payment plan before the registration ( e.g. Crazyegg ) .
In case users have selected the wrong payment plan they can get back with the cancel - button and select another plan they prefer .
Apart from that : we just do n’t understand why Dzone has a cancel - button placed on the left in its sign - up form .
If the cancel - button is used , it is placed on the right side of the submit - button ( 4 % ) .
Among the sites reviewed in the post cancel and submit - buttons did n’t have a strong visual difference and were placed next to each other .
From the usability point of view it makes more sense to use a clear visual distinction between primary action buttons and secondary action buttons and introduce a significant amount of space to clearly separate them .
3.10 .
Alignment of the submit- button
Depending on the form layout it may make sense to align the submit - button on the left , on the right side or place it in the middle of the layout .
Designers seem to have a strong preference toward left - aligned submit - buttons ( 56 % ) , followed by centered buttons ( 26 % ) .
Right - aligned submit- button is still popular ( 17 % ) , however it is often used when designers want to indicate the next step of the registration .
In such cases submit - buttons are often titled “ Continue ” or “ Next ” .
Reason : in usual desktop - applications “ Next ” - button is also often right - aligned .
3.11 .
Thank - you message
While few years ago most services offered a simple , basic thank - you message after a successful registration ( usually with a link to the login - page ) , now most sites try to motivate users to explore the service immediately .
45 % of the forms asked just registered users to proceed with submitting further information , finding friends in the networks , suggesting the site to friends or filling out his or her profile .
33 % of the forms presented “ places to go ” and functions to explore in an engaging , user - friendly - tone ,
4 % offered a basic “ thank you ” - message ,
2 % had a redirect to the homepage .
Further findings
tab index was used correctly in 99 % of the cases ( the only exception was Habrahabr )
24 % of forms used conversational talk , trying to address users needs by speaking with them through labels .
Informal phrases such as “ What ’s your name ? ” , “ Your e-mail , please ? ” or “ I ’d like to … ” are common in this context .
, trying to address users needs by speaking with them through labels .
Informal phrases such as “ What ’s your name ? ” , “ Your e-mail , please ? ” or “ I ’d like to … ” are common in this context .
38 % of sites prefer to remain formal and use business talk , asking users the required information user - friendly ( e.g. “ Your name ” , “ Confirm password ” etc. ) ,
38 % of sites use system talk ; here visitors are asked for their “ Login ” , “ User password ” , “ Location ” etc .
Bottom line
Let ’s conclude with a brief overview of the findings presented above .
Please keep in mind that we have considered only sign - up forms .
Thousands of recordings that had been largely consigned to the realm of prehistory in the digital age have gained a new life , thanks to the tireless efforts of one man .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Cliff Bolling did n’t realize what he was getting into when he picked up a copy of the first record he ever owned ( Cliff Steward ’s " Aba Daba Honeymoon " ) and realized soon after that " there ’s a whole world of music that you do n’t hear anymore , and it ’s on 78 RPM records . "
( Update : Bolling ’s site was offline on Wednesday , but Yahoo reinstated it on Thursday . )
Once that first discovery started him collecting the early singles known as 78s , he decided to dub some of them to cassette for playing in his car and sharing the music with fellow enthusiasts .
That was about ten years ago .
As the digital music movement started in earnest , Bolling began digitizing his records , and posted a list of first 1,500 songs he had digitized so fellow collectors could see what kind of progress he had made .
Finally , he decided to upload MP3s of every song on the list so that he could access them from anywhere , and so that curiosity seekers could find them .
As things stand now , the 57 - year - old Portland , Oregon , native has uploaded 3,739 MP3s , with plenty more in the pipeline .
Cliff Steward – " Aba Daba Honeymoon " ( 1951 ) :
Even with the MP3s , Bolling ’s site only received 10 - 30 hits per day until appearing on reddit and StumbleUpon in July , reaching over 11,000 hits at its peak .
" I really did n’t know there were so many people in the world interested in this music , " said Bolling told wired.com .
" A lot of younger people go to the site , and it ’s amazing that they hear songs today that originally were recorded 75 years ago .
It ’s pretty cool that people get to listen to this stuff .
As far as copyrights , apparently I ’m okay , because nobody ’s come to shut me down or anything . "
But his wife had worried that recordings from the early half of last century would prove offensive to 21st century ears .
Would listeners be sophisticated enough to handle once - mainstream sentiments that have since been revealed as racist or sexist ?
As a result , the site contains a a note that reads , " Please note that what was considered humor early in the 20th century might today be deemed offensive and politically incorrect .
Some of these old songs reflect that . "
Bolling explained , " My wife told me that I should n’t put those songs onthere because they ’re racially offensive or sexually offensive .
So I
asked around , and people said , ‘ you know , First Amendment –- ( do )
anything you want . "
Despite his wife ’s warnings , Bolling posted thesongs with the exception of one , called " Uncle Tom , " which can only be heard by contactinghim .
So far , he says , no one has complained .
" Everybody else seems tothink ‘ well , put them up there — that ’s the way they are , ’ " he said .
On the day I spoke with him , Bolling said his site received traffic fromAustralia , United Arab Emirates , United Kingdom , Romania , Canada , NewZealand , France and Belgium .
The collection itself now transcends US
borders too , encompassing vintage recordings of Arabic , Greekand Japanese music .
" Kinkajuji " ( Japanese recording from the early 1900s ) :
Like the early US recordings , many of these are fairly noisy .
But to clean up the hissand delete the pops using digital techniques would lessen the impactand appeal of hearing such old recordings played over a global network through tiny , great sounding equipment .
As for the equipment he has used for this formidableproject , Bolling told us his approach was decidedly old school , infitting fashion .
" I have an old 1950s Gerard turntable that I boughtat an estate sale for two and a half bucks , and it ’s got a GE ( GeneralElectric ) VR cartridge in it , which is just excellent for playing 78s . "
The copyright situation surrounding some of these songs is as murky as their sound quality .
Butas with the music ’s political content , Bolling said he has yet to receive a copyright - related complaint about the recordingsbeing online .
Everyone who has come across the recordings seems happy that they ’ve reappeared , or at the very least , does n’t care one way or the other — somewhat refreshing , in these times of copyright lawsuits and name calling .
" I get dozens of emails every day from people telling me how wonderfulit is to hear this music , and people post links to my webpage onwebsites all over the world , " Bolling told us .
" It ’s truly amazing . "
Bolling plans to upload an MP3 for each of the records listedon his site , but his quest does n’t end there .
" I think there ’s onlylike 150 more ( songs on the list ) to go , but I ’ve got about 2500 morerecords to record , " said Bolling .
" I ’ve been digitizing for about fiveyears , " he said , " and it ’ll probably take me another 10 or 15 years todo the rest of it . "

How not to do an American accent
Please turn on JavaScript .

Advertisement Everyone can do an American accent ... at least everyone thinks they can .
But how many would pass muster with a Hollywood studio ?
The BBC's Stephen Robb took a lesson from one of the movie industry 's top accent coaches .
Any actor or actress hoping to convince in a foreign accent must have three words in the back of their mind at all times .
They wo n't be phrases like " shape of mouth " , " position of tongue " or " placement of voice " - although all of these will be fundamental to learning and adopting an accent .
The three words haunting the performer , driving hour after hour of dialect practice , are " Dick " , " Van " and " Dyke " .
NOW LET'S HEAR YOURS
Thanks to all readers who phoned or sent in examples of their American accents .
A selection will be featured on the Magazine on Tuesday The American 's " strike a light , guv'nor " Cockney caricature in Mary Poppins is widely regarded as delivering the worst film accent of all time .
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious , it was not .
And that 's up against competition from Sean Connery playing a Spaniard , an Irishman and a Russian at stages of his career .
British dialect coach Barbara Berkery admits that a lot of actors seeking her tutelage plead at the outset : " I do n't want to sound like Dick Van Dyke . "
Her glittering cast of former students include Gwyneth Paltrow , whom she trained for Emma and Shakespeare in Love , and Renee Zellweger for Bridget Jones 's Diary and Miss Potter .
Half - hour challenge Paltrow won an Oscar for Shakespeare in Love and Zellweger was nominated as Bridget Jones , but probably the greater tributes to their English accents were the nominations from an obviously impressed British Academy - they sounded the part .
Berkery has also coached Brad Pitt ( Seven Years in Tibet ) , Jim Carrey ( A Christmas Carol , due out next year ) and Geoffrey Rush ( Pirates of the Caribbean ) , and is currently working with Jake Gyllenhaal on his English accent for Prince of Persia .
You must play a character who has an accent , but you must never play an accent
Barbara Berkery
In other words , or for words in another accent anyway , London - based Berkery has become the English dialect coach Hollywood turns to .
" It 's a nice position to be in , " she says .
Usually conducting her training for several weeks in the run-up to a production , and then throughout the shoot , Berkery has consistently achieved convincing results with hugely - dedicated and highly - talented actors ; what she can do with me in half an hour is a different challenge altogether .
Exposure to US films and television means most people probably believe they can affect a passable American accent - myself included .
But Berkery explains that " mimicry is not the same as doing accents - if somebody is just mimicking , I think we do feel it is n't quite truthful . "
Dick Van Dyke 's accent in Mary Poppins is one of the worst ever Her work involves building the accent authentically by teaching the real mouth shapes and tongue positions involved - for a general American accent , she tells me , that means a wide mouth and the tongue higher up in the mouth .
She also tells me to smile , in order to place the voice towards my nasal resonator - one of the three voice resonators along with the facial and throat resonators .
Berkery describes learning to do an accent as having " a mask on the face that fits perfectly " .
With my lifted tongue , wide mouth , attempted smile , and the concentration involved in maintaining these as we start voice exercises , my mask resembles something like Jack Nicholson 's
The Joker with a lobotomised , vacant look in the eyes .
I feel certain that a cinema audience would find it distracting .
Berkery takes me through some of the major vowel changes from standard English to general American - their short " ah " in bath and sample , the " aw " in cloth and Boston - and the sound that comes out of my mouth is unrecognisable to me .
Julia Roberts in Mary Reilly ran Van Dyke close
It is a long way from my own south - east England accent , but not much nearer my trusted American impression .
It does sound vaguely American , but like an over - the - top , slightly camp game show host with an occasional lisp - not what I had been aiming for at all .
And I find the process very unnerving .
" The voice is the soul and you are moving it , " says Berkery .
" People do find it very frightening - it 's like being off - balance . "
As we continue , moving from vowel exercises to working on consonant changes , Berkery frequently offers comments like " Make it less " and " Do n't do as much " .
TRY THIS AT HOME
Follow these instructions to start learning an American accent : Widen your mouth , as you would making the 'ee ' sound in weed Smile , to place the voice towards your nasal resonator Position your tongue further up in the mouth , rather than against the ridge behind the top teeth Read out loud the following :
Round the rugged rock , the ragged rascal ran .
Saying 'l ' as you do the final letters in bell , well and level , read the following :
Lucky Lily liked to live in Louisiana .
Barbara Berkery 's advice : " Let yourself go , and have fun . "
Not only is my performance dreadful , there is clearly much too much of it ; my overacting makes Dick Van Dyke 's infamous turn look like a masterclass of subtlety and technique .
" You must n't play an accent , " Berkery says .
" You must play a character who has an accent , but you must never play an accent . "
Berkery and her students start with nothing and build an accent from its essential parts .
My brief lesson hints at the phenomenal amount of work involved in reaching a point where that accent convinces on a giant screen , in surround sound and over a two - hour running time .
While Berkery suggests most actors " can have a good stab at the accent if you have enough time " , she stresses that those that " get it really perfect " do so through exceptional dedication .
She had two months working with Zellweger before filming started on Bridget Jones 's Diary , comprising lessons in the morning followed by afternoons out together in London when the actress was forced to keep up her accent .
Zellweger later worked undercover in a publishing house using her English accent , and also maintained it on set for the entirety of the film 's shoot .
" Some people never , ever heard her own accent until we finished the film , " says Berkery .
Master of the House : Hugh Laurie is acclaimed as an American " It was a testament to her talent and hard work .
It was a complete transformation ; she is a girl with a very strong Texan accent and she did completely transform herself . "
An authentic accent will be " second - nature " to an actor , Berkery says , likening it to fluency in a foreign language where a person does n't have to think about the process of speaking .
" You do n't want the audience to notice , " she adds .
" You do n't really want people to think , ' That 's a good accent , ' because if you think that you are not thinking about the character . "
On those terms , maybe my accent was n't such a flop after all - nobody 's ever going to be distracted thinking how good it was .

What a great story .
It never occurs to us that there is such a thing as an American accent .
This video was a lot of fun for a Texan to watch .
Had no idea it was so difficult .
Steve Hoxworth , Laredo , Texas U.S.A .
Trying to sound ' American ' is all well and fine , but what I , as a native American , find very annoying is that everyone who attempts our accent seems to adopt a southern dialect .
This is not the only accent in the United States !
I implore those of you who want to speak with an American accent , even if it is to ridicule , at least attempt a different region , say Midwest , West or , if you 're brave enough , the north - eastern accent .
Just like Britain , every region has their own accent , so it 's not completely fair to ball them all up into one ' American ' accent label .
Michelle , Aberdeen , Scotland
Only ever having seen her in Bridget Jones I remember being astonished upon seeing an interview with Zellweger and realising she is American .
On the other hand do n't criticise Van Dyke until you hear that guy playing Susan 's English boyfriend in Desperate Housewives - excruciating .
It 's a pity good voice coaching is not available to some members of the general public .
Mark , Liverpool , UK
It sounded best when you relaxed and just went with it .
There are so many types of American accents that it becomes difficult even for us to pinpoint where someone grew up .
It evolves as well , depending on where you live .
Well done , Stephen .
Candace , New Jersey , US " ... standard English to general American - their short " ah " in bath " - a short " ah " is standard English in other parts of the UK .
" aaaaah " in Bath is very SE .
MarkC , Manchester , UK Robb would probably do well reading some Jack Kerouac , since he had some of the intonation right .
Get an audio recording of Jack reading Railroad Earth .
Aside from that I wonder why there were no mentions of regional dialect , especially given that New England accents vary from one town to the next .
DP , Birmingham UK I teach French to adults and would love to know more about the details of forming different accents by placing your face and tongue etc in the right position .
I think what voice coaches do for film stars , language teachers should know how to do for their students .
At the moment we mainly rely on mimicry , but I do tell my students to widen their mouths when they say a French " R " .
Fiona Cooper
I do n't think there is really such a thing as " an American accent " , any more than there 's such a thing as " an English accent " .
Just as speakers from southern England have difficulty distinguishing between Yorkshire and Lancashire accents , so Britons in general find it difficult to distinguish even between U.S. and Canadian accents , let alone , say , Boston and New York .

Obama Becomes First Black Democratic Presidential Nominee
The third black senator since Reconstruction beats Clinton for nomination .
June 3 , 2008  --
After a bruising battle , Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , has won enough delegates to clinch the Democratic Party 's presidential nomination becoming the first African - American major party presidential candidate in the nation 's history .
But the candidate emerges battered after a bitter , five - month fight against Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , who was vying to become the party 's first female presidential nominee and was once considered the likely nominee .
Delivering soaring speeches tied to a popular message of hope and change , Obama 's insurgent candidacy inspired record - breaking campaign contributions , record turnout by black voters , and wide support from independents , liberals , young voters , and high - income , better - educated Democrats .
Although he won the majority of primary contests -- 33 to Clinton 's 20 , not including Michigan and Florida -- the Illinois senator struggled to win the support of white , blue - collar voters , older voters and Hispanic voters .
The issue of race cropped up again and again for the man seeking to become the nation 's first black president .
When tapes of Obama 's longtime pastor excoriating America surfaced , the Illinois senator distanced himself from his pastor , and ultimately from his Chicago church , delivering a widely applauded speech on race and religion .
If Obama is elected president , he will be , at 47 , among the youngest presidents in U.S. history .
His Republican opponent , Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , would be the oldest presidential candidate to win a first term in office at age 72 .
Obama's Rise
No stranger to record books , Obama , became the fifth African - American senator in U.S. history and was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review .
Born to a white , American mother and a black , Kenyan father , Obama has spoken openly of his struggle to find acceptance in the black community .
First living in Hawaii , Obama 's family moved to Jakarta , Indonesia , when he was 6 , where he lived for a time with his mother and Indonesian stepfather .
He has credited his upbringing for making him sensitive to America 's flagging image abroad .
Attending Columbia University and Harvard Law School , Obama worked as a community organizer , a constitutional law professor , and a lawyer in Chicago before becoming a senator in the Illinois state Senate in 1996 .
Over his eight years in the Illinois Capitol , Obama earned a reputation as a consistently liberal senator who reflected the views of voters in his Chicago district .
He also developed a reputation as someone willing to reach across the aisle to build consensus .
Obama 's 2004 bid for the Senate was filled with dramatic turns in his favor .
In a crowded Democratic field , Obama emerged with the Democratic nomination after allegations of domestic abuse and a well organized Obama effort felled his opponent .
Jack Ryan , the Republican nominee , left the race after a court ordered divorce records be released , leaving Obama unopposed until former presidential candidate and conservative radio commentator Alan Keyes , who lived in Maryland , took Ryan 's place .
Obama won in a landslide .
The Speech
Many Americans -- indeed , many Democrats -- had never heard of the charismatic politician before he delivered a stirring speech at the Democratic National Convention in Boston in July 2004 .
He called on Americans to leave behind party polarization , saying , " There is not a liberal America and a conservative America ; there 's the United States of America . "
The speech instantly made Obama a star , with political pundits suddenly predicting the state senator who had not yet been elected to the U.S. Senate might someday be positioned for a presidential run .
Rep. Jan Schakowsky , D - Ill. , said at the time that during a meeting with President Bush in February of 2004 , the Congresswoman wore an Obama button on her coat .
" I do n't know him , " Bush said , according to Schakowsky .
" Oh , you will , Mr. President , " she responded .
Obama 's newfound stardom and oratory skills made him a draw at political events and fundraisers across the country , able to attract media attention and raise money for other Democrats .
Expanding on his speech , Obama 's 2006 book , " The Audacity of Hope : Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream , " rocketed up The New York Times best - seller list .
Even his candid admission that he used cocaine and smoked pot in high school and college , in his first book , " Dreams From My Father : A Story of Race and Inheritance , " did little to tarnish his image as an up - and - coming political phenomenon .
Historic Bid
Announcing his presidential bid in February 2007 on the steps of the Illinois state legislature where Abraham Lincoln gave a famous speech condemning slavery and calling for the United States to unite , Obama said that as president he would heal a divided nation .
" I know that I have n't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington .
But I 've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change , " Obama said .
Obama has focused his campaign on pulling U.S. troops out of Iraq , universal health care , and stimulating the economy with a middle - class tax cut .
At a time when the majority of Americans believe the Iraq War was a mistake , Obama reminded voters that his closest Democratic rivals , Clinton and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina , voted to give President Bush the authority to wage the war .
A Front -Runner Falters
Last year , Clinton was considered the front - runner , with big - money donors backing her bid , not to mention a political team mirroring her husband 's inner circle and an organized effort to attract women voters .
But Clinton 's message of experience , Washington resume and her front - runner strategy left some Democrats cold and open to Obama 's and Edwards ' anti-Washington message .
Waging an outsider campaign , Obama 's campaign raised a record - breaking $ 58 million during the first half of 2007 , and boasted record - breaking support among people donating $ 200 and less .
Obama also attracted high - profile celebrity endorsements from talk - show queen Oprah Winfrey , and won highly sought - after Democratic establishment support from Sen .
Ted Kennedy , D - Mass. , Caroline Kennedy , the daughter of former President John F. Kennedy , Sen. John Kerry .
D- Mass. , and California first lady Maria Shriver .
As voters went to the polls in the early voting states of Iowa , New Hampshire , Nevada and South Carolina , Obama 's campaign raised $ 36.8 million , the most ever raised in one month by a presidential candidate in the Democratic primaries .
Early Momentum
Obama split early voting state victories with Clinton in January , winning Iowa and South Carolina , and narrowly losing New Hampshire and Nevada .
Gaining momentum , Obama racked up more convention delegates than Clinton in all of the early contests .
With Clinton and Obama running neck and neck , the Democratic campaign took on a decidedly negative tone .
Days before the New Hampshire primary , Bill Clinton questioned Obama 's record on Iraq , saying it was wrong he was able to trumpet superior judgment on Iraq by claiming he had been against the war from the start .
" Give me a break .
This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I 've ever seen , " Bill Clinton said .
The former president also drew outrage when he compared Obama 's South Carolina win to the Rev. Jesse Jackson 's primary wins in the state in 1984 and 1988 .
The comments created a furor , with some suggesting Clinton was trying to dismiss Obama and bring attention to his race .
During the media firestorm over the issue , Clinton told a Philadelphia radio station the Obama campaign was playing the race card .
" I think that they played the race card on me .
And we now know , from memos from the campaign and everything , that they planned to do it all along , " Clinton said in a telephone interview with WHYY .
Super Tuesday , Super Split
Trailing the two front - runners , Edwards dropped his presidential bid days before the Super Tuesday sweep of primaries Feb 5 , when 22 states held primaries and caucuses .
With Obama and Clinton locked in a tight , escalatingly bitter fight for delegates , the first - of - it 's kind Feb .
5 Democratic primary contests did nothing to clarify the Democratic field when Obama and Clinton traded Super Tuesday victories .
Obama went on to win 12 straight primary contests in February , but lost contests to Clinton in the delegate - rich states of Ohio and Texas .
His failure to wrap up the nomination and secure the number of delegates needed to win left him open to attacks by the Clinton campaign , which said he was n't experienced enough to be commander - in - chief and that she was the better candidate to win against McCain .
Obama and Clinton continued to trade primary victories throughout the campaign , exposing the Illinois senator 's weakness in attracting white , blue - collar voters .
Role of Race in the Race
In March tapes surfaced of incendiary sermons by Obama 's longtime pastor the Rev. Jeremiah Wright in which the pastor said , " God Damn America " for the way it treats blacks , and said the United States brought on the 9/11 attacks with its own " terrorism . "
Obama gently distanced himself from Wright , now retired , who had been his pastor for more than 20 years , who had married Obama and his wife , Michelle , and baptized both of his daughters .
The controversy led Obama to make one of the most stirring speeches of his campaign on the issue of race .
Standing in the Constitution Center in Philadelphia , Obama condemned Wright 's remarks , and then offered a historical perspective , citing " the complexities of race in this country that we 've never really worked through . "
" Race is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now .
We would be making the same mistake that the Rev. Wright made in his offending sermons about America -- to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distorts reality , " Obama said .
After Wright reiterated some of his remarks during a speech at the National Press Club and in television interviews , Obama strongly denounced him .
He later resigned from the Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago after another pastor , Father Michael Pfleger mocked Clinton .
Obama 's speech on race prompted New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson to endorse Obama , and other superdelegates followed .
After a stinging defeat in North Carolina and barely squeaking out a win in Indiana , Clinton vowed to stay in the race at least until the last primaries June 3 , despite the fact that she trailed Obama in pledged and unpledged delegates , and her campaign was bleeding money .
The Clinton campaign announced in May that the senator had loaned herself $ 6.425 million -- bringing her personal loans to her campaign to $ 11.425 million -- making her the second biggest self - funder this election cycle , behind former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney .
In a dramatic effort to woo superdelegates to his campaign , and perhaps to allay concerns that he fails to win the support of white , blue - collar workers , Obama announced he has won the coveted endorsement of his former Democratic rival , former Sen. John Edwards .
Clinton fought until the last primary contests were held in Montana and South Dakota June 3 , hoping a surge of support from superdelegates -- those 797 party officials , members of Congress and state party leaders who can vote for any candidate they choose at the party 's Denver convention in August -- would allow her to catch up to Obama 's delegate lead .
Obama vs. McCain
After a bruising primary nomination contest , Obama now faces the task of uniting the Democratic Party behind him while taking on McCain and Republican opponents who have been content to watch the two Democratic candidates tear at each other during a six - month - long primary season .
A relative unknown before the primary race , Obama now faces a presidential contest against a former prisoner - of - war turned maverick GOP senator with strong defense policy credentials .
Obama goes into the general election as the new kid on the block , younger and less experienced but armed with an appealing message of hope and change against a Republican tied to the Iraq War .
The Democratic presidential candidate may also benefit from a Republican president with record - low approval ratings , and 82 percent of Americans who say the country is seriously on the wrong track .

Republicans use it as a cautionary tale .
" If you like government - run health care programs , I suggest you go to Canada or England , or some of the other countries that do before you embrace that proposal , " presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain said at a forum in St. Paul this June .
" To those who want a Canadian - style , single payer national health program , please show us the Mayo Clinic or the Medtronic of Canada .
They do not exist , " U.S. Sen .
Norm Coleman , R - Minn. , said in his acceptance speech at the state Republican Convention .
Canada 's system is called " single payer , " because the government provides health insurance for everyone .
It is like one big insurance company that covers everybody 's medical bills .
All the money comes from taxes .
And to be clear : neither Coleman 's opponent , DFL candidate Al Franken , nor McCain 's opponent , Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , is proposing a system like Canada 's single payer system .
Both support the idea in principle , but they say it is not where the U.S. is headed .
" I never said that we should try to go ahead and get single payer , " Obama said in a Jan. 21 debate .
" What I said was that if I were starting from scratch , if we did n't have a system in which employers had typically provided health care , I would probably go with a single payer system . "
" We 're not going to get national , single payer health care with this Congress , or even with a Congress that has anything less than 60 Democrats , " Al Franken said in an appearance on Minnesota Public Radio 's Midday program .
Both Obama and Franken want to reduce or eliminate the number of Americans without insurance , and both envision greatly increasing government 's role in the health care system .
But neither of them proposes eliminating private insurance .
Gordon Buchanan , 49 , has had good experiences as a patient in both the U.S. and Canada .
He is currently waiting for a liver transplant in the U.S. and is too sick to work .
He is grateful he can fall back on Canada 's universal health care system when his U.S. insurance runs out in two years .

Yet , Canada keeps popping up in the American health care debate .
So how are things going up there ?
It should n't be hard to find out .
You do n't even have to cross the border to find people with experience in both systems .
The Web site CanadaToTwinCities.com has an e-mail list of 450 expatriates .
One of them is Gordon Buchanan , 49 , who has spent lots of time in hospitals on both sides of the border .
Eighteen years ago , Buchanan 's liver and kidneys stopped working .
His doctors still do n't know why .
He got a transplant in Ontario , Canada , which cost him nothing and changed his life .
But then , two years ago , Buchanan got sick again .
This time he was living in the U.S .
" All my skin turned yellow , and my kidney function was dropping , " Buchanan said .
Buchanan needs another liver transplant .
He 's on the list , here , waiting for one .
And he 's too sick to work .
For now , he has insurance through his job , but that wo n't last forever .
" I think I have about two more years , " Buchanan said , " at which point if I have n't had a transplant , and I 'm not back working , then I have to go back to Canada . "
Buchanan has had good experiences as a patient in Canada and the U.S. , including at the Mayo Clinic .
He wants to stay in Minnesota , because he has a daughter in school , a house and a life here .
But he still prefers the Canadian system .
Michael and Jen Ifill moved to the Twin Cities from Canada seven years ago and never want to move back .
One of the big reasons is the U.S. health care system .
MPR Photo / Curtis Gilbert
" Can you imagine never , ever having to worry about going to see a doctor ? "
Buchanan asked .
" No matter what your money situation , job situation , you never , ever see a bill .
The level of tension in everyone is just that much less , just because of that one issue . "
But not all the Canadian Twin Cities transplants have such fond feelings for Canada 's system .
Four months after moving to the U.S. in 2001 , Michael Ifill tore his Achilles ' tendon .
He was amazed to get an MRI within a week .
He probably would have waited months back in Winnipeg .
He had surgery and a complete recovery .
Meanwhile , back in Canada , one of his cousins tore her Achilles ' , as well .
" There , they steered her away from the surgery , and through some complications of things that could have been picked up on she developed a blood clot and ended up dying , " Ifill said .
Ifill and his wife Jen never want to move back to Canada , and health care is the main reason .
She 's only 37 years old , but she 's already had her hip replaced here in the U.S.
That is another one of those operations people have to wait for in Canada .
She says at the time she left Winnipeg , the wait stood at 18 months .
" That would have been 18 months probably after I could no longer work , " Jen Ifill said .
If you have a medical emergency in Canada , there are no waiting lists .
The waits are for procedures the government deems to be non-necessary ones .
But Jen Ifill points out :
When you need a hip replacement , it sure feels necessary .
" I could n't really walk , " she said .
" I mean , I could walk from one point to another , but grocery shopping , going to the park , I could n't do any of that . "
That 's why Michael Ifill does n't want to see the U.S. move toward a Canadian - style system .
" Crime , violence , things like that does n't scare me , but universal health care -- that 's the one thing that scares me , " Ifill said .
On a number of key health indicators , Canada actually does better than the U.S .
It has a higher average life expectancy and lower infant mortality rate .
But the U.S. does better on other measures , like the percentage of people who survive after they 're diagnosed with cancer .
" If you have something seriously , seriously wrong with you and really need the entire panoply of high - tech medicine , it 's probably better to be in the United States , " said Johns Hopkins professor Gerard Anderson , who has studied both health insurance systems .
" If , on the other hand , you have a chronic condition , or you 're basically just healthy , you 're probably better off in Canada . "
Anderson says Canada is way ahead of the U.S. in controlling the cost of health care .
" In the 1970 's we spent about the same amount as Canada did , " he said .
" Now we 're spending about twice as much as Canada is spending on health care . "
According to a survey from the U.S. based Commonwealth fund , Canadians are more satisfied with their health care system than Americans are .
Only 12 percent of Canadians think their system needs a total overhaul .
In the U.S. , that number jumps to 34 percent , the percentage of Americans think our health care system is broken .
But there is a growing movement for health care reform in Canada .
" We have a situation now where we are ranked 24th in the world in the number of doctors per-population , and we used to be ranked , in the early ' 70s , fourth in the world , " said Dr. Brian Day , President of the Canadian Medical Association .
" So , things are not going well in Canada , and change is about to happen . "
Day wants the government to change the way it pays hospitals , and he wants to see a private health care system flourish alongside Canada 's public one .

The Old Photomaton : Portraits for the Poor , Rich and Celebrities
In 1926 , a Jewish inventor from Siberia named Anatol Josepho opened a photo - booth concession , the first Photomaton in the world .
Mr. Josepho kept the Photomaton “ studio , ” as he called it , open 24 hours .
In April 1927 , Time magazine reported that 280,000 customers had entered his booths in the first six months .
It was such an instant hit that the photo booth spread from that spot in Times Square to arcades , amusement parks , state fairs , bus depots and five - and - dimes around the country .
Across eight decades it has recorded countless youthful frolics , loving kisses and inebriated indiscretions .
Its popularity survived the Depression , the vanishing of the old arcades and five - and - dimes and the proliferation of disposable , digital and cellphone cameras .
But today , the old - fashioned booths with their “ dip ‘ n ’ dunk ” chemical developing process and breathless wait for the damp strip of black - and - white images to slide out are disappearing into scrapheaps or into the homes of collectors ( Tim Burton and Quentin Tarantino among them ) , giving way to booths that are powered by digital , computerized equipment .
When it first opened , there were people standing all the way around the block .
They spent 25 cents each to pose and then wait the eight minutes it took to process a strip of eight small photos .
The old photo booths served as little portrait studios for the poor , the rich and even celebrities ( in the old days ) .
Among them was New York ’s Gov. Al Smith , not the last political figure to step into a photo booth .
In 1953 , the newlyweds Jack and Jackie Kennedy took glowing self - portraits in one .
In the 1960s , Andy Warhol often used the photo booths tin Times Square to take portraits , including his own , which he incorporated into his art .
When Warhol went to a 42nd Street arcade , he always had to try several photo booths so he could find the one that had the right combination of chemicals to produce the best imagery .
He was ofent there all day with rolls of quarters , and he was quite choosy about the poses .
Warhol ’s use of photo booths was consistent with his appreciation of mug shots , snapshots and news photos .
Warhol was a great connoisseur of these vernacular types of photography .
He was n’t making judgments .
He understood that it does n’t have to be a work of art to be a great image .

This :
We like to talk about the amazingly complex machinery of the cell : flagella that resemble finely tuned outboard motors , or complex information processing circuits that help a cell process information about its environment .
Biologists work hard at understanding how these systems work .
They will take a wiring diagram like the following , and ask why is it set up this way ?
What is the function of this circuit ?
( Side note :
This genetic circuit , taken from an example involved in yeast cell division , involves both genes and transcription factor proteins , but for semantic simplicity , I 'm just calling them all genes . )
Here 's how to read this diagram : arrowheads indicate one gene activating another ; a bar instead of an arrowhead means one gene isanother .
Basically what 's going on here is that Gene 4 has to get turned on at the right time by Gene 2 , which is turned on by Gene 1 .
But Gene 1 also turns on Gene 3 , which can switch on Gene 4 , but for some perverse reason , is n't supposed to , so Gene 1 ends up both activating and inhibiting Gene 4 .
Why is this set up this way ?
Sometimes we have to remind ourselves that in some instances there is no purpose to all of this complexity .
Sometimes a genetic circuit , while it may get the job done , has no deep functional purpose for its structure - that structure is an artifact of evolutionary history .
In this case , I gave you an example from a small genetic circuit involved in yeast cell division .
The excessive complexity of this particular circuit is underscored by a parallel circuit ( in fact , a homologous one , formed by gene duplication , serving essentially the same function ) which achieves the exact same result in a much more simple way :
If you 're reverse engineering a human designed engine , you can legitimately ask " What did the engineer have in mind by designing things this particular way ? "
In biology we do n't have that particular luxury - a design may have a specific functional purpose , or it may not , and an alternative could be just as good .
Evolutionary biologist Michael Lynch rather bluntly , if not combatively , makes the same point ( free full text ) , not about genetic circuits , but about the complexity in our genomes : " Emergent biological features such as complexity , modularity , and evolvability , all of which are current targets of considerable speculation , may be nothing more than indirect by - products of processes operating at lower levels of organization . "
Lynch argues that much of the complex structure of the genomes of multicellular organisms ( compared with the more simple genomes of single - celled organisms ) arises not because it 's useful , but because it can't be avoided given the underlying population genetics .
This is one reason biology is so hard .
Reverse engineering complex systems is hard enough , but the sheer , cussed contingency in biology can really throw a wrench in the works .
We are all overwhelmed by the amount of data in our feed readers .
While this problem is unavoidable if you keep on adding new feeds in it , they could be automatically filtered and categorized to reduce the flow of data .
I wanted for a long time to try out some custom filters over my feeds to find for example related entries , by trying to understand the meaning of the posts , using tools like NLTK .
So I needed a playground for this , where I could play with feeds .
I think the closest tool for this is to use Yahoo Pipes but as far as I know , the only way to create custom filters is to run a web service and call it from Yahoo Pipes .
Anyways , I started to code a framework ( at first it was an example for my latest book ) that looks a lot like Yahoo Pipes in its principles .
I do n’t have any User Interface at this time of course , but a simple plugin - based tool that will let me combine my code snippets with feeds .
It is called Atomisator ( see http://atomisator.ziade.org).
The process is quite simple :
Readers are plugins that know how to read a source and provide entries out of it .
Filters are plugins that know how to remove unwanted entries , or enhance them ( change their title , summary , etc. ) .
They can be combined .
the entries are then pushed in a database .
This is useful to avoid doublons , and to keep track of past entries .
to create the feed , the entries are read from the database Enhancers are plugins that will add to entries extra info .
Typically info that ca n’t be stored , like Digg comments if the entry is detected on Digg , or Google related searches , and so on The feed is then generated .
Right now I am focusing on making it fast , which is not simple because the plugins can play with all entries in the database .
It is in early stage and undertested , but it kinda works .
I pushed it at PyPI to see of it meets interest .
If it does , I will document the process of writing plugins .
Make sure you have SQlite installed , and give it a try :
$ easy_install atomisator.main
$ atomisator -c atomisator.cfg
$ atomisator
You will have an atomisator.xml feed created .
You can add other feeds in atomisator.cfg as well and try them .
Now with this environment , I can start to try out custom algorithms over my feeds .
I ’ve been told the name does n’t sound right in Ehglish , but it does in French so I keep it 😉

Father Funes says the universe is so vast that other life forms may exist
The Pope 's chief astronomer says that life on Mars can not be ruled out .
Writing in the Vatican newspaper , the astronomer , Father Gabriel Funes , said intelligent beings created by God could exist in outer space .
Father Funes , director of the Vatican Observatory near Rome , is a respected scientist who collaborates with universities around the world .
The search for forms of extraterrestrial life , he says , does not contradict belief in God .
The official Vatican newspaper headlines his article ' Aliens Are My Brother ' .
' Free from sin '
Just as there are multiple forms of life on earth , so there could exist intelligent beings in outer space created by God .
And some aliens could even be free from original sin , he speculates .
Asked about the Catholic Church 's condemnation four centuries ago of the Italian astronomer and physicist , Galileo , Father Funes diplomatically says mistakes were made , but it is time to turn the page and look towards the future .
Science and religion need each other , and many astronomers believe in God , he assures readers .
To strengthen its scientific credentials , the Vatican is organising a conference next year to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of the author of the Origin of Species , Charles Darwin .

American speed skater Joey Cheek has done a great deal to bring global attention to the immense suffering of the people of Darfur , forming Team Darfur and even going so far as donating his $ 40 k Olympic bonus to the cause in 2006 .
Unfortunately , the gold and silver medalist was punished for his activism by the Chinese government -- who has contributed to the genocide in Darfur by fueling and supporting Sudan 's murderous military government -- when they revoked his visa this week , preventing him from attending this year 's Olympics in Beijing .
During the opening ceremony NBC's Bob Costas discussed the controversy surrounding Cheek and the Chinese government , noting that he made it clear he would not protest the Chinese government during the Olympics :
Costas : " Joey Cheek had planned to invoke the Olympic truce , the time - honored concept of an Olympic truce , to call attention to the humanitarian crisis in Sudan .
He did not intend to directly protest the Chinese government .
The fact that they pulled his visa is so contrary to the Olympic ideal it is simply outrageous . "
I wondered if NBC was going to cave on this or take a stand and defend Cheek against the reprehensible actions of the Chinese government .
I applaud Costas for choosing the latter .

I ’ve been working recently on improving the performance of locking in D ( the D programming language ) .
At this moment the synchronized statement in D simply uses the underlying OS facilities –CriticalSection on Windows and pthread mutex on Linux .
This incurs a substantial performance hit for multithreaded programming .
I looked at research in the Java community and found some interesting solutions .
They are all versions of Thin Locks , first described by Bacon et al .
These guys figured out that when a program is entering a synchronized section , in about 80 % of the cases the section is not locked by anybody .
The next most common case is nested locking –the section is locked by the same thread recursively .
Only rarely there is actual contention for a lock .
And when that happens , it ’s very likely that it will happen again and again .
Such contended lock is most likely part of a shared data structure designed to be accessed by multiple threads .
Thin Locks optimize the most common case of no contention .
Every Java
Object has a word in its header that is used as a thin lock .
If this field is zero ( I ’m skipping details here ) , the object is not locked .
When a thread enters a synchronized section , it optimistically assumes that the lock is zero and tries to flip it to a non -zero value .
This is done in one atomic operation , Compare And Swap ( CAS ) .
Most processor either have such an instruction built in , or provide primitives to implement it .
CAS checks the value in memory , comparing it to the “ expected value . ”
If the comparison succeeds , the “ new value ” is written in its place .
In our case , we expected the value of the thin lock to be zero , and the new value we want to put there is the ( non - zero ) thread ID of the lock taker .
If the CAS succeeds , we are done , we owne the lock .
If the CAS fails , the lock has already been taken .
Again , the most likely case is that our own thread holds it .
So we check if our thread ID is stored in the thin lock .
If so , we increment the count field of the thin lock ( several fields are cleverly mashed together into one word ) .
We ’re done !
If we do n’t find our own thread ID in the thin lock , we know we have contention .
We have to inflate the lock–allocate an additional object ( the fat lock ) that holds the general - purpose OS - based mutex .
Of course we also check if the thin lock has n’t already been inflated , in which case we just lock the fat lock .
The inflation process is a little tricky –we can’t just modify the thin lock while it ’s bein held by another thread .
Instead we spin wait for it to be released , then try to acquire it ourselves , and then inflate it .
Once inflated , the lock remains inflated forever ; which usually is the right thing to do anyway , since a lock that ’s been contended once , is likely to be contended many times .
The one - time spinning is amortized across many accesses .
Of course there are details that I ’ve omitted , but I gave you the gist of the algorithm .
It makes un-contended locking so cheap ( one CAS ) that in most cases there is no reason to implement two versions , one for single - and one for multithreaded use , of the same data structure .
A single - threaded program does n’t have to pay the multithreaded penalty when using general - purpose libraries .
A revolutionary scheme to grow organic cod in Scottish fish farms , touted as the ethical answer to a global crisis in fish stocks , has been shut down after it lost £ 40 m in three years .
The world 's first attempt to farm organic cod , " No Catch " fish was sold as a breakthrough in sustainable fisheries .
Its costly marketing campaign boasted it would " save the planet " and claimed celebrities such as Demi Moore had savoured its ethically - conscious produce .
" Not too high a price to pay for a clear conscience , " its adverts said .
But the administrators Grant Thornton , brought in earlier this year to rescue the Shetland - based business from total collapse , admitted that organic cod farming had been a financial disaster and had no realistic chance of succeeding .
It has sold the firm 's fish - farming business to two Norwegian - owned companies , who will instead begin producing organic salmon in Shetland 's coastal waters .
Its last supplies of cod – totalling about 3,400 tonnes - would now be sold off at knock - down prices , less than a tenth of its original cost in the shops .
The announcement confirmed mounting suspicions on Shetland – where accusations of bloated expense accounts and luxurious lifestyles at No Catch have been rife - that the much - hyped cod farming experiment was dead .
Dozens of jobs have already been lost .
At Scalloway fish market last week , No Catch cod was being sold whole as ordinary fish for less than the wild - caught Atlantic cod it was expected to replace .
Once on sale as premium cod fillets in Tesco in the UK and Carrefour in France for as much as £ 20 / kg ( £ 9/lb ) , it reached as little as £ 1.70 / kg in the fish market .
Daniel Smith , the administrator brought in by a bank that lost £ 15 m in No Catch , said the firm 's owners had had " very ambitious " plans but organic cod was just too expensive to produce .
Its feed was expensive , it was forced to produce fewer fish to meet organic welfare standards , and it had also refused to let supermarkets sell its cod as " own label " fish .
As a result , it was double the price of wild cod from the sea .
" The consumer is not yet prepared to pay such a large premium for wild cod , " he said .
" Cod production is still in its infancy , with a great deal still to be learnt about the life cycle of cod . "
Karol Rzepkowski , one of No Catch 's former directors , was unavailable for comment yesterday .
But last month he insisted to the Guardian that farming organic cod was viable .
" If we 'd been given the chance to complete what we set out to do , to harvest the fish we 'd put out to sea , that would 've been the case .
There 's massive demand for farmed cod , " he claimed .
Global citizens closely follow every nuance of US presidential campaigns - trying to divine what the future holds for US policy .
They may not vote in the election , but they are aware of the enormous influence the United States wields throughout the world .
The curiosity goes beyond foreign policy and security .
US policies on trade , immigration , the environment and even health care often carry implications for other nations , some expected and some unexpected .
That ’s why the campaign tops headlines in newspapers around the globe : “ Who Are the Superdelegates ? ” inquires the Independent in Great Britain .
“ Voters ’ New Focus on Foreign Policy Could Reshuffle US Presidential Race , ” suggests China ’s Xinhua .
“ We ’re on Fantasy Island in the US Election Campaign , ” commented the Daily Star in Lebanon .
The campaign for president reveals the mood of the electorate and sets a policy course .
Observers ponder whether the US electorate , polarized in so many ways , will pursue a path leading to reckless spending or frugality , diplomacy with a few nations or many , unilateralism or a policy of multilateral cooperation .
This YaleGlobal special section presents articles that analyze the global implications of the US elections .

Monday , August 4 , 2008 - Questions surround an incident Monday morning at El Paso 's Federal Courthouse .
A Deputy U.S. Marshal 's gun accidentally went off in a hallway on the 3rd floor of the courthouse just before 11:00 AM .
The bullet struck the Deputy U.s. Marshal as well as a U.S. Border Patrol agent .
A spokesperson for the U.S. Marshal 's service will only confirm the gun accidentally discharged , though we are not yet being told how or why .
Both the Deputy Marshal and the Border Patrol agent were taken from the building in stretchers .
They were each loaded into waiting ambulances and driven to the hospital .
Both suffered only minor injuries .
President George Bush was given such a splendid welcome by Pope Benedict XVI yesterday that rumours started flying that the President , like Tony Blair before him , was on the verge of converting to Catholicism .
It was a Vatican visit such as no other head of state has ever enjoyed .
Instead of greeting him , like all previous high - ranking visitors , in the papal library of the Apostolic Palace , the Pope took Mr Bush round the medieval St John 's Tower then gave him a tour of the Vatican gardens , culminating in a brief open - air concert by the Sistine Chapel Choir .
The Pope waited for the President at the entrance of the tower .
As he arrived , the President was overheard gushing " What an honour " as the two men disappeared for a half - hour tête - à - tête , details of which have not been made public .

The special reception was seen as a return of favours for the magnificent party thrown for the Pope two months ago when he turned 81 during his US tour , attended by up to 9,000 guests .
But yesterday the Vatican was seething at rumours that there was much more to it than protocol : George Bush , lifelong Methodist , was about to convert .
The notion was given extra mileage by the fact that the President 's brother Jeb , the former governor of Florida , converted to Catholicism on marrying his wife Columba , a Mexican .
The Vatican differs from the White House on immigration and the death penalty but on other issues including stem cell research , gay marriage and abortion there has been , as the Catholic daily L'Avvenire put it , " total harmony . "
Cardinal Pio Laghi , the papal envoy to the White House , said : " Bush believes in the values of the Church and his brother is a convert . "
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Two French students who were found stabbed to death in a burned - out London apartment were the victims of a " frenzied , brutal , horrific attack , " police said Thursday , as they appealed for information about the case .
Gabriel Ferez ( left ) and Laurent Bonomo were graduate biochemistry students at London 's Imperial College .
Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez , both 23 , were bound and stabbed multiple times in the head , neck , torso , and back , said Mick Duthie , a detective with London 's Metropolitan Police .
Britain's Press Association reported that the students had been tied up and tortured , suffering up to 250 injuries -- facts the police could not confirm .
" The extent of the injuries are horrific , " Duthie told a news conference .
" Everyone working on this case , including myself , have been deeply shocked by what we 've seen .
I have never seen injuries like this throughout my career . "
Firefighters found the students ' bodies Sunday night after responding to a fire at Bonomo 's rented room on a quiet cul - de-sac in south London , police said .
They initially believed the men died in the fire , but a post - mortem exam showed they died of the stab wounds .
Watch CNN report on murders »
The fire was the result of an explosion , Duthie said , and the smell of accelerant permeated the area .
Bonomo and Ferez were students at Universite Blaise - Pascale in Clermont Ferrand , France .
They had arrived in London in late May to do research at Imperial College and were planning to return to France at the end of July , Duthie said .
Both were graduate biochemistry students and had been studying DNA and the cleansing of protein within DNA , he said .
" Laurent and Gabriel had bright futures ahead of them and it is dreadful that their lives should end so soon , " the college 's rector , Roy Anderson , said in a statement .
Duthie said it was possible the men were the victims of mistaken identity , but he appealed to the public for any information .
" We cannot understand why these two young men were targeted , " Duthie said .
Police were trying to locate a man seen running from the building shortly after the explosion , Duthie said .
He said the students could have been killed by more than one person , but whoever stabbed them must have left the scene covered in blood .
" I would n't say this was a professional attack -- I would say it 's a frenzied , brutal , horrific attack , " Duthie said .
He said the room had been broken into six days before the fire , and police were investigating whether the incidents were connected .
Dammit .
I hate it when I ’m right .
Andy Schlafly of Conservapedia is planning on suing Lenski .
About a week ago , I predicted that Andy Schlafly may consider suing Lenski to get access to the data from his e. coli citrate experiment : despite Lenski ’s willingness to give his data to a certified biologist , since Schlafly ’s pride is now in issue , Andy wants a personal victory , and he ’ll do anything he can to get it .
Well , now Schlafly has issued the first “ Conservapedia challenge , ” urging his crack squad of stormtroopers homeschoolers to look for a way to sue Lenski into giving his data to someone who wo n’t understand it .
Personally , I do n’t think there ’s a way : Lenski ’s not a “ public agency ” within the meaning of FOIA ( 5 U.S.C. 522 ) .
But , for the sake of those of you that care , I ’ll do some research on my own time and report back .
Stay tuned .
In the meantime , look out world .
Andy Schlafly , armed with legal knowledge , a personal score to settle , and NO sense of honesty whatsoever , is a scary thing .
He has no honor and , as I ’ve said , regardless of whether he has a case , he wo n’t hesitate to use his limited grasp of law to bludgeon you .
He may be all bark and no bite , but a lawyer ’s bark has been known to cost money in and of itself .
Update : the debate rages .
It seems Schlafly ’s just bluffing … again .
I ’m SHOCKED !
If you ’re just coming to this post , please take a look at the comments : as one of the posters there points out , Schlafly ’s intense desire to stare down anyone that looks at him – evinced in this whole Lenski debacle , and his conduct at Conservapedia – can all probably be explained by his ardent desire to please mommy .
He is the last of three boys , a second - career lawyer who abandoned a good electrical engineering job … it all screams “ LOOK AT ME , MOM .
AREN ’T I GOOD ? ”

Pet Goat : President Bush listens to Andrew Card inform him of the 9 - 11 attacks .
It would be so nice if something made sense for a change .
-- Alice , from Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland
We 're hurtling down the rabbit hole .
Gravity 's refuted .
Black is white , and white turns bitter , transfigured by a mawkish Mad Hatter blithely chewing up our Constitution , juggling missile - shaped teacups , splashing sweet , light crude and cold blood everywhere .
To anyone who 's passed through the last eight years believing whatever George W. Bush and his minions have blown their way , well , best of luck to you , because most of it has n't been true .
Does that mean , then , that W. and his cronies were behind the 9 - 11 attacks ?
Of course not .
Some say , however , if it looks , waddles and quacks like a duck and lays duck eggs , then perhaps it 's time we re-examine it under oath , because it just might be a friggin ' duck .
( Fact : Nixon White House audiotapes reveal Tricky Dick literally quacking like a duck .
Nixon was a lot of things , but ducky was n't one of them . )
We 're all mad here .
-- the Cheshire Cat
Ken Jenkins , a Marin - based videographer , electrical engineer and activist with the 9 - 11 Truth group , tells of one who responded to certain provocative conjecture with " I would n't believe it -- even if it were true . "
It , of course , is the widely held and yet wildly contentious belief that elements within our own government bear responsibility for the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 ; and that the 596 pages of the official 9 - 11 Commission Report comprise lies , half - truths and intentional omissions .
Like the rift between those who detected a foul stench behind the Warren Commission 's report on JFK 's assassination and those who believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone , deeply held 9 - 11 beliefs place Americans at increasing loggerheads with one another .
Mainstream media and not a few on both sides of the political divide condemn , belittle and ridicule conspiracy theorists , who , in turn , have graced their own movement with the weighty word " Truth . "
And , just like backers of the official account , the " Truthers " boast vast legions of supporters from across the doctrinaire landscape .
Each side contains its sober thinkers , its celebrities , rational researchers , experts , well - meaning patriots , rabid supporters and total nutballs .
Bizarre and contradictory political alliances abound .
Reams of paper , books , reports , magazine articles ; ceilinged stacks of film and video documentaries ; and tens of thousands of blogs and websites -- one source contends there are more than 600,000 - - vie for our attention , proving this issue will not soon disappear .
In one corner there are the " official report " backers , including not only Bush & Co. sycophants , but an armada of Bush - bashers , including such well - regarded lefties as professor Noam Chomsky , journalist Greg Palast , satirist Bill Maher , columnist Alexander Cockburn and the comedy team Penn and Teller .
They think the 9 - 11 Truthers are cranks .
The other side of the ledger boasts its own raft of notables calling for a new independent investigation into the attacks .
These include former U.S. senators Lincoln Chafee and Mike Gravel , fellow politicos Ron Paul , Jesse Ventura and Dennis Kucinich , historian Howard Zinn , doc maker Michael Moore , actors Martin and Charlie Sheen , Ed Asner and Rosie O'Donnell , former U.N. Chief Weapons Inspector Scott Ritter and retired CIA chairman of the National Intelligence Estimates , Ray McGovern .
' No , no ! ' said the Queen .
' Sentence first -- verdict afterwards . '
Richard Gage is a Bay Area - based architect and the founding member of Architects and Engineers for 9 - 11 Truth .
He presently has over 400 fellow architects and engineers who 've signed on with him , demanding a new investigation .
Gage contends that the WTC Twin Towers came down as the result of controlled demolitions .
Citing the 10,000 - page National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) 2005 report on the tower collapses , Gage notes that the report stops before the collapses actually occur .
Why ?
" Because , " Gage charges , " if they had gone any further in their analysis they would have had to account for the massive quantity of evidence for the demolition of these two towers . "
Well , further they have gone .
The NIST last week released a new report centering solely on WTC Tower 7 , the focus of much speculation for its hours - later tumble , and now pronounced to be the first steel skyscraper to ever succumb to mere fire .
Even that bastion of the handy - guy , Popular Mechanics , has stepped into the fray , releasing a special report entitled " Debunking the 9 - 11 Myths . "
Popular Mechanics says , " Plane debris sliced through the utility shafts at the North Tower 's core , creating a conduit for burning jet fuel -- and fiery destruction throughout the building . "
Jet fuel burns at about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit , while steel does n't begin to melt until about 2,700 degrees .
Even if the steel lost structural strength at somewhat lower temps , and building materials and furnishings stoked the blaze , a 1,200 - degree meltdown differential does raise certain questions .

Lots of people think conspiracies never happen , that life at or near the top , where we 'd expect conspiracies to originate , is far too intricate and subtle for such shenanigans .
Nicholas Lemann , writing on conspiracies last year for the New Yorker , claims conspiracy theories amount to " a view of how the world works that mistakenly empowers particular , and evil , forces with the ability to determine the course of events , and it misses the messiness and contingency with which life actually unfolds . "
If we buy into Lemann 's argument , then how about the Gulf of Tonkin affair and the explosion on the Battleship Maine ?
What about Watergate and Iran - Contra , the Tuskegee Study or innumerable covert adventures in foreign coups , economic hits and political assassinations ?
And what about the 1999 trial when Dr. Marin Luther King Jr.'s family won a wrongful death civil suit against " unknown co-conspirators " ?
Six white and six black jurors found that " governmental agencies were parties " to Dr. King 's assassination plot .
Then there are lesser known but equally real conspiracies .
Some were actually foisted upon us or else were disrupted or energetically disappeared from official records .
Take , for example , the CIA 's nefarious mind - altering Cold War -era drug testing known as MK - ULTRA .
Its scientists and hirelings dosed thousands of unwitting U.S. citizens with mind - altering drugs over the course of two decades .
Operation Mockingbird was another long - running top - secret CIA operation , which co-opted prominent print and electronic media journalists to spy and propagandize the American public .
Mockingbird is largely the reason why it is illegal - - wink , wink , nudge , nudge - - to do so today .
Perhaps the most revealing and least known conspiracy in U.S. history was the stillborn 1933 " Business Plot , " intended to overthrow newly elected president Franklin Delano Roosevelt and put in place a fascist regime designed to be fronted by retired Marine Corps major general Smedley Butler .
Fortunately for us , the patriotic Butler spilled the beans .
He even remembered what the recruiters said .
" You know the American people will swallow that .
We have got the newspapers .
. . .
And the dumb American people will fall for it in a second , " Butler told the McCormack - Dickstein Committee , the first body convened by the House Committee on Un - American Activities , on Nov. 20 , 1934 .
FDR had been in office for but a few months .
The economy was wrecked , and those who wrecked it did n't like Roosevelt 's plans for something called the New Deal .
A group of businessmen , industrialists and bankers including J. P. Morgan , Irénée du Pont and an up - and - comer named Prescott Bush were fingered by Butler as plot intimates .
Afterward , sworn testimony and evidence placed before McCormack - Dickstein disappeared from the official record altogether .
" Like most committees , " Butler said after the report of the attempted coup was released , " it has slaughtered the little and allowed the big to escape .
The big shots were n't even called to testify .
They were all mentioned in my testimony .
Why was all mention of these names suppressed from the testimony ? "
What is the use of repeating all that stuff , if you do n't explain it as you go on ?
It 's by far the most confusing thing I ever heard !
-- the Mock Turtle
So could the official 9 - 11 Commission Report itself be defined as a conspiracy theory ?
Put another way , does this report stand up to rational and - or forensic scrutiny ?
" The Jersey Girls " think not .
Against the considerable will of the Bush administration , these four widows waged a 441 - day campaign to force the 9 - 11 Commission into existence .
By comparison , similar investigations into the space shuttle disaster , Pearl Harbor and the JFK assassination were launched within a few days of the events occurring .
And , say the Jersey Girls , few of their questions got answered by the commission 's report .
But what about plain , old - fashioned forensics ?
" It 's hard for the mind to reject rational forensic evidence which agrees with logic that 's science - based , " says architect Gage .
Later he adds , " I , along with many others , are treated as conspiracy theorists , basically , because people are n't ready to look at this stuff seriously .
But once you get the evidence in front of them , it 's a whole different thing . "
OK , then , why the resistance to a second investigation into what was surely the crime of the last half - century ?
Ken Jenkins thinks he understands why .
" People just do n't want to know it .
They do n't want to know how bad things are , and accepting that 9 - 11 was an inside job is just way too horrendous for a lot of people to seriously consider .
They do n't approach it rationally .
They approach it emotionally , that in terms of the implications of what you 're presenting is too scary . "
Well , maybe .
But then again , who 's to say the initial investigation 's case is n't actually airtight ?
One way to answer that is to follow the money .
Crimes of this magnitude require enormous sums of money in order to be both properly executed and investigated .
Another way of determining the extent to which 9 - 11 was investigated is to ask precisely who led the investigation ?
President Bill Clinton was impeached following an investigation in which he lied under oath about a sexual peccadillo .
That investigation , conducted by independent counsel Kenneth Starr , cost taxpayers a cool $ 39.2 million .
While it cost us nearly $ 40 million to hear Clinton parse the meaning of blowjob , a mere $ 3 million got earmarked for the 9 - 11 investigation .
And when it finally came time to actually investigate , who was chosen to lead the team ?
Philip D. Zelikow , a close personal friend of , former colleague of and book co-author with Condoleezza Rice .
Zelikow also happened to be a White House mole .
In fact , unbeknownst to other members of the committee , as executive director of the commission , Zelikow briefed the White House on a near daily basis .
Judging from this , one might conclude that the independent investigation into events surrounding 9 - 11 was about as independent as Fox News is fair and balanced .
And when the White House finally relented and allowed an investigation to take place , no independent counsel was deemed necessary in order to get to the bottom of the disaster .
Neither George W. Bush nor Dick Cheney would agree to have their testimony recorded , transcribed or even to have notes taken .
They refused to testify separately , in public , or under oath .
According to Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist Ron Suskind 's new book , The Way of the World , George W. Bush had direct and personal knowledge that Saddam had no WMD .
Bush lied about it , and then covered up his lie by having the CIA forge a document .
But Bush also lied about holding administration officials accountable for leaking the identity of Valerie Plame .
He has lied about Brownie and Katrina , about torture , wiretapping , habeas corpus , tax relief to the middle class and the health of our economy .
He 's lied about global warming , his military record , his cocaine use , about his relationships with slime buckets like Ken Lay and Jack Abramoff and about the scientific data 's he 's had altered or deleted from public documents .
Bush has been a virtual one - man lying industry , and yet clear thinkers among us would have us believe that , when it comes to this single overarching issue of 9 - 11 , he speaks nothing but the truth .
Alice , spinning through Wonderland , had certain insight into that particular notion : " If I had a world of my own , everything would be nonsense .
Nothing would be what it is , because everything would be what it is n't .
And contrary wise , what is , it would n't be .
And what it would n't be , it would .
You see ? "
Now It ’s The Post Covering Up John McCain ’s Mob Connections By Michael Collins Piper AN AFP EXCLUSIVE IF YOU STILL DOUBT that the big media is determined to keep under wraps the organized crime origins of the $ 200 million fortune of John McCain and his wife Cindy , take note of how the prestigious Washington Post touched on the issue in its July 22 edition .
Rather , instead , note how the Post covered up the matter .
The Post reported : Cindy Lou Hensley grew up as an only child , and a privileged one , in a large rancher in an upper - class section of Phoenix .
Her dad , Jim Hensley , founded what became a large Anheuser - Busch distributorship , and her mom , Marguerite , was a proper belle who emphasized impeccable manners .
The Post also added , almost discretely , that Mrs. McCain ’s wealth “ may ” exceed $ 100 million ( although most sources estimate it is worth $ 200 million or more ) and — for the record — that “ she was the apple of her father ’s eye . ”
The Post did not mention that Mrs. McCain ’s father was a highly - placed fixture in the Arizona branch of the national organized crime syndicate :
He was the chief henchman of the late Kemper Marley , Arizona point man for infamous mob chief Meyer Lansky and his powerful partners - in - crime , the super - rich Bronfman family of Montreal .
In that capacity — for 40 years until his death in 1990 — Marley was undisputed political boss of Arizona , acting as the behind - the - scenes power over both the Republican and Democratic parties .
As such , his wealth and connections played the primary role in advancing John McCain ’s political career from the start .
Although some Democrats have muttered that Mrs. McCain ’s business interests could impact on her husband ’s decision - making as president , none has dared cross the line and make reference to the fact this vast wealth was spawned by what others have indelicately ( although quite correctly ) called “ the Jewish Mafia . ”
Correspondents for American Free Press have repeatedly referenced the McCain fortune ’s ties to the Lansky - Bronfman syndicate going back to 2000 when McCain first ran for president .
Most recently , in its July 14/21 issue AFP reported the story again .
At that time , AFP pointed out that in its June 30 edition , Newsweek ( owned by the Washington Post ’s parent company ) also suppressed McCain ’s mob link .
Newsweek said Mrs. McCain ’s family “ was deeply rooted in Arizona , ” and that her father “ was one of the most prominent men in the state , ” who was “ a World War II bombardier . . . shot down over the English channel , ” — in other words , a war hero like McCain .
Newsweek did not mention ( or even hint of ) the racketeering , corruption and murder associated with Hensley and his patrons .
Newsweek said Hensley “ borrowed $ 10,000 to start a liquor business ” which became one of the largest Anheuser - Busch distributorships in the country and pointed out that the vast Hensley influence and fortune “ got [ McCain ] access to money and connections ” after he divorced his ailing first wife and married his then mistress , Cindy Hensley , and settled in Arizona where he first ran for office in 1982 .
But there was much more to the story .
Newsweek did not mention what AFP had reported and which is republished here in order to keep this important story before the American public :
To repeat : McCain ’s father - in - law was the top
During Prohibition , the Canadian - based Bronfmans supplied — and thus controlled — the “ spigot ” of liquor funneled to Lansky syndicate functionaries in the United States , including Al Capone in Chicago .
After Prohibition , Lansky - Bronfman associates such as Marley got control of a substantial portion of liquor ( and beer ) distribution across the country .
Marley ’s longtime public relations man , Al Lizanitz , revealed that it was the Bronfmans who set Marley up in the alcohol business .
In 1948 , 52 of Marley ’s employees ( including Jim Hensley , the manager of Marley ’s company ) were prosecuted for federal liquor violations .
Hensley got a six month suspended sentence and his brother Eugene went to prison for a year .
In 1953 Hensley and ( this time ) Marley were prosecuted by federal prosecutors for falsifying liquor records , but young attorney William Rehnquist acted as their “ mouthpiece ” ( as mob attorneys are known ) and the two got off scot - free .
Rehnquist later became chief justice of the Supreme Court and presided over the “ fix ” that made George W. Bush president in a rightly disputed election .
Arizona insiders say Hensley “ took the fall ” for Marley in 1948 and Marley paid back Hensley by setting him up in his own beer distribution business .
Newsweek implied Hensley ’s company was a “ mom and pop ” operation that became a big success , but the real story goes to the heart of the history of organized crime .
Hensley ’s sponsor , Marley , was also a major player in gambling , a protégé of Lansky associate Gus Greenbaum who , in 1941 , set up a national wire for bookmakers .
After Lansky ordered a hit on his own longtime partner , Benjamin “ Bugsy ” Siegel , who was stealing money from the Flamingo Casino in Las Vegas — which was financed in part by loans from an Arizona bank chaired by Marley — Greenbaum turned operations of the wire over to Marley while Greenbaum took Siegel ’s place in tending to Lansky ’s interests in Las Vegas .
In 1948 Greenbaum was murdered in a mob “ hit ” that set off a series of gang wars in Phoenix , but Marley survived and prospered as did Jim Hensley , who sponsored McCain ’s rise to power .
McCain ’s father - in - law also dabbled in dog racing and expanded his fortune by selling his track to an individual connected to the Buffalo - based Jacobs family , key Prohibition - era cogs in the Lansky network as distributors of Bronfman liquor .
Expanding over the years , buying up race tracks and developing food and drink concessions at sports stadiums , Jacobs enterprises were described as being “ probably the biggest quasi- legitimate cover for organized crime ’s money - laundering in the United States . ”
In 1976 , Hensley ’s mentor — Marley ( at the height of his power ) — was the key suspect behind the contract murder of journalist Don Bolles who was investigating the mob in Arizona , but Marley was never prosecuted .
Since McCain ’s career was sponsored by the Lansky - Bronfman syndicate , it is no coincidence McCain recently traveled to London where Lord Jacob Rothschild of the international banking empire raised money among American expatriates on McCain ’s behalf .
Rothschild has long been allied with the Bronfman family as major patrons of Israel .
A journalist specializing in media critique , Michael Collins Piper is the author of Final Judgment , the controversial “ underground bestseller ” documenting the collaboration of Israeli intelligence in the assassination of John F. Kennedy .
He is also the author of The High Priests of War , The New Jerusalem , Dirty Secrets , The Judas Goats : The Enemy Within and The Golem : Israel ’s Nuclear Hell Bomb .
All are available from AFP : 202-547-5585 .
He has lectured on these topics in places as diverse as Malaysia , Japan , Iran , Canada , Russia and the United Arab Emirates .
( Issue # 33 , August 18 , 2008 )
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Sen. John McCain could support a 16 - month timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq , he told CNN's Larry King Monday night .
Sen . John McCain appears Monday in Bakersfield , California , before talking to Larry King .
But the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said he would only do that if military chiefs deemed the " conditions on the ground " safe enough .
Speaking from Bakersfield , California , the Arizona senator said he would not stick to a " hard and firm date " suggested by Sen.
Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee .
" Now whether that fits into 16 months or not , or one month , or whatever , the point is it 's got to be conditions - based , " he added , saying that 's the point Gen.
David Petraeus , the U.S. commander in Iraq , " is trying to get over as we go into this political season . "
Asked whether he would support an invasion of Iraq again , McCain responded : " The fact that Saddam Hussein was bent on acquiring weapons of mass destruction .
... I think we did the right thing . "
" I think that it was a colossal intelligence failure on the part of the United States and every other county as to whether he had them or not , " he said .
McCain acknowledged that he initially predicted an " easy victory . "
" And then we employed the wrong strategy , which doomed us to failure and we were losing this war when I said we had to have this new strategy all along and stood up for it when most political pundits said that my career was finished . "
McCain vowed that if elected president , he would apprehend al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and " bring him to justice no matter what it takes . "
Obama made a similar promise on King 's show earlier this month , when he said he would pursue bin Laden into Pakistan if adequate intelligence suggested the terrorist leader was there .
McCain , however , would not elaborate on the subject of Pakistan .
" I 'm not going to go there ... because Pakistan is a sovereign nation .
I think the Pakistanis would want bin Laden out of their hair and out of their country , and it 's causing great difficulties in Pakistan itself . "
Obama has said that if he 's elected president in November , he will ask advice from military commanders on the Iraq war and the fighting in Afghanistan .
" But ultimately , the buck stops with me , " he told King .
Obama has said the United States should focus on Afghanistan while conducting a gradual troop withdrawal from Iraq by 2010 .
" What Sen .
Obama does n't understand is that they are all connected , " McCain said Monday of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" If we had lost the war in Iraq , we would have had much greater problems in Afghanistan .
Watch McCain share his thoughts on Iraq »
" And also , the strategy that he said would n't work in Iraq is the same strategy we have to employ in Afghanistan .
It 's not just to increase the number of troops ; it 's secure and hold ; it 's a government that functions more effectively ; it 's taking on the narco - traffickers ; it 's the issue of Pakistan , which is of course the border area -- it 's uncontrolled .
So it 's got to be an overall strategy .
" And Sen .
Obama does not understand that , just like he did n't understand the situation in Iraq . "
Speaking on domestic issues , McCain said despite his earlier position against off - shore drilling , he now supports the action as a way to offset soaring gas prices .
He also said that unlike President Bush , he would n't attend the opening ceremonies at the Olympic Games in Beijing : " I do n't think I would , particularly in light of the Tibetan situation .
I want good relations with China .
I recognize China is an emerging superpower .
" But frankly , I do n't question the president 's decision and it's a decision only a president can take . "
A number of world leaders , including German Chancellor Angela Merkel , Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , have said they will not attend the opening ceremonies in Beijing .
McCain also addressed questions about his health that have emerged because of a mole - like growth he had removed Monday from near his temple .
McCain has previously suffered from melanoma .
Campaign officials have said the senator 's doctor did n't think the growth was anything serious , and that it was removed as a precautionary measure and will be tested .
McCain visited his doctor for a three month check - up .
McCain told King on Monday night that the mole was a byproduct of too much sun exposure over the years .
" As you know , my dad was in the Navy , and we lived in places where I was at the beach a lot and ...
I 'm paying the price for that , " he said .
" Melanoma is something if you look at it , and you be careful , it 's fine . "

Ritan park is one of the three venues set aside for protesters , officials say China says it will allow demonstrations in three designated city parks during the Olympic Games in Beijing .
But anyone wanting to protest will have to apply for permission from the city 's government and police .
The announcement suggests China will have a more relaxed attitude towards protesters during the Olympics than it had in the past .
But Chinese citizens are already allowed to stage rallies .
In reality , there are few anti-government protests .
Liu Shaowu , director of the Beijing organising committee 's security department , said protests would be allowed in Shijie , Zizhuyuan and Ritan parks .
Organisers say that fans wo n't be able to take in any banners or leaflets which contain political , religious , racial , commercial , military , or other messages
The BBC's James Reynolds Reynolds ' China : Protesters ' parks
" They are all close to the city proper and the Olympic venues , " he told a press conference on the city 's security preparations .
But Mr
Wu was hazy about how potential protesters would apply for permission , and on whether spontaneous demonstrations would be allowed .
" As for the concrete application , and who handles those applications , I have no clear information at this time , " he said .
' Encouraged '
The issue of protests is a sensitive one for China , which this year has had to deal with unrest in Tibetan areas in western China .
Chinese law  as Mr
Wu made clear  lets ordinary people stage demonstrations , but few protests take place that are not sanctioned by the government .
To underline just how sensitive the issue is , the Chinese authorities seemed reluctant to publicise exactly where protests would be allowed .
A transcript of Wednesday 's press conference on the Beijing organising committee 's website expunged the parks ' names .
Earlier , Mr
Wu made it clear no activities involving ethnic , political or religious activities would be allowed inside Olympic venues .
Previously , Olympic cities have set aside areas for protests , and the International Olympic Committee wanted China to follow suit .
" Past organisers have found ways to manage any protests , and the Chinese authorities were encouraged to do the same , " said an IOC spokeswoman .
At the press conference , Mr Wu also dismissed suggestions that the Olympics would be a " kill - joy games " because of excessive security restrictions .
His assessment appears to be shared by the vast majority of Chinese people .
An investigation by the US - based Pew Research Centre found that 96 % of Chinese people think the Olympics will be a success .
Nearly as many believe the Olympic Games will improve China 's image across the globe .

What are these ?
Update : Unfortunately , this specific post has been targeted by the spambots , so I need to close the comments .
I urge you to make your comment on any other post on the blog — there are many about ID issues .
Disclosure : I believe the REAL ID
Act creates a fundamentally flawed national identification system and the Act should be repealed .
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindall has signed HB 715 , “ Directs the Department of Public Safety and Corrections not to implement the federal REAL ID Act of 2005 . ”
The new law also requires that the department “ report to the governor any attempt by agencies or agents of the United States Department of Homeland Security to secure the implementation of the REAL ID Act through the operations of that division and department . ”
Lousiana becomes the 21st state to pass anti-REAL ID legislation and the 11th state to prohibit implementation of or funds to be spent on the national identification program .
Louisiana will not face any immediate sanction from the Department of Homeland Security because the agency has given all 56 states and territories extensions on fulfilling the REAL ID requirements until the end of 2009 .
That is the deadline for states to “ materially comply ” with this national ID system or the federal Department of Homeland Security will stop accepting rebellious states ’
ID cards for federal purposes , which includes entering federal buildings ( such as Social Security offices or courthouses ) .
Last month , I discussed Arizona ’s opt - out legislation and problems with the REAL ID system .
A quantum computer is a computer design which uses the principles of quantum physics to increase the computational power beyond what is attainable by a traditional computer .
Quantum computers have been built on a small scale and work continues to upgrade them to more practical models .
How Computers Work
Computers function by storing data in a binary number format , which result in a series of 1s & 0s retained in electronic components such as transistors .
Each component of computer memory is called a bit and can be manipulated through the steps of Boolean logic so that the bits change , based upon the algorithms applied by the computer program , between the 1 and 0 modes ( sometimes referred to as " on " and " off " ) .
How a Quantum Computer Would Work
A quantum computer , on the other hand , would store information as either a 1 , 0 , or a quantum superposition of the two states .
Such a " quantum bit " allows for far greater flexibility than the binary system .
Specifically , a quantum computer would be able to perform calculations on a far greater order of magnitude than traditional computers ... a concept which has serious concerns and applications in the realm of cryptography & encryption .
Some fear that a successful & practical quantum computer would devastate the world 's financial system by ripping through their computer security encryptions , which are based on factoring large numbers that literally cannot be cracked by traditional computers within the lifespan of the universe .
A quantum computer , on the other hand , could factor the numbers in a reasonable period of time .
To understand how this speeds things up , consider this example .
If the qubit is in a superposition of the 1 state and the 0 state , and it performed a calculation with another qubit in the same superposition , then one calculation actually obtains 4 results : a 1/1 result , a 1/0 result , a 0/1 result , and a 0/0 result .
This is a result of the mathematics applied to a quantum system when in a state of decoherence , which lasts while it is in a superposition of states until it collapses down into one state .
The ability of a quantum computer to perform multiple computations simultaneously ( or in parallel , in computer terms ) is called quantum parallelism .
The exact physical mechanism at work within the quantum computer is somewhat theoretically complex and intuitively disturbing .
Generally , it is explained in terms of the multi- world interpretation of quantum physics , wherein the computer performs calculations not only in our universe but also in other universes simultaneously , while the various qubits are in a state of quantum decoherence .
While this sounds far - fetched , the multi- world interpretation has been shown to make predictions which match experimental results .
History of Quantum Computing
Quantum computing tends to trace its roots back to a 1959 speech by Richard P. Feynman in which he spoke about the effects of miniaturization , including the idea of exploiting quantum effects to create more powerful computers .
This speech is also generally considered the starting point of nanotechnology .
Of course , before the quantum effects of computing could be realized , scientists and engineers had to more fully develop the technology of traditional computers .
This is why , for many years , there was little direct progress , nor even interest , in the idea of making Feynman 's suggestions into reality .
In 1985 , the idea of " quantum logic gates " was put forth by the University of Oxford 's David Deutsch , as a means of harnessing the quantum realm inside a computer .
In fact , Deutsch 's paper on the subject showed that any physical process could be modeled by a quantum computer .
Nearly a decade later , in 1994 , AT&T's Peter Shor devised an algorithm that could use only 6 qubits to perform some basic factorizations ... more cubits the more complex the numbers requiring factorization became , of course .
A handful of quantum computers has been built .
The first , a 2 - qubit quantum computer in 1998 , could perform trivial calculations before losing decoherence after a few nanoseconds .
In 2000 , teams successfully built both a 4 - qubit and a 7 - qubit quantum computer .
Research on the subject is still very active , although some physicists and engineers express concerns over the difficulties involved in upscaling these experiments to full - scale computing systems .
Still , the success of these initial steps does show that the fundamental theory is sound .
Difficulties With Quantum Computers
The quantum computer 's main drawback is the same as its strength : quantum decoherence .
The qubit calculations are performed while the quantum wave function is in a state of superposition between states , which is what allows it to perform the calculations using both 1 & 0 states simultaneously .
However , when a measurement of any type is made to a quantum system , decoherence breaks down and the wave function collapses into a single state .
Therefore , the computer has to somehow continue making these calculations without having any measurements made until the proper time , when it can then drop out of the quantum state , have a measurement taken to read its result , which then gets passed on to the rest of the system .
The physical requirements of manipulating a system on this scale are considerable , touching on the realms of superconductors , nanotechnology , and quantum electronics , as well as others .
Each of these is itself a sophisticated field which is still being fully developed , so trying to merge them all together into a functional quantum computer is a task which I do n't particularly envy anyone ... except for the person who finally succeeds .
March 26 , 2008  -- GOP presidential hopeful John McCain on Wednesday cast America 's commitment to Iraq as a " moral responsibility " to avert a genocidal civil war that could ensue if U.S. troops are withdrawn too soon .
In a major address in California on foreign policy , the presumptive Republican nominee said , " It would be an unconscionable act of betrayal , a stain on our character as a great nation , if we were to walk away from the Iraqi people and consign them to the horrendous violence , ethnic cleansing and possibly genocide that would follow a reckless , irresponsible and premature withdrawal . "
McCain Sees Progress in Iraq
Speaking to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council , McCain , who has supported the war from the beginning , pointed to what he said were signs of progress : a decrease in violence and civilian and military deaths , Iraqis returning to work , markets open , and oil revenues increasing .
He also said there have signs of political reconciliation at the local level , but he acknowledges , " political progress at the national level has been far too slow .
… but there is progress . "
McCain spent two days in Iraq on a congressional visit one - and - a - half weeks ago .
He has previously said that to be elected president , he will need to convince American voters that whatever they think of the wisdom of having gone to war , the U.S. has a vital interest in keeping troops there long enough to quash the threat posed by Al Qaeda .
The Challenge in November
In his speech , he said he believes it is still possible for Iraq to become a stable democracy and it is in the geo-political interests of the United States to see that Iraq and Afghanistan attain that goal .
" Those who claim we should withdraw from Iraq in order to fight Al Qaeda more effectively elsewhere are making a dangerous mistake , " he warned .
" Whether they were there before is immaterial .
Al Qaeda is in Iraq now .
If we withdraw prematurely , al Qaeda will survive [ and ] proclaim victory … Civil war in Iraq could easily descend into genocide , and destabilize the entire region as neighboring powers come to the aid of their favored factions .
I believe a reckless and premature withdrawal would be a terrible defeat for our security interests and our values . "
In his sole attack directed explicitly at Democratic presidential contenders Senators Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , and Barack Obama , D - Ill. , McCain said , " [ The ] consequences of our defeat would threat us for years and those who argue for [ withdrawal ] , as both Democratic candidates do , are arguing for a course that would eventually draw us into a wider and more difficult war that would entail far greater dangers and sacrifices than we have suffered to date . "
McCain reiterated a prominent campaign theme of his : that radical Islam and terrorism are the transcendent threat of our time .
" Any president who does not regard this threat as transcending all others does not deserve to sit in the White House , for he or she does not take seriously enough the first and most basic duty a president has — to protect the lives of the American people , " he said , in an oblique reference to the two Democrats vying for their party 's presidential nomination .
Responding , Obama campaign spokesperson Bill Burton said in a written statement , " John McCain is determined to carry out four more years of George Bush 's failed policies , including an open - ended war in Iraq that has cost us thousands of lives and billions of dollars while making us less safe .
Barack Obama will change our foreign policy and renew America 's leadership by responsibly ending the war in Iraq , finishing the fight in Afghanistan , and focusing on the 21st century challenges that conventional Washington has ignored for too long -- al Qaeda 's core leadership and nuclear proliferation , poverty and genocide , climate change and disease . "
Greater Cooperation , Revamped Foreign Policy
McCain went on to propose greater strategic co-operation with America 's European allies and other democracies .
In a seeming rebuke to the Bush Administration , he said , " Our great power does not mean we can do whatever we want whenever we want , nor should we assume we have all the wisdom and knowledge necessary to succeed .
We need to listen tot he views and respect the collective will of our democratic allies .
When we believe international action is necessary , whether military , economic or diplomatic , we will try to persuade out friends that we are right .
But we , in return , must be willing to be persuaded by them . "
McCain called on the United States and international community to work to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons .
And the Republican contender demanded greater action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change , proposed ousting Russia from the G - 8 group of economic partners because it is insufficiently democratic , and he said as president he would establish the goal of eradicating malaria in Africa .
He also made an apparent effort to allay concerns that he is insensitive to the horrors of war , noting that his father and grandfather , both Navy admirals , served in the Pacific in World War II .
His grandfather returned exhausted from war and died the next day of a heart attack .
He said he lost friends in the Vietnam War , during which he himself was held prisoner by North Vietnamese for more than five years .
" I detest war , " McCain said .
" When nations seek to resolve their differences by force of arms , a million tragedies ensue .
Only a fool or a fraud sentimentalize the merciless reality of war . "
McCain made no mention of the number of U.S. troop deaths in Iraq , which surpassed 4,000 earlier this week .
Iraqi government poised to yank immunity from Blackwater RAW STORY

This A withdrawal plan currently being worked out between American and Iraqi negotiators includes the acknowledgment that military security contractors such as Blackwater , whose employees have been accused of recklessness and mass murder during the occupation , would be newly subject to Iraqi law , the Washington Post reported Sunday .
Negotiators are in agreement on most of the plan , which will have to meet the approval not only of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , but also officials within his Council of Ministers and , finally , the Iraqi parliament .
It could be weeks , if not longer , before the agreement sees those votes , said one official .
" They are obviously going to be extremely attentive not just to the substance but also to the presentation , " added another .
Excerpts from the article follow : # The Bush administration has opposed such a timetable but has bowed to Iraqi demands for target dates .
Officials on both sides said dates will be couched in language that allows the withdrawal to speed up or slow down , depending on conditions on the ground .
The U.N. mandate authorizing the U.S. troop presence in Iraq expires at the end of this year .
Negotiations on the bilateral arrangements to replace it began in March , with a completion target of July 31 that would have given the two governments time to gain political and popular approval and arrange logistics for the transition .
Negotiators initially began with two separate agreements .
The first , called a strategic framework , outlines long - term political , economic , cultural and security arrangements between the two countries .
A second accord , a status - of - forces agreement , was to cover more specific rights and responsibilities of the U.S. military in Iraq .
When negotiations over the status - of - forces agreement stalled in June , negotiators decided to attach it to the larger framework as an implementing memorandum on security arrangements .

Ubuntu - based things do well in tech circles , but the consumer space is different , as gOS discovered when Wal - Mart blamed poor demand from baseball caps and mullets for its decision to stop selling Linux - loaded PCs .
David Liu , chief executive of Emeryville , California - based gOS , is undaunted .
Indeed he is optimistic that Linux can succeed in the consumer market , on " next generation " appliances and the increasingly popular netbooks that offer the " best experiences " .
To that end , gOS has launched version 3.0 of its consumer - focused Linux operating system , which packs in Google Gadgets .
But Liu also sees a threat on the horizon .
Why ?
OEMs are only flirting with Linux in the consumer space , and that leaves the path clear for Microsoft on netbooks and appliances to duplicate its PC - based Windows empire .
" Linux companies like ourselves need to work closely with people making the next wave of appliance or netbooks ... we need to seize it before other people fill the gap , " Liu told a LinuxWorld panel on life , now that OEMs are shipping Linux PCs .
" The business model of Microsoft will adjust down [ to netbooks and appliances ] , " he told The Register afterwards .
" We can do it , but it 's a really small window of time .
The PC world is moving on . "
Liu agreed that it is hard trying to catch consumers ' interest in a channel geared towards Windows .
" We have been trying to resize and use open source to appeal to consumers , but to be honest it 's tough , " he said .
OEMs have been shipping more Linux on selected PC models , but have yet to make Linux generally available as a pre-installed and supported option .
They still rely on Windows and look certain to continue doing so as companies like Hewlett - Packard , Dell and Lenovo respond to the run-away Asus ' EEE with their own netbook - style devices .
Demand for Linux does exist with Linux - powered PCs going into specialized markets like education .
HP 's recently launched mini notebook - also for education and available with SuSE Linux , Windows XP or Windows Vista - has been enjoying adoption outside of its intended market .
HP technology strategist Jim Mann told LinuxWorld there hadd been : " A lot of interest and purchase from business executives " .
Mann was one of the few OEMs on the panel to venture an opinion on the subjects of Linux versus Windows and the netbook craze .
The reason that OEMs are not offering Linux more broadly is simple - and timeless : usability and the lack thereof .
Google Gadgets gone wild : the latest gOS
" From a general operating system perspective - there 's still a lot of packages to download .
That 's not something you are going to see my mom use , " Mann said bluntly .
" Until it gets to the point where it 's drop - dead simple or devices lock down functionality , you are n't going to see much uptake among consumers . "
Liu reckons that Linux has improved .
The problem is that OEMs are n't working to fit Linux - based netbooks or appliances into their portfolio in a way that consumers can understand and at the same time does n't compromise existing revenue streams .
" The window [ of opportunity ] is how do we tell consumers and get support of partners on the hardware side ?
To [ get partners to ] work on packages of software and hardware to make it clear where this fits into the ecosystem of products , " Liu said .
" If you have a device running on Linux , how can it fit naturally and gracefully , so it's here to advance profit rather than kill the existing business ? " ®
As a borderline synaesthete with a debilitating sensitivity to vowels , I ’ll admit I was knocked a bit off balance when Apple confirmed rumors and announced MobileMe as the next iteration and rebranding of its .mac suite of online services .
But because this is Apple , I ca n’t just join the negative nancies in the hoo - ha parade that has subsequently stormed the comment threads ( to which I wo n’t link because these people are scum and should be ignored ) .
Instead , because this is Apple , I ’ll invoke the words of the inimitable Fake Marshall McLuhan in his Twitter a few days back :
Stop asking ‘ Is this a good or bad thing ? ’ and start asking ' What ’s going on ? ’
And because this is Apple , I ’ll do the work of a true apologist and extrapolate the aphorism a step further :
Stop asking ' Is this a good or bad thing ? ’ and start asking ' Why is this awesome ? ’
Me. Everything used to be ’i ’ , remember ?
After the 1998 intro of iMac , that adorably anthropomorphic little revolution in personal computing , the brand of ' i ’ took such a strong hold in digital culture it has since been reappropriated both inside Apple ( iPod , iTunes , iTools , iDisk , iPhoto , iMovie , iWork , etc. ) and endlessly imitated outside Apple [ examples redacted under legal advisement ] .
Whereas prior to the era of ' i ’ , the go - to digital prefix had been ' e ’ ( as in eMail ) , which I suppose stood quaintly for ' electronic ’ [ ugh ] , the 'i ’ brand fell into that magical space where it took on the dual meanings of ' Internet ’ ( or the ever - buzzy ' interactive ’ ) , as well as the very personal , non-technical and empowering first - person pronoun ' I ’ .
As such , the cultural significance of ' i ’ can not be understated .
You might even say it defined the digital culture in its apex , when the bubble seemed only ever to expand with IPOs and flying cars and robot sex .
However , it was n’t simply ' i ’ , the subject case of the first - person pronoun that made its way into the branding lexicon , it was the first - person pronoun in general that imposed itself on such brand names and products as MySpace , Windows Me ( the Millennium Edition of Microsoft Windows ) , the Western Digital My Book hard drive , the paradigm - shifting Nintendo Wii game console , and the grammatically - questionable productivity tool Minesweeper .
As imitations , none of these applications of first - person branding made all that much of a mark and really served only as foils to the ' i ’ of the Apple product line .
' i ’ has historically been so successful for Apple that the thought of ever abandoning it would appear misguided .
But it seems that the day of ' i ’ may have come and gone .
Even last year ’s release of iPhone ( following a battle with Cisco over rights to the trademark ) showed that the ' i ’ was perhaps beginning to feel a little stale , its usage conceivably due more than anything to legacy and brand recognition in a risky and brand - unfamiliar market .
With the MobileMe unveiling ( and that of its complementary domain me.com ) , it ’s looking like a shift is afoot for Apple — a shift that may be every bit as significant as the shift from PowerPC to the Intel processor , but a shift in ideology whose signs may be found in the simple grammatical switch from subject ( I ) to object ( me ) .
I offer evidence only in my strictly unacademic impressions of the differences between ' I ’ and ' me ’ .
For instance , ' I ’ implies activity , a doing and a being of something .
Ideologically , this meshes well with Apple ’s provenance as the tool of the artist and its aim to imbue the user with the identity of Unique Creator of Digitial Artifact , of curator and distributor and master of his or her digital hub .
In this model , I am the center of my digital lifestyle , from which springs endless evidence of my unique and lovable existence and expendable income .
By contrast , ' me ’ implies passivity , an identity of self - evident existence without the burden of activity .
In the ' me ’ model , I exist by the token of my relation to my Contacts and Calendar .
In the ' I ’ model , I exist by the token of my photos , which I sync from my camera in iPhoto and upload to my iDisk .
On a practical level , MobileMe is a subscription service which allows my data to exist simultaneously in all places .
In its marketing materials as well as its MobileMe logo , Apple is employing the “ cloud ” as metaphor for the omnipresence of my digital identity .
That they equate the cloud with the term “ mobile ” I have yet to rationalize , as “ mobile ” has always been applied more to the mobility of the devices we use than the omnipresence of the data across those devices .
But such a redefinition is standard fare for Apple , who is in the business of redirecting commonly - understood concepts among consumers , and redefining markets in the process .
So I ’ll suspend my judgement on that one .
Signs do , however , point clearly to Apple steering away from consumer as creator of data and toward consumer as data itself .
I no longer create the data I sync , the data is me and it syncs on its own .
“ Exchange for the rest of us ” is a common refrain of the MobileMe pitch .
The reference , of course , is to Microsoft Exchange , a product marketed toward consumers for whom identity through creation of data is not a high priority .
Connectivity is the Holy Grail of the Exchange market , and connectivity is what MobileMe puports to offer this untapped segment of the mobile market .
To this end , unkind comparisons to Microsoft have been made of MobileMe ’s branding , but also to this end , they are not completely unfounded .
Could it be that in attempting to reach the coveted “ enterprise ” segment of the market , Apple has intentionally taken on characteristics of Microsoft ’s branding ?
Of course , to Apple users , this is a hateful suggestion .
Common among Apple users is an elitism which we will not only admit to , but wear as a badge of honor .
Common brand perception of Microsoft applies the terms ' corporate ’ , ' boring ’ and ' status quo ’ .
Microsoft holds a much more populist position in the tech market , as evidenced by the market share of its operating system .
My assertion is that in forgoing the ' i ’ and evoking the 'me ’ , Apple is making a conscious effort to finally appeal less to the elite segment of the market and more to the vast numbers of Microsoft users .
Let ’s look back at the lineage of MobileMe .
In 2000 , it appeared as a free suite of web - based services collectively known as iTools .
In 2002 it changed to a subscription - based model and was renamed ( dropping the first - person pronoun and the ambiguous utility motif ) to “ .mac ” , which , with its domain - like brand name was meant to conjure the extension of the Mac desktop experience to the Internet environment .
This phase of the evolution can now be clearly seen as remedial , its purpose to indoctrinate users to the idea of migrating their data offsite .
But due to lack of infrastructure , its execution has been largely unsuccessful .
Now , six years and many perplexed customers later , and with the crucial element of mobility finally in place with the iPhone , MobileMe is shaping up to be an idea whose time has come .
And within its story can be found the perfect illustration of Apple ’s plan : first Apple got us on the Internet .
Once we were there , it gave us “ tools ” to play with .
This included a place to put our email , a way to make a “ HomePage ” and a little bit of storage .
Then it got us to start paying for these tools , and it got us used to the idea of using a few of the Applications we use on the Mac ( i.e. , Mail , Address Book , Calendar ) , but through the browser instead of the desktop .
Now , in its third and most important phase , Apple has literally removed the “ Mac ” from its online counterpart in an effort to make the Apple user experience a platform - agnostic one .
Take a look at the MobileMe Guided Tour video on Apple ’s site .
You may notice that every bit of the demo of MobileMe ’s browser - based application is shown from the Safari browser on the Windows Vista platform .
The video shows you navigation through a hierarchical file structure in the new iDisk with fluid graphics and beautiful buttons that look unlike the Aqua buttons of the Mac OS and it takes a moment to realize that the demo you ’re watching is not being done on a Mac .
Think about this for a second .
Apple is removing the Mac from the Apple computer experience and laying the foundation for a browser - based OS , the thing that Google has been threatening all this time .
Of course , it ’s not a new idea ; for a while , everyone has assumed that this is where the trend is taking us .
But it ’s never been clearer how we ’re getting there .
In branding , floaty , ambiguous concepts that appeal to the ego like ' I ’ and ' me ’ are typically put into play haphazardly by marketeers trying to sell you stuff .
But in the case of a company as ideologically solid as Apple , the concepts used in marketing the products we wait for and lust after can often be the clearest signs of what is to come .

Truthout.org — Congressman Dennis Kucinich introduced a new article of impeachment against President Bush in the House last Thursday .
In a single , pointed resolution , he charged the president with lying to Congress about the presence of weapons of mass destruction ( WMDs ) in Iraq , in order to obtain permission for a US attack .
In the hour before Kucinich brought his resolution to the floor , he sat down with Truthout for an interview .
We discussed the politics of justice , the quest for peace and the rationale for holding the administration accountable for its decisions on Iraq .
" The case for war was based on fraud , " he said .
" That 's the core charge in this impeachment resolution .
And it just takes one article to be able to force the administration and the president to the consequences of their deceit . "
No one said impeachment would be an easy fight .
House leadership has repeatedly stated its distaste for the idea , and even some progressive Congress members have shied away from taking such a forceful stand against the president , late in his last term .
But Kucinich is n't big on easy fights :
He is fond of quoting Spanish philosopher Miguel De Unamuno , who said , " Only he who attempts the absurd is capable of achieving the impossible . "
Kucinich may be making some headway on the " impossible , " this time around .
The morning of our interview , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who had previously dismissed impeachment as " off the table , " told reporters that Kucinich 's resolution may well reach the Judiciary Committee for a hearing .
Even if impeachment is ultimately achieved , it 's doubtful that the congressman will sit tight for long .
Kucinich 's pesky habit of dreaming big extends beyond impeachment .
In our interview , he elaborated on one of his most broad - ranging dreams : the establishment of a federal Department of Peace , the scope of which would range from developing diplomatic solutions to tough international conflicts , to preventing domestic violence , to providing support for peer mediation in schools .
Envisioning a shift from fear and defensiveness to peaceful cooperation , Kucinich points to the US 's historical ideals of liberty and democracy - as delineated by the Constitution - as models for moving into the future .
" 9/11 , as a metaphor , has plunged this country into a very fear - based approach to policy , " he said .
" But that 's not really who we are ...
The Department of Peace is aimed at reestablishing peace as a central theme in our society . "
The congressman emphasizes that he is not deterred by the rampant , unceasing violence currently wracking our country and our world .
Rather , he quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson , saying , " Every jet of chaos which threatens to exterminate us is convertible by intellect into a wholesome force . "

Who does n’t like a makeover ?
Finding the perfect piece of furniture at a yard sale or thrift store can help you make over your house and furnishings , saving money and reducing waste at the same time .
Often all that ’s needed to renew something is a good cleaning and a new coat of paint , the only cost being your time .
But wait a minute , you say , paint is expensive .
It does n’t have to be .
Gallons and gallons of latex and oil - based paints never get used , probably because we ’ve been told to always get extra so we wo n’t run out in the middle and have to worry about matching the color ( custom colors mostly ) .
Many small jobs use less than a small can ’s worth of paint , and yet we can only buy a full can , not just a tiny bit .
The next time you need paint or thinner , wood stain or oil finish , do n’t buy new .
Find out if your city or county has a Drop and Swap program , which reduces waste locally , as well as helping to keep it out of drains and sinks ( and rivers ) .
Do n’t look at me like that .
I ’m sure you know people who pour things down the drain “ just to get rid of it ” .
Drop and Swap programs generally accept partially - used and new containers of paint , thinner , stain , cleaners , automotive chemicals , and other household products and then store them for exchange days or dispose of them properly .
You can donate that collection of random paint from your mother ’s garage , or your basement , and you can go shopping in the storeroom for what you need .
In order to participate , all that is required is your signature , agreeing to use the products as directed and to dispose of them properly or bring them back when you ’re done .
I walked out of there one day with enough wood finish and stain to last me for the next year , and if I did n’t like something , I brought it back with me on my next trip .
I also recently found 2 quarts of linseed oil that sell for big bucks over at the hardware store , and some cans of spray paint primer to paint a bike frame with .
Score !
Our local Drop and Swap is at the county landfill , next to the recycling center and hazardous materials center .
If you ’re headed there anyway , ask about their programs for disposal and reuse of household chemicals .
You may find a source of materials for your next project , or you may find materials that just need a good project .
When my wife and ( then ) baby daughter went to see family for a week , I found some pints of really cool paint at the Drop and Swap .
One lonely night I decided to re-finish a stepstool as a surprise for them , inspired by the colors of paint I found .
I re-glued and re-nailed the top , sanded it and gave it three coats of paint , and we still use it every single day , ten years later .
I think it ’s our first heirloom .

How to Write Doc Comments for the Javadoc Tool
Javadoc Home Page
This document describes the style guide , tag and image conventions we use in documentation comments for Java programs written at Java Software , Oracle .
It does not rehash related material covered elsewhere :
For reference material on Javadoc tags , see the Javadoc reference pages .
For the required semantic content of documentation comments , see Requirements for Writing Java API Specifications .
Contents
Introduction
Principles
At Java Software , we have several guidelines that might make our documentation comments different than those of third party developers .
Our documentation comments define the official Java Platform API Specification .
To this end , our target audience is those who write Java compatibility tests , or conform or re-implement the Java platform , in addition to developers .
We spend time and effort focused on specifying boundary conditions , argument ranges and corner cases rather than defining common programming terms , writing conceptual overviews , and including examples for developers .
Thus , there are commonly two different ways to write doc comments -- as API specifications , or as programming guide documentation .
These two targets are described in the following sections .
A staff with generous resources can afford to blend both into the same documentation ( properly " chunked " ) ; however , our priorities dictate that we give prime focus to writing API specifications in doc comments .
This is why developers often need to turn to other documents , such as Java SE Technical Documentation and The Java Tutorials for programming guides .
Writing API Specifications
Ideally , the Java API Specification comprises all assertions required to do a clean - room implementation of the Java Platform for " write once , run anywhere " -- such that any Java applet or application will run the same on any implementation .
This may include assertions in the doc comments plus those in any architectural and functional specifications ( usually written in FrameMaker ) or in any other document .
This definition is a lofty goal and there is some practical limitation to how fully we can specify the API .
The following are guiding principles we try to follow :
The Java Platform API Specification is defined by the documentation comments in the source code and any documents marked as specifications reachable from those comments .
Notice that the specification does not need to be entirely contained in doc comments .
In particular , specifications that are lengthy are sometimes best formatted in a separate file and linked to from a doc comment .
The Java Platform API Specification is a contract between callers and implementations .
The Specification describes all aspects of the behavior of each method on which a caller can rely .
It does not describe implementation details , such as whether the method is native or synchronized .
The specification should describe ( textually ) the thread - safety guarantees provided by a given object .
In the absence of explicit indication to the contrary , all objects are assumed to be " thread - safe " ( i.e. , it is permissible for multiple threads to access them concurrently ) .
It is recognized that current specifications do n't always live up to this ideal .
Unless otherwise noted , the Java API Specification assertions need to be implementation - independent .
Exceptions must be set apart and prominently marked as such .
We have guidelines for how to prominently document implementation differences .
The Java API Specification should contain assertions sufficient to enable Software Quality Assurance to write complete Java Compatibility Kit ( JCK ) tests .
This means that the doc comments must satisfy the needs of the conformance testing by SQA .
The comments should not document bugs or how an implementation that is currently out of spec happens to work .
Writing Programming Guide Documentation
What separates API specifications from a programming guide are examples , definitions of common programming terms , certain conceptual overviews ( such as metaphors ) , and descriptions of implementation bugs and workarounds .
There is no dispute that these contribute to a developer 's understanding and help a developer write reliable applications more quickly .
However , because these do not contain API " assertions " , they are not necessary in an API specification .
You can include any or all of this information in documentation comments ( and can include custom tags , handled by a custom doclet , to facilitate it ) .
At Java Software , we consciously do not include this level of documentation in doc comments , and instead include either links to this information ( links to the Java Tutorial and list of changes ) or include this information in the same documentation download bundle as the API spec -- the JDK documentation bundle includes the API specs as well as demos , examples , and programming guides .
It 's useful to go into further detail about how to document bugs and workarounds .
There is sometimes a discrepancy between how code should work and how it actually works .
This can take two different forms : API spec bugs and code bugs .
It 's useful to decide up front whether you want to document these in the doc comments .
At Java Software we have decided to document both of these outside of doc comments , though we do make exceptions .
API spec bugs are bugs that are present in the method declaration or in the doc comment that affects the syntax or semantics .
An example of such a spec bug is a method that is specified to throw a NullPointerException when null is passed in , but null is actually a useful parameter that should be accepted ( and was even implemented that way ) .
If a decision is made to correct the API specification , it would be useful to state that either in the API specification itself , or in a list of changes to the spec , or both .
Documenting an API difference like this in a doc comment , along with its workaround , alerts a developer to the change where they are most likely to see it .
Note that an API specification with this correction would still maintain its implementation - independence .
Code bugs are bugs in the implementation rather than in the API specification .
Code bugs and their workarounds are often likewise distributed separately in a bug report .
However , if the Javadoc tool is being used to generate documentation for a particular implementation , it would be quite useful to include this information in the doc comments , suitably separated as a note or by a custom tag ( say @bug ) .
Who Owns and Edits the Doc Comments
The doc comments for the Java platform API specification is owned programmers .
However , they are edited by both programmers and writers .
It is a basic premise that writers and programmers honor each other 's capabilities and both contribute to the best doc comments possible .
Often it is a matter of negotiation to determine who writes which parts of the documentation , based on knowledge , time , resources , interest , API complexity , and on the state of the implementation itself .
But the final comments must be approved by the responsible engineer .
Ideally , the person designing the API would write the API specification in skeleton source files , with only declarations and doc comments , filling in the implementation only to satisfy the written API contract .
The purpose of an API writer is to relieve the designer from some of this work .
In this case , the API designer would write the initial doc comments using sparse language , and then the writer would review the comments , refine the content , and add tags .
If the doc comments are an API specification for re-implementors , and not simply a guide for developers , they should be written either by the programmer who designed and implemented the API , or by a API writer who is or has become a subject matter expert .
If the implementation is written to spec but the doc comments are unfinished , a writer can complete the doc comments by inspecting the source code or writing programs that test the API .
A writer might inspect or test for exceptions thrown , parameter boundary conditions , and for acceptance of null arguments .
However , a much more difficult situation arises if the implementation is not written to spec .
Then a writer can proceed to write an API specification only if they either know the intent of the designer ( either through design meetings or through a separately - written design specification ) or have ready access to the designer with their questions .
Thus , it may be more difficult for a writer to write the documentation for interfaces and abstract classes that have no implementors .
With that in mind , these guidelines are intended to describe the finished documentation comments .
They are intended as suggestions rather than requirements to be slavishly followed if they seem overly burdensome , or if creative alternatives can be found .
When a complex system such as Java ( which contains about 60 packages ) is being developed , often a group of engineers contributing to a particular set of packages , such as javax .
swing may develop guidelines that are different from other groups .
This may be due to the differing requirements of those packages , or because of resource constraints .
Terminology
API documentation ( API docs ) or API specifications ( API specs )
On - line or hardcopy descriptions of the API , intended primarily for programmers writing in Java .
These can be generated using the Javadoc tool or created some other way .
An API specification is a particular kind of API document , as described above .
An example of an API specification is the on-line Java Platform , Standard Edition 7 API Specification .
Documentation comments ( doc comments )
The special comments in the Java source code that are delimited by the /** ... */ delimiters .
These comments are processed by the Javadoc tool to generate the API docs .
javadoc
The JDK tool that generates API documentation from documentation comments .
Source Files
The Javadoc tool can generate output originating from four different types of " source " files :
Source code files for Java classes ( . java ) - these contain class , interface , field , constructor and method comments .
Package comment files - these contain package comments
Overview comment files - these contain comments about the set of packages
Miscellaneous unprocessed files - these include images , sample source code , class files , applets , HTML files , and whatever else you might want to reference from the previous files .
For more details , see : Source Files .
Writing Doc Comments
Format of a Doc Comment
A doc comment is written in HTML and must precede a class , field , constructor or method declaration .
It is made up of two parts -- a description followed by block tags .
In this example , the block tags are @param , @return , and @see .
/** * Returns an Image object that can then be painted on the screen .
*
The url argument must specify an absolute {@link URL} .
The name * argument is a specifier that is relative to the url argument .
* < p > *
This method always returns immediately , whether or not the * image exists .
When this applet attempts to draw the image on * the screen , the data will be loaded .
The graphics primitives * that draw the image will incrementally paint on the screen .
* * @param url an absolute URL giving the base location of the image * @param name the location of the image , relative to the url argument * @return the image at the specified URL * @see Image */ public Image getImage ( URL url , String name ) { try { return getImage ( new URL ( url , name ) ) ; } catch ( MalformedURLException e ) { return null ; } }
Notes :
The resulting HTML from running Javadoc is shown below
Each line above is indented to align with the code below the comment .
The first line contains the begin - comment delimiter ( /** ) .
) .
Starting with Javadoc 1.4 , the leading asterisks are optional .
Write the first sentence as a short summary of the method , as Javadoc automatically places it in the method summary table ( and index ) .
Notice the inline tag {@link URL} , which converts to an HTML hyperlink pointing to the documentation for the URL class .
This inline tag can be used anywhere that a comment can be written , such as in the text following block tags .
, which converts to an HTML hyperlink pointing to the documentation for the URL class .
This inline tag can be used anywhere that a comment can be written , such as in the text following block tags .
If you have more than one paragraph in the doc comment , separate the paragraphs with a < p > paragraph tag , as shown .
paragraph tag , as shown .
Insert a blank comment line between the description and the list of tags , as shown .
The first line that begins with an " @ " character ends the description .
There is only one description block per doc comment ; you cannot continue the description following block tags .
The last line contains the end - comment delimiter ( */ )
Note that unlike the begin - comment delimiter , the end - comment contains only a single asterisk .
For more examples , see Simple Examples .
So lines wo n't wrap , limit any doc-comment lines to 80 characters .
Here is what the previous example would look like after running the Javadoc tool :
getImage
public Image getImage ( URL url , String name )
Returns an Image object that can then be painted on the screen .
The url argument must specify an absolute URL .
The name argument is a specifier that is relative to the url argument .
This method always returns immediately , whether or not the image exists .
When this applet attempts to draw the image on the screen , the data will be loaded .
The graphics primitives that draw the image will incrementally paint on the screen .
Parameters :
url - an absolute URL giving the base location of the image .
name - the location of the image , relative to the url argument .
Returns :
the image at the specified URL .

Doc Comment Checking Tool
At Oracle , we have developed a tool for checking doc comments , called the Oracle Doc Check Doclet , or DocCheck .
You run it on source code and it generates a report describing what style and tag errors the comments have , and recommends changes .
We have tried to make its rules conform to the rules in this document .
DocCheck is a Javadoc doclet , or " plug - in " , and so requires that the Javadoc tool be installed ( as part of the Java 2 Standard Edition SDK ) .
Descriptions
First Sentence
The first sentence of each doc comment should be a summary sentence , containing a concise but complete description of the API item .
This means the first sentence of each member , class , interface or package description .
The Javadoc tool copies this first sentence to the appropriate member , class / interface or package summary .
This makes it important to write crisp and informative initial sentences that can stand on their own .
This sentence ends at the first period that is followed by a blank , tab , or line terminator , or at the first tag ( as defined below ) .
For example , this first sentence ends at " Prof . " :
/** * This is a simulation of Prof. Knuth 's MIX computer .
*/
However , you can work around this by typing an HTML meta - character such as " & " or " < " immediately after the period , such as :
/** * This is a simulation of Prof. Knuth 's MIX computer .
*/
or
/** * This is a simulation of Prof . <!-- -->
Knuth 's MIX computer . */
In particular , write summary sentences that distinguish overloaded methods from each other .
For example :
/** * Class constructor . */ foo ( ) { ... /** * Class constructor specifying number of objects to create . */ foo( int n ) { ...
Implementation - Independence
Write the description to be implementation - independent , but specifying such dependencies where necessary .
This helps engineers write code to be " write once , run anywhere . "
As much as possible , write doc comments as an implementation - independent API specification .
Define clearly what is required and what is allowed to vary across platforms / implementations .
Ideally , make it complete enough for conforming implementors .
Realistically , include enough description so that someone reading the source code can write a substantial suite of conformance tests .
Basically , the spec should be complete , including boundary conditions , parameter ranges and corner cases .
Where appropriate , mention what the specification leaves unspecified or allows to vary among implementations .
If you must document implementation - specific behavior , please document it in a separate paragraph with a lead - in phrase that makes it clear it is implementation - specific .
If the implementation varies according to platform , then specify " On < platform > " at the start of the paragraph .
In other cases that might vary with implementations on a platform you might use the lead - in phrase " Implementation - Specific : " .
Here is an example of an implementation - dependent part of the specification for java.lang .
Runtime : On Windows systems , the path search behavior of the loadLibrary method is identical to that of the Windows API 's LoadLibrary procedure .
The use of " On Windows " at the beginning of the sentence makes it clear up front that this is an implementation note .
Automatic re-use of method comments
You can avoid re-typing doc comments by being aware of how the Javadoc tool duplicates ( inherits ) comments for methods that override or implement other methods .
This occurs in three cases :
When a method in a class overrides a method in a superclass
When a method in an interface overrides a method in a superinterface
When a method in a class implements a method in an interface
In the first two cases , if a method m( ) overrides another method , The Javadoc tool will generate a subheading " Overrides " in the documentation for m( ) , with a link to the method it is overriding .
In the third case , if a method m( ) in a given class implements a method in an interface , the Javadoc tool will generate a subheading " Specified by " in the documentation for m( ) , with a link to the method it is implementing .
In all three of these cases , if the method m( ) contains no doc comments or tags , the Javadoc tool will also copy the text of the method it is overriding or implementing to the generated documentation for m( ) .
So if the documentation of the overridden or implemented method is sufficient , you do not need to add documentation for m( ) .
If you add any documentation comment or tag to m( ) , the " Overrides " or " Specified by " subheading and link will still appear , but no text will be copied .
A Style Guide
The following are useful tips and conventions for writing descriptions in doc comments .
Use < code > style for keywords and names .
Keywords and names are offset by < code >...</ code > when mentioned in a description .
This includes : Java keywords package names class names method names interface names field names argument names code examples
Use in - line links economically
You are encouraged to add links for API names ( listed immediately above ) using the {@link} tag .
It is not necessary to add links for all API names in a doc comment .
Because links call attention to themselves ( by their color and underline in HTML , and by their length in source code doc comments ) , it can make the comments more difficult to read if used profusely .
We therefore recommend adding a link to an API name if :
The user might actually want to click on it for more information ( in your judgment ) , and Only for the first occurrence of each API name in the doc comment ( do n't bother repeating a link )
Our audience is advanced ( not novice ) programmers , so it is generally not necessary to link to API in the java.lang package ( such as String ) , or other API you feel would be well - known .
Omit parentheses for the general form of methods and constructors
When referring to a method or constructor that has multiple forms , and you mean to refer to a specific form , use parentheses and argument types .
For example , ArrayList has two add methods : add ( Object ) and add ( int , Object ) : The add ( int , Object ) method adds an item at a specified position in this arraylist .
However , if referring to both forms of the method , omit the parentheses altogether .
It is misleading to include empty parentheses , because that would imply a particular form of the method .
The intent here is to distinguish the general method from any of its particular forms .
Include the word " method " to distinguish it as a method and not a field .
The add method enables you to insert items .
( preferred ) The add ( ) method enables you to insert items .
( avoid when you mean " all forms " of the add method )
OK to use phrases instead of complete sentences , in the interests of brevity .
This holds especially in the initial summary and in @param tag descriptions .
Use 3rd person ( descriptive ) not 2nd person ( prescriptive ) .
The description is in 3rd person declarative rather than 2nd person imperative .
Gets the label .
( preferred )
Get the label .
( avoid )
Method descriptions begin with a verb phrase .
A method implements an operation , so it usually starts with a verb phrase :
Gets the label of this button .
( preferred )
This method gets the label of this button .
Class / interface / field descriptions can omit the subject and simply state the object .
These API often describe things rather than actions or behaviors : A button label .
( preferred )
This field is a button label .
( avoid )
Use " this " instead of " the " when referring to an object created from the current class .
For example , the description of the getToolkit method should read as follows :
Gets the toolkit for this component .
( preferred )
Gets the toolkit for the component .
( avoid )
Add description beyond the API name .
The best API names are " self - documenting " , meaning they tell you basically what the API does .
If the doc comment merely repeats the API name in sentence form , it is not providing more information .
For example , if method description uses only the words that appear in the method name , then it is adding nothing at all to what you could infer .
The ideal comment goes beyond those words and should always reward you with some bit of information that was not immediately obvious from the API name .
Avoid -
The description below says nothing beyond what you know from reading the method name .
The words " set " , " tool " , " tip " , and " text " are simply repeated in a sentence .
/** * Sets the tool tip text .
* * @param text the text of the tool tip */ public void setToolTipText ( String text ) {
Preferred -
This description more completely defines what a tool tip is , in the larger context of registering and being displayed in response to the cursor .
/** * Registers the text to display in a tool tip .
The text * displays when the cursor lingers over the component .
* * @param text the string to display .
If the text is null , * the tool tip is turned off for this component .
*/ public void setToolTipText ( String text ) {
Be clear when using the term " field " .
Be aware that the word " field " has two meanings :
static field , which is another term for " class variable "
text field , as in the TextField class .
Note that this kind of field might be restricted to holding dates , numbers or any text .
Alternate names might be " date field " or " number field " , as appropriate .
Avoid Latin use " also known as " instead of " aka " , use " that is " or " to be specific " instead of " i.e. " , use " for example " instead of " e.g. " , and use " in other words " or " namely " instead of " viz . "
Tag Conventions
This section covers :
Most of the following tags are specified in the Java Language Specification , First Edition .
Also see the Javadoc reference page .
Order of Tags
Include tags in the following order :
@author ( classes and interfaces only , required )
( classes and interfaces only , required ) @version ( classes and interfaces only , required .
See footnote 1 )
( classes and interfaces only , required .
See footnote 1 ) @param ( methods and constructors only )
( methods and constructors only ) @return ( methods only )
( methods only ) @exception ( @throws is a synonym added in Javadoc 1.2 )
( @throws is a synonym added in Javadoc 1.2 ) @see
@since
@serial ( or @serial Field or @serialData )
( or @serial Field or @serialData ) @deprecated ( see How and When To Deprecate APIs )
Ordering Multiple Tags
We employ the following conventions when a tag appears more than once in a documentation comment .
If desired , groups of tags , such as multiple @see tags , can be separated from the other tags by a blank line with a single asterisk .
Multiple @author tags should be listed in chronological order , with the creator of the class listed at the top .
Multiple @param tags should be listed in argument - declaration order .
This makes it easier to visually match the list to the declaration .
Multiple @throws tags ( also known as @exception ) should be listed alphabetically by the exception names .
Multiple @see tags should be ordered as follows , which is roughly the same order as their arguments are searched for by javadoc , basically from nearest to farthest access , from least - qualified to fully - qualified , The following list shows this progression .
Notice the methods and constructors are in " telescoping " order , which means the " no arg " form first , then the " 1 arg " form , then the " 2 arg " form , and so forth .
Where a second sorting key is needed , they could be listed either alphabetically or grouped logically .
@see # field @see # Constructor ( Type , Type ... ) @see # Constructor ( Type id , Type id ... ) @see # method ( Type , Type , ... ) @see # method ( Type id , Type , id ... ) @see Class @see Class#field @see Class#Constructor ( Type , Type ... ) @see Class #Constructor ( Type id , Type id ) @see Class#method ( Type , Type , ... ) @see Class # method ( Type id , Type id , ... ) @see package .
Class @see package .
Class # field @see package .
Class#Constructor ( Type , Type ... ) @see package .
Class #Constructor ( Type id , Type id ) @see package .
Class#method ( Type , Type , ... ) @see package .
Class #method ( Type id , Type , id ) @see package
Required Tags
An @param tag is " required " ( by convention ) for every parameter , even when the description is obvious .
The @return tag is required for every method that returns something other than void , even if it is redundant with the method description .
( Whenever possible , find something non-redundant ( ideally , more specific ) to use for the tag comment . )
These principles expedite automated searches and automated processing .
Frequently , too , the effort to avoid redundancy pays off in extra clarity .
Tag Comments
As a reminder , the fundamental use of these tags is described on the Javadoc Reference page .
Java Software generally uses the following additional guidelines to create comments for each tag :
@author ( reference page )
You can provide one @author tag , multiple @author tags , or no @author tags .
In these days of the community process when development of new APIs is an open , joint effort , the JSR can be consider the author for new packages at the package level .
For example , the new package java.nio has " @author JSR - 51 Expert Group " at the package level .
Then individual programmers can be assigned to @author at the class level .
As this tag can only be applied at the overview , package and class level , the tag applies only to those who make significant contributions to the design or implementation , and so would not ordinarily include technical writers .
The @author tag is not critical , because it is not included when generating the API specification , and so it is seen only by those viewing the source code .
( Version history can also be used for determining contributors for internal purposes . )
If someone felt strongly they need to add @author at the member level , they could do so by running javadoc using the new 1.4 - tag option :
- tag author : a:" Author : "
If the author is unknown , use " unascribed " as the argument to @author .
Also see order of multiple @author tags .
@version ( reference page )
The Java Software convention for the argument to the @version tag is the SCCS string " %I % , %G % " , which converts to something like " 1.39 , 02/28/97 " ( mm/dd /yy ) when the file is checked out of SCCS .
@param ( reference page )
The @param tag is followed by the name ( not data type ) of the parameter , followed by a description of the parameter .
By convention , the first noun in the description is the data type of the parameter .
( Articles like " a " , " an " , and " the " can precede the noun . )
An exception is made for the primitive int , where the data type is usually omitted .
Additional spaces can be inserted between the name and description so that the descriptions line up in a block .
Dashes or other punctuation should not be inserted before the description , as the Javadoc tool inserts one dash .
Parameter names are lowercase by convention .
The data type starts with a lowercase letter to indicate an object rather than a class .
The description begins with a lowercase letter if it is a phrase ( contains no verb ) , or an uppercase letter if it is a sentence .
End the phrase with a period only if another phrase or sentence follows it .
Example :
* @param ch the character to be tested * @param observer the image observer to be notified
Do not bracket the name of the parameter after the @param tag with < code > ...</ code > since Javadoc 1.2 and later automatically do this .
( Beginning with 1.4 , the name cannot contain any HTML , as Javadoc compares the @param name to the name that appears in the signature and emits a warning if there is any difference . )
When writing the comments themselves , in general , start with a phrase and follow it with sentences if they are needed .
When writing a phrase , do not capitalize and do not end with a period :
@param x the x-coordinate , measured in pixels
When writing a phrase followed by a sentence , do not capitalize the phrase , but end it with a period to distinguish it from the start of the next sentence :
@param x the x-coordinate .
Measured in pixels .
If you prefer starting with a sentence , capitalize it and end it with a period :
@param x Specifies the x-coordinate , measured in pixels .
When writing multiple sentences , follow normal sentence rules : @param x Specifies the x-coordinate .
Measured in pixels .
Also see order of multiple @param tags .
@return ( reference page )
Omit @return for methods that return void and for constructors ; include it for all other methods , even if its content is entirely redundant with the method description .
Having an explicit @return tag makes it easier for someone to find the return value quickly .
Whenever possible , supply return values for special cases ( such as specifying the value returned when an out - of - bounds argument is supplied ) .
Use the same capitalization and punctuation as you used in @param .
@deprecated ( reference page )
The @deprecated description in the first sentence should at least tell the user when the API was deprecated and what to use as a replacement .
Only the first sentence will appear in the summary section and index .
Subsequent sentences can also explain why it has been deprecated .
When generating the description for a deprecated API , the Javadoc tool moves the @deprecated text ahead of the description , placing it in italics and preceding it with a bold warning : " Deprecated " .
An @see tag ( for Javadoc 1.1 ) or {@link} tag ( for Javadoc 1.2 or later ) should be included that points to the replacement method :
For Javadoc 1.2 and later , the standard format is to use @deprecated tag and the in - line {@link} tag .
This creates the link in - line , where you want it .
For example :
tag and the in - line tag .
This creates the link in - line , where you want it .
For example : /** * @deprecated
As of JDK 1.1 , replaced by * {@link # setBounds ( int , int , int , int ) } */ For Javadoc 1.1 , the standard format is to create a pair of @deprecated and @see tags .
For example : /** * @deprecated
As of JDK 1.1 , replaced by * setBounds * @see # setBounds ( int , int , int, int ) */
If the member has no replacement , the argument to @deprecated should be " No replacement " .
Do not add @deprecated tags without first checking with the appropriate engineer .
Substantive modifications should likewise be checked first .
@since ( reference page )
Specify the product version when the Java name was added to the API specification ( if different from the implementation ) .
For example , if a package , class , interface or member was added to the Java 2 Platform , Standard Edition , API Specification at version 1.2 , use :
/** * @since 1.2 */
The Javadoc standard doclet displays a " Since " subheading with the string argument as its text .
This subheading appears in the generated text only in the place corresponding to where the @since tag appears in the source doc comments ( The Javadoc tool does not proliferate it down the hierarchy ) .
( The convention once was " @since JDK1.2 " but because this is a specification of the Java Platform , not particular to the Oracle JDK or SDK , we have dropped " JDK " . )
When a package is introduced , specify an @since tag in its package description and each of its classes .
( Adding @since tags to each class is technically not needed , but is our convention , as enables greater visibility in the source code . )
In the absence of overriding tags , the value of the @since tag applies to each of the package 's classes and members .
When a class ( or interface ) is introduced , specify one @since tag in its class description and no @since tags in the members .
Add an @since tag only to members added in a later version than the class .
This minimizes the number of @since tags .
If a member changes from protected to public in a later release , the @since tag would not change , even though it is now usable by any caller , not just subclassers .
@throws ( @exception was the original tag ) ( reference page )
A @throws tag should be included for any checked exceptions ( declared in the throws clause ) , as illustrated below , and also for any unchecked exceptions that the caller might reasonably want to catch , with the exception of NullPointerException .
Errors should not be documented as they are unpredictable .
For more details , please see Documenting Exceptions with the @throws Tag .
/** * @throws IOException
If an input or output * exception occurred */ public void f( ) throws IOException { // body }

Custom Tags and Annotations
If annotations are new to you , when you need to markup your source code , it might not be immediately clear whether to use an annotation or a Javadoc custom tag .
Here is a quick comparison of the two .
In general , if the markup is intended to affect or produce documentation , it should probably be a javadoc tag ; otherwise , it should be an annotation .
Tag - Intended as a way of adding structure and content to the documentation .
Allows multi-line text to be provided .
( Use the - tag or - taglet Javadoc option to create custom tags . )
Tags should never affect program semantics .
Annotation - Does not directly affect program semantics , but does affect the way programs are treated by tools and libraries , which can in turn affect the semantics of the running program .
Annotations can be read from source files , class files , or reflectively at run time .
Allows a single line of text to be provided .
If you need to affect both program semantics and documentation , you probably need both an annotation and a tag .
For example , our guidelines now recommend using the @Deprecated annotation for alerting the compiler warning and the @deprecated tag for the comment text .
Documenting Default Constructors
Section 8.8.7 of the Java Language Specification , Second Edition describes a default constructor :
If a class contains no constructor declarations , then a default constructor that takes no parameters is automatically provided .
It invokes the superclass constructor with no arguments .
The constructor has the same access as its class .
The Javadoc tool generates documentation for default constructors .
When it documents such a constructor , Javadoc leaves its description blank , because a default constructor can have no doc comment .
The question then arises :
How do you add a doc comment for a default constructor ?
The simple answer is that it is not possible -- and , conveniently , our programming convention is to avoid default constructors .
( We considered but rejected the idea that the Javadoc tool should generate a default comment for default constructors . )
Good programming practice dictates that code should never make use of default constructors in public APIs : All constructors should be explicit .
That is , all default constructors in public and protected classes should be turned into explicit constructor declarations with the appropriate access modifier .
This explicit declaration also gives you a place to write documentation comments .
The reason this is good programming practice is that an explicit declaration helps prevents a class from inadvertently being made instantiable , as the design engineer has to actually make a decision about the constructor 's access .
We have had several cases where we did not want a public class to be instantiable , but the programmer overlooked the fact that its default constructor was public .
If a class is inadvertently allowed to be instantiable in a released version of a product , upward compatibility dictates that the unintentional constructor be retained in future versions .
Under these unfortunate circumstances , the constructor should be made explicit and deprecated ( using @deprecated ) .
Note that when creating an explicit constructor , it must match precisely the declaration of the automatically generated constructor ; even if the constructor should logically be protected , it must be made public to match the declaration of the automatically generated constructor , for compatibility .
An appropriate doc comment should then be provided .
Often , the comment should be something as simple as :
/** * Sole constructor .
( For invocation by subclass * constructors , typically implicit . ) */ protected AbstractMap ( ) { }
Documenting Exceptions with @throws Tag
NOTE -
The tags @throws and @exception are synonyms .
Documenting Exceptions in API Specs
The API specification for methods is a contract between a caller and an implementor .
Javadoc - generated API documentation contains two ways of specifying this contract for exceptions -- the " throws " clause in the declaration , and the @throws Javadoc tag .
These guidelines describe how to document exceptions with the @throws tag .
Throws Tag
The purpose of the @throws tag is to indicate which exceptions the programmer must catch ( for checked exceptions ) or might want to catch ( for unchecked exceptions ) .
Guidelines - Which Exceptions to Document
Document the following exceptions with the @throws tag :
All checked exceptions .
( These must be declared in the throws clause . )
( These must be declared in the throws clause . )
Those unchecked exceptions that the caller might reasonably want to catch .
( It is considered poor programming practice to include unchecked exceptions in the throws clause . )
Documenting these in the @throws tag is up to the judgment of the API designer , as described below .
Documenting Unchecked Exceptions
It is generally desirable to document the unchecked exceptions that a method can throw : this allows ( but does not require ) the caller to handle these exceptions .
For example , it allows the caller to " translate " an implementation - dependent unchecked exception to some other exception that is more appropriate to the caller 's exported abstraction .
Since there is no way to guarantee that a call has documented all of the unchecked exceptions that it may throw , the programmer must not depend on the presumption that a method cannot throw any unchecked exceptions other than those that it is documented to throw .
In other words , you should always assume that a method can throw unchecked exceptions that are undocumented .
Note that it is always inappropriate to document that a method throws an unchecked exception that is tied to the current implementation of that method .
In other words , document exceptions that are independent of the underlying implementation .
For example , a method that takes an index and uses an array internally should not be documented to throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException , as another implementation could use a data structure other than an array internally .
It is , however , generally appropriate to document that such a method throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException .
Keep in mind that if you do not document an unchecked exception , other implementations are free to not throw that exception .
Documenting exceptions properly is an important part of write - once , run-anywhere .
Background on Checked and Unchecked Exceptions
The idea behind checking an exception is that the compiler checks at compile - time that the exception is properly being caught in a try - catch block .
You can identify checked and unchecked exceptions as follows .
Unchecked exceptions are the classes RuntimeException , Error and their subclasses .
, and their subclasses .
All other exception subclasses are checked exceptions .
Note that whether an exception is checked or unchecked is not defined by whether it is included in a throws clause .
Background on the Throws Clause
Checked exceptions must be included in a throws clause of the method .
This is necessary for the compiler to know which exceptions to check .
For example ( in java.lang .
Class ) :
Copy public static Class forName ( String className ) throws ClassNotFoundException
By convention , unchecked exceptions should not be included in a throws clause .
( Including them is considered to be poor programming practice .
The compiler treats them as comments , and does no checking on them . )
The following is poor code -- since the exception is a RuntimeException , it should be documented in the @throws tag instead .
java.lang .
Byte source code :
Copy public static Byte valueOf ( String s , int radix ) throws NumberFormatException
Note that the Java Language Specification also shows unchecked exceptions in throws clauses ( as follows ) .
Using the throws clause for unchecked exceptions in the spec is merely a device meant to indicate this exception is part of the contract between the caller and implementor .
The following is an example of this ( where " final " and " synchronization " are removed to make the comparison simpler ) .
java.util .
Vector source code :
public Object elementAt ( int index )
java.util .
Vector spec in the Java Language Specification , 1st Ed. ( p. 656 ) :
Copy public Object elementAt ( int index ) throws IndexOutOfBoundsException
Package - Level Comments
With Javadoc 1.2 , package - level doc comments are available .
Each package can have its own package - level doc comment source file that The Javadoc tool will merge into the documentation that it produces .
This file is named package .
html ( and is same name for all packages ) .
This file is kept in the source directory along with all the *. java files .
( Do not put the packages . html file in the new doc - files source directory , because those files are only copied to the destination and are not processed . )
The file package . html is an example of a package - level source file for java. text code > and package - summary .
html is the file that the Javadoc tool generates .
The Javadoc tool processes package . html by doing three things :
Copies its contents ( everything between < body > and </ body > ) below the summary tables in the destination file package - summary .
html .
Processes any @see , @since or {@link} Javadoc tags that are present .
Copies the first sentence to the right - hand column of the Overview Summary .
Template for package .
html source file
At Oracle , we use the following template , Empty Template for Package - Level Doc Comment File , when creating a new package doc comment file .
This contains a copyright statement .
Obviously , if you are from a different company , you would supply your own copyright statement .
An engineer would copy this whole file , rename it to package .
html , and delete the lines set off with hash marks : ##### .
One such file should go into each package directory of the source tree .
Contents of package . html source file
The package doc comment should provide ( directly or via links ) everything necessary to allow programmers to use the package .
It is a very important piece of documentation : for many facilities ( those that reside in a single package but not in a single class ) it is the first place where programmers will go for documentation .
It should contain a short , readable description of the facilities provided by the package ( in the introduction , below ) followed by pointers to detailed documentation , or the detailed documentation itself , whichever is appropriate .
Which is appropriate will depend on the package : a pointer is appropriate if it 's part of a larger system ( such as , one of the 37 packages in Corba ) , or if a Framemaker document already exists for the package ; the detailed documentation should be contained in the package doc comment file itself if the package is self - contained and does n't require extensive documentation ( such as java . math ) .
To sum up , the primary purpose of the package doc comment is to describe the purpose of the package , the conceptual framework necessary to understand and to use it , and the relationships among the classes that comprise it .
For large , complex packages ( and those that are part of large , complex APIs ) a pointer to an external architecture document is warranted .
The following are the sections and headings you should use when writing a package - level comment file .
There should be no heading before the first sentence , because the Javadoc tool picks up the first text as the summary statement .
Make the first sentence a summary of the package .
For example : " Provides classes and interfaces for handling text , dates , numbers and messages in a manner independent of natural languages . "
Describe what the package contains and state its purpose .
Package Specification
Include a description of or links to any package - wide specifications for this package that are not included in the rest of the javadoc - generated documentation .
For example , the java . awt package might describe how the general behavior in that package is allowed to vary from one operating system to another ( Windows , Solaris , Mac ) .
Include links to any specifications written outside of doc comments ( such as in FrameMaker or whatever ) if they contain assertions not present in the javadoc - generated files .
An assertion is a statement a conforming implementor would have to know in order to implement the Java platform .
On that basis , at Oracle , references in this section are critical to the Java Compatibility Kit ( JCK ) .
The Java Compatibility Kit includes a test to verify each assertion , to determine what passes as Java Compatible .
The statement " Returns an int " is an assertion .
An example is not an assertion .
Some " specifications " that engineers have written contain no assertions not already stated in the API specs ( javadoc ) -- they just elaborate on the API specs .
In this respect , such a document should not be referred to in this section , but rather should be referred to in the next section .
Include specific references .
If only a section of a referenced document should be considered part of the API spec , then you should link or refer to only that section and refer to the rest of the document in the next section .
The idea is to clearly delineate what is part of the API spec and what is not , so the JCK team can write tests with the proper breadth .
This might even encourage some writers to break documents apart so specs are separate .
Related Documentation
Include references to any documents that do not contain specification assertions , such as overviews , tutorials , examples , demos , and guides .

Anonymous inner classes are defined in Java Language Specification , Second Edition , at Anonymous Class Declaration .
The Javadoc tool does not directly document anonymous classes -- that is , their declarations and doc comments are ignored .
If you want to document an anonymous class , the proper way to do so is in a doc comment of its outer class , or another closely associated class .
For example , if you had an anonymous TreeSelectionListener inner class in a method makeTree that returns a JTree object that users of this class might want to override , you could document in the method comment that the returned JTree has a TreeSelectionListener attached to it :
/** * The method used for creating the tree .
Any structural * modifications to the display of the Jtree should be done * by overriding this method .
* < p > *
This method adds an anonymous TreeSelectionListener to * the returned JTree .
Upon receiving TreeSelectionEvents , * this listener calls refresh with the selected node as a * parameter . */ public JTree makeTree( AreaInfo ai ) { }
Including Images
This section covers images used in the doc comments , not images directly used by the source code .
NOTE : The bullet and heading images required with Javadoc version 1.0 and 1.1 are located in the images directory of the JDK download bundle : jdk1.1/docs/api/images / .
Those images are no longer needed starting with 1.2 .
Prior to Javadoc 1.2 , the Javadoc tool would not copy images to the destination directory -- you had to do it in a separate operation , either manually or with a script .
Javadoc 1.2 looks for and copies to the destination directory a directory named " doc- files " in the source tree ( one for each package ) and its contents .
( It does a shallow copy for 1.2 and 1.3 , and a deep copy for 1.4 and later . )
Thus , you can put into this directory any images ( GIF , JPEG , etc ) or other files not otherwise processed by the Javadoc tool .
The following are the Java Software proposals for conventions for including images in doc comments .
The master images would be located in the source tree ; when the Javadoc tool is run with the standard doclet , it would copy those files to the destination HTML directory .
Images in Source Tree
Naming of doc images in source tree - Name GIF images < class >- 1.gif , incrementing the integer for subsequent images in the same class .
Example : Button - 1.gif
- Name GIF images , incrementing the integer for subsequent images in the same class .
Example : Location of doc images in source tree -
Put doc images in a directory called " doc- files " .
This directory should reside in the same package directory where the source files reside .
( The name " doc- files " distinguishes it as documentation separate from images used by the source code itself , such as bitmaps displayed in the GUI . )
Example : A screen shot of a button , Button - 1.gif , might be included in the class comment for the Button class .
The Button source file and the image would be located at : java / awt/Button .java ( source file ) java/awt/doc-files/Button -1.gif ( image file )
Images in HTML Destination
Naming of doc images in HTML destination - Images would have the same name as they have in the source tree .
Example : Button - 1.gif
- Images would have the same name as they have in the source tree .
Example : Location of doc images in HTML destination
With hierarchical file output , such as Javadoc 1.2 , directories would be located in the package directory named " doc- files " .
For example : api/ java/awt/doc-files/Button-1.gif
With flat file output , such as Javadoc 1.1 , directories would be located in the package directory and named " images - < package > " .
For example : api/images - java.awt / api/images-java.awt.swing /

/** * Graphics is the abstract base class for all graphics contexts * which allow an application to draw onto components realized on * various devices or onto off - screen images .
* A Graphics object encapsulates the state information needed * for the various rendering operations that Java supports .
This * state information includes : * < ul > * < li>The Component to draw on * < li>A translation origin for rendering and clipping coordinates * < li > The current clip * < li > The current color * < li> The current font * < li> The current logical pixel operation function ( XOR or Paint ) * < li> The current XOR alternation color * ( see < a href= " #setXORMode " >setXORMode</a >)
* </ul > * < p > * Coordinates are infinitely thin and lie between the pixels of the * output device .
* Operations which draw the outline of a figure operate by traversing * along the infinitely thin path with a pixel - sized pen that hangs * down and to the right of the anchor point on the path .
* Operations which fill a figure operate by filling the interior * of the infinitely thin path .
* Operations which render horizontal text render the ascending * portion of the characters entirely above the baseline coordinate .
* < p > *
Some important points to consider are that drawing a figure that * covers a given rectangle will occupy one extra row of pixels on * the right and bottom edges compared to filling a figure that is * bounded by that same rectangle .
*
Also , drawing a horizontal line along the same y coordinate as * the baseline of a line of text will draw the line entirely below * the text except for any descenders .
*
Both of these properties are due to the pen hanging down and to * the right from the path that it traverses .
* < p > *
All coordinates which appear as arguments to the methods of this * Graphics object are considered relative to the translation origin * of this Graphics object prior to the invocation of the method .

Troubleshooting Curly Quotes ( Microsoft Word )
Problem -
A problem occurs if you are working in an editor that defaults to curly ( rather than straight ) single and double quotes , such as Microsoft Word on a PC -- the quotes disappear when displayed in some browsers ( such as Unix Netscape ) .
So a phrase like " the display 's characteristics " becomes " the displays characteristics . "
The illegal characters are the following :
146 - right single quote
147 - left double quote
148 - right double quote
What should be used instead is :
39 - straight single quote
34 - straight quote
Preventive Solution -
The reason the " illegal " quotes occurred was that a default Word option is " Change ' Straight Quotes ' to ' Smart Quotes ' " .
If you turn this off , you get the appropriate straight quotes when you type .
Fixing the Curly Quotes - Microsoft
Word has several save options -- use " Save As Text Only " to change the quotes back to straight quotes .
Be sure to use the correct option :
" Save As Text Only With Line Breaks " - inserts a space at the end of each line , and keeps curly quotes .
" Save As Text Only " - does not insert a space at the end of each lines , and changes curly quotes to straight quotes .

At Java Software , we use @version for the SCCS version .
See " man sccs - get " for details .
The consensus seems to be the following :
% I % gets incremented each time you edit and delget a file
%G % is the date mm /dd/yy
When you create a file , % I % is set to 1.1 .
When you edit and delget it , it increments to 1.2 .
Some developers omit the date %G % ( and have been doing so ) if they find it too confusing -- for example , 3/4/96 , which %G % would produce for March 4th , would be interpreted by those outside the United States to mean the 3rd of April .
Some developers include the time %U % only if they want finer resolution ( due to multiple check - ins in a day ) .
The clearest numeric date format would be to have the date formatted with the year first , something like yyyy - mm-dd , as proposed in ISO 8601 and elsewhere ( such as http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html), but that enhancement would need to come from SCCS .

Cyc-ing out the terrorists
Posted 3/30/03
Only sheer brilliance or a crystal ball could foretell the next terrorist attack , right ?
Nope , says the inventor of a computer program that predicted anthrax might be sent through the mail six months before it happened .
Cyc ( as in encyclopedia ) , a project that is now part of the Pentagon 's research on sniffing out terrorist plots , comes up with scenarios that could help focus screening efforts .
It works by applying common sense to an extensive knowledge of terrorism .
" It 's not like beating Kasparov at chess , " says creator Doug Lenat , head of the Austin - based firm Cycorp .
He compares it to " a person with average intelligence but a vast amount of time and patience . "
Cyc 's roots go back to 1983 , when Lenat concluded that efforts to create computer intelligence had hit a wall .
" Robots lacked the common sense of humans , " he says .
So he began feeding Cyc concepts like the difference between turkey the meat or bird and Turkey , the country .
The database now holds almost 2 million such simple truths .
Under a $ 9.8 million grant from the Defense Department 's Information Awareness Office , Cyc has acquired a trove of knowledge about past terrorist activities , tactics , and weapons .
But it is still a work in progress .
Once , developing a scenario for a terrorist attack on Hoover Dam , it hypothesized a school of 1,000 al Qaeda - trained dolphins bearing explosives .
Another time , Cyc , which can learn by asking questions , inquired : " Am I human ? "
It 's reassuring to know it still needs our help .

Admiral Inman is linked to SAIC ( among other things , SAIC is neck - deep in connections to digital voting machines ) .
This article from 2003 is pretty informative ;
" " Currently on SAIC 's board is ex-CIA director Bobby Ray Inman , director of the National Security Agency , deputy director of the CIA , and vice director of the Defense Intelligence Agency .
According to the OC ( * Orange County )
Weekly , " Inman worked at the highest levels of American intelligence during an era ( President Ronald Reagan ) when it displayed a stunning lack of it .
Inman 's achievements include : failing to predict the peaceful collapse of the Soviet Union ; prolonging violent , useless civil wars in Central America ; and giving arms to terrorists in exchange for hostages ( Iran Contra ) . "
" During the Bush administration , Inman , Perry and Deutch - while directors of Science Applications ( SAIC ) , were also members of the National Foreign Intelligence Board ( NFIB ) , an advisory group reporting to the President and the director of Central Intelligence , which deals with production , review and coordination of foreign intelligence , " reports the Crypt. Both Inman and Deutch were former Directors of the CIA .
William J. Perry was also a former Secretary of Defense during the Clinton Administration .
SAIC proudly lists DARPA in its annual report as one of its prime clients .
DARPA is the controversial Department of Defense ( DOD ) subsidiary , which until recently employed Admiral John Poindexter of Iran -Contra fame .
Poindexter was forced to resign when it was revealed that DARPA was prepared to trade " futures " in terrorist attacks .
DARPA has also developed a program to spy on American citizens , which has civil libertarians in an uproar . "
SAIC in turn , is linked to Steven Hatfill and Jerome Hauer .
Mr. Hauer is currently a director at Emergent Solutions , parent co. of BioPort , which in turn is linked to Bruce Ivins .
So , an artificial intelligence program with an uncanny knack for putting the pieces together " predicts " the anthrax mailings , and 6 months later they happen ?
And the program , under " widespread deployment " is funded heavily by DARPA , and is hard - wired into the U.S. intelligence community .
Admiral Inman is a very connected individual ;
http://www.namebase.org/cgi-bin/nb06?_INMAN_BOBBY_RAY
Including a maximum of 2 degrees of separation from all of the ( known ) players in the anthrax tango .
How detailed was Cy's ( Cycorp ) " prediction " about the mailings ?
Did it include variables like mailing the anthrax from different states to muddy the trail ... stuff like that ?
How about a variable on creating false evidence trails to keep people guessing ?
I 'm not sure that Cy is any more humane than HAL ever was .
I call out to internet researchers everywhere for more info on Cycorp .

The claimed recent discovery of Bigfoot in the US state of Georgia has turned out to be a hoax - it was a rubber gorilla suit in a block of ice .
Two men said last week they had found a 2.3 m - tall ( 7ft 7in ) , 226kg ( 500 lb ) corpse of the legendary ape - like creature in a wood in June .
Two researchers bought the " carcass " , encased in ice , for an undisclosed sum .
But as it thawed it turned out to be a rubber monkey outfit .
Bigfoot has been the subject of decades of hoaxes .
Matt Whitton , a police officer , and Rick Dyer , a former prison officer , told a new conference in California last week that they had made the find while hiking .
' Dinosaurs '
A photograph on the men's website showed what appeared to be a large , hairy creature .
But Bigfoot experts reacted suspiciously to the men's claims and the story soon began to unravel .
BIGFOOT BASICS
First documented report was prints found by Canadian trader in 1811 Name dates from 1958 reports of giant footprints found in California Ray Wallace , who died in 2002 , claimed to have faked these Most famous footage shot in 1967 and contested ever since Steve Kulls - of squatchdetective.com - observed the thawing and said that as the ice melted , the exposed head was found to be " unusually hollow in one small section " .
As the process continued the feet were exposed - and were found to be made of rubber .
AP news agency reported that telephone calls to Mr Whitton and Mr Dyer were not returned on Tuesday .
But the voicemail recording for their Bigfoot Tip Line - which proclaims they also search for leprechauns and the Loch Ness monster - has been updated .
It announced the duo were also looking for " big cats and dinosaurs " .

The report said that several senior Justice Department Criminal Division officials raised concerns with the National Security Council in 2003 about the military ’s treatment of detainees , but saw no changes as a result of their complaints .
John Ashcroft , the former attorney general , declined to be interviewed by the inspector general ’s office of the department he had headed , an unusual refusal and one that hampered investigators ’ attempts to learn of discussions inside the council , the report said .
A Pentagon spokesman had no immediate comment on the report .
The inspector general ’s office started its investigation in late 2004 , following widespread public attention to the question of detainee treatment spurred by graphic photographs of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
The American Civil Liberties Union , through a lawsuit , also unearthed numerous internal e-mail messages from the bureau about agents ’ complaints of rough interrogation tactics at Guantánamo Bay , which proved central in the Justice Department ’s review .
The investigation examined about a half - million documents and included surveys of 1,000 F.B.I. agents regarding their experiences with interrogation tactics by military and C.I.A. interrogators , as well as interviews with hundreds of other bureau personnel , officials said .
The investigation centered on the accounts of what the agents witnessed in the treatment of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay , in Iraq and in Afghanistan , and how those complaints were handled .
The Justice Department ’s inspector general does not have jurisdiction over the Pentagon .
The bulk of the report was completed last year , but its public release by the inspector general was bottled up for months because of concerns from the Defense Department about the disclosure of sensitive information centering on interrogation tactics .
The final report from the inspector general , unlike some earlier terrorism investigations , was released with relatively few blacked - out sections .
The bureau stationed agents at Guantánamo Bay and other military detention sites to assist in the questioning of detainees taken into custody after the terror attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , but the rough tactics by military interrogators soon became a major source of friction between the bureau and sister agencies .
Agents complained to superiors beginning in 2002 that the tactics they had seen in use yielded little actual intelligence , prevented them from establishing a rapport with detainees through more traditional means of questioning , and might violate bureau policy or American law .
John McCain 's message machine shifted gears today -- after a week or so of offbeat efforts to annoy and exasperate Barack Obama , the Republican 's campaign launched a new bid to distance him from the titular head of his own party .
A 60 - second McCain television ad ( see below ) airing in several of this year 's key battleground states seeks to both remind voters of the " maverick " image that gained him national prominence and undercut arguments that he 's a President Bush clone .
Indeed , the spot 's third sentence offers this starkly negative assessment of the incumbent 's second term : " We ’re worse off than we were four years ago . "
We doubt Bush will embrace that talking point when he gets his moment at the podium on the opening night of the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minn .
And Obama 's campaign certainly is n't buying it .
As The Times ' James Gerstenzang details on our Countdown to Crawford blog , the Democrat today sought to draw a straight line between the administration 's energy policies and McCain .
[ UPDATE : The Democratic National Committee also joined the fray , producing a video depicting McCain as the puppet of oil industry lobbyists . ]
The McCain ad focuses on touting his credentials as one who can fix a " broken " Washington and does not directly mention Obama .
But questions his campaign has raised about Obama 's readiness for the White House are referenced in the ad's last line : " One is ready to lead : McCain . "
Mark Silva notes in his posting on the Swamp that actor James Garner may have reason to take umbrage over the spot .

If all goes according to plan , the announcement will be made with text and e-mail messages to supporters early in the morning , in time to capture coverage on the morning news shows and take advantage of a full day ’s news cycle .
Mr. Obama and his running mate will begin , perhaps that day , a visit to swing states .
Plans call for them to be on the trail together for much of the time between the day of the announcement and the day Mr. Obama arrives in Denver , a week from Wednesday , but their most intense campaigning together will come after the convention .

Mr. Obama ’s schedule calls for him to awaken on Tuesday in Orlando , Fla. , and by the end of the day be in Raleigh , N.C. By Wednesday , he is scheduled to be in Virginia .
The Obama campaign has cautioned against reading anything into his schedule , saying it could be changed in an instant to accommodate the plan to introduce the running mate .
Aides said the announcement would come at the earliest on Wednesday morning .
Mr. Obama ’s advisers said they wanted to time the announcement to get maximum publicity going into the convention , after a stretch in which Mr. Obama was on vacation in Hawaii and Mr. McCain made good use of having the political stage largely to himself .
Vice - presidential announcements are one of a handful of moments when the presidential candidates are given a clear grab at the public spotlight , and both Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain have put much thought into the timing of their announcements .
If Mr. Obama is looking to build excitement going into the convention , Mr. McCain ’s aides have looked to announcing his choice right after the Democratic convention , which ends Aug. 28 , a Thursday , as a way of stepping on whatever bounce Mr. Obama enjoys from his nomination .
The Republican convention begins the following Monday .
Democrats close to the process said the ability to turn up information on the Web had made it easier for Mr. Obama ’s search team — Caroline Kennedy and Eric Holder , a former deputy attorney general — to plumb the backgrounds of prospective running mates with relatively little notice .
In addition , because so many of the candidates were senators , they were required to file annual financial disclosure reports .
Gentoo Foundationは 、「 Gentoo Linux 2008.0」の正式版をリリースした。ハードウェアドライバの追加が注目される新しいLinuxカーネルに移行している。
Gentooは、パッケージのアップデータとインストーラに「 Portage 」 という特別なシステムを採用していて、Portageの柔軟性を理由に「メタディストリビューション」と称している。Portageは各ソフトウェアコンポーネントを、コンパイル済みのバイナリを使わずにソースコードからコンパイルして構築する。
Portageだと各パッケージがユーザーのハードウェアとソフトウェアにあわせてカスタマイズされるが、欠点として、デスクトップ環境「KDE」など複雑なシステムの場合はインストールが遅くなる可能性がある（KDEや「OpenOffice.org 」「 Mozilla Firefox」など一部の人気ソフトについて、Gentooはコンパイル済みのバイナリをリリースしている）。
速さについては定評があり、スクリプティングを多用することで維持管理者の作業量が軽減されるように作られている。開発陣によると今回の新バージョンは2.6.24カーネルを採用しており、バージョン2007.0以降にリリースされた新しいハードウェアドライバが追加されているという。
また、インストーラが新しくなってネットワークを用いないインストールの実行方法が変更されたほか、拡張パーティションおよび論理パーティションの管理のバグが修正されている。
Gentooのサイトによると 、Gentooの最も一般的なインストール方法であ るLiveCDでは、デスクトップ環境が「 GNOME 」から「 Xfce」に変更され、必要なディスクスペースが少なくなっているという。デスクトップ環境はGNOMEやKDEがいいという人はソースからインストールする必要がある、と開発陣は話している。
Gentooのリリースを遅らせてい たLiveDVDは後回しにされており、リリースが取りやめになる可能性もある。
アップデートされたパッケージをいくつか挙げておくと、インストールとアップデートの基本システムであるPortageがバージョン2.1.4.4に、Xfceがバージョン4.4.2に、「GNU C Compiler」（gcc）がバージョン4.1.2に、「 GNU C Library 」がバージョン2.6.1になっている。
Gentooはデフォルトでは最も基本的なパッケージのみをインストールし、あとはユーザーがPortageを使ってシステムを構築するようになっている。現在、GentooのPortageツリーには1万を超えるパッケージが含まれている。

BEIJING 
His work here done , Michael Phelps spent a few minutes Sunday hitting the highlights .
Meeting the Spaniard Rafael Nadal at the athletes ’ village was one .
Phelps said he approached Nadal and introduced himself , explaining , “ He ’s probably one of my favorite tennis players to watch on TV . ”
After surpassing Mark Spitz as the most decorated athlete in a single Olympics , Phelps will probably require no further introductions .
His successful pursuit of eight gold medals was the story of the first week of the Beijing Games .
From what Phelps has heard , the race that delivered his eighth medal  the 4x100 - meter medley relay on Sunday morning  was shown at sports bars , neighborhood Olympic parties and the giant video screens at the stadium where Phelps ’s hometown Baltimore Ravens were playing a preseason game .
Now comes the hard part .
The 23 - year - old Phelps wants to keep people tuned into swimming , but how ?
“ I do n’t want this sport to be an every - four - years sport , ” said Phelps , who plans to compete through the 2012 Olympics in London .
“ In between the four years , there ’s really not as much exposure as I ’d like . ”
Votestrike.com has put forth plans for a General Strike beginning on September 11 , 2008 , which is quickly gaining a tremendous amount of support .
Chris Rice , Founder of Votestrike , said , " General strikes shut down the normal operations of a city , state , or nation for a period of time .
These strikes aim to force action on a single issue or broader set of concerns .
The reason for this shutdown is not to hurt this country in any way shape or form .
But is in fact a peaceful method of sending a message to Washington , D.C. "
As support for this sentiment grows daily the strike 's appeal has increased worldwide .
Rice goes on to say , " The General Strike is a national call to action , from citizens to other citizens .
It 's not about a single issue .
It is not an anti-war protest , a gas price protest , a civil rights protest , and election fraud protest .
It is not about torture , surveillance , corporate media , or the environment .
This strike is about all these issues and more . "
Votestrike.com is calling for YOU , to set things right by calling for people to participate by refusing to shop , go to work , go to school , and instead to non-violently protest and engage in acts of non-violent civil disobedience nation - wide .
The strike targets key issues facing the general public , issues that have not been addressed in any meaningful way by any branch of government .
Now is your moment to join with thousands who are saying enough is enough .
The Votestrike.com website reminds people of this admonition from the Supreme Court : " It is not the function of our Government to keep the citizen from falling into error : it is the function of the citizen to keep the Government from falling into error . "

We the people ... The Constitution of The United States of America spells out in the first line where the power of our great democracy lies .
Unfortunately we the people have allowed the power to slip away to special interest , lobbyist , corporations and career politicians .
It is time to reclaim our democracy from the people that are destroying it .
Thomas Jefferson said that " All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent " now is the time for all people to be heard .
The framers of our democracy did not intend our representatives be career politicians .
They foresaw the danger in this .
The constitution states that " The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year . "
The framers intent was for our democracy to be governed by everyday people not career politicians for obvious reasons .
Legislators would meet enact laws and go back to their chosen profession .
Career politicians will do and say anything to keep their power .
Power corrupts even those with the best intentions .
Jefferson understood that " experience hath shown , that even under the best forms of government those entrusted with power , in time , and by slow operations , perverted it into tyranny . "
The framers had no fear that the result of their experiment would be that men may be trusted to govern themselves without a master .
Unfortunately today 's politician does have a " master . "
This master is the special interest , corporations and lobbyists that are destroying our country .
Ronald Reagan once said " It has been said that politics is the second oldest profession .
I have learned that it bears a striking resemblance to the first . "
We need to get politics as usual out of government and start to tell our leaders to GIVE BACK CONGRESS .
FDR said that " the only sure bulwark of continuing liberty is a government strong enough to protect the interests of the people , and a people strong enough and well enough informed to maintain its sovereign control over the government . "
FDR further stated that " nobody will ever deprive the American people of the right to vote except the American people themselves and the only way they could do this is by not voting . "
Let us never forget that government was not meant to be a power over us .
The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not the President , Senators , Congressman or Government Officials , but the voters of this country .
It does not matter if we vote Democrat , Republican or Independent .
We have seen Congress change power since 2006 .
Each time we were promised that the ways of old were over .
We were told that the new party in power would return the power to the people and get rid of the status quo in Washington DC .
We were promised solutions to the health care crisis , social security crisis , taxation , inflation and the deficit .
In fact these were the same problems we spoke about in the 1960's .
They are still not fixed .
WHY ?
Because the special interest , lobbyist and corporations have a stranglehold on our career politicians .
The special interest , lobbyist , and corporations do not care which party is in power because there are enough career politicians in both parties willing to take their money and perks to look the other way .
Thomas Jefferson said " Whenever a man has cast a longing eye on offices , a rottenness begins in his conduct . "
We must tell our leaders enough is enough . "
GIVE BACK CONGRESS .
The day that " politician " became a career choice is the day we started losing the Republic .
Let 's get it back !

We have often discussed the possible benefits of prediction markets for reducing bias .
One key element that could be particularly useful is a conditional prediction market , where betting claims are based on outcomes conditional on some factor we want to evaluate .
Robin recently mentioned the possible benefit from market claims on longevity or health conditional on various interventions .
Unfortunately , there are few prediction markets in the world , and fewer conditional ones , so it is hard to know how practical this institution may become .
Thanks to an initiative by OB contributor Peter McCluskey , Intrade – the large , real - money prediction market – has added conditional claims based on the outcome of the U.S. Presidential elections .
These may represent the first major case study of real - money conditional futures markets .
So how are they doing ?
Here is some data and analysis .
Because of how the conditional claims are computed , we need to normalize the results by dividing the claim prices by the probability of a win for that party ’s candidate .
At the moment I looked ( 2008 - 07 - 28 , 5:00 PM PDT ) , clicking on Politics and “ 2008 US Election ” , and expanding “ 2008 Presidential Election Winner ( Political Party ) ” I saw that the odds for a Democratic victory are 66.7 - 67.4 .
The claims are based on Democratic vs non-Democratic victories , so we will use the complementary odds of 32.6 - 33.3 for a non-Democratic win .
Then clicking on the left on “ US Pres. Decisions ” gives us the six conditional markets funded by Peter McCluskey .
Here are the claims , the prices , and the normalized values found by dividing by the corresponding Democratic and non-Democratic victory probabilities above .
To compute the normalized values , I divided the lowest claim price by the highest party - victory price , and the highest claim price by the lowest party - victory price , giving the maximum range consistent with current trading prices .
( Peter provides continually - updated information on current implied values as well . )
Claim Dem price non-Dem price
Dem norm non-Dem norm Increase in US government debt ( over $ 10 billion ) 51.2-53.7 34.4-36.5 76.0-80.5 105.5-109.6
Number of US troops in Iraq on 30 June 2010 ( over 2000 ) 41.3-43.8 32.1-34.3 61.3-65.7 96.4-105.2
These prices imply that the market expects that under a non-Democratic administration , we will see substantially higher government debt , as well as much higher numbers of soldiers in Iraq .
In addition , there are two claims based on the chance that futures prices will move in the same direction as the Democratic party victory claim price , on election day :
Claim Odds Oil Futures & PRESIDENT .DEM2008 prices will move in same direction on Election Day 49.8- 49.9 T - Bond interest rate futures & PRESIDENT .
DEM2008 prices will move in same direction on Election Day 49.9 - 50.1
These values are so close to the 50 % mark that it appears that the markets do not expect any significant movement in oil prices or interest rates on election day , that can be attributed to developing information about which party will win .
As critics have noted , this could be because they do n’t see much effect of political parties on these values , or else because they expect that the election day results will be a foregone conclusion and there will be no surprises in that regard .
( Or perhaps , that no significant information will leak out regarding election results during trading hours . )
Intrade has another set of conditional election claims under the heading of “ Impact of Next Pres . ” .
Rather than party based , these claims are linked to specific candidates , meaning that at this point only the Obama and McCain claims have significant relevance .
The claims measure economic growth , unemployment , crime , and control of the legislature , conditional on candidate victory – all interesting topics .
But there is a huge difference in liquidity and trading volume for these claims versus the ones discussed above .
These claims have bid -ask spreads that range from large to enormous ; some have no bid or ask offers at all .
And the trading volume is so far non-existent – apparently none of them has ever traded !
These claims are essentially useless for shedding light on likely impacts of the presidential choice .
So what is the difference ?
The first set of claims is being funded and subsidized by Peter McCluskey , who has set up an automated market maker algorithm ( based on an invention by Robin Hanson ) that keeps the bid-ask spread within 2.5 points .
When I first heard of the idea of such a bot , I thought it would have to be willing to lose infinite amounts of money , but actually this is not the case ; losses are bounded .
Nevertheless the potential costs to Peter are very significant , and he could be out almost $ 50,000 to fund his six claims .
Still , we can see the very real and practical benefits of this subsidy approach .
The claims sponsored by Peter have relatively good liquidity and produce meaningful price comparisons .
While not intrinsically more interesting than the other batch , Peter ’s claims trade relatively frequently since there is always an attractive offer , while the others have never traded at all .
The lesson , then , is that conditional prediction markets can be informative , but that there is great importance in the detailed structure of the institutions .
Peter ’s subsidies have made the difference between a failed market and a successful one .
At the same time , we see that the claims based on price movements on election day are not working as well as the others , so that idea may not be as promising ( perhaps circumstances will change as election day approaches ) .
Another issue I would see as a potential trader is the difficulty of protecting my position against shifts in prices of two different markets .
The value I am betting on is the ratio of two sets of prices , so I may want to change my holdings if either of those prices moves .
It would be nice if one could post bids which are based on the ratio rather than on specific prices in the individual markets .
It would also be nice to see the imputed values based on price ratios live and next to the market prices , rather than on another web page .
Even with these problems , it appears that the overall concept is a rather spectacular success that suggests that the concept has great promise .
We all owe a debt of thanks to Peter for making such a substantial contribution towards showing the practicality of conditional futures markets .

Hinkley , Palmer face off for Calhoun County sheriff job
Calhoun County 's recently appointed sheriff will be challenged in November by a retired Battle Creek Police Department sergeant .
How to Tell When Leftovers Go Bad Experts explain when it 's time to toss old food ; the answer may surprise you .
Aug. 12 , 2008  --
To toss or not to toss :
Exactly when leftovers become trash has fueled arguments of couples , roommates and co-workers since the dawn of the refrigeration .
Does moldy bread go in the trash , or just get a trim around the green spot ?
Can Sunday 's leftovers be Friday 's meal ?
What about that day - old ground beef ?
While scientists have developed methods to detect spoilage -- for example , sensors that go off when milk changes consistency or a polymer to detect bacteria growth in meat -- until these are available on a mass scale , food science and safety experts have some tips .
Deadly and Invisible
First tip : slimy , stinky , spotty or chunky changes in food do n't mean very much in terms of safety .
" It may not taste good , that does n't mean it 's going to make you sick , " said Michael Doyle , director of the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia in Griffin .
Doyle said there 's a difference between what food scientists call spoilage bacteria and pathogens .
Spoilage bacteria make themselves known by way of slimy films on lunch meat , soggy edges on vegetables or in stinky chicken .
But " there 's a big difference between spoilage and what 's going to make you sick , " Doyle said .
" Often spoilage bacteria will outgrow the harmful bacteria and protect [ the food ] . "
The pathogens that do make you sick are odorless , colorless and invisible .
The consumers sickened in the e-coli contaminated beef recalled from Whole Foods this month likely could not smell , see or taste the bacteria .
Salmonella is invisible , too .
" Even if you put it under the microscope , you could n't tell it 's salmonella [ bacteria ] , " Doyle said .
Catherine Donnelly , professor of nutrition and food sciences at the University of Vermont in Burlington , said , " That 's the problem : it 's that you really can't tell . "
But that does n't mean Donnelly and other food safety experts think consumers are simply at the mercy of farms and slaughter houses .
It 's Getting Hot in There
Because consumers can't use the looks - OK , smells - OK , is - OK mantra for safety , Donnelly has some other advice .
" Do you know the temperature of your refrigerator ?
Most people don't , " Donnelly said .
For leftover food to be safe , it must be kept in what Donnelly calls the rule of four : no more than four days at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or 4 degrees centigrade .
( Freezing fresh food at zero degree Fahrenheit will keep it safe indefinitely . )
" About 25 percent of the refrigerators in the country are operating at a temperature that can make food unsafe , " says Donnelly , citing a study commissioned by the Federal Transit Administration .
" Here we 're using the refrigerator as a food safety device and most people have no clue , no idea what temperature it should be . "
Temperature can slow or stop bacterial growth of either the pathogens or the spoilage variety .
Forty degrees Fahrenheit buys people three days for safety with raw chicken and ground beef , three days with cuts of beef and lamb and four days for leftovers .
Allowing anything to go above the cold 40 degrees along the way from store to frying pan can make the difference between illness and safety .
" If it 's contaminated and then you further abuse it temperature - wise , then you 're at risk , " Donnelly said .
" In heat , low levels of contamination can just go really wild . "
That means not leaving groceries in a hot car for hours during other errands .
It also means changing doggy bag habits .
" Bacterial growth is time and temperature dependent " said Eileen Dykes of the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline .
Dykes recommends a time limit of two hours between meal to fridge transport , which is not always enough time " if you go to a restaurant and then get a doggy bag , and then go to a movie . "
Ignoring Smells , or Avoiding Fights
Watching a thermometer in the fridge and counting days on the calendar does far better for home food safety than searching for funny smells or sites of mold .
But that does n't mean those disgusting signs are useless .
Without a thermometer or a clue about the time since purchase , Donnelly says those signs of spoilage can help .
" Depend on those spoilage clues , " Donnelly said .
" Because it can mean that something else has been growing there . "
But mold is a different story .
Most mold that grows on bread or fruits is n't toxic , according to M. A. Cousin , a food microbiology and mold expert at Purdue University .
" But if somebody is allergic to mold , and you would inhale those molds , it may give them an adverse reaction , " Cousin said .
Otherwise , the allergy - free consumer can just cut a few inches past the mold and the allergy - free consumer will be fine .
" You have to realize that everyone 's perception of spoilage is not the same because all of us have different senses ; we do n't have the same taste , smell , or even see it the same way , " Cousin said .
" That 's why two people do n't always agree -- some people would eat it , other people wo n't . "

The world ’s greatest nation is surprisingly mediocre when it comes to playing the world ’s most popular sport .
It ’s not that they keep losing – far from it .
Americans have a winning mentality that automatically ensures that whatever team they put out will be competitive .
However , when it comes to genuine footballing talent , the US are found wanting .
Many people have blamed this in poor infrastructure , training methods and the short period of time that proper club football has been around in the US .
I disagree – these might be symptoms of a country that does n’t generate footballing talent but when you consider the sporting talent in general that the US has produced over the years it ’s clear that there ’s something else at hand here .
Personally , I put it down as a cultural issue – Americans by and large just do n’t care about football .
Sure , there are fans here and there , but compared to a nation like Spain or Italy , the US as a people do not value soccer , they do n’t respect the game and there ’s very little cultural love for it .
So here are 7 cultural reasons why Americans have no real talent for soccer :
1. No Hands
The most popular American sports – basketball , baseball , American football , ice hockey , golf – primarily involve the use of hands / upper body to compete in .
In fact , you could argue that feet are only for mobility ( only American football allows for kicking , and that too is best done long - range ) .
Now if you drop a sport like soccer – all feet , some head and no hands – it ’s like asking someone to walk on their hands instead of their feet .
It ’s not easy to switch around to compeletely different way of playing a sport .
This is the primary reason why when you see the MLS , the terms ‘ long - ball ’ and ‘ headless chicken ’ come to mind .
2. Ridiculous Name
Soccer ?
Seriously ?
The biggest obstacle to soccer ’s popularity in the US may well be its name .
You ca n’t have two sports by the same name , unless you want to see Eddie Johnson pick up the ball and then do his customary dash up the pitch and then look around all confused as opposition defenders pile up on him .
Soccer .
Sawker .
I feel dumber just saying it .
It ’s called football , and unless the American people learn to call it by it ’s real name ( come to think of it , Australians have their Australian Rules footy and they still call the beautiful game football ) , it ’s not going to be successful .
3. No Breaks
Who in the world thought of a 90 - minute game that only took one break , and that too after 45 minutes ?
The American public is used to a quick break every 5 minutes , if not sooner .
Basketball has its quarters .
Baseball has its regular breaks with batters coming in and going out .
American football is a stop - start game .
In golf you hit a ball a couple of hundred yards and then you walk towards it ( the game is a candidate for the most retarded sport ever award ) .
On the other hand , soccer has a natural ebb and flow to it that no American sport can match .
Americans have been bred on small , easily digestible segments of everything – sport , news , knowledge , etc .
It ’s a cultural effort to make low concentration levels a standard across the country .
It ’s also why the typical American watching soccer feels the inevitable urge to flip to another channel and watch commercials every 5 minutes .
This is why you see US goalkeepers do so well – they thrive in the stop - start nature of a goalie ’s involvement in the game .
4. They Hate It
They did n’t create it , and they ’re not very good at it .
Either one would have been enough to foster some passion for the sport , but since there are so many countries in the world that are better than the US at soccer , the American people have little interest .
And it makes sense too – why follow something in which your side keeps losing ?
After being subjected to a lifetime of doctored news and world views , this sudden brush with reality is overwhelming for the average American psyche and they do what any American would do when faced with something they do n’t know – they turn their back to it .
Ironically this disdain for soccer makes it more difficult for the sport to take off in the country – a vicious cycle .
5. No One Likes The Americans
Usually , when there ’s someone in your family who ’s not as good at a sport as you are , you tend to try and help them out so that they can get better and ( hopefully ) provide more of a challenge to you later on .
At least that ’s what I ’ve seen .
With the US though , the rest of the world is n’t so kind .
We ’ve made it acceptable to make fun of US soccer instead of going there and investing in the sport in America .
We ’ve made it acceptable to mock them instead of training them and coaching them .
That ’s why when someone like David Beckham – an excellent businessman – goes to the US to invest in soccer , the world laughs at him .
Would you laugh at Bill Gates if he invested in a new technology startup ?
People would scramble to get involved .
The world does n’t take Americans seriously , and soccer is worse off as a result .
6 . It ’s Illegal To Cheat
Did you know that American sports in general do not follow WADA rules ?
That the use of performance - enhancing drugs is not strictly regulated in US sports ?
The World Anti-Doping Agency has strict regulations that almost all sports adhere to , especially soccer with it ’s spot drug testing and what not .
American sports , on the other hand , play by their own rules , which is a nice way to say that American sports feature more drug abuse than more global sports .
In some cases , having a global authority making sure that you follow certain standards is a good thing .
But hey , what ’s the point of playing a sport when you ca n’t pump yourself with drugs to make you faster / stronger ?
If you ca n’t cheat , why play ?
7. No Cheerleaders
In all honesty this is where I agree with the Americans .
Soccer needs cheerleaders like one needs a glass of cold water on a hot day .
As we ’ve discussed before on Soccerlens , cheerleaders can stop hooliganism , provide suitable pitch - side ( or on - TV ) distractions when the game itself gets a little tedious and once you give each club their own cheerleading squad , there ’s a whole new set of rivalries to play upon for the advertisers .
Plus if there ’s no porn , how can a genuine American sports fan enjoy the game ?
Without cheerleaders soccer just is n’t manly enough .
It ’s blasphemous .
…
So there you have it – 7 reasons why American society is setup to undermine the soccer ’s success in the US .
Let us know what you think in the comments ( or on your blog ) .
There ’s a sign over the front desk in my hotel which reads as follows :
“ Non -Zimbabwean guests must pay their accomodation charges in foreign currency . ”
I ’ve been to several countries where it ’s been forbidden to denominate salaries or prices in a foreign currency – you had to pay in the local money , helping ensure that you did n’t end up with two parallel economies ( one in dollars or other “ hard currency ” and another in a local currency ) , leading to black market trades between the two .
But this sign reflects a much more dire reality .
Zimbabwe is desperately short of foreign currency , and their own currency is in an inflationary free fall – CNN reports an annual inflation rate of 1200 % .
For businesses like my hotel , which makes a lot of purchases abroad to feed guests and keep us in clean sheets , it ’s critical to have dollars on hand , since few vendors will accept payment in Zimbabwean dollars .
And it ’s hard to buy dollars , and probably impossible to buy them at the official exchange rates .
So the hotel needs me to pay them in dollars so they can buy the goods to run the hotel for the guests who pay in a currency that ’s losing its value every day .
There ’s another reason as well .
Since the hotel ca n’t be seen dealing with foreign exchange at black market rates , they are changing dollars at $ 250 Zim = $ 1 USD , less than half of the street rate .
This means that , to pay my $ 100 hotel bill , I could change a US $ 50 on the streetcorner , come back in with $ 27000 , pay my bill at the official rate and have change left over …
( In truth , the opposite happens .
The hotel charges me for breakfast in Zimbabwe dollars , then asks me to pay the bill in US dollars , doubling the real cost … )
All of this means that one of my goals for this trip is to leave Zimbabwe with as few Zimbabwean dollars as possible .
For one thing , they lose value by the day .
For another , they might expire before I come back .
I ’ve never seen currency with an expiration date on it before .
The bills I carry are , technically , “ Bearer Cheques ” .
They read :
“ Pay the bearer on demand Twenty Dollars on or before 31st July 2007 for the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe , Issue date 1st August 2006 . ”
In other words , good luck getting my $ 20 – ( about two and a half US cents at today ’s black market rate ) after August 2007 – the currency is technically worthless at that point .
( Friends tell me that previous currency marked like this has been “ extended ” by legislative act to maintain its worth . )
This currency looks temporary , too .
It ’s got one ink color ( as opposed to the multicolored fantasy of earlier bills ) and no security thread .
Given how much it costs to print money , how little the bills are worth , and how fast they ’ll become worthless , it seems no surprise that a government scrambling to make ends meet might cut some corners in the national mint .
Speaking of cutting , the major innovation in the recently issued bills is the removal of three zeros .
This means that the currency is trading at roughly 500:1 to the dollar , rather than 500000:1 , which can get a little awkward .
Reserve Bank chief Gideon Gono claims that the change was made because the size of the sums involved was beginning to break Zimbabwean banking software … but many speculate that the change was designed to distract people from the relentless pace of inflation .
Many folks still refer to the price of things in terms of how many million something costs .
It ’s taken me a while to mentally translate “ million ” as “ pound sterling ” , which is a rough equivalent .
Others seem to be having translation issues as well – banks have this helpful poster outside designed to let you convert from your millions to your thousands .
( Note the slogan : “ Zero to Hero ” )
( An old joke is that Mugabe had succeeded in making all Zimbabweans into millionaires , since that illustrious status used to involve having more than $ 2 USD .
The ugliness of the joke – unless something changes , lots of Zimbabweans will find themselves millionares again soon . )
Even with a big , thick stack of funny money , you ’ll have a hard time buying petrol in Harare .
Most stations have signs out from that say “ Direct Fuel Import Refuelling ONLY ” .
That translates as “ we do n’t accept Zimbabwean currency ” .
To legally purchase fuel , your best bet is to visit a site like Mukuru.com and purchase fuel vouchers using dollars or pounds .
You end up receiving a digital voucher , which you can trade in for a quantity of fuel coupons from the Mukuru office in Zimbabwe , which you can then turn into fuel at stations , 20 liters at a time .
What you ’re doing – technically – is importing fuel from abroad for your own use , not paying for fuel in Zimbabwe with foreign currency , which would be illegal – hence , “ Direct Fuel Import ” .
And if you do n’t have internet access and foreign currency to buy petrol ?
You buy black market petrol from the back side of the petrol station , paying a sharp premium to the vendor for his willingness to break the law .
Legal petrol is 52 pence a liter , 50 pence in large quantities – close to $ 2 USD a liter .
Bottled water is only slightly less expensive , at $ 1.50 a liter .
This , I suppose , is only fair – bottled water is a commodity bought mostly by tourists and the wealthy .
But it ’s odd to spend more for two liters of water than for lunch .
I ’m considering brushing my teeth with beer instead which is , thankfully , about half the cost of bottled water .
My friends tell me that prices of all goods change rapidly – which is to be expected , when the currency is halving in value over the course of a month .
I got a taste of this at the psuedo - Texan steakhouse I made the error of having dinner in last night .
The menus were glossy and professionally printed … but lacked prices .
The prices were printed on a separate sheet of paper , xerox ’ed and placed in a laminate folder .
I ’d expected prices to have been scratched out on menus – the decision to print without prices at all seems like a reflection on a state used to the notion that their currency is in free fall and wo n’t be landing any time soon .
( This proved to be true at every restaurant I visited , save the South African Steers chain across the street from my hotel , including room service in the hotel .
It ’s a bit like being the guest at a fancy restaurant – pick what you want and try not to worry about the cost . )
To review – signs that your economy is in trouble include :
– You ca n’t use your own money to purchase essential goods and services .
– Critical goods , like petrol , can be purchased by average citizens only if they ’re willing to break the law .
– Prices change so fast it ’s not worth printing them .
– Your currency includes an expiration date , and may well be worthless before that date .
And it ’s probably not good news if you ’re brushing your teeth with beer , either .
Cathy Buckle ’s August Letters from Zimbabwe includes some powerful and important reflections on the currency situation .
This post is part of the Holiday in Harare series .
As Hurricane Dolly batters the coasts of Texas and Mexico , it 's not the whipping winds that residents should be most worried about .
It 's the water .
Storm surge accounts for the majority of hurricane - related deaths .
As history and studies of severe weather have shown , storm surge and torrential rains can wreak havoc on coastal communities ; the power of water , along with the suddenness with which floods can happen , often catches people by surprise , with potentially devastating consequences .
Flooding , which can result from both torrential rains and the ocean surf a storm can push ashore , is what officials in Texas were most concerned about after Dolly made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane at 9 am EDT on Wednesday .
Residents of the Rio Grande Valley have been warned of potential severe flooding and possible levee breaks .
The National Hurricane Center predicted that Dolly could drop a total of 6 to 10 inches ( 15 to 25 centimeters ) of rainfall in the next few days , with some isolated spots potentially getting soaked by up to 15 inches .
When an area receives such a large amount of rain in a short period of time , it can cause flash flooding .
As the name implies , these floods can happen suddenly , with water rising several feet in a matter of minutes and taking unsuspecting communities by surprise .
On average over the last 30 years , more people have died as a result of flooding than from lightning , tornadoes or hurricanes , according to the National Weather Service .
And almost half of all fatalities that result from flash flooding are vehicle - related , as rapidly rising waters can quickly inundate roads .
Many drivers try to cross the water , only to be swept away in the current — it only takes about 2 feet of water to float a car , and 500 pounds of force pushes on a car for each foot of water rise , according the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
Pedestrians fare no better :
Six inches of fast - moving water can knock a person off their feet .
Not to mention the debris that can be carried along by the floods , which can often tear down trees and roll boulders .
Flash floods typically occur when a slow - moving thunderstorm or large storms such as a tropical storm or hurricane pelt an area with rain so fast that the ground can't soak all the water up .
Flooding can be particularly bad in urban areas , because roads and parking lots do n't soak up as much water as soil might , turning streets into rivers .
( An intense thunderstorm that dumped 1.5 inches of rain over Manhattan in just one hour in August of 2007 flooded the subway system and several stations , crippling the city for several hours . )
Another watery force , storm surge , is viewed as the most destructive part of a hurricane .
Storm surge can build for hours before a hurricane makes landfall as the storm 's winds push against the ocean and cause the water to pile up higher than the sea 's usual level .
As the hurricane makes landfall , the water is pushed onshore and can quickly wash many miles inland , destroying homes and businesses .
The storm surge from Hurricane Katrina , for example , was estimated to have reached heights of 24 to 28 feet ( 7 to 8.5 meters ) along a 20 - mile swath of the Gulf Coast and washed up to 12 miles inland , devastating the Mississippi coast .
The National Weather Service warned coastal residents of Texas that storm surges of 4 to 6 feet above normal tide level could inundate the coast north of the center of the storm and that the storm would bring with it " dangerous battering waves . "
While Dolly is unlikely to be the disaster that Katrina was , officials are still warning residents of low - lying areas to stay in shelters , out of the way of floods and storm surge .
It ’s an age old question – which came first ?
The chicken or the egg ?
This could very well be the same sort of question future historians could be asking when they look back to the period when social media and the tools to use it became an integral part of our society .
Was it the people who dragged the corporations into a more social world or was it the corporations who brought the people into a more social world ?
As a basic – very basic – primer for those who might be confused about what social media is it is the concept of creating a level playing field for everyone within our world by utilizing the Internet as the method by which people can talk with others regardless of economic , gender or geographical differences and achieve change within our society .
Lately though this has also moved to include more and more the companies that are also a part of our society .
While traditionally one would consider the companies most interested in this would be those that require the Web in order to have an economic base , but more and more we are seeing non-Web , or as some one say – the brick and mortar establishments , companies stepping into the social media world .
The commonly held belief is that it is the people – the crowd – that is the driving force behind the growth of this idea called social media .
While much of this crowd might currently be the folks called early adopters the fact is that social media tools like Twitter and Plurk are making that crossover into the mainstream of Web users .
At this point much of the traffic is being driven by the early adopters who have been using services like Twitter since it started but slowly more and more regular Web users are discovering it – and others .
As well , corporations are dipping their toes into this new social media sea ; therein lies the one thing that could really push social media beyond just being a niche sector .
While corporations are thought more of being entities that accept change or new things slower than molasses , they are made up of some very intelligent people .
People who know very well the power of networking .
After all most of them probably owe their jobs to the pre-Web business networking that has gone on for a very long time .
For them this idea of not just networking with their associates but also their current and potential customer base in near real time is an incredibly powerful idea .
It wo n’t be an easy road forward for these corporate early adopters but they are deft at playing those corporate games that are needed to be played in order to get new ideas tried out .
It is almost inevitable that as more people within these environments become engaged with using social media tools like GetSatisfaction and Twitter on behalf of corporations the more acceptable will be the idea of their wide spread use become .
One of the companies that I reached out to find out some how’s and why ’s of their Twitter use was Laplink and even though they are new to this , Krystle Sivorot , their Marketing Communications Associate answered a few questions for me .
From her email reply I found that the decision for Laplink to step into the social media sector using Twitter was one that came from one of their managers and on of their employees .
The upper management of the company is very excited about the project and the potential for it to bring new things to the company .
I believe this is the common feeling among the corporations that are beginning to include social media as a part of their everyday operations with both other corporations , employees and their customers .
While the advocates might like to believe that this is because these corporations have seen the light of social media , I think that there is also a much more down to earth reasoning as well that should be taken into consideration .
It ’s called economics .
When it really comes down to it corporations will do something if it make a difference to their bottom line and shareholder returns .
One has to consider the amounts of money that corporations must be paying out in a year to public relation firms and maintain in some cases their own in - house PR departments .
For them if a smaller team of people can do as good as job ; or better , than what their current methods are and for less money then it makes sense to use these new tools .
After all who does a company want representing it to their customers ?
Some faceless cold spin doctoring PR firm or people who are passionate about the company they are working for and the products they are selling .
So once the economics and a better rapport with their customers is shown to be better using these social media tools it is a very short step to it becoming a common practice for corporations to setup these small but highly effective teams of company social mediaists .
Once this happens and people start hearing about this new way to interact with the companies whose products they buy they will go looking for these social media tools like Twitter .
They will ask their friends – they will tell their friends .
At this point the snowball is definitely started the roll downhill .
It might be easy to believe that it is the people that are driving the momentum of social media but really those of us in the field of watching these things can have a narrow perspective – even though we might not like to think so .
In the real world of the everyday computer user it is their friends who influence them the most and if their friends are the ones telling them about this cool way to deal with companies that is who they will be listening to – not us .
As such it is those companies who do listen and learn from the early adopters that will be the one ’s really spreading the word by their example of doing .
In this case what really would be the answer to the question ?
Is the the companies pulling us forward or is it us doing the pulling ?
Hundreds have fled to Georgia rather than accept a new life as Russians .
" Georgian residents have been given no choice but to take Russian documents that have been sent in with freshly printed details , lacking only a photograph , which can be inserted on the ground , " said Shota Utiashvili , a spokesman for Georgian 's Interior Ministry .
" They are fleeing instead , and as they leave they have been told they can't come back . "
Today 's vote in the Senate approving FISA legislation was a huge blow to our country , our Constitution and our rule of law .
Twenty - six Democrats stayed true to democratic principles and voted against the bill , which grants immunity to telecommunication companies who betrayed the American people by illegally spying on our communications without warrants .

One of the Democrats who voted correctly today was Senator Russ Feingold , who appeared on Wednesday 's Countdown with Rachel Maddow .
Feingold has long been a staunch advocate for following the Constitution , speaking out against President Bush 's illegal wiretapping program and fighting and voting against the anti-American Patriot Act .
Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama voted for the FISA legislation , and while Feingold says there is hope that as president , Obama could change the unconstitutional aspects of the bill , it was still " the wrong vote . "
WASHINGTON — A bitter personal struggle between two powerful figures in the world of terrorism has broken out , forcing their followers to choose sides .
This battle is not being fought in the rugged no man ’s land on the Pakistan - Afghan border .
It is a contest reverberating inside the Beltway between two of America ’s leading theorists on terrorism and how to fight it , two men who hold opposing views on the very nature of the threat .
On one side is Bruce Hoffman , a cerebral 53 - year - old Georgetown University historian and author of the highly respected 1998 book “ Inside Terrorism . ”
He argues that Al Qaeda is alive , well , resurgent and more dangerous than it has been in several years .
In his corner , he said , is a battalion of mainstream academics and a National Intelligence Estimate issued last summer warning that Al Qaeda had reconstituted in Pakistan .
On the other side is Marc Sageman , an iconoclastic 55 - year - old Polish - born psychiatrist , sociologist , former C.I.A. case officer and scholar - in - residence with the New York Police Department .
His new book , “ Leaderless Jihad , ” argues that the main threat no longer comes from the organization called Al Qaeda , but from the bottom up  from radicalized individuals and groups who meet and plot in their neighborhoods and on the Internet .
In his camp , he said , are agents and analysts in highly classified positions at the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation .
If Dr. Hoffman gets inside organizations  focusing on command structures  Dr. Sageman gets inside heads , analyzing the terrorist mind - set .
But this is more important than just a battle of ideas .
It is the latest twist in the contest for influence and resources in Washington that has been a central feature of the struggle against terrorism since Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Python has been enjoying a tremendous rise in popularity recently .
At the beginning of the year Python became TIOBE 's language of the Year ( for 2007 ) , surpassing Perl and making it the 6th most popular language .
Then , Django started to gain prominence , followed shortly after by the release of Google 's AppEngine , which features Python technology .
Today , Python got a further boost with two announcements from Sun that strengthen their support of the language .
Dynamic Languages & Tools Architect Ted Leung and Jython Project Lead Frank Wierzbicki announced that future releases of NetBeans will support Python and Jython .
A detailed list of planned features is available on the nbPython project page , and includes : Syntax highlighting with version support , Code Completion , Python / Jython support , PyUnit support , Debugger support , Python library manager , Bundled Jython Package and Execution of python scripts .
Ted notes :
One of the obvious things that Sun could do in the Python world is to make Python a supported language in the NetBeans IDE .
Netbeans has really nice support for Ruby and Javascript , so why should Python be left out ?
So today Sun is announcing that a future version of NetBeans will provide support for Python .
We are not announcing which release of NetBeans that will be because we are taking an unconventional ( at least for NetBeans ) path towards providing that support .
Before Frank Wierzbicki and I were even hired by Sun to work on Python and Jython , Allan Davis , a member of the NetBeans community , decided to start implementing support for Python in NetBeans in a project called NBPython .
What we ’ve decided to do is to work together with Allan and the rest of the NBPython community to produce a high quality Python plugin for NetBeans .
The follow on announcement is around the opening of a Python zone at the Sun Developer Network :
The new Python Developer Center is your connection for downloads , community , libraries , documents , and frameworks for developing web applications with the Python programming language and Jython , its implementation for the Java platform .
Sun has proven that Netbeans is a viable IDE for languages other than Java , however it will be interesting to see how they will fare against established Python IDEs such as Komodo , Wing , and the PyDev Eclipse plugin .
If they can do for Django what they did for Rails , it will be Game On !
WNBA Signs Nancy Lieberman at Age 50
Way to go !
WNBA team The Detroit Shock have signed the athlete to a 7 day contract .
Lieberman will be the oldest player in the organization at the young age of 50 .
Nancy is currently a ESPN broadcaster and was inducted into the Hall of Fame back in 1999 .
Coach Bill Laimbeer noticed her talents last year at an All Star Game and hoped that at some point he would have the opportunity to sign her for a 7 day contract .
He recently lost forward Cheryl Ford for the rest of the season with a torn ACL .
This all comes just after the WNBA brawl on the court Tuesday night when Detroit Shock was playing LA Sparks .
The team is likely to lose other players temporarily to suspensions stemming from the free - for - all .
Watch the fight here .

A letter ( pdf ) from House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Cali . ) states that there may be " potentially thousands of criminal cases involving fraudulent contracts in Iraq . "
Chairman Waxman 's letter to Pentagon Inspector General Claude Kicklighter is based on an audit by the DoD IG that found that 4 % of 702 transactions examined in a sample worth $ 1.5 billion " appeared to involve criminal misuse of taxpayer funds . "
Waxman 's staff extrapolated this to the entire pool of 180,000 transactions .
Thus , " there may be more than 7,000 potential criminal cases involving more than $ 190 million in federal spending that have not been identified . "
He added , " This is an astounding amount of potential criminal fraud . "
Waxman requests that the DoD IG spend further resources and dig in to find and prosecute the full extent of the actual fraud .
However , unless the DoD IG , Army Criminal Investigation Command and others are fully staffed and empowered to pursue procurement fraud , Waxman 's request may be impossible to fully achieve .

It ’s no secret around here that I believe Pixar is not only the best animated movie studio in the film business today , but also the best movie studio period .
They are a perfect 9 for 9 with their films … not only big box office success , not only big critical success , but also huge audience success .
This company squats and craps out excellence with everything they do … and now they ’ve given us the best film of 2008 ( thus far ) in Wall - E
But an interesting discussion broke out the other day when one commenter asked why Pixar just makes little kid movies .
Why not make movies for adults ?
This got me thinking a little bit about the nature of the movies that Pixar has done in the past and continue doing right through to today .
My conclusion was this :
PIXAR DOES NOT MAKE LITTLE KID MOVIES .
THEY MAKE MOVIES THAT ARE KID FRIENDLY .
Now I understand that on the surface this looks like little more than a mere issue of minor semantics .
But if you look more closely you ’ll see there is actually a world of difference in both style and substance between the two and the end result are VERY different movies .
There are many 3D animated films that are specifically kid movies .
Films like “ Kung Fu Panda ” , “ Madagascar ” , clearly “ Madagascar 2 ” , “ Robots ” , “ Shark Tale ” , “ Shrek ” and so on and so forth .
Films like these ( and many others like them ) are writen , produced and completely geared toward entertaining children , and there ’s nothing wrong with that philosophy in and of itself if they ’re done well .
Oh sure , sometimes they ’ll throw in the odd pop cultural reference that will fly over kids heads and is aimed at the adults … but the themes and language ( both visual and verbal ) and style are conceived of and aimed at kids .
They are Kids Movies .
But then there ’s is Pixar .
Yes , Pixar does have some excellent “ Kids Movies ” on it ’s impressive resume like “ Bugs Life ” , “ Toy Story ” and to a certain degree “ Monsters Inc ” .
But then a shift became visible that we say elements of in Toy Story 2 , and when “ Finding Nemo ” came out a full fledged new philosophy in Pixar ’s creative workflow because evident .
Pixar was no longer just making Kid Movies .
They were making films for everyone that were made in such a way to also be very kid friendly .
The entertainment of the kid was no longer the guiding principle … but rather making a universal movie for everyone to experience and enjoy while keeping the kids engaged and entertained at the same time .
It ’s not an easy task , but it ’s one that Pixar has mastered and is more than just a semantical variant .
FINDING NEMO
Themes of fatherhood .
Life lived in precaution due to tragic loss and the notions of wanting to shelter your child and the desperation of both fear and action when your child is at risk .
THE INCREDIBLES
A slightly past middle aged man reflecting on former glories … but also former potential .
Finding himself in a life and life style you never would have pictured .
Struggling to understand the balance between the importance of self - actualization , and the responsibility and joy in sacrificing personal goals and ambitions for family , children and marriage .
CARS
The decay of the classic and traditional small town America .
Issues of modernization inadvertently replacing the fabrics of small town values and senses of community .
The loss of the journey to the expedience of the destination .
RATATOUILLE
Standard themes of pursuing dreams are mixed in with issues of breaking out of expectation .
Facing generations old biases and preconceptions , learn hatreds and expectations while trying to overcome them with a wider world view by stopping looking at the problem on a race or national ( or in this case species ) level and looking at individuals on a personal level instead .
WALL-E
The obvious themes of Environmentalism are also layered with warnings of a society developing an over reliance on technology and a less and less social population that engages more with the digital than with real life human beings
Films such as these can not be equated with films like “ Madagascar ” and just lumped in as if they were made with the same purpose and the same audience … because they are n’t .
One is a kids movies … the others are kid friendly .
One type is specifically made for and aimed at kids … the other has a main message that is aimed at adults , but made in such a way that the experience is still a great one for kids .
Suddenly red ink flows from my pen .
Startled , I assume it is blood , but then realize it is the color of the moon ...

When you 're doing Ajax - based validation on a text input control , you really do n't want your data calls firing off at every keyup event as this will put unnecessary load on your server .
Instead , the thing to do is to wait a little while after the user 's last key release to see if she 's stopped typing before firing off a request .
I 'm sure that there are hundreds of code snippets lying about for doing just this , and that JQuery probably already has something built in or a plugin for it , but a quick Google search did n't turn up anything for me so here I am , sharing my simple solution for delayed Ajax validation in JavaScript .
// A simple mechanism to handle delayed validation based on keyboard entry .
// Copyright ( c ) 2008 , Aral Balkan , All Rights Reserved . //
Released under the MIT license .
validationFunctionRefs = [ ] ; timers = [ ] ; function callAfterDelay ( fnRef , duration ) { //
Check if a timer for this validation function is already in effect // and reset it if it is .
for ( i = 0 ; i < validationFunctionRefs.length ; i++) { fnToCheck = validationFunctionRefs[i ] ; if ( fnToCheck == fnRef ) { timer = timers [ i ] ; clearInterval ( timer ) ; timers.splice( i,1 ) ; validationFunctionRefs.splice( i,1 ) ; break ; } } timer = setTimeout ( fnRef , duration ) ; timers.push ( timer ) ; validationFunctionRefs.push ( fnRef ) ; return timer }
To use it , simply call callAfterDelay from your event handler for the keyup event .
e.g. , in JQuery :
$ (" #id_vat_no " ) .keyup( function () {callAfterDelay(checkVatNumber , 500 ) } )
Deputy Assembly Speaker Neil Cohen is being investigated for alleged possession of child pornography , according to two of his Democratic colleagues who said they brought the matter to the attention of law enforcement .
In a joint statement , Sen. Raymond Lesniak and Assemblyman Joseph Cryan ( both D - Union ) confirmed they alerted authorities to the possibility Cohen ( D - Union ) had child pornography on his computers .
" As the facts became apparent in our office , we notified the appropriate agency and will continue to assist in any way possible , " Lesniak and Cryan said .
" While it was our proactive steps that led to the investigation to this point , we are appalled at what has transpired .
" At least one of Cohen 's computers from the Union Township legislative office the three lawmakers share was confiscated by the Attorney General 's Office , according to three sources who have been briefed on the investigation .
Two of the sources said a legislative staffer initially discovered the images , then notified Lesniak and Cryan .
The sources declined to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation .
" Both of us have known Neil Cohen for more than two decades , " Lesniak and Cryan said .
" We know him as a compassionate , caring individual but if the allegations prove true , clearly there was a side to him neither of us knew .
We have been instructed to not make any further comments regarding this very serious matter . "
Sources said Cohen was under psychiatric care Thursday night .
He could not be reached for comment .
Assembly Democratic spokesman Derek Roseman declined to comment .
Attorney General Anne Milgram and spokesman David Wald did not return phone messages .
Cohen , 57 , is in his 17th year in the Assembly , having served from 1990 to 1991 and continuously since 1994 .
He chairs the Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee and is one of seven deputy speakers .
He also is a long - time member of the Legislature 's Joint Committee on Ethical Standards .
Lesniak and Cryan reported the Cohen matter to authorities on Monday .
" We have been in constant touch with the appropriate authorities throughout the situation and will continue to follow the Office of Legislative Services guidelines and counsel in this matter , " Lesniak and Cryan said .
A law enforcement source said material seized from the raid of Cohen 's office has been turned over the State Police Official Corruption Unit .
The source , who declined to be identified because he was not permitted to speak publicly about the case , said the State Police have not yet looked at any of the evidence .
Cohen practices law in Montclair with Sen. Nia Gill ( D - Essex ) .
Among the more than 100 laws Cohen has sponsored is one that created a 24 - hour hotline for members of the public to report computer crimes , including child pornography .
He also co-sponsored a law that retroactively removed immunity from churches , schools and other charities that negligently hire employees who sexually abuse children .
He also supported measures to support stem cell research , provide health insurance for mammograms , restrict strip searches and expand eligibility for the Pharmaceutical Assistance for the Aged and Disabled program .
He was one of the leaders last year of the effort to save the life of Congo , a German Shepherd condemned as a vicious dog after mauling a landscaper .
Congo was spared for that incident only to be destroyed by his owners last month after attacking a family member .
Cohen 's measure to provide greater protections to dogs accused of being vicious , dubbed " Congo 's Law , " is still pending .
Word of the development spread quickly through Cohen 's district .
Roselle Mayor Garrett Smith , a Democrat but longtime opponent of Cohen and his supporters in the Union County Democratic organization , said , " My phone started ringing off the hook .
I hit the floor when I heard the news .
I 'm speechless .
It 's incredible -- if it 's true .
I do n't know what to think . "
" I know he 's kind of like a loner ... but I 've had no indication of anything like that , " Smith said .
Third Ward Councilwoman Cecilia Dallis Ricks , a former Board of Education member , local Girl Scout leader and longtime Cohen supporter , was " totally shocked . "
Prior to his election to the Legislature , Cohen served as a Union County freeholder from 1988 to 1990 .
He was the Union County Democratic Chairman during 1991 and 1992 .
Cohen , who is not married , graduated from Athens University in Alabama and Howard University School of Law in Washington , D.C. After a clerkship with a Superior Court judge , he began his legal career as a trial lawyer in the Middlesex County Public Defender 's Office .
" Let me just give you one statement .
This is how I feel .
I have nothing but respect for Neil .
I have no comment on any of the accusations , " said Gleshia Givens , his chief of staff .

" Patch of Grass " was painted by Van Gogh in Paris in 1887 .
Behind the painting is a portrait of a woman .
A previously unknown portrait of a woman by Vincent van Gogh has been revealed in a high - tech look beneath another of his paintings , it was announced today .
Scientists used a new technique to peer beneath the paint of van Gogh 's " Patch of Grass . "
Already it was known there was something there , likely a portrait of some sort .
Van Gogh was known to paint over his work , perhaps as much as a third of the time .
Behind the painting , done mostly in greens and blues , is a portrait of a woman rendered in browns and reds .
The new technique is based on " synchrotron radiation induced X - ray fluorescence spectroscopy " and is said to be an improvement on X - ray radiography , which has been used to reveal concealed layers of other famous paintings .
The new method measures chemicals in the pigments .
Specifically , mercury and the element antimony were useful in revealing the woman 's face .
The work was done by researchers at Delft University of Technology in the the Netherlands and the University of Antwerp in Belgium , along with help from other institutions .
" Patch of Grass " was painted by van Gogh in Paris in 1887 and is owned by the Kröller - Müller Museum .
The reconstruction enables art historians to understand the evolution of van Gogh ’s work better , the researchers said in a statement .
And the new technique is expected to pave the way for research into many other concealed paintings .
The Dynamic Tower will constantly change its shape
The world 's first moving building , an 80 - storey tower with revolving floors giving a shifting shape , will be built in Dubai , its architect says .
The Dynamic Tower design is made up of 80 pre-fabricated apartments which will spin independently of one another .
" It 's the first building that rotates , moves , and changes shape , " said architect David Fisher , who is Italian , at a news conference in New York .
" This building never looks the same , not once in a lifetime , " he added .
The 420 - metre ( 1,378 - foot ) building 's apartments would spin a full 360 degrees , at voice command , around a central column by means of 79 giant power - generating wind turbines located between each floor .

The slender building would be energy self - sufficient as the turbines would produce enough electricity to power the entire building and even feed extra power back into the grid , said the Italian architect at the unveiling of the project in New York .
The apartments , which will take between one and three hours to make a complete rotation , will cost from $ 3.7 m to $ 36 m .
There are also plans to build a similar , 70 - storey skyscraper in Moscow .
" I call these buildings designed by time , shaped by life , " said the Florence - based architect , who has never built a sky - scraper before .
" These buildings will open our vision all around , to a new life . "
The skyscraper will cost an estimated $ 700 m to build and should be up and running in Dubai in 2010 .

Following a survey of ownership carried out in the late 1960s , ownership of the totality of the walls was vested in 1973 in the Spanish State , through the Ministry of Education and Science .
It was transferred to the Xunta de Galicia by Royal Decree in 1994 .
The Spanish Constitution reserves certain rights in relation to the heritage to the central government .
However , these are delegated to the competent agencies in the Autonomous Communities , in this case the Xunta de Galicia .
For the Lugo walls the Xunta is in the position of both owner and competent agency .
Under the Galician Heritage Law the Xunta is required to cooperate with the municipal authorities in ensuring the protection and conservation of listed monuments , and certain functions are delegated down to them .
The Xunta operates through its General Directorate of Cultural Heritage ( Dirección General de Patrimonio Cultural ) , based in Santiago de Compostela .
The Master Plan for the Conservation and Restoration of the Roman Walls of Lugo ( 1992 ) covered proposals for actions to be taken in respect of research and techniques of restoration .
This was followed in 1997 by the Special Plan for the Protection and Internal Reform of the Fortified Enceinte of the Town of Lugo , which is concerned principally with the urban environment of the historic town .
However , it has a direct impact on the protection afforded to the walls , in terms of traffic planning , the creation of open spaces , and regulation of building heights .
Another planning instrument which affects the walls is the Special Plan for the Protection of the Miño [ river ] , approved by the municipality at the beginning of 1998 .
There is at the present time no management plan sensu stricto for the walls in operation in Lugo : work is continuing on the basis of the 1992 plan .
Nor is there a technical unit specifically responsible for the conservation and restoration of the walls .
It is against this background that serious consideration is being given to the creation of an independent foundation , under royal patronage and with representatives from government , academic , voluntary , and business institutions , to work with the General Directorate of Cultural Heritage of Galicia .
The work plan of this body would include the development and implementation of integrated conservation , restoration , and maintenance programmes .
The WH area is managed directly by the Divisional Forest Officer from the Forest Dept .
A national steering Committee co-ordinates institutions for Sinharaja as a National Wilderness Area , Biosphere Reserve ( 1988 ) , and WH site .
There are two management plans , prepared in 1985 / 86 and 1992/94 , which emphasise conservation , scientific research , buffer zone management , benefit - sharing , and community participation .
The “ Hadrian ’s Wall ” which was previously inscribed on the World Heritage List , is part of the transnational property “ Frontiers of the Roman Empire ” .

News in Sunsport today , from the man himself , and it ’s tragic and terrible news as Bobby Robson says he is losing his fifth bout with cancer .
Â Sir Bobby Robson – standing next to his statue at St. James ’
Park
Bobby talked to SunSport :
â€ œI have accepted what they have told me and I am determined to make the most of what time I have left .
I have been fortunate to survive this long .
It is thanks to my doctors and their dedication .
â€ â€ œMy condition is described as static and has not altered since my last bout of chemotherapy .â€ â€ œThey have arrested the growth of the tumours on my lungs and I have my next scan shortly .
â€ â€ œI am going to die sooner rather than later .
But then everyone has to go sometime and I have enjoyed every minute .
â€ Â â€ œI donâ€™t even think about it and my biggest problem today was unrelated , just old - fashioned laryngitis.â€ 
As usual Bobby is down to earth , and as usual he is upbeat about things , even though the news is not good .
Bobby has had problems with cancer for over 17 years , but you wo n’t find the man pitying himself .
Rather he is out and about , and touching everyone he can with his warmth and enthusiasm for football – and life .
Bobby donated a Â £ 500,000 cheque yesterday on behalf of the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation for a new dedicated cancer research center in Newcastle .
Bobby added :
â€ œI am not going to sit around at home thinking about what might or might not happen.â€ Â Â â€ œI have always found it difficult to turn down good causes and invitations from people I know .â€ â€ œMy family and close friends have always said I should say â€ ˜Noâ€™ more often and now is no different .
â€ â€œ
It has been a hectic summer .
I have watched a couple of days of Wimbledon , several days of Test cricket and Durham county cricket .â€ 
“ I had my own celebrity golf tournament in Portugal and managed to enjoy a few days holiday afterwards before returning to London , where I was honored by the Football League Managers Association .â€ â€ œThey not only inducted me into their Hall of Fame with a host of celebrities but it was at a special dinner , the first of its kind.â€ 
Bobby is , and has been one of our favorite people in football for a long long time .
He is also one of our favorite people because of his warmth , enthusiasm and undying enthusiasm for life and for football .
When he did finally manage to take over Newcastle United for his dream job , he did a fantastic job , and in his first season – which may well be his best management ever , he took over a Newcastle side rooted at the bottom of the league and got us 52 points that seasonÂ in 1999 - 2000 .
And in his first home game of course , we famously demolished our looming relegation partner Sheffield Wednesday 8 - 0 – with 5 goals from Alan Shearer .
He never really got the credit he deserved at Newcastle , where he had us in The Champions League , and the club has been struggling ever since he left in August , 2004 .
Bobby Robson is a legend in football , but his greatest accomplishment is that he is a tremendous and inspiring person with charm , charisma and passion – and that above all is what we ’ll always remember about Bobby Robson .
He is an inspiration to us all .

" It is the continuing decline in faith in the politicization of society that has , for well over a year , made the 2008 presidential race the preoccupation of the mainstream media .
The media must continue to advertise the products and services of the establishment owners , just as it does for the sellers of prescription drugs and other nostrums .
Still , the outcome of the 2008 election will confirm the truth of the proposition that it really does n't matter for whom you vote .
Regardless of whether Obama or McCain prevails , the government will be re-elected , and will continue to increase its powers over you .
Should you remain dissatisfied with the behavior of the system , the media will be right back to begin its campaign on behalf of ' Election 2010 , ' urging you , once again , to continue supporting the process that continues to frustrate your expectations .
In the words of Emma Goldman , 'if voting changed anything , they 'd make it illegal . '''
~ Butler Shaffer from the LewRockwell.com Blog
There are some questions that tend to recur whenever one talks to almost anyone outside the realm of radical libertarianism .
Actually , these questions seem to recur not only in debates with statists , but also in debates among those who share a radical libertarian , i.e. , market anarchistic , point of view .
One such question is the sanctity of the democratic process , voting and all that .
Is voting a necessity for a free society or simply busy - work for the unwashed proletariat , completed while the rulers continue to do what they 've always done ?
Russell Langcore 's recent column reminded me that this question has , thankfully , pretty much been decided among radial libertarians .
However , he also reminded me of a couple of issues that almost always come to the fore when one discusses voting .
A Really Short Answer for a Relatively Short Question
Here 's the question : Do I vote ?
Here 's the answer : No .
While some folks would argue that he's no philosopher , I 'll still take George Carlin 's argument on non-voting as excellent justification .
( I realize that I may be in the minority on that . )
I cannot think of a single scenario whereby I might vote in a national election such as that for president .
Not one .
I do n't care who the candidate is .
I do n't care what issues to which he seems to gravitate .
I do n't care about his record , his leadership qualities , the apparent first - lady - ness of his wife ( or her husband ) , his insider - ness or his outsider - ness , his race , his height , his weight , how well he speaks , how wonderfully he photographs , the nation of his birth , how likely it might be that he 's fun to drink with , or his appreciation for unique uses for a fine cigar .
More importantly though , given two other observations , voting strikes me as an incredible waste of time for anyone who is ultimately interested in two rather vital issues : personal liberty and personal responsibility .
First of all , under the U.S. " first - past - the - post " electoral system , one is assured of only two viable parties .
Secondly , with the use of a secret ballot , one is assured that no one will assume personal responsibility for the actions of their ostensible candidate or his party .
Every voter is automatically absolved for doing that which his vote suggests that he is doing : selecting the implementer of the policies he supports .
When I say the U.S. system guarantees only two viable parties , I 'm simply citing Duverger 's Law .
While there may remain debates about whether or not there are exceptions to Duverger 's Law , the U.S. system seems not to be one .
( This is a striking irony given how rarely the resulting pseudo - kings obey any laws after they are elected ! )
When I say that there will be no responsibility for the action of either party , I am referring to two other phenomena .
One , the inherent incentives of a coercive state virtually assure that only those who ascribe to either megalomania or theft - is - good as a paradigm will survive the electoral process .
The overwhelming bulk of the money necessary to elect a candidate is given with ' strings ' attached to it .
Lobbying is widespread because it works .
But much more importantly , everyone who contributes to a candidate hopes that their candidate will enact their version of control over everyone else , and everyone knows it !
There is no other alternative for a coercive state .
Two , people who vote are quick to distance themselves from the guy to whom they gave their support .
It seems to me that if your candidate lies , cheats , steals , or gets a whole bunch of people killed , you -- the voter who supported him -- might share some blame .
( I also realize that with the amount of graft in the U.S. , even if no one voted , the ' elected ' cretins would probably still find a way to keep spending money and killing people . )
With the secret ballot , everyone can claim to be disappointed with the guy they actually helped elect !
Becoming president is a viable quest only for those too stupid to know better or too smart to not realize the availability of responsibility - free power and plentiful stolen cash to the holder of the office and all his friends .
Notice I said ' viable ' quest .
There may be those who would use the incredible power of the office for good .
Frankly though , I rather think the Presidency of the United States is rather like the One Ring from Tolkien 's classics .
It eventually corrupts all who possess it , even if they were initially pure of heart .
I wo n't comment on my own cynicism regarding the existence of any such person .
Let 's just say that 40 - plus unrepentant rights infringers and counting is enough evidence for me .
Conclusion
While I have conveyed my view , better erudition than mine is available .
There is a plethora of non-voting -- both pro and con--and general free market prose already out there .
A rather awe - inspiring ( although still somewhat incomplete ) bibliography in testament to that fact , put together by Johan Ridenfeldt , with some additions from yours truly and others , may be found below .

While musing over yesterday ’s post on the use of psychological language as a form of a magician ’s misdirection , I remembered Dennett ’s 2003 article [ pdf ] on consciousness where he uses exactly this as a metaphor for why consciousness does n’t exist as some scientists think it does .
Dennett argues that the ‘ hard problem ‘ is a red herring – the whole question of how conscious first person experience arises from the biological function of the brain assumes that consciousness is a single thing that needs explaining .
He suggests that there is n’t a single thing that is consciousness , just a collection of mental components , but the fact we ’ve named it as a single thing fools us .
In his article Explaining the “ Magic ” of Consciousness , he gives a great analogy of how the use of the word ‘ the’ was used in a card trick to make it seem completely mysterious even to fellow professional magicians .
The tempting idea that there is a Hard Problem is simply a mistake .
I can not prove this .
Or , better , even if I can prove this , my proof will surely fall on deaf ears , since CHALMERS , for instance , has already acknowledged that arguments against his convictions on this score are powerless to dislodge his intuition , which is beyond rational support .
So I will not make the tactical error of trying to dislodge with rational argument a conviction that is beyond reason .
That would be wasting everybody ’s time , apparently .
Instead , I will offer up what I hope is a disturbing parallel from the world of card magic : The Tuned Deck .
For many years , Mr. Ralph Hull , the famous card wizard from Crooksville , Ohio , has completely bewildered not only the general public , but also amateur conjurors , card connoisseurs and professional magicians with the series of card tricks which he is pleased to call “ The Tuned Deck ” …
Ralph Hull ’s trick looks and sounds roughly like this :
Boys , I have a new trick to show you .
It ’s called ‘ The Tuned Deck ’ .
This deck of cards is magically tuned [ Hull holds the deck to his ear and riffles the cards , listening carefully to the buzz of the cards ] .
By their finely tuned vibrations , I can hear and feel the location of any card .
Pick a card , any card …
[ The deck is then fanned or otherwise offered for the audience , and a card is taken by a spectator , noted , and returned to the deck by one route or another . ]
Now I listen to the Tuned Deck , and what does it tell me ?
I hear the telltale vibrations , … [ buzz , buzz , the cards are riffled by Hull ’s ear and various manipulations and rituals are enacted , after which , with a flourish , the spectator ’s card is presented ] .
Hull would perform the trick over and over for the benefit of his select audience of fellow magicians , challenging them to figure it out .
Nobody ever did .
Magicians offered to buy the trick from him but he would not sell it .
Late in his life he gave his account to his friend , HILLIARD , who published the account in his privately printed book .
Here is what Hull had to say about his trick :
For years I have performed this effect and have shown it to magicians and amateurs by the hundred and , to the very best of my knowledge , not one of them ever figured out the secret .
… the boys have all looked for something too hard [ my italics , DCD ] .
Like much great magic , the trick is over before you even realize the trick has begun .
The trick , in its entirety , is in the name of the trick , “ The Tuned Deck ” , and more specifically , in one word “ The ” !
As soon as Hull had announced his new trick and given its name to his eager audience , the trick was over .
Having set up his audience in this simple way , and having passed the time with some obviously phony and misdirecting chatter about vibrations and buzz - buzz - buzz , Hull would do a relatively simple and familiar card presentation trick of type A ( at this point I will draw the traditional curtain of secrecy ; the further mechanical details of legerdemain , as you will see , do not matter ) .
His audience , savvy magicians , would see that he might possibly be performing a type A trick , a hypothesis they could test by being stubborn and uncooperative spectators in a way that would thwart any attempt at a type A trick .
When they then adopted the appropriate recalcitrance to test the hypothesis , Hull would ‘ repeat ’ the trick , this time executing a type B card presentation trick .
The spectators would then huddle and compare notes : might he be doing a type B trick ?
They test that hypothesis by adopting the recalcitrance appropriate to preventing a type B trick and still he does “ the ” trick – using method C , of course .
When they test the hypothesis that he ’s pulling a type C trick on them , he switches to method D – or perhaps he goes back to method A or B , since his audience has ‘ refuted ’ the hypothesis that he ’s using method A or B .
And so it would go , for dozens of repetitions , with Hull staying one step ahead of his hypothesis - testers , exploiting his realization that he could always do some trick or other from the pool of tricks they all knew , and concealing the fact that he was doing a grab bag of different tricks by the simple expedient of the definite article : The Tuned Deck .
git_remote_branch 0.2.6 is out !
I ’ve just released a new and improved version of git_remote_branch .
Code named 0.2.6 !
Ok , I admit .
I have n’t really begun using code names .
I ’m promoting the project from a pre-alpha to an alpha release .
There ’s still a lot to do , but the stability and “ testedness ” have improved greatly .
Following are both sides of the maturity story .
The project is maturing
grb got its first contributor , Caio Chassot
I added a lot of tests , both unit and functional there might even be interesting stuff to see in there for those who need to test command - line tools
the gem can now be installed directly from RubyForge
git_remote_branch now has a Google Group
The project is still immature
it swears a lot
no rubyforge page , despite the project being on rubyforge ( at rubyforge.org/projects/grb )
no real documentation other than running grb help
very little in code documentation .
On the other hand the code is spectacularly clean and readable , so that ’s completely unnecessary .
Just kidding .
What ’s new in 0.2.6 ?
Three new actual features
the ‘ rename ’ command , contributed by Caio Chassot
the ‘ publish ’ command
the −−silent option to completely mute grb output as well as every git command run by grb on your behalf
And other stuff
the grb bin file now works when symlinked ( also thanks to Caio Chassot )
lots of unit and functional tests
bug fixes
more flexibility for running grb outside of a git repository ( e.g. for ‘ explain ’ or ‘ help ’ )
now officially under the MIT license
refactored a bunch of rake tasks
Git the new version
To install the newest version of the gem , simply run
sudo gem install git_remote_branch
If you really want to be on the bleeding edge you can also get it on GitHub .
Note however that in ‘ bleeding edge ’ the word ‘ bleeding ’ is still the most important one at that point .
git clone git://github.com/webmat/git_remote_branch.git cd git_remote_branch rake install
The ‘ install ’ task will run the tests before installing so you ’ll need Shoulda , mocha , redgreen and ruby - debug for that approach .
Not familiar with git_remote_branch ?
What it is
The basic idea for git_remote_branch is to trivialize the interaction with remote branches .
The first goal is to make the commands for the simple situations easy .
The secondary goal , is to help you learn the commands by seeing them displayed in a beautiful shade of red each time you use grb , along with git ’s output .
git_remote_branch lets you
create local - remote branche pairs , and tracks the remote branch automatically ( for automatic merges when you git pull )
local - remote branche pairs , and tracks the remote branch automatically ( for automatic merges when you git pull ) publish a local branch as a remote branch , very similar to create
a local branch as a remote branch , very similar to create delete local - remote branch pairs
local - remote branch pairs track a remote - only branch
a remote - only branch rename a local - remote branch pair
a local - remote branch pair explain by simply spitting out the necessary commands to do any of the above
How to use it
explain
If you simply want to use grb as a cheatsheet ( and run nothing on your behalf ) , you can use the explain command :
$ grb explain create git_remote_branch version 0.2.6
List of operations to do to create a new remote branch and track it locally : git push origin current_branch : refs / heads / branch_to_create git fetch origin git branch −−track branch_to_create origin / branch_to_create git checkout branch_to_create
or
$ grb explain create my_branch my_origin git_remote_branch version 0.2.6
List of operations to do to create a new remote branch and track it locally : git push my_origin current_branch : refs / heads / my_branch git fetch my_origin git branch −−track my_branch my_origin / my_branch git checkout my_branch
Notice that you can specify any normally expected parameter you ’d normally include and ‘ explain ’ will use them in the list of commands it suggests .
Even better , if you ’re in your repository , the current branch is going to be taken into account :
( master ) $ grb explain create my_branch my_origin git_remote_branch version 0.2.6
List of operations to do to create a new remote branch and track it locally : git push my_origin master : refs / heads / my_branch git fetch my_origin git branch −−track my_branch my_origin / my_branch git checkout my_branch
Of course , ‘ explain ’ works for all commands : create , publish , delete , track and rename .
The main commands
I ’m not going to painstakingly give an example for each command .
I ’ll only give two , to show how git ’s responses are displayed when running grb without ‘ explain ’ :
( master ) $ grb create test_branch git_remote_branch version 0.2.6 git push origin master : refs / heads / test_branch Total 0 ( delta 0 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 ) To [ email protected ] : webmat/git_remote_branch.git * [ new branch ] master -> test_branch git fetch origin git branch −−track test_branch origin / test_branch git checkout test_branch Switched to branch " test_branch " ( test_branch ) $ grb delete test_branch git_remote_branch version 0.2.6 git push origin : refs/ heads/ test_branch
To [ email protected ] : webmat/git_remote_branch.git - [ deleted ] test_branch git checkout master Switched to branch " master " git branch -d test_branch ( master ) $
Yes my friends , I have just boldly used grb on my real repository for your viewing pleasure .
But worry not , no repository was hurt during the writing of this article .

Major elements of the Bush administration 's proposed $ 17 billion " cyber security " initiative have little to do with protecting government networks , and a lot to do with spying , according to a budget report released by the Senate Armed Services Committee this week .
The so - called National Cyber Security Initiative is also wrapped in unnecessary secrecy , and would spend billions on unproven , embryonic technology , and possibly illegal or ill - advised projects , according to the analysis – which is part of a broad look at the proposed 2009 defense budget .
" [ S ] ome of the projects support foreign intelligence collection and analysis generally rather than the cyber security mission particularly , " the report concludes .
" That is not to say that the proposed projects are not worthwhile , but rather that what will be achieved for the more than $ 17 billion planned by the administration to secure the government 's networks is less than what might be expected . "
After years of being lambasted for ignoring cyber security , in the last six months , the Bush administration has embraced the project of locking down government networks with the zeal of a convert .
Top officials have been rallying support for the huge expenditure , with hyped claims of information warfare , cyber terrorism and spying .
The U.S. Air Force , the Department of Homeland Security , the NSA and the FBI are all jostling for a piece of the cyber - security action .
While many of the specifics of the plan are classified , U.S. intelligence chief Michael McConnell told the New Yorker in January that he wants the National Security Agency to begin eavesdropping on the internet , and a McConnell aide said the spy agency was prepared to examine the content of e-mails , file transfers and Google searches without a warrant .
The purported goal of the National Cyber Security Initiative is to reduce the vulnerability of federal government networks to attacks and intrusions by extending the tools that currently protect classified networks to all federal government networks .
The unclassified portion of the project also seeks to simplify the task of patrolling the government 's e-perimeter by reducing the number of connections to the internet from more than 2,000 to 50 .
The move includes putting the NSA in charge of monitoring and protecting civilian sites such as the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration .
But according to the Armed Services Committee 's analysis , there 's a lot of spying being proposed under the guise of e-security .
That confirms THREAT LEVEL 's suspicions that the highly classified proposal could have far - ranging implications for the internet generally , especially as the government contemplates becoming the firewall for all Americans on the net .
The committee 's report also faults the administration for over - classifying the project , which was launched with a still - classified presidential directive signed in January .
Even most non-classified information about the project is stamped " For Official Use Only , " , the report notes , effectively keeping the whole project hidden from healthy public debate .
" These restrictions preclude public education , awareness , and debate about the policy and legal issues , real or imagined , that the initiative poses in the areas of privacy and civil liberties , " reads the report .
The Armed Services Committee was briefed on the project , which puts it far ahead of the Senate Homeland Security Committee , which early in May was reduced to writing a public letter to beg for the most basic information about the cyber plans .
The secrecy can also backfire in other ways , according to the report .
For instance , if the government plans to build the capability to strike back at adversaries who try to bring down a government website , the response tool has no deterrent effect if its very existence is secret .
" It is difficult to conceive how the United States could promulgate a meaningful deterrence doctrine if every aspect of our capabilities and operational concepts is classified . "

A few days before we flew to Barcelona last month to attend a wedding , international headlines filled with news that truckers had blocked roadways leading to Spain 's major cities , leaving some store shelves bare .
The wildcat strike passed , and the wedding went off without a hitch .
But the independent truckers ' protest – and subsequent efforts by Spanish farmers to block roadways in protest – bear testament to the pain inflicted by diesel fuel prices that have passed $ 8 a gallon and continue to climb .
That 's right , $ 8 a gallon .
Gasoline prices in Europe are even higher , roughly 1.5 euros per liter for regular in the French countryside last month or about $ 8.50 a gallon .
But petrol , as it's called , has always cost a lot more in Europe , in large part because of much higher taxes at the pump .
And even as protest strikes rippled across Spain and edged into France , Europeans had taken conservation measures that in the long haul leave them better - prepared than Americans to deal with the energy crunch ahead .
Sure , the message is getting through in the States , too .
When my wife , Kathy , and I put down a $ 500 deposit for a new Toyota Prius ( 48 m.p.g. in town ) in June , we were told the wait would be three to six months .
Gas - guzzling SUVs , meanwhile , are piling up on American car lots – mini 21st - century replicas of deserted Rust Belt steel mills a few decades ago .
Still , in stop after stop in Spain and France this summer , we saw signs that people routinely conserve in ways Americans have not yet begun to figure out .
When we rented a cottage for a week in the village of Pennautier , France , near the Disneyesque restored castle of Carcassonne , our British landlady informed us that we could only use the dryer after 9 p.m. , part of an economy plan that lowers electric usage and bills .
We also have rented places where water is only heated at night , and throughout France lights in public bathrooms are often triggered by motion sensors .
Even those decades - old timed lights in the hallways of smaller European hotels – the butt of American jokes about groping through pitch - black corridors – now seem eminently practical rather than quaint and amusing .
Throughout Europe , air conditioning , too , is a carefully meted - out commodity .
Our three - star Paris hotel offered us a single setting – low .
( Alas , Paris 's crowded subway offers no AC at all . )
Though Time columnist Joe Klein notes that air conditioning accounts for just 4 percent of Americans ' energy addiction , he adds , " I 'd like to see both candidates call for an immediate 5 degree F. thermostat adjustment , just to get the conservation ball rolling . "
Even as Americans queue up for smaller cars , they 're well behind the French .
These days in Paris , it seems every third car along the Seine is a sawed - off – and gas - efficient – Smart car , about the length from front bumper to back taillights of your two arms stretched wide .
Those without any car can rely on Paris 's new rent - a- bike system .
Throughout the city , residents and guests can grab a bike at one location , compliments of what seems a simple credit - card prompted trigger , and return it to any of dozens of other locations .
The first half - hour , the instructions noted , is free .
Each evening we watched as the streets filled with young and often fashionable bike riders , as likely pedaling in high heels and dress slacks as in jeans and sandals .
None of these measures , of course , have taken the sting out of gas prices twice as high in much of Europe as what Americans are paying for at the pump today .
But perhaps if Americans , who still use more energy per person than any country in the world , took note and took action to follow suit , prices here and there might at least stabilize .
Yes , three decades after we chose to ignore the warning shot of the 1970s energy crunch , Americans are finally looking to smaller cars again .
But we can do more .
We still chill buildings as if they 're housing Antarctic penguins instead of lightly clad humans .
And in many offices and public buildings , we still do n't bother to turn out the lights at night .
So as we grouse at the president , Congress , the oil companies and just about anyone else paying too little heed to our growing pain , perhaps Americans should remember that conservation can – and should – begin both in our homes and in our towns .
Let 's think globally , then act locally .
Our European friends have been doing that for a long time .

One of the most useful - and I believe coolest - features of the Mac OS is the amazing flexibility of the operating system .
Specifically , I am referring to the ability of the OS to be copied from one computer to another without a need for reinstall .
Compared to Windows , the Mac OS is like a double jointed gymnast .
One Installation , Many Macs
Something that most people may not realize is that an installed copy of the Mac OS can be almost endlessly copied and instantly run on any Mac for which there is basic hardware support ( e.g. you ca n't clone Panther to an Intel or a newer PowerPC Mac , because you would get a kernel panic on boot due to a lack of support for the newer hardware ) .
This principle forms the basis of Low End Mac 's Unsupported Leopard page .
If I so desired , I could buy a copy of Leopard and install it on an external drive using my fairly new Intel - based iMac .
I could then attach my eMac in Target Disk Mode and clone the Leopard installation to it using Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper .
The only reason I would even have to use the external drive would be to get around the GPT ( GUID Partition Table ) / APM ( Apple Partition Map ) formatting problem .
Intel Macs can only install the Mac OS to GPT drives , although they can boot from either GPT or APM drives .
PowerPC
Macs can only boot from APM drives .
Thus the clone is necessary to move the copy of Leopard onto an APM drive .
My 700 MHz eMac does n't even meet the minimum requirements for Leopard ; it lacks 167 MHz of processor speed and 192 MB of RAM .
The only thing that matters in this scenario is the G4 compatibility compiled into Leopard .
This procedure also works with the Classic Mac OS , though I find one must be more careful with version numbers than in OS X .
Through time I ended up with a clamshell iBook and CRT iMac and only one set of OS 9 discs for an even older clamshell iBook that no longer functioned .
I could install the system on the iMac , as it was the only one that could boot from the discs .
Then , after updating the system to 9.2.2 , I would copy the contents to the iBook , which would work flawlessly .
Unfortunately , when I tried to clone the system to my eMac , I ended up with no sound or 3D graphics .
I suspect that the problem lies in an old ROM file in the System Folder that predates the eMac .
Well That Didn't Work
From experiments and experience , I have learned that this feat is impossible to do on Windows .
Believe me , I have wasted many hours trying to get it to work .
My attempt was simple : I was moving a Parallels system to the recently released VMware Fusion for my math teacher .
I followed VMware 's instructions to the letter .
My new image booted fine , though it complained of needing reactivation .
However , I had to do a repair install of Windows to change to an ACPI Multiprocessor HAL .
This was necessary for two reasons .
First , one of the reasons my teacher moved to VMware was its support for two virtual processors .
Second , the virtual machine could n't automatically shut down because Parallels virtual machines used the older APM HAL .
After I performed the process , the system developed several massive bugs .
For example , Windows Update simply ceased to function , leaving security vulnerabilities .
After spending hours trying to fix this , I eventually ended up with a non-system disk , which for those unfamiliar with Windows means that the system will not boot .
At that point I turned to my teacher and exclaimed , " Well that did n't work ! "
In the end , I ended up reinstalling Windows .
Come on , Microsoft .
You can move an installed copy of Mac OS X between two different processor architectures and it wo n't bat an eye .
Your OS is far too rigid and brittle .
Apple Bailed Me Out
If it was n't for this feature , I would have been in deep trouble many times .
When I once managed to install the core system for an Intel Mac onto my eMac , generating an unbootable system , my Panther iBook saved me .
I was able to boot my iBook in Target Disk mode and boot my eMac from the iBook 's hard drive until I could get it fixed .
Thankfully , the fantastic support people of the Apple Store 's Genius Bar were kind enough to reinstall Tiger for free .
As an aside , make sure and generously thank the Genius Bar staff when they fix your problems .
Trust me , they deserve it .
If Apple were to integrate some kind of copy protection , such as what has been rumored , scads of people would n't be able to use yet another feature that makes the Mac superior .
Burning questions :
What you need to know about the Rugby Championship in Australia

There 's plenty of detail to be organised but here 's what you need to know about the Rugby Championship in Australia and the Wallabies ' movements in coming months .
The US mortgage finance empire Freddie Mac yesterday predicted the worst housing slump since the Great Depression as it set aside $ 2.5 bn ( £ 1.28 bn ) to cover credit liabilities caused by delinquent loans and foreclosures .
Two weeks after the US government hastily assembled a rescue package to support the business , Freddie revealed a second - quarter loss of $ 821 m - a big jump in comparison with its first - quarter deficit of $ 151m .
Richard Syron , chief executive of Freddie Mac , said : " As we 're all painfully aware , the housing correction has had a significant impact on the US economy . "
He admitted that the credit environment was deteriorating " even faster than we thought " .
The government - sponsored company has a loan portfolio of more than $ 1.5tn .
Along with its sister firm , Fannie Mae , it buys mortgages from lenders and securitises them on the financial markets in its mission to broaden access to home ownership .
Syron predicted yesterday that the American housing slump would be even deeper than anticipated .
He said the company believed prices would drop by between 18 % and 20 % from their peak , exceeding its earlier forecast of 15 % .
In a statement , the company said it was " in the midst of the single largest decline in real estate values since the Great Depression " .
Syron said : " Today 's challenging economic environment suggests the housing market is far from stabilising .
We now think we 're about halfway through the peak - to - trough decline . "
Alarm about the financial position of Fannie and Freddie has sent shares in the two companies plummeting by more than 80 % this year .
Freddie 's loss , which was significantly greater than analysts had predicted , sent its stock down by 15 % in early trading on Wall Street .
Freddie intends to raise $ 5.5 bn of new capital to bolster its reserves and is slashing its dividend .
The company insisted that its cash remained above regulatory targets - it has $ 37.1 bn of core capital , which is $ 2.7 bn more than the surplus required by the US government .
Congress recently nodded through a bill allowing the US treasury to lend money or buy shares in Freddie and Fannie to keep the businesses afloat .
Economists fear that a collapse of one or both could have grave repercussions throughout the financial system .
Between them , they back more than half of new US mortgages .
Syron said he did not believe such drastic taxpayer support would be needed : " While we do not expect to draw on any of the new backstops going forward , they provide important sources of reassurance and potential support in the event that the housing market declines even further than anticipated . "
Analysts believe investors are likely to attach stringent terms to any fundraising by the company .
Walter O'Haire , of the Boston financial consultancy Celent , said : " What will be interesting to see are the terms investors will demand in return for buying into Freddie Mac 's proposed $ 5.5 bn stock offering . "

SOUTH AFRICAN POET DENNIS BRUTUS ON STEAL THIS RADIO !
Nelson Mandela hid out in Dennis Brutus ’ house while the apartheid army searched for him .
Then Dennis served hard time in jail with Mandela and other heros of the anti-apartheid freedom struggle , and was a member of the African National Congress .
Today , some of those same South African radicals are opposing a lawsuit that Dennis Brutus and others have brought in US Federal Court in New York , which seeks to hold multi-billion dollar corporations accountable for their collaboration with apartheid and profiteering off of slave labour .

Most teenagers who smoke cigarettes make repeated attempts to quit but most are unsuccessful , according to new research from the Université de Montréal and funded by the Canadian Cancer Society .
" The study found that teen smokers make their first serious attempt to quit after only two and a half months of smoking , and by the time they have smoked for 21 months they have lost confidence in their ability to quit , " says Dr. Jennifer O'Loughlin , the study 's lead author and a researcher from the Université de Montréal 's department of social and preventive medicine .
Dr. O'Loughlin analyzed data from 319 Montreal teens who completed reports on their smoking habits every three months for five years .
The study found that teen smokers progress through stages or milestones in their attempts to stop smoking .
These stages are :
Confidently declaring that they have stopped smoking forever , one to two months after their first puff ;
Expressing a conscious desire to quit with a growing realization that quitting requires serious effort ;
Over the next two years , as cravings and withdrawal symptoms increase , gradually losing confidence in their ability to quit ;
A year later , they are smoking daily and now realize they still smoke because it is very hard to quit ;
About two years after starting to smoke cigarettes daily , teen smokers are showing full - blown tobacco dependence .
The study found that more than 70 percent of the teens expressed a desire to quit , but only 19 percent actually managed to stop smoking for 12 months or more by the end of the five - year study .
Girls were more likely than boys to want to quit and to attempt quitting .
" These findings indicate that teenagers want to quit smoking , " says Dr. O'Loughlin .
" We really need to develop and implement effective tobacco control interventions for young people , before it 's too late . "
Participants were aged 12 to 13 at the beginning of the study .
For these novice smokers it took about :
Nine months after their first puff to become monthly smokers ;
19 months after their first puff to become weekly smokers ;
23 months after their first puff to become daily smokers .
" These findings show that teen smokers want to quit and attempt to quit , but very few are actually able to stop for long periods " says Rob Cunningham , senior policy analyst , Canadian Cancer Society .
" This research suggests that much more needs to be done to prompt teenagers to quit in terms of programming , legislation and taxation .
In particular , federal and provincial governments must get the contraband situation under control -- cheap cigarettes discourage teen smokers from quitting . "
This research was funded by the Canadian Cancer Society .
Testosterone key to disease transmission
High levels of testosterone may be a key factor in spreading disease among mice , according to biologists .
The findings could help explain why males in a population are often more likely to get infected , and transmit disease .
Previous research has linked testosterone , the male sex hormone , to immune system suppression .
Studies have shown that males , compared to females , experience more bouts of disease , and account for a larger share of disease transmission .
However , it is not fully clear what makes males such super - spreaders of disease .
" We know that testosterone makes males more susceptible to disease , " said Daniel Grear , Penn State doctoral student in ecology .
" We wanted to find out if it impacts their behavior as well and how that increases their ability to transmit disease . "
Grear and his Penn State colleagues Sarah E. Perkins , postdoctoral fellow , and Peter J. Hudson , the Verne M. Willaman chair in biology and director of the Huck Institutes of Life Sciences at Penn State , investigated the effects of increased testosterone on mice behavior .
" Our plan was to raise the testosterone levels in wild mice and measure the disease risk they posed to the population , " said Grear , who presented the team 's findings today ( Aug. 8 ) at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America in Milwaukee , Wis .
The researchers randomly treated 24 male mice trapped at five sites in Huntingdon County , Pa. , with testosterone implants .
Twenty - five other male mice received sham implants , while mice at three separate sites received neither treatment .
All sites were trapped twice a week for six weeks before and after treatment .
The trapping sites were innovatively positioned to represent a large grid and mice were electronically tagged so researchers could keep precise track of where the animals were being recaptured .
Such a social network , Grear explained , could help provide a clear picture of how the treated and untreated mice mix on the grids over time .
Tests on recaptured mice indicated that the average number of contacts made between both males and females by mice that received the treatment -- sham and testosterone -- increased significantly increased after treatment .
In other words , all mice were mixing more when testosterone treated mice were present .
Researchers also found that all mice at the separate untreated sites made significantly less contacts with other mice during the same time that the testosterone treatment significantly increased contacts .
" These findings suggest that even if some individuals in a population have high levels of testosterone , they can impact the behavior of those around , and drive the transmission of diseases transmitted by close contact such as the respiratory pathogen bordetella , " explained Grear , whose work is funded by the National Science Foundation .
Official threatens voter fraud whistleblowerThere has been a tremendous amount of information being kicked around the blogs about the Florida straw poll fiasco .
A lot of the blogs use terms like ?
it was rumored that ?
or ?
I heard that ?. Forget the rumors ; here is a short audio clip from the actual person who said she was threatened by Pinellas County REC Chairman Tony DeMatteo .
She said that this happened after she brought voting issues to his attention :
1. Straw poll tickets were sold with a 1 vote per ticket ( per person ) claim , but Romney voters at the polls were voting multiple times with one ticket .
When asked about multiple voting , election officials pushed the camera away ( yes there is video , but not in this clip ) 2 .
The voting machines registered some votes for Romney when the final ? verifiy ?
option was used , even though the voter had selected Ron Paul .
Officials were immediately notified and did nothing .
Bloggers point out that these are the same voting machines which are used in the elections .
Florida doesn ?t buy separate machines for straw polls .

When a BMW 335i owner in Munich became bored with his black coupe , he hired a team to wrap it in white tape .
Two days later , he drove home in his refreshed " Alpine White " coupe ( with an M3 - appearing black roof ) .
No , it 's not normal tape .
It 's a special 3 M wrap , and the process is known as " foiling . "
Apparently , the German military has been using the process ( with an olive drab tape ) for some time now .
Likewise , the process is popular with race teams and taxi companies .
Available in countless colors , the tape itself is thick enough to protect the paint from minor chips and nicks , and it can be left adhered to the surface for 3 - 4 years without damage (! ) .
Adhesion is n't a problem either , as the tape can even withstand an automatic car wash without peeling off .
Thanks for the tip Frank .

( Money Magazine ) -- Entitlement has become a bit of a swear word .
In Washington , D.C. , it 's technically a nonpejorative term for government programs like Social Security and Medicare that are n't subject to the usual budget process .
But what many pundits and pols who talk about entitlements really mean is :
Look at all those aging boomers who think they 're entitled to every penny of younger generations ' tax dollars .
As the general election campaign heats up , you will surely be hearing more about a looming entitlements crisis .
And there is a real problem .
Thanks largely to the projected growth of entitlement programs for seniors , the federal government is already on the hook for about $ 54 trillion over the next 75 years .
That 's trillion with a T .
It 's hard to know where to begin solving a problem this big and tangled .
But here are a couple of things worth thinking about .
Can we tone down the old - vs. - young rhetoric ?
Because entitlements are a " pay as you go " plan - that is , they 're funded by taxes of current workers - the issue is often framed as a sort of intergenerational warfare .
But the seniors who collect benefits are n't aliens who came down to Earth for the early - bird special at Denny's .
They are , mostly , the people who changed diapers and paid tuition for the working generation .
They 're family .
As the economist Robert Shiller has observed , the safety net for the elderly has always been a pay - as - you - go system financed by the young .
Before Social Security and Medicare , your parents simply moved into your house .
According to one study , the share of widows living with their adult kids fell from nearly 60 % in 1940 to just 20 % in 1990 .
I love spending time with my folks , but I 'd want to be very , very careful messing with this .
That does n't mean the current system must be sacrosanct .
Still , as boomers age and start needing costly long - term care , which Medicare rarely covers , I suspect that many of their Gen X children are going to be demanding a stronger safety net , not a weaker one .
Let 's focus on the real problem : health - care costs .
Social Security is actually a relatively small and fixable piece of the entitlement puzzle .
Medicare for the old and Medicaid for the poor are the programs that really threaten to swallow up the budget .
The federal deficit , not counting interest payments , could eat up 9 % of GDP by 2050 if business continues as usual .
According to Brookings Institution economist Henry Aaron , the two big federal health programs account for nearly all of the gap ( see above and right ) .
The main problem is not the demographic bulge of baby boomers , says Aaron .
It 's that health - care costs overall , for private payers as well as in Medicare , are growing about 2.5 percentage points faster than the economy every year .
New drugs , procedures and technologies keep upping the ante , even when we are n't sure if they work better than what came before .
If we could get a grip on runaway cost growth throughout the system - not just for old folks - we 'd solve much of the budget problem .
And we could even afford to cover everybody .
As a practical matter , Aaron argues , the two reforms must go together .
Well , if that 's all ... okay , this is a tough one .
Barack Obama 's not - quite - universal health plan identifies places to save but does n't say how it would enforce budget discipline .
While John McCain wants to hold down spending by making people bear costs more directly , he punts on ensuring that they get the coverage they need .
And both candidates want tax cuts that keep digging the budget hole .
Here 's hoping the candidates get serious and specific about this in the coming debates .
I think we 're entitled .

This further begs the question as to why he'd say steel when everyone knows you need wood to kill a vampire , unless it was all a ruse so that he really could come back without anyone knowing .
Vampires are crafty like that .

Gov. distances himself from what Obama called GOP ‘ ignorance ’
[ social_buttons ]
Two weeks ago , the presumptive Democratic candidate for President of the United States , Barack Obama had the gall to suggest that proper tire inflation could actually reduce national gasoline consumption , thereby lowering our carbon emissions and reducing our demand for oil .
GOP strategists saw an opportunity to pounce on this bold claim by Senator Obama .
And they , along with their friend Rush Limbaugh , lampooned and ridiculed Obama ’s tire pressure assertion as a joke .
The McCain campaign even went so far as handing out tire gauges branded with the slogan “ Obama ’s Energy Plan ” to reporters traveling with Senator Obama .
Let me just say this , whomever was in charge of that “ brilliant ” move at McCain HQ should be canned .
Today several more groups were added to the growing list of organizations that stand behind Senator Obama ’s claim that properly inflated tires can indeed reduce gasoline consumption .
Speaking on behalf of these groups , and helping to launch the EcoDriving initiative were the Republican Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger , and the Democratic Governor of Colorado Bill Ritter .
The pair were on hand in Denver on Monday ( Schwarzenegger spoke via satellite link ) to announce a new initiative from the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the American Automobile Dealers Association called EcoDriving ( EcoDrivingUSA.com ) , a comprehensive , nationwide effort to save consumers money at the gas pump , reduce fuel use and cut carbon dioxide emissions .
The Environmental Defense Fund also participated in the launch .
By following a set of subtle and easy - to - use best practices , including proper tire inflation , for driving and vehicle maintenance , the group says a typical driver can improve mileage by about 15 percent .
In addition , officials at EcoDriving claim that if just half of all drivers nationwide practiced moderate levels of EcoDriving , annual CO2 emissions could be reduced by about 100 million tons , or the equivalent of heating and powering 8.5 million households .
As part of their national campaign , automakers pledged to reach out to government , business , educators and more .
Alliance members hope to engage all 50 states , as well as major consumer organizations , in EcoDriving .
“ We ’re all in this together , so there ’s a role for each one of us to play in being a part of the solution to these critical issues , ” said said Dave McCurdy , president and CEO of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers .
“ Automakers are aggressively developing and introducing new technologies , but it takes 15 years or more for these technologies to become widespread on the road .
EcoDriving helps consumers reduce carbon dioxide emissions today , ” said McCurdy .

A research program designed to enhance spiritual awareness for persons with a cancer diagnosis is accepting volunteer participants at the Bayview Campus of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore .
The program consists of a brief counseling intervention , including medical screening , rapport - building appointments , two all - day sessions that include psilocybin administration , and appointments to facilitate initial integration and application of insights gained .
More detailed information is available at cancer- insight.org
Conducted by Drs. Roland Griffiths , William Richards and colleagues , this program is designed to help cancer patients who are suffering with some degree of psychological distress to become less anxious and depressed , and to become more fully engaged with life again .
Psilocybin , the psychoactive ingredient in the " sacred mushrooms " that have been used in religious ceremonies by indigenous people in Mesoamerica for approximately two thousand years , is employed to facilitate the resolution of personal conflicts and to occasion states of consciousness that for some may be indistinguishable from visions and mystical experiences recorded in the history of religions .
Psilocybin has not been found to be toxic or addictive , and is considered reasonably safe for persons without a history of serious mental illness , when administered in accordance with the safety guidelines published by the Hopkins researchers .
Additional information on safety and the unique contributions this intervention may make to human personal and spiritual well - being , may be found here .
The research is FDA approved and is open to persons between 21 and 70 .

Allegations of Official And Vendor Blunders Screw it !
It 's Just Too Hard !
by Robert A Franco |
There is an interesting article in the Detroit Free Press about a man who found his Social Security number in the county 's online records and how Wayne County handles these situations .
It is estimated that the number of documents in Wayne County that contain Social Security numbers is in the hundreds of thousands .
With the Federal Trade Commission estimating that identity theft costs approximately nine million Americans $ 50 billion per year , surely Wayne County has a comprehensive plan to redact vulnerable information from their records .... ummm ... nope .
The county 's records have been online for about 8 years and they still have n't figured out what to do about the older documents that still contain Social Security numbers .
Wayne County officials said they have not developed a comprehensive plan to redact vulnerable information from older records .
They say , however , they are weighing the costs of a computer program , like that used in Macomb County , that scrubs Social Security numbers from online documents .
So what has been done to better protect the citizens of Detroit and the rest of the County ...
Well , about a year ago , the state of Michigan passed a law prohibiting the county clerks from accepting records with Social Security Numbers , but that does n't effect the images from 1960 to 2007 .
Michigan also permits residents to file an affidavit to have their Social Security number redacted from the earlier documents .
But , did they really expect hundreds of thousands of affiants , most of whom have no idea their Social Security numbers are available online , to take advantage of that procedure ?
I do n't think so .
It seems rather disingenuous to address such an important issue by placing the onus back on those who are oblivious to the existence of the hazard the county created .
Besides that , it appears that the county employees are n't really all that helpful .
The resident who saw his Social Security number online , said he had not been able to get past answering machines at the Wayne County Clerk 's Office .
But he said a friend who called received another version :
It was impossible for the numbers to be online because they had already been redacted .
[ Another ] Wayne County resident ... said she had no idea her private information was online , let alone that she had to file an affidavit to have it removed .
[ She ] found out her Social Security number was online when a Free Press reporter called .
" I know nothing about computers , " [ she ] said ...
" How could I know that this stuff is on there ? "
Why not just redact all of the Social Security numbers , like Macomb county did ?
Macomb county paid ACS about $ 485,000 to check more than 4.8 million documents - or just over ten cents per document .
That does n't seem so bad .
But , what a racket ACS has going .
ACS sells imaging and indexing systems to the counties and encourages them to publish the records online .
Then , they sell them another service , redaction , if the county wants to make it safe for the citizens to have their records hosted on the Internet .
But , redaction poses another problem in Oakland County .
Oakland County 's clerk , said she had also considered electronic redaction for Oakland records , but that the numbers used to identify land parcels in Oakland are too similar to Social Security numbers for the system to be effective .
And , let 's not forget the real problem ... we are n't just dealing with a database anymore ... we are dealing with publication on the Internet .
There is no telling how many people may have printed the image before someone requested redaction of their Social Security number .
Of course , counties also routinely sell the documents to third parties and the counties no longer have any control over redaction of those records .
For years , companies have been culling private information from Public Records and selling it .
" These documents probably have been sold to a variety of different title companies across the country , to be resold and sold and sold again , " [ the Wayne County clerk ] said .
Apparently , Michigan considered requiring redaction of all records to protect its citizens .
Last year , Michigan lawmakers considered requiring Social Security numbers to be redacted from all records , said Phil Browne , chief of staff for Rep. Brian Palmer , R - Romeo .
But officials concluded that would be logistically difficult because of the volume of records and changes in filing practices .
No such bills are being considered .
That leaves the onus on individual counties .
That sounds like our government hard at work .
They could have taken steps to ensure that Social Security numbers were not available online ... but they said , " Screw it !
Its too difficult . "
I wonder if they considered the obvious alternative - if the records cannot be published safely on the Internet , do n't do it !
There have been several counties that have realized the potential dangers of recklessly subjecting citizens to identity theft and have pulled their images from Internet access .
That is the responsible thing to do .
Though it is often difficult to cite to specific examples that link Public Records on the Internet to identity theft , it has been done .
See Online Records Linked To Identity Theft And Worse , in the News For County Officials newsletter .
I 'm sure it happens much more than we are aware .
Hamilton County Clerk of Courts Greg Hartmann understood the link when he told the Cincinnati Post he was removing more than 320,000 public documents from his Web site in an attempt to combat the growing crime of identity theft .
" I have seen increasing numbers of identity theft , " Hartmann said .
" We have had a number of cases where police have told me the bad guys got the information used to steal identities from my Web site . "
Citizens there have filed a lawsuit against the county for the breach of their security .
( read the full article for more examples )
The media is becoming increasingly aware of these dangers and as they report on them , more criminals will be , too .
Unless , of course , you do n't think these sophisticated criminals read the newspaper .
How many thieves now know that they could potentially find hundreds of thousands of new victims by simply searching the Wayne County Public Records from the convenience of their local coffee shop with Wi -Fi access ?
If you think it 's difficult to require redaction , try catching the thieves who operate behind the anonymity of the Internet .
Then again , maybe we should n't bother .
Screw it !
It 's too difficult .

A dam fine sight : Baby beavers born in Britain for the first time in 400 years
Captured on camera as they swim in a lake , drag pieces of wood to make their dens and play with one another , these are the first beavers to be born in Britain in 400 years .
The enchanting scene is a heartwarming sight for animal lovers as the species was previously extinct in this country .
The 12 baby beaver ‘ kits ’ – all from the same mother – were born at the 550 - acre Lower Mill Estate near Cirencester , Gloucestershire .
New born :
One of the baby beavers born in Gloucestershire
They are testament to the success of the breeding programme there .
Jeremy Paxton , owner of the estate , brought three pairs of beavers – named Tony and Cherie , Gordon and Sarah and John and Pauline – from Bavaria in 2005 .
He has spent almost £ 1 million on the project .
He said : ‘ I have always wanted to bring an extinct indigenous species back to Britain .
' The process began with discussions with Defra .
I had to demonstrate , through research , that the beavers would be beneficial to the environment .
‘ When I brought the six original ones over , they had to be quarantined for six months .
' I hired a farm in Devon and various experts , including vets and environmentalists , and built a beaver - friendly habitat with diving pools to ensure they would be happy and comfortable , as they can die quickly if they ’re stressed . ’
Mr Paxton was then able to release them into Flagham Fen Lake on the estate , which is home to more than 6,000 protected wildlife species .
Back in Britain : A beaver friendly habitat with diving pools has been built on the estate to ensure the beavers are comfortable
He believes the reason the beavers have bred is because of the close supervision by his team of experts .
‘ We would know immediately if they were n’t happy with one another or not bonding .
' They are a “ key species ” – the habitats they create support up to 32 other endangered species , including water voles and otters . ’
Beaver - friendly : A lake on the Gloucestershire estate where beavers have been re-introduced
Beavers were hunted to extinction in Britain in the 16th Century because of demand for their fur and throat glands , which were believed to have medicinal properties .
It is still illegal to release beavers into the countryside , but Mr Paxton said : ‘ Within ten years I anticipate their wider release .
' The time will come when people will be spotting them by riverbanks across Britain . ’
South Africa has been in the news a lot recently because of its electricity supply problems throughout 2008 .
Most South African electricity comes from coal - fired power stations .
Jeremy discusses the role of coal in South Africa 's energy mix , long - term trends in production and consumption , and how underground coal gasification might help solve South Africa 's energy problems .
Can and should our dependence continue ?
South Africa ’s energy economy is overwhelmingly dependent on coal .
The fossil fuel provides nearly three quarters of total primary energy , supports almost 90 per cent of electricity generation , and provides feedstock for close to a third of the country ’s liquid fuels via Sasol ’s coal - to - liquids process .
Coal is also used directly as a fuel by certain industries ( e.g. steel production ) , and indirectly as feedstock for Sasol ’s petrochemical products .
In addition , roughly a third of the nation ’s annual coal output is exported , generating an important source of foreign exchange earnings .
There are two major risks inherent in this heavy dependence on coal : one is the finite nature of its supply , and the other is its contribution to global warming .
This article takes a broad look at some of the key issues concerning the outlook for coal in South Africa , including demand , supply , prices and environmental concerns .
It concludes with a brief discussion of a promising development called underground coal gasification , which could potentially address both of these risks to some extent .
Demand for coal is growing
Production and consumption of coal in South Africa have grown reasonably steadily over the past two and a half decades , at average annual rates of 2.9 % and 2.5 % , respectively ( see Figure 1 ) .
Consumption in 2006 is estimated by the US Energy Information Administration at 177 million metric tonnes ( mt ) .
The largest share of this , about 64 % , was burned by Eskom in its power stations , with Sasol consuming another 24 % and industry and small consumers accounting for the remainder .
Eskom ’s consumption of coal grew to 125 million tonnes in 2007 .

This growth in coal use – especially by Eskom and Sasol – is expected to continue or even accelerate over the next few years .
Eskom is in the process of returning to service three coal - fired power stations ( Camden , Grootvlei and Komati ) with a combined capacity of 3800 megawatts ( MW ) .
It has also begun construction of the new 4800 MW Medupi power station , whose first unit is due to begin generation in 2012 , while a second plant called Project Bravo ( 5400 MW , scheduled to start generating power in 2013 ) was recently given the go - ahead .
The combined consumption of these five power plants could raise Eskom ’s coal use by over 50 mt ( assuming they use the average amount of coal burned by existing power stations in 2007 ) .
For its part , Sasol has announced that it is conducting feasibility studies for an expansion of its existing synfuels plant at Secunda by 20 per cent ( or 30,000 barrels per day ) and for the construction of a new plant ( called Mafutha ) with a capacity of 80,000 barrels per day .
If both of these projects come on stream , they could raise the demand for coal by approximately 25 million tons a year ( again extrapolating from past consumption patterns ) .
Thus the domestic demand for coal could rise by 75 million tonnes or over 40 % over the next decade .
Only from about 2025 when the decommissioning of older coal - fired power plants begins could one expect consumption of coal to start falling ( provided no further coal - fired plants are built ) .
This raises an important question : for how long might South Africa ’s coal reserves be able to sustain current and projected rates of consumption ?
Can reserves sustain this growth ?
The electricity crisis has already thrown a spotlight , so to speak , on the status of the country ’s coal reserves : Eskom attributed a part of its electricity supply problems at the start of this year to difficulties it experienced in sourcing sufficient quantities of suitable grade coal .
This prompted the Minister of Public Enterprises , Alec Erwin , to say that the government would if necessary intervene to ensure Eskom ’s coal needs were met .
Could this be an indication of moves towards resource nationalism , as are increasingly being observed across the globe in relation both to energy ( especially oil ) resources as well as food production ?
There is probably little immediate chance of this happening , for two reasons .
First , Eskom uses low - grade coal while export - quality coal is high - grade and unsuitable for burning in existing power stations .
Second , coal mining companies have long - term supply contracts to fulfil .
Outright nationalisation of the coal industry would seem a remote possibility given the need for financial capital , management expertise , etc. possessed by the mining companies .
However , it is still possible that growing domestic demand could at some point in the future come into conflict with exports .
According to BP ’s Statistical Review of World Energy 2007 , South Africa ’s proved reserves of coal stood at 48,750 million tonnes at the end of 2006 , representing 5.4 % of the world total ( the sixth largest national share ) .
BP estimates a reserve to production ratio ( i.e. the number of years production could be sustained at current rates ) of 190 years .
The Statistical Review defines proved reserves as “ those quantities that geological and engineering information indicates with reasonable certainty can be recovered in the future from known deposits under existing economic and operating conditions . ”
This figure seems to be based on the 1987 Bredell report .
However , the official government figure for reserves has been revised downward sharply to only 28.6 billion tonnes ( South Africa Yearbook 2006 / 7 ) , giving an R/ P ratio of about 115 years .
David Rutledge , a Professor at the California Institute of Technology , has used the ‘ Hubbert linearization ’ method to estimate that there could be as little as 10 billion tonnes ( Gt ) of recoverable coal reserves remaining in Africa ( most of which is in South Africa ) .
If true , current production could be sustained for only about 40 years .
The R/P ratio is however of limited usefulness , for a couple of reasons .
First , as mentioned already , the annual rate of consumption is expected to grow in the medium term , not remain constant .
More fundamentally , production cannot maintain any particular rate indefinitely and then suddenly collapse to zero .
Because coal is a finite resource , its production will of necessity reach a peak at some point and then decline gradually toward zero .
This production profile , initially identified by the geophysicist M. King Hubbert in the case of US oil production , is clearly evident in the history of British coal output ( see Figure 2 ) .
Figure 2 : British coal production
Source : Prof. Dave Rutledge : http://rutledge.caltech.edu/
The ‘ Hubbert peak ’ for South African coal production may still be a few decades away , depending on which estimate of ultimately recoverable reserves turns out to be most accurate .
If Rutledge ’s conservative reserve estimate is used as a base , and the rule of thumb applied that peak production occurs when roughly half the recoverable resource has been mined , then the peak could come by 2020 if production grows at historical averages ( 2.5 % ) until then .
Whatever the case , the economics of mining dictates that the most accessible reserves are mined first , so that the net energy return from the coal mining declines while the production costs rise over time ( although the latter may be counteracted to an extent by technological improvements ) .
To a degree this process is already in evidence , as costs are rising and the quality of mined coal is declining , according to statements made by Eskom officials .
The global picture is similar .
Several studies of global coal reserves published last year indicated that world reserves are likely to be much lower than has been commonly believed .
One of these studies , by the German Energy Watch Group , forecasts that global coal production might reach its peak as early as 2025 ( see Figure 3 ) .
Meanwhile , demand is growing rapidly in many developing countries , mostly notably in China ( which has recorded growth of 12 percent per annum since 2001 ) and India .

Spiralling prices
The surging demand in the face of short - term supply constraints has resulted in a dramatic rise in coal prices over the past few years ( see Figure 4 ) .
The spot price of coal on the international market has risen from $ 100 to $ 300 per ton within the last year .
A major reason is that China , by a large margin the world ’s top producer and consumer of coal , recently became a net coal importer .
Figure 4 : Northwest Europe steam coal marker price

All this has been good news for South Africa ’s coal exports .
South Africa was the world ’s fourth largest coal exporter in 2005 , selling 65 million tonnes of high - grade coal to buyers in Western Europe ( approximately a quarter of their coal imports ) and East Asia .
It was recently reported that India may source low - grade coal from South Africa to fuel new power stations .
Domestic coal prices are also on the rise .
Eskom has cited a 30 per cent rise in the price of its key feedstock in the past year as one of the reasons it is seeking a 100 per cent increase in electricity tariffs over the next two years .
The CEO of ArcelorMittal , the giant steel producer , recently stated that he expects the price of coking coal to rise between 150 % and 200 % .
As long as demand remains strong , the spike in coal prices will not be a temporary anomaly .
Can our climate cope ?
The scenario of demand growth – subject sooner or later to supply limitations and thereby forcing up prices – applies in a business - as - usual scenario .
But from the climate change point of view , can we afford to burn all the coal that ’s left ?
In parts of the developed world at least , there is a movement away from coal .
In February 2007 , NASA ’s chief climate scientist James Hansen called for a moratorium on the construction of new coal - fired power plants unless they sequester the carbon emissions .
Lester Brown , President of the Earth Policy Institute , recently noted that opposition is mounting to coal - fired electricity generation in the USA , where many State governments are placing moratoriums on the construction of new coal power plants .
The European Union has embraced renewable energy and is at the forefront of efforts to reduce carbon emissions .
South Africa is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol , but as an Annex I country currently has no obligation to reduce its greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions .
However , this may change under a successor treaty to Kyoto , which is due to expire in 2012 .
Given the severity of climate change , a new protocol could be much more stringent , and could involve an international carbon trading system that would add a substantial premium to the price of fossil fuels .
There is consequently a significant risk for South Africa that its carbon - intensity will undermine the international competitiveness of many of its exports ( e.g. minerals , beneficiated metals and certain manufactured goods ) .
Thus far , although carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) has received a lot of attention , the development of economical technology could take years or even decades .
Earlier this year the Bush administration cancelled federal funding for a consortium aiming to construct a demonstration coal - fired power station that sequesters its carbon dioxide emissions , on account of rising costs .
Whether or not CCS will some day become technically viable in South Africa , it looks highly likely that carbon sequestration at existing plants would substantially increase the costs of coal - based electricity and / or liquid fuels .
Two birds with one stone ?
More promisingly , Eskom and Sasol are currently working jointly to develop an alternative technology for extracting the energy from coal , called underground coal gasification ( UCG ) .
This is a process whereby coal is ignited in situ underground , fed through a borehole by air or oxygen and yielding a synthetic gas ( syngas ) .
The syngas can be used for electricity generation , for the production of synthetic liquid fuels or for industrial uses ( e.g. manufacture of petrochemicals ) .
In addition to this flexibililty , several other advantages are claimed for UCG .
First , otherwise uneconomical resources can be utilised ; Eskom estimates that an additional 45 billion tons of coal could be exploited through UCG .
Second , there is no need for traditional mining and associated health and safety risks for miners .
Third , indications from a pilot UCG project in Australia indicate that the process has a much lower environmental impact ( in terms of groundwater contamination , land degradation and subsidence , and greenhouse gas emissions ) than conventional mining .
Eskom already has a small pilot UCG plant in operation at its Majuba power station in Mpumalanga , generating 100 kilowatts of electricity .
So far , Eskom is optimistic that the costs will compare favourably with those of conventional coal mining and power generation .
One must pose the question , however , as to why UCG has not been commercialised before in South Africa ( and other countries such as the United States ) , given that the technique has been used since the 1950s in the former Soviet Union .
Conclusion : watch this space
Let us attempt a quick summary of the coal situation .
In the first place , coal ’s future in South Africa is perhaps not as certain as was commonly believed , at least until recently .
Second , the risks of continuing heavy dependence on coal are becoming clearer : including security of energy and electricity supply , as well as climate change and associated financial risks related to carbon pricing .
Third , the international price of coal looks set to continue to rise in the foreseeable future – whether from resource constraints or climate protection - so that the long era of cheap coal seems likely to be over for good .
Fourth , underground coal gasification may provide a partial solution to all of these challenges in South Africa by substantially extending the amount of economically recoverable coal reserves while also limiting the environmental damage .
The development of UCG will no doubt garner close scrutiny over the next few years , and not just in this country .
But this prospect should not allow a renewed complacency to set in regarding coal dependence .
From a long - term perspective it arguably still makes sense for the country to diversify its energy sources by investing in renewable energy technologies and industries as ultimately these will be needed , have proven environmental benefits , and are becoming increasingly cost competitive with fossil fuels .

Concerned about its appeal to sponsors , the women ’s professional golf tour , which in recent years has been dominated by foreign - born players , has warned its members that they must become conversant in English by 2009 or face suspension .
“ We live in a sports - entertainment environment , ” said Libba Galloway , the deputy commissioner of the tour , the Ladies Professional Golf Association .
“ For an athlete to be successful today in the sports entertainment world we live in , they need to be great performers on and off the course , and being able to communicate effectively with sponsors and fans is a big part of this .
“ Being a U.S. - based tour , and with the majority of our fan base , pro-am contestants , sponsors and participants being English speaking , we think it is important for our players to effectively communicate in English . ”
The L.P.G.A. and the other professional golf tours , unlike professional team sports , are dependent on their relationships with corporate sponsors for their financial survival .
July 10 , 2008 Lotus has taken a different approach to ' green ' car building with the announcement of its Eco Elise - featuring hemp - based bodywork and other renewable materials .
Taking the position that too many ' green ' cars concentrate solely on CO2 emissions at the tailpipe , Lotus has overhauled its entire manufacturing process to reduce energy and water usage , boost recycling , use locally - sourced , renewable and carbon - neutral materials , and provide dash instrumentation to encourage greener driving habits .
It 's an unique ' holistic ' approach to environmentally friendly car building - and the stunning Eco Elise should make at least two sales when the news reaches Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong .
Lotus ' new Eco Elise celebrates a new type of eco-engineering , in which the company has taken great pains to make the entire manufacturing and driving process as fuel efficient and environmentally sustainable as possible .
To that end , they 've built the body panels from a hemp resin , and used eco wool and sisal in the interior .
Paint is water - based and all materials are sourced locally to reduce the Eco Elise 's total carbon miles in production .
Drivers are asked to play their part too - while the car is light , quick and efficient , the dash features a " green shift " light instead of the usual red power shift light , showing drivers where to shift for maximal fuel efficiency and low emissions .
Fuel economy and efficiency meters are on display as well .
The British manufacturer 's building processes have been overhauled with large reductions in power , fuel and water usage , and nearly 60 % of all waste products from the process are now recycled .

Well , every once in a while something slips by the notice of even the best journalistic organization , and such appears to have been the case on a broad scale recently regarding the sale of a certain software package on the shelves of Best Buy .
Fortunately , the Linux blogosphere is always on duty , which is how we recently learned of the US $ 20 Ubuntu Hardy Heron Long Term Support package that ’s apparently been for sale at Best Buy since early May .
“ How did this development fly under the radar for over two months without anybody noticing ? ” charged SirLurksAlot on Slashdot , where more than 650 comments had followed by Friday .
Linux Loop also picked up the news — first once , then again — and so did LXer , among other forums .
Mainstream Legitimacy ?
Reactions , it ’s fair to say , were mixed at best .
“ It flew under the radar because verily nobody is stupid enough to buy something they can download legally !
Right ?
Right !? ” wrote Swizec on Slashdot .
“ I mean , come on , people do n’t even buy stuff they can download illegally anymore … ”
On the other hand : “ Things like this have a habit of gaining legitimacy in the ‘ mainstream ’ when you ’re allowed to pay for them , ” countered Viflux .
“ Unfortunately , $ 20 is n’t enough .
People will think it ’s a 2nd rate product since the cost is so much lower than Windows . ”
An Ubuntu PC ?
Indeed , in his second post on the Linux Loop , Thomas Teisberg also noted that “ just having the software hidden away on some shelf is highly unlikely to attract new Ubuntu users . ”
That , in turn , prompted his next idea : “ This made me wonder if it would be a smart move for Canonical to introduce an Ubuntu PC ? ”
The idea would be for Canonical “ to sell one , or possibly two , computers preinstalled with Ubuntu , ” he explained .
“ These computers might be sold directly by Canonical , but the main point would be to get Ubuntu - based computers in major stores , both online and physical . ”
‘ Nice to See ’
Will Hardy Heron ’s presence on the Best Buy shelves boost its mainstream acceptance ?
Will people pay $ 20 for otherwise free software ?
Is $ 20 the right price ?
LinuxInsider could n’t resist asking around .
“ It ’s nice to see Ubuntu gaining mainstream acceptance , ” Gerhard Mack , a Montreal - based consultant and Slashdot blogger , told LinuxInsider .
“ Being able to just run out and buy it instead of downloading it will also help with slower net connections . ”
Similarly : “ My very first Linux install was from a purchased box - set ( quite possibly from Best Buy ) , ” added Mhall119 , another blogger on Slashdot .
“ Amusingly , it was Caldera ’s OpenLinux , and we all know how well that worked out ( SCO ) . ”
Nevertheless , “ it was helpful having a physical manual and CD of extra packages ( drivers mostly ) , since it did n’t automatically recognize my Ethernet card . ”
‘ Not a Bad Deal ’
In general , “ I have no problem with people buying and selling Ubuntu Linux , ” Mhall119 told LinuxInsider .
“ If it comes with a good manual and DVDs with more packages than the LiveCD , it ’s not a bad deal at all , especially for people without the bandwidth to download it for free .
“ Hopefully they also include a disk of restricted drivers , legal codecs ( like the Fluendo ones ) , Wine and others to make it easy to get an off - line install doing everything you would expect from a PC , ” he added .
Even more upbeat : “ I think that having Ubuntu Linux for sale at Best Buy is ultimately a great thing for Linux in general , ” asserted Adam Kane , a blogger on Foogazi .
“ It will help bring desktop Linux into a more mainstream spotlight , as the sale of Ubuntu at Best Buy is obviously targeting current Windows users . ”
Price Concerns
Savvy , technical users might think , “ ‘ who the heck would pay $ 20 for an operating system that is completely free and available on the Internet ? ' ”
Kane noted .
“ The truth is that $ 20 is really going to the 60 - day support offer . ”
Ultimately , “ I think the best move would be for Canonical themselves to package Ubuntu and sell it on store shelves with a little bit of a higher price in relation to a year ’s worth of support , ” Kane told LinuxInsider .
“ I think that would make the product look more worthy than $ 20 .
People who do n’t understand that it is a free operating system might see that it is so cheap and think that it must not be a worthy product . ”
Therein , in fact , lies a key concern that many Linux fans appear to share .
‘ Misses the Mark ’
“ I think this misses the mark completely , ” Slashdot blogger yagu asserted .
“ The Linux crowd already knows about Ubuntu , already knows how to get it for free , and probably already has an image of it up and running somewhere on one of their 10 or 20 computers sitting around the house . ”
The Windows crowd , on the other hand , “ will see the $ 20 price tag for an alternative to Windows and have one of two reactions , ” yagu told LinuxInsider .
“ First , they ’ll see that it ’s $ 20 , which obviously indicates Ubuntu , and thus Linux , must be some shoddy knockoff of XP , or at best some novelty item not even worth considering .
If it ’s that cheap , it must be inferior !
“ Or , second , for $ 20 they may figure it ’s so cheap , it ’s worth a look , ” he added .
“ But , when they encounter their first glitch ( unsupported hardware ? , ca n’t run Photoshop ? , etc. ) , it confirms their suspicion that this product is n’t real at that price , and they ’ll abandon it without any further effort to find out if there is something worth spending more time on . ”
Loss for Linux
Either way , Linux loses , yagu believes .
“ Linux needs to be free for the technical crowd as it ’s always been , ” he said .
“ But for others , their only way to judge that Linux actually has value is by its price , since they do n’t have the technical background to understand Linux on technical merit .
When they see $ 20 , they see ‘ cheap , ’ not ‘ good . ' ”
What needs to happen , he said , is for Linux to be sold already installed , with support , at a “ market value ” price .
“ This is the only way Linux gets the imprimatur of being a real product to consumers who have no other way to decide , ” yagu concluded .
“ Linux is up to the task , but someone has to break down the barrier to entrance in the marketplace that is Microsoft . ”
Officer : May I see your Driver 's license ?
Driver : I do n't have one .
I had it suspended when I got my 5th DUI .
Officer : May I see the owner 's card for this vehicle ?
Driver :
It 's not my car .
I stole it .
Officer :
The car is stolen ?
Driver :
That 's right .
But come to think of it , I think I saw the owner 's card in the glove box when I was putting my gun in there .
Officer :
There 's a gun in the glove box ?
Driver :
Yes sir .
That 's where I put it after I shot and killed the woman who owns this car and stuffed her in the trunk .
Officer : There 's a BODY in the TRUNK ?!?!?
Driver : Yes , sir .
Hearing this , the Officer immediately called his Captain , the car was quickly surrounded by police , and the Captain approached the Driver to handle the tense situation .
Captain : Sir , can I see your license ?
Driver : Sure .
Here it is .
It was valid .
Captain :
Who 's car is this ?
Driver :
It 's mine , Here 's the registration .
Captain : Could you slowly open your glove box so I can see if there 's a gun in it ?
Driver :
Yes , sir , but there 's no gun in it .
Sure enough , there was nothing in the glove box .
Captain : Would you mind opening your trunk ?
I was told you said there 's a body in it .
Driver : No problem .
Trunk is opened ; no body .
Captain : I do n't understand it .
The Officer who stopped you said you told him you did n't have a license , stole the car , had a gun in the glove box , and that there was a dead body in the trunk .
Driver : Yeah , I 'll bet he told you I was speeding , too .
It appears the apple does n't fall far from the McSame .
The Political Base :
Almost exactly 20 years ago -- in the middle of the saving and loan crisis -- federal regulators seized Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine , California .
The takeover took place more than a year after five United States senators had tried to hold - off a government investigation by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board into Lincoln 's risky loan practices regarding home loans .
Those five senators included Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) and the chairman of Lincoln was Charles Keating -- who was not only a top McCain donor but was Cindy McCain 's business partner in a real estate deal in Arizona ( as I detailed earlier this year ) .
This scandal -- known as The Keating 5 -- remains an albatross for McCain 's political career .
As a result of Lincoln 's collapse , American taxpayers lost more than $ 2 billion on the bailout and more than 21,000 mostly elderly investors lost their life savings as a result of bankruptcy of Lincoln 's parent company .[.. ]
Well , 20 years later , we 're back in the middle of another banking crisis and federal regulators have already begun seizing insolvent banks , and this advisory ran on the wires over the weekend :
Silver State Bancorp ( NASDAQ : SSBX ) , the holding company for Silver State Bank , announced today that Andrew K. McCain submitted his resignation today as a director on the Boards of Directors of Silver State Bancorp and Silver State Bank , citing personal reasons .
Mr. McCain previously served as a director of Choice Bank in Scottsdale , Arizona from 2006 to April 1 , 2008 when Choice Bank merged into Silver State Bank .
Mr. McCain had been appointed to the Boards of the Company and Silver State Bank in February , 2008 and had served on the Audit Committee .
Andrew is none other than the son of John McCain .
On one of the walls of the Birla temple in New Delhi is engraved an unusual inscription .
Unusual , because it contains an amazing first - person account of an alchemical experiment purportedly conducted in the early 1940s in Delhi , which was witnessed by a few prominent people of that time .
It was an experiment in which mercury was successfully transformed into gold ��� or so the inscription claims .
Here 's a translation of how the inscription , in Hindi , describes the event :
" On 27 May 1942 AD ( Jyaistha Shukla 1 Samvat 1998 ) in Birla House , New Delhi Shri Pandit Krishnapal Sharma made approximately 1 tola of gold from 1 tola of mercury in front of us .
The mercury was put inside a shell of reetha .
In the mercury was mixed about 1 or 11/2 ratti of a white powder of some herb ( jari- buti ) and another yellow powder .
Then the reetha shell was closed by clay and the whole thing put into the hollow of an earthen lamp and put on fire .
For about 45 minutes , the fire was stoked by a fan till the coal got burnt completely to ashes .
The lamp was then put into water to remove the contents .
From the hollow of the earthen lamp a lump of gold was extracted .
On weighing it was found to be one or two ratti less than 1 tola .
It was very dry .
" We could not find out what these two powders were .
Pandit Krishnapal stood at a distance of 10 to 15 feet from us during this whole process .
Present at that time were Shri Amritlal B Thakkar ( prime minister , All India Hindu Sevak Sangh ) Shri Goswami Ganesh Duttji Lahore , secretary , Birla Mills , Delhi , Shri Sitaramji Kemka , chief engineer Shri Wilson and Shri Viyogi Hari .
All were quite amazed to witness the process .
We could witness this process by the kindness of Shriman Seth Jugal Kishore Birla . "
A similar inscription also exists at Varanasi's Birla temple :
" In the month of charitra mas , Samvat 1999 ( Indian calendar , 1943 ) , a resident of Punjab , staying in Kashi , one Pandit Krishnapal Rasavaidya performed the experiment in Rishikesh in the presence of Mahatma Gandhi's PA Mahadeva Desai and Goswami Ganesh Dutta and G K Birla .
Mercury provided by Desai was made into gold , about 18 kg in weight .
" This was given as donation to Samadhan Dharma Pratinidhi Sabha , Punjab which fetched Rs 72,000 to the said trust .
Sri Krishnapal repeated this experiment in the presence of Pratap Singh , Benaras Hindu University . "
What prompted the detailing of these experiments on the walls of the Birla temples ?
The reason , according to V K Mishra , administrator of the Birla temple in Delhi , was to make people aware of the vast alchemical knowledge possessed by ancient Indian rishis , who apparently knew the secret of converting mercury into gold .
In fact , there are plenty of references in ancient Indian texts to this kind of alchemy .
Researchers say that if they indeed occurred , they'd be a type of low - energy nuclear reaction , popularly termed cold fusion .
This is a field that has always been surrounded by controversy , as modern science has consistently refused to believe that cold fusion ��� essentially a nuclear reaction taking place at room temperature ��� is possible .
" With our present knowledge of the known facts of condensed matter of physics , there is no explanation for cold fusion , " admits Amit Roy , director of the Inter - University Accelerator Centre in Delhi .
" However , if proven , it could re-write the rules of science , " he adds .
Among other benefits , cold fusion could lead to the development of a clean , decentralised ( gridless ) source of power .
This opens up limitless possibilities , as virtually every house can then create its own electricity using clean sources of fuel like water , without producing any radioactive or hazardous waste .
Also , when perfected , cold fusion can yield results of the kind described in the Birla temple inscriptions .
Mahadeva Srinivasan , former associate director of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre ( BARC ) , who was among the first to conduct research in this field in India and is now one of the country 's foremost advocates of cold fusion , believes this kind of alchemical conversion is perfectly possible .
" I am personally convinced that alchemy , namely conversion of mercury to gold is true , " he asserts .
The basis of Srinivasan 's confidence lies in the research he conducted between 1989 and 1994 at BARC which , he says , yielded very positive results .
" Because of the results we got , we started pursuing this field with great interest and hope .
Unfortunately , it was killed in India by some senior scientists , " he says .
In fact , the opposition to cold fusion is n't restricted to India alone .
Ever since the first claims of this effect were made in 1989 by two Utah University researchers , scientists have viewed such claims with scepticism , primarily because the results of cold fusion experiments have not always been consistent and reproducible .
Also , not much has been understood about how and why such reactions occur .
" The physics of these reactions still remains a mystery , " says Srinivasan .
However , recent research , especially by Japanese physicist Yoshiaki Arata , has made some headway .
A demonstration conducted by Arata on May 22 reported a high degree of reproducibility , raising hopes that cold fusion reactions can perhaps become a reality .
But while China , Russia and Japan are pumping money into cold fusion research , India continues to lag behind .
" It 's ironical that funding agencies are not encouraging research in this field though it is much cheaper than many other types of atomic research underway in the country .
This is primarily because top scientists have closed their eyes to its possibilities .
It 's time they woke up to its reality , " says Srinivasan .
Sceptics might not be convinced in a hurry .
But here 's a tantalising thought :
In case cold fusion research succeeds , experiments of the kind mentioned in the Birla temple inscriptions might just turn into a scientific reality .
The leap in the unemployment rate also appeared to cool talk that the Federal Reserve might soon begin inching up interest rates in an effort to choke off rising prices for gasoline , food and other goods , and to support the weak dollar .
The Fed policy board meets again at the end of the month .
“ I do n’t think we ’ll be seeing Ben Bernanke defending the dollar anytime soon , ” said Michael T. Darda , chief economist at the research and trading firm MKM Partners , who has worried that the Fed has stoked inflation by lowering interest rates too aggressively .
“ The Fed more than anything else puts emphasis on the labor market indicators .
This will make it very difficult for the Fed to take back the easing in an expeditious fashion . ”
For six months , the Fed has been steadily lowering interest rates , which tends to spur borrowing and investment , in an effort to bolster the economy .
As inflation fears have grown , so have calls in some quarters that the Fed alter its course .
That conversation has been amplified by talk on Wall Street that the economy appeared to be stabilizing , and banks were past the worst of their mortgage - related woes .
But Friday ’s report injected a substantial note of gloom into that view .
“ We simply have n’t had five months of net job losses without being in a recession , ” said Jared Bernstein , senior economist at the labor - oriented Economic Policy Institute in Washington .
The details of the report fleshed out how economic troubles that began with the fall of real estate prices and then spread to the construction industry have continued to ripple out to other areas of the economy .
Many homeowners who are no longer able to borrow against the values of their houses have been cutting their spending , shrinking sales at shopping malls , grocery stores and home improvement outlets .
That has prompted to businesses to cut payrolls , taking more purchasing power out of the economy .
Construction again led the way down in May , shedding 34,000 more jobs , according to the report .
Profession and business services  which includes lawyers , accounts , architects and management consultants  declined by 39,000 .
Manufacturing lost 26,000 jobs as the sector continued its steady decline .
Retail payrolls shrunk by 27,000 jobs , and transportation and warehousing by 10,500 .

Remember the GTA : San Andreas Hot Coffee scandal ?
Of course you do n’t , you were busy updating your Bebo profile , chatting on MSN messenger , patiently explaining to people why Limewire was so much better than YouTube , and all those other archaic things we used to do .
Ah , the heady days of youth .
Rest assured though , Hot Coffee nearly brought the games industry to its knees , and certainly not in a good kind of ‘ Thai massage ’ way either .
A naughty hacker squirreled deep within the game ’s code and discovered a desperately unexciting sex - based mini game and produced a patch to unlock it .
At the time , parenting groups , senators and insane soon - to - be - ex lawyers jumped on the scandal and had a field day , but what did the general public really think ?
Apparently they were the rationally minded ones .
A class -action lawsuit sought compensation for all those who were shocked to discover these grotesque digital parodies of the act of love making , but even though the case was won , only 2,676 claims have been filed .
Considering the 8.5 million units sold in North America , we can safely call that ‘ fuck all ’ .
The lawyers all now feel decidedly stupid as this essentially shows that they can get all riled up about something incredibly inconsequential , and that may make potential clients think twice before bothering to wave the class - action banner in future .
Or , y’know , they are guilty of bringing a meritless suit to trial .
“ Am I disappointed ?
Sure , ” said Seth R. Lesser , lead lawyer for the plaintiffs .
“ We ca n’t guess as to why now , several years later , people care or do n’t care .
The merits of the case were clear . ”
Yep .
I think I get it – it is possible to be offended for buying a game , downloading a patch to unlock sexual scenes that were never accessible or even intended to be in the standard over - the - counter content , then watching them .
Oh , and then wanting money for it .
Clear as mud .
Possibly the fact that a number of years have passed since the case started and the best ‘ compensation ’ you can hope for is a $ 35 payout might explain some of the lacklustre uptake .
Rockstar is believed to have lost around $ 2.5 m over the incident , taking into account the legal fees , payouts , charitable donations , production alterations , etc .
There ’s just no way of knowing how many people bought the game simply to access the scandalous sex scenes after the story broke .
GTA IV , however , made over $ 500 m in its first week of sale .
Go figure .

As former President Bill Clinton took the stage , the moment of Democratic unity that so many have been waiting to see occurred , the long standing ovation Clinton got sent the message that the primary battle is forgotten , and all Democrats are behind Barack Obama .
Clinton started off by endorsing Obama / Biden , “ I am honored to be here tonight to support Barack Obama .
And to warm up the crowd for Joe Biden , though as you ’ll soon see , he does n’t need any help from me .
I love Joe Biden , and America will too .
What a year we Democrats have had .
The primary began with an all - star line up and came down to two remarkable Americans locked in a hard fought contest to the very end .
The campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming . ”
President Clinton masterfully laid out case for Obama , “ Hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she ’ll do everything she can to elect Barack Obama .
That makes two of us .
Actually that makes 18 million of us – because , like Hillary , I want all of you who supported her to vote for Barack Obama in November .
Here ’s why .
Our nation is in trouble on two fronts :
The American Dream is under siege at home , and America ’s leadership in the world has been weakened . ”

He used his experience as a way of vouching for Obama , “ Clearly , the job of the next President is to rebuild the American Dream and restore America ’s standing in the world .
Everything I learned in my eight years as President and in the work I ’ve done since , in America and across the globe , has convinced me that Barack Obama is the man for this job . ”
Mr. Clinton made it clear that he thinks Obama is ready to lead , “ Barack Obama is ready to lead America and restore American leadership in the world .
Ready to preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States .
Barack Obama is ready to be President of the United States . ”
Clinton then laid out why Obama / Biden is the right choice on all of the issues . ”
He also spoke about the Republican failures and said that McCain promises more of the same , “ They took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt ; from over 22 million new jobs down to 5 million ; from an increase in working family incomes of $ 7,500 to a decline of more than $ 2,000 ; from almost 8 million Americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and a half million falling into poverty – and millions more losing their health insurance .
Now , in spite of all the evidence , their candidate is promising more of the same :
More tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans that will swell the deficit , increase inequality , and weaken the economy .
More band - aids for health care that will enrich insurance companies , impoverish families and increase the number of uninsured .
More going it alone in the world , instead of building the shared responsibilities and shared opportunities necessary to advance our security and restore our influence . ”
Clinton compared his 1992 campaign to Barack Obama , My fellow Democrats , sixteen years ago , you gave me the profound honor to lead our party to victory and to lead our nation to a new era of peace and broadly shared prosperity .
Together , we prevailed in a campaign in which the Republicans said I was too young and too inexperienced to be Commander - in - Chief .
Sound familiar ?
It did n’t work in 1992 , because we were on the right side of history .
And it wo n’t work in 2008 , because Barack Obama is on the right side of history . ”
“ Barack Obama will lead us away from division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope .
If , like me , you still believe America must always be a place called Hope , then join Hillary , Chelsea and me in making Senator Barack Obama the next President of the United States , ” Clinton concluded .
Bill Clinton delivered the endorsement that not only he could deliver , but it was an endorsement that he had to deliver .
With one swoop , Bill Clinton rehabbed his own image within the Democratic Party , and gave Obama the serious hard sell .
I think we can now put the idea to bed that the Democratic Party is somehow fractured .
The bar has now been set really , really , high for Obama tomorrow night .

It 's time to return to the vector space monad .
But first , after some Haskell preamble , I need to talk about the Einstein summation convention .
We 're going to be dealing with multidimensional arrays of values that I 'll call tensors .
We can refer to the individual elements of these arrays by providing tuples of indices drawn from some set of indices .
For example we might refer to the elements of a 10 by 10 array by using pairs of indices , each drawn from the set { 0,1,2 , ...,9} .
We 'll write some indices as subscripts and some as superscripts .
Here are some examples : v , w , T , W. vmeans the ith value in array v , Tmeans the ( i , j ) - th element of T and so on .
We can form sums over such indices like thiswhere the sum is over the corresponding index sets for j and k .
The Einstein summation convention is simply this : if an expression has an index repeated once as a subscript and once as a superscript then we implicitly assume a sum over the index without writing the summation symbol .
So the above expression becomes simply The vector space monad allows us to express something similar using do - notation .
Let 's use the typefor our index set , so we 're selecting elements of our arrays using the values { False , True} rather than integers .
Let ebe the ( 2 - dimensional ) vector with the property that its j - component is 1 for j=i and 0 for j≠i .
In do - notation this is represented by .
We use superscripts to indicate the components of a vector so the components of eare e .
We can write the vector v=3e - 5ea , with components ( 3 , - 5 ) asDual to vectors we have covectors .
You can think of these as linear functions that consume vectors and return reals .
We can define a basis of covectors fwith the property that f(e ) is 1 for i=j and 0 otherwise .
In our Haskell code it 'll be more convenient to think of covectors as mapping vectors to the one - dimensional vector space whose basis element is labelled by .
When we make a vector using an expression like , thatis a constructor for the type .
We expect to use the dual operation for covectors , and that dual is case analysis .
So , for example , we can write w = f+2*f , wih components ( 1,2 ) , asApplying w to v gives the expression vusing the summation convention .
Using do - notation it looks like
The point to note is that just like with the summation convention , we do n't need to explicitly sum over i.
i serves as a kind of iterator object and a vector v automatically supplies i with values in the appropriate range .
w then consumes i.
So we can translate the summation convention to do - notation by thinking of upper indices corresponding to places that iterators can emerge from , and thinking of lower indices as places where iterators can be consumed .
Another example is matrix representing a transformation of a vector to a vector .
It must consume one iterator and emit another one .
In the Einstein summation convention such a transformation might be written r=M .
We could write a simple 2D 2 x scale and 90 degree rotation matrix asWe can then write the transformation asAnother simple example is an inner product .
We can represent the ordinary dot product as a matrix dand write the square length of v as v .
v = d .
We can implement this aswhere we defineSimilarly , tuples of superscripts correspond to iterators that are tuples of indices .
With that in place , we 're now in a position to consider what monadic notation for knots means in the vector - space - overmonad .
Essentially what we 're doing is representing ' components ' of a tangle or knot , the cups , caps and crossings , as tensors .
When we glue these components with labels we 're forming sums .
In fact , each labelled edge connecting two components corresponds to an index and so we can think of it as possibly taking two different values , or .
So the monadic expression corresponds to a sum over all possible ways to assign values fromto the indices with a corresponding weight for each term .
This should be familiar to some people , it 's just like what takes place in statistical thermodynamics .
We consider a bunch of particles and form a sum over all of the possible states that those particles could have , with a corresponding weight for each configuration of states .
A good example is the Ising model in which electrons sit at the vertices of a regular lattice .
Two neighbouring electrons in a ferromagnet tend to want to align the same way , so confgurations in which neighbouring electrons have the same spin will get assigned a higher weight .
In our tangle problem , the trick is to find a magic set of weights with the property that two different summations representing isotopic knots or tangles give the same result .
This turns out to be too hard , but we relax it a bit we will be led to one of the most fruitful new approaches in knot theory in recent years - the Jones Polynomial .
Vaughan Jones was investigating certain types of model from statistical mechanics and came to realise that some of the equations that were arising were the same ones needed to get suitable weights for knot theory .
From this realisation emerged his eponymous polynomial .
But , that 's all I 'll be saying about this polynomial in this post .
Anyway , to make things clearer here 's an example :
We interpretandas the tensors M , N , Sand T .
In monadic notation we getWith the summation convention in mind this evaluates to : and without it we see that all we 're doing is computing We can try an elementary choice for our tensors above .
We can define M and N to be given by identity matrices :
We can then choose S and T to simply swap their arguments :
With these choices , the weighting is such that a non -zero weight is assigned to a knot or tangle if and only if all of the labels along a single strand are assigned the same value , in other words we 're now summing over ways of assigning labels to entire strands .
For rational tangles we can only end up with three possible values corresponding to the three ways the two outputs can be connected to the two inputs .
( Straight through , the tangle I called ∞ ; straight through with a swap , the tangle called - 1 ; and connecting together both the inputs , and both the outputs , the tangle called 0 . )
Onlysucceeds so we knowis a tangle that forms its outputs by swapping the inputs .
So even with this simple assignment we 're able to extract some basic connectivity information from our monadic representation .
With smarter choices we 'll get more information , but that 's enough for now .
We now have the prerequisites and in the next installment we can start doing some proper knot theory .
While the Pirate Party might be well known in Sweden , and heard of elsewhere around Europe , it 's not really taken off in the country that prides itself as being ' the land of the free ' .
Unperturbed , the US Pirate Party has soldiered on and with the preliminary release of data from it 's first study , it 's hitting back at the media lobbyists .
Claims by the music or film industries that ‘ piracy is costing billions ’ are commonplace .
In 2005 , for instance , the MPAA funded the LEK study , which claimed that over $ 6 billion was lost to MPAA members due to piracy .
However , the figures and data behind those claims have never been publicly released , a fact underscored this past January when the MPAA had to release a statement saying ‘ they made a mistake ’ in one of the figures .
It ’s a figure that ’s been quoted a lot , to this day , and was something that rankled US Pirate Party Administrator , Andrew Norton .
“ I was tired of seeing those claims on every press release , ” he tells TorrentFreak , “ knowing there was no evidence to back them up .
They could have said that the loss was $ 20 billion , if they think they could bluff it out .
The sad fact is that we have news outlets , and politicians quoting this figure as fact , and yet not one verified any claim .
If I said I could turn lead into gold , I would be bombarded with requests to prove it .
They have turned air into $ 6 billion , and supposedly smart people accept it without question . ”
Frustrated , Norton decided he should study the MPAA ’s own figures .
When he could n’t find any data to support their claims , he decided that there needed to be a study of the data the MPAA did put out .
“ I was thinking about where I could look , when the MPAA announced a new record year , and I thought ‘ of course ’ .
The MPAA can hardly question the accuracy of the data published by its members , and itself . ”
The preliminary findings of the study , published today , show a different picture to the one the MPAA paints .
Norton took the view that the films most likely to be distributed on filesharing networks , and sold on street corners , would be the big blockbuster films , and so he should look at the top 10 films of each year .
The results from that are shown below .
With average growth throughout the time period , it would seem that claims of cinema piracy hurting box office figures ( leading to cinemas issuing night vision goggles to staff , and teenagers being charged with crimes for recording 20 - second clips ) are unfounded .
When certain p2 p protocol lifespans are marked on the graph , for comparison , the MPAA claims are pretty much shattered .
Mr. Norton is also aware that he will have to prove he is not just making things up .
The US Pirate Party , who is publishing the study , has stated that all data used in the study will be available when the full study will published at the end of July .
He does have a comment for the MPAA however .
“ Prove your claims , or shut up about them . ”
Spider ' kills ' pet dog after paratrooper accidentally brings it home from Afghanistan
When Rodney Griffiths came home on leave from Afghanistan , he thought he was leaving the perils of the desert behind .
But a little bit of danger had hitched a ride back with him .
A camel spider has been seen scuttling across the floor of the paratrooper 's home - and is thought to have killed the family 's pet dog Bella .
Forced out : Lorraine Griffiths and her children Ellie - Rose ( l ) , Ricky ( c ) and Cassie ( r ) have left their Essex home after spotting a camel spider roaming free
Now his wife Lorraine and their children Cassie , 18 , Ricky , 16 , and Ellie - Rose , four , have been forced to move out until the creature is found .
Mrs Griffiths , 37 , thinks the hairy , sandy - coloured spider is nesting in Cassie 's bedroom .
She has left out traps and plates of raw mince in the bedroom .
The meat has been devoured , but so far the spider has managed to escape .
The camel spider , which grows up to six inches long , belongs to a group of arachnids called solifugae .
It can run at up to 10 mph and feeds on insects and small animals .
Mrs Griffiths said the spider appeared after her husband , 32 , returned in June
from a four - month tour in Helmand province with the 16 Air Assault Brigade .
Mr Griffiths has now returned to the desert .
Camel spiders can deliver a nasty bite but are not venomous enough to kill humans .
However Mrs Griffiths believes it could have killed family dog Bella
She said : ' My son Ricky was in my bedroom looking for his underwear and he went into the drawer under my bed and something crawled across his hand .
' He saw a huge spider and screamed to his sister Cassie .
' They tried to put a pint glass over it but it was too big , they poked it with a coat hanger and the spider bit it .
' The dog came in , jumped on the bed and barked at it .
The spider hissed and Bella went running out whimpering .
' There was an electrician in the house and he came and looked but just ran out of the house . '
Mrs Griffiths , a care worker , got a description of the creature from the workman and her children and scoured the internet until they picked out a camel spider .
She said : ' They said it was the size of a palm , sandy coloured with a pink body and red knees .
' I think it must have hitched a lift back with my husband in June so it 's been in my house for seven weeks .
' He 's back out there now , I called him and he said one of his friends had been bitten by one .
I 'm petrified of spiders , I can not live in that house until it 's gone . '
Last week Bella , eight , was taken to the vet with a high temperature and swollen stomach .
Blood tests revealed a low white cell count and she had to be put down .
Mrs Griffiths said : ' She was an active healthy dog .
It seems too much of a coincidence that she died at the same time that we saw the spider .
' I wondered if she had been bitten or if it sprayed something into her face when it hissed at her .
' The vet said they would n't know without an autopsy but said there could have been an underlying condition which was brought on with the stress of it all . '
To catch an arachnid : Mrs Griffiths has laid traps to try and snare the spider
An Army welfare officer has scoured the house but not found any sign of the intruder .
The RSPCA came and caught another spider which they have not been able to identify but which Mrs Griffiths says is a different , much smaller creature .
The family has left the army home in Colchester and is staying with Mrs Griffiths 's mother Jennifer Meason until the spider is caught .
Mrs Griffiths added : ' I 've searched the house and can't find it , I do n't know what to do .
' I just want to get back in there but I can't with that spider in there . '
Iain Newby , of the Dangerous and Wild Animals Rescue Facility in Essex , said it is common for travellers to bring back unwanted souvenirs .
' We get calls all the time from people who have unpacked their suitcase and found a gecko from Spain or a frog from Namibia , ' he said .
' It 's perfectly possibly this man has folded up the sand spider in his clothes and accidentally brought it home with him .
' Camel spiders are also called sun spiders .
They have a huge head and massive mandibles and it gives a nasty painful bite .
It is venomous but would not kill you . '
A spokesman for the RSPCA said : ' We would advise people with creatures like these to try to contain them otherwise they are difficult to catch .
' If it is the spider they believe it is then normally they do n't attack humans but they could give a painful bite . '
Combine a housing meltdown with election - year politics and the results were not going to be pretty .
Add a crisis in confidence in Washington 's favorite quasipublic companies and what we 're getting is a rout for taxpayers , especially those who kept their heads during the housing mania .
The House yesterday passed a housing bailout by 272-152 .
The White House has thrown its reservations overboard and is begging to sign this boondoggle , despite the less - than - veto - proof majority .
A few brave souls in the Senate are threatening ...
BRITISH GRAND PRIX , Silverstone
Friday : Practice 1000 and 1400 BST Saturday : Final practice 1000 BST ; Qualifying 1300 BST Sunday : Race 1300 BST
Live coverage : Practice on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra , qualifying and race on Radio 5 Live and BBC Sport website ; text commentary on BBC Sport website By Andrew Benson
Coulthard is heading into his last British Grand Prix this weekend David Coulthard will bring his 14 - year Formula
One driving career to a close at the end of the season .
The 37 - year - old Scot , who won 13 races , made his announcement on the eve of Sunday 's British Grand at Silverstone , which will be his 237th Grand Prix .
Coulthard drove for Williams and McLaren and is now at Red Bull Racing , where he will continue as a consultant .
" My decision was taken earlier this year and is based on a desire to stop while I am still competitive , " he said .
" I 'm still enjoying the immense challenge that Grand Prix driving represents .
I also have the desire to look for new challenges within the sport .
" I will remain actively involved in the sport as a consultant to Red Bull , focusing on testing and development of the cars .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" I have an open mind if I will compete again in the future , in some other form of motorsport , so I am definitely not hanging up my helmet .
" The decision to make this announcement at the British Grand Prix should be an obvious one for all to understand , as I have achieved two of my F1 victories at Silverstone and I am a member of the British Racing Drivers ' Club , which hosts this event .
Coulthard , the oldest driver in F1 , made it clear ahead of the British Grand Prix that he still loved driving and was content with his career in the sport .
" If you had told me when I started in 1994 that I would retire after 15 seasons , I would have bought that , " Coulthard told BBC Radio 5 Live .
" I never dreamt I would last that long .
This plane crash in 2000 changed Coulthard 's perspective on life " To have raced against the most successful driver in the history of our sport in the case of Michael Schumacher and to have finished second to him in a world championship is no embarrassment .
" I will finish at the end of the season feeling fulfilled .
I had a chance to win a championship , I had a winning car .
" I did n't achieve the championship win but I did achieve race victories , so I wo n't walk away thinking ' if only I had that chance ' .
" Winning a championship would have been fantastic but it does n't mean that I do n't sleep well at night or that I do n't have a great life .
I think I have been very fortunate .
" Some people are good enough and some just do n't have that last little bit - that is something I can deal with quite comfortably . "
606 : DEBATE
Whenever I think of F1 he is one of the drivers I instantly think of - the man is F1
GT Coulthard , who won the British Grand Prix in 1999 and 2000 , began his F1 career in 1994 , when he was promoted from his role as test driver at Williams following the death of Ayrton Senna .
He won his first race in Portugal in 1995 , and moved to McLaren for 1996 .
He spent much of his career there in the shadow of Mika Hakkinen , who won the world title in 1998 and 1999 when Coulthard was his team - mate .
But the best season of his career came in 2001 when he finished second in the drivers ' standings to a dominant Schumacher .
Coulthard remains one of the most liked figures in F1 , and is widely admired for his honesty , honour and a sense of humour that did not always come across to the public .
" I could have been killed in 2000 when my plane crashed , I could have been killed at various other points of my life during the journey I have been on , but I 'm still here , " he added .
" I have had a great career - better to be a has - been than a never - been .
F1 is unique no question , but it is wrong to say nothing can replace that . "
Coulthard won 13 races , including this one in Brazil in 2001 Red Bull team boss Christian Horner paid tribute to his driver as " a consummate professional " .
" He has demonstrated that he is a real team player , a fact reinforced by the statistic that he has only driven for two other F1 teams in his career , " said Horner .
" He scored our first point , our first podium and was the first of our drivers to lead a Grand Prix .
Above all , he is a gentleman and I regard him as a good friend .
" His retirement brings to a close not just his career as a Grand Prix racing driver but also a chapter in the history of F1 , if one considers the changes the sport has been through while he has been involved with it . "

The Many Faces of Lily Allen ( Photos )
Singerseems to be having a rough summer by the looks of these photos .
Best known for " Smile " and " LDN " , Allen has finished her second album Stuck on the Naughty Step - a great title for the party girl .
Planning for her future , Allen does n't seem too secure about her new album 's success and said in an interview that if people do n't like her new album , she plans to quit singing and pursue doing A&R .
Lily thinks she might enjoy trying her hand at scouting and artist development for a recording company because she enjoying going to concerts .
Hmmm , sounds like Lily may be ready for a change of pace .
It will be interesting to see what comes of her new album and if she follows through with her plans .
Maybe Lily really needs a vacation with a little R&R.
Check out the photo gallery below .

[ Subtitled , " Familiar Conversations on the Manner in which Wealth Is Produced , Distributed , and Consumed , " this essay is excerpted from the book , Letters to Mr. Malthus . .
It appears appears in print in this volume . ]
I . On the Composition of Wealth and the Use of Money
What do you understand by the word wealth ?
Whatever has a value ; gold , silver , land , merchandise …
Are not gold and silver preferable to other wealth ?
That is preferable in which the greatest value is to be found .
One hundred and ten guineas in corn are preferable to one hundred guineas in gold .
But , where the value is equal , is not the money better than the merchandise ?
In fact , it is preferred .
What is the reason of it ?
The custom generally established of using money as a medium in exchanges , renders that species of merchandise more convenient than any other for those who have purchases to make ; that is , for everybody .
What do you mean by money being a medium of exchanges ?
If you are a farmer and desire to exchange a part of your corn for cloth , you begin by procuring money for your corn ; then with that money you buy cloth .
Without doubt .
You have in reality made a double exchange , in which you have given corn to one man , and another has given cloth to you .
That is true .
The value of this corn was transitorily in money , afterwards in cloth ; and though you have in fact exchanged your corn for cloth , money was the intermediate form which that value assumed in order to change itself into cloth .
Such is the use of money .
Well !
But if all these values are equal , why is that of money preferred ?
Because , when a man once possesses money , he need make only one exchange , in order to obtain what he may want ; while he who possesses every other merchandise has two exchanges to make .
He must , in the first place , exchange his merchandise for money , and afterwards his money for merchandise .
Can you make use of any other thing for this purpose instead of money ?
Yes ; there are countries in which shells and other articles are used ; but the metals , and principally gold and silver , are of all materials , the most convenient to be used as money .
It is that which has caused them to be adopted by all civilized and commercial nations .
Then in those countries in which shells are used as money , they are the objects which , the value being equal , are preferred in exchanges ?
They are so in effect : but the precious metals are more sought after than the other monies , because they possess , as merchandise , certain advantages that increase the preference they possess as money .
They contain much value in small bulk , which permits them to be easily concealed and carried from place to place ; they do not spoil by keeping ; they may be divided or reunited at will , almost without loss ; in fine , they are valuable all over the world , and whatever frequented place we travel to with this sort of wealth , we are sure , on more or less favorable conditions , to be able to exchange it for whatever we may want .
I comprehend the reason why money , and , above all , money of gold and silver , is more desirable than any other merchandise ; but how can we procure it ?
As we procure everything else that we want , by an exchange when we have not a mine that produces it ; in the same way that we procure fruit when we do not possess the tree that bears it .
How can we obtain a thing in order to give it in exchange for money ?
Produce it .
Produce a thing !
But supposing that possible , how shall I be certain that I shall get money for that thing ?
You may assure yourself of that by giving it a value .
But how can a value be given to things ?
We shall see that in the following chapters .
II .
On the Utility and Value of Products
What do you understand by the word products ?
I understand all those things to which men have consented to give a value .
How is value given to a thing ?
By giving it utility .
How is the utility of a thing the cause of its having a value ?
Because persons are then to be found who are in want of this thing ; they desire to have it from those who produce it .
These , on their side , will not part from it until they are paid the expenses they have been at in producing it , including their profits .
The value of the thing is established by the result of this opposition between the producer and the consumer .
But there are many things of great utility , and no value , as water .
Why have they no value ?
Because nature gives them gratuitously , and without stint , and we are not obliged to produce them .
If a person was able to create water , and wished to sell it , no one would buy it , because it could be got at the river for nothing .
Thus all the world enjoys these things , but they are not riches to anybody .
If all things that men could desire were in the same case , no one would be rich , but no one would be in want of riches , since each could enjoy all things at his pleasure .
But this is not the case : the greater part of things which are necessary and even indispensable to us are not given to us gratuitously and unlimitedly .
Human industry must , with pains and labor , collect , fashion , and transport them .
They then become products .
The utility , the faculty they have acquired of being serviceable , gives them a value and this value is riches .
When once riches are thus created they may be exchanged for other riches , other values , and we may procure the products we want in exchange for those we can spare .
We have seen in the preceding chapter how money facilitates this exchange .
I now conceive how products alone are riches ; but their utility does not appear to be the only cause that gives them value ; for there are products , such as rings and artificial flowers , which have value but no utility .
You do not discover the utility of these products because you call only useful that which is so to the eye of reason , but you ought to understand by that word whatever is capable of satisfying the wants and desires of man such as he is .
His vanity and his passions are to him wants , sometimes as imperious as hunger .
He is the sole judge of the importance that things are of to him , and of the want he has of them .
We cannot judge of it but by the price he puts on them .
The value of things is the sole measure of their utility to man .
It is enough for us to give them utility in his eyes in order to give them a value .
Now that is what we call to produce , to create products .
Recapitulate what you have said .
Give to anything , to a material that has no value , utility , and you give it a value ; that is , you make a product of it , you create wealth .
One can then create wealth ?
Incontestably .
I thought that man could not create anything .
He cannot create matter : he cannot make the laws that regulate nature ; but with existing matter and the laws of nature such as they are , he can give a value to certain things , and consequently can create wealth .
What country may be called a rich country ?
One in which many things of value , or more briefly , many values are to be found ; in the same manner as a family that possesses many of these values is a rich family .
III .
On Production
You have told me that to produce is to give utility to things : how is utility given ?
How are we to produce ?
In an infinity of ways ; but for our convenience we may arrange , in three classes , every manner of producing .
What is the first manner of producing ?
It consists in collecting or gathering together those things nature creates , either without the intervention of man , such as fish and minerals ; or , such as men have , by the cultivation of the earth , and by means of seeds , induced and assisted nature to produce .
All these works are alike in their object .
They are called Agricultural Industry .
What utility is given to a thing by him who finds it ready made to his hands ; as the fisherman who takes a fish , or the miner who collects minerals ?
He renders it fit for use .
The fish , while it is in the sea , is useless .
As soon as it is brought to the market we can make use of it .
In like manner , it is in vain that coal exists in the bosom of the earth ; while there , it is of no utility ; it neither warms us , nor heats the iron in the forge : it is the industry of the miner that makes it fit for these purposes .
He creates , by extracting it from the earth , all the value that it has when extracted .
How does the cultivator create value ?
The materials , of which a sack of corn is composed , are not drawn from nothing ; they existed before the corn was corn : they were diffused through the earth , the water , and the air , and had no value whatever .
The industry of the cultivator , in taking measures to bring these different matters together , first under the form of grain , and afterwards of a sack of corn , created a value that they had not before .
It is the same with all the other products of agriculture .
What is the second manner of producing ?
It consists in giving to the product of another industry a greater value , by the new forms we give to it , by the changes that it is made to undergo .
The miner procures the metal of which a buckle is made ; but a buckle , when made , is worth more than the metal of which it is formed .
The value of the buckle above that of the metal is a value produced , and the buckle is the product of two kinds of industry : of that of the miner , and that of the manufacturer .
This last is called manufacturing industry .
What works are included in manufacturing industry ?
It includes the most ordinary as well as the most exquisite workmanship , the form given by a rough village artisan to a pair of wooden shoes , as well as that given to a piece of jewelry .
It includes alike the work executed by a single cobbler in his stall , and by hundreds of workmen in a vast manufactory .
What is the third manner of producing ?
We produce also by buying a product in one place , where it is of a less value , and conveying it to another , where it is of greater value .
This is the work of commercial industry .
How does commercial industry produce utility , as it neither changes the form nor the substance of a product , which is sold just as it is bought ?
Commercial industry acts like the fisherman … it takes a product from a place where … uses are less extensive , less precious — to a place where they are more so , or where its production is less easy , less abundant , and dearer .
It acts like the fisherman , of whom we have just spoken ; it takes a product from a place where it cannot be used — from a place , at least , where its uses are less extensive , less precious — to a place where they are more so , or where its production is less easy , less abundant , and dearer .
Wood is little used , and consequently of very limited utility in the mountains , where it so far exceeds the wants of the inhabitants , that it is sometimes left to rot ; this utility , however , becomes very considerable when the same wood is transported into a city .
Hides are of little value in South America , where they have a great number of wild animals : the same skins have a great value in Europe , where their production is expensive , and their uses much more multiplied .
Commercial industry , in bringing them , augments their value by all the difference between their price in Brazil and their price in Europe .
What is comprehended under the term commercial industry ?
Every species of industry that takes a product from one place and transports it to another , where it is more precious , and which thus brings it within the reach of those who want it .
It includes also , by analogy , the industry that , by retailing a product , brings it within the reach of small consumers .
Thus the grocer , who buys merchandise in gross to resell it in detail in the same town ; and the butcher , who buys whole beasts to resell them piece by piece , exercises commercial industry .
Is there not great similarity between these different modes of producing ?
The greatest .
They all consist in taking a product in one state , and delivering it in another , in which it has a greater utility and a higher value .
They may be all reduced to one species .
If we distinguish them here , it is to facilitate the study of their results , but , notwithstanding all our distinctions , it is often very difficult to separate one kind of industry from another .
A villager who makes baskets is a manufacturer ; when he carries them to market , he becomes commercial .
But no matter by which means , the moment that we create or that we augment the utility of things , we augment their value ; we exercise an industry ; we produce wealth .
For shortness , agricultural industry may be called agriculture ; manufacturing industry may be called manufactures ; and commercial industry , commerce .
IV .
On the Operations Common to all the Species of Industry
I have just seen that agriculture , manufactures , and commerce are productive of wealth ; by what means do they attain that end ?
An industrious undertaking , whatever it may be , is an enterprise in which a man decides , what part of the material and of the laws of the physical and moral world he is able to apply to the production of a useful thing .
What do you understand by the laws of the physical world ?
I understand the laws to which material beings are subjected ; thus , metals are softened by heat : this is a physical law .
Give me an example of the use of this physical law in any industrious enterprise ?
A blacksmith , who uses heat to soften a piece of iron of which he makes a horseshoe , is the entrepreneur of a manufacturing industry , who avails himself of that physical law ; in the same manner , the merchant , who fits out a vessel , uses for the purpose of sending it beyond seas , the power of the winds , which are themselves the effects of some other law of the physical world .
What do you understand by the laws of the moral world ?
They are the rules to which we are subjected by the customs , the wants , and the will of mankind .
Give me an instance in which the entrepreneur of any industry consults the laws of the moral world ?
He consults them when he informs himself of the manners , the wants , and the legislation of men , which may either enable him to procure the materials for his industry , or furnish him with consumers of his products .
Some of these laws belong to the nature of man , others to the manners of the country and age in which we live .
He who takes into his calculation human vanity , runs little risk of deceiving himself .
A hatter who carries on , in a proper manner , his business among us has a lucrative occupation .
He would have gained nothing among the ancients , who did not wear hats .
Who are those who study the laws of the physical world ?
Those who cultivate the physical and mathematical sciences : such as chemists , naturalists , geometricians , etc .
Who are those who study the laws of the moral world ?
Those who inform themselves of morals , politics , history , geography , travels , etc .
I understand : the learned serve as guides to the industrious ?
Just so : and the work of the one , as well as the other , is productive , since they concur in creating products .
It is only in civilized and enlightened countries that we see a very great and productive industry .
It is there only that we find that great mass of acquired knowledge , of which the industrious , the agriculturists , manufacturers , and merchants , avail themselves .
Are the learned , and the entrepreneurs of works of industry , the only industrious men ?
No .
There are also workmen under the direction of the entrepreneurs of works of industry .
When a workman carries on an enterprise on his own account , as the knife grinder in the streets , he is both workman and entrepreneur .
V. On Capital and Land
Is it sufficient for an entrepreneur of industry to have the talents and judgment that constitutes his industry ?
No : his judgment and his talent would be exercised upon nothing .
He must possess , besides those , the materials on which he would employ his industry , and the indispensable implements to carry it into effect .
All these things have a value previously acquired , and this value is called capital .
I thought that capital was a sum of money , and not materials and utensils ?
The value of a capital at the moment in which it is borrowed may have the form of money : but it has it only transitorily , in the same manner that the corn which a producer of corn desires to exchange for cloth , is exchanged in the first place for money , which is to be again exchanged for cloth .
The values which we save , in order to be employed as capitals are , in the same manner , products which we successively exchange for money , and when we desire to use them as capital , we exchange them again for products necessary to production .
You say that capital is composed of products , that is to say , of things or values produced by the industry of man : a capital is then always a value which is moveable ?
No : the products of human industry may be either moveable or immoveable .
A house is a product of human industry .
In works of agriculture , besides the value of the land , which may be considered as a great and admirable instrument in the hands of man , and which , on this account , makes part of his capital , the clearings , the buildings , and the enclosures , which are improvements of this grand instrument , are products of industry .
Are there not also moveable values in the capital of an agriculturist ?
Yes ; the implements of labor , the cattle , the seed , as well as the provisions for his family , his servants , and his animals : and even the money that is destined for the outgoings which his undertaking requires .
Tell me of what the capital of a manufacturer ; a weaver , for example , consists .
It is composed of the value of his first material , which may be either cotton , flax , wool , or silk : also of his looms , shuttles , and other implements : and , in fact , of every value which he is obliged to advance for his own maintenance as well as that of his workmen .
If the value of the capital is employed in the purchase of all these things , how is it that it is not lost ?
Because the result of all these things is a ribbon or a cloth , the value of which reimburses the capital , and pays besides to the weaver the profits of his industry .
In the same manner , the capital of the merchant consists principally of the value of the merchandise in which he trades , and this merchandise , augmenting in value in his hands , represents at all times his capital increased by his profits .
How does a man , engaged in industry , know whether the value of his capital is increased or diminished ?
By an inventory ; that is , by a detailed account of all that he possesses , in which everything is valued according to its current price .
VI .
On the Formation of Capital
I see that to create values , that is , riches , industrious talents and capital are necessary .
I can conceive that industrious talents may be acquired by study and practice ; but how is capital to be procured ?
It must be created , or borrowed of those who have created it .
How can it be created ?
To answer this question , it is necessary to begin by giving some notions on consumption , although this is not the proper place , and it ought to be developed hereafter .
What do you understand by consumption ?
Consumption is the opposite of production : it is a destruction of values produced .
We cannot destroy matter any more than we can create it ; but we can destroy the utility that has been given to it ; and , in destroying its utility , we destroy its value .
That is what is called " to consume . "
We do not wantonly destroy things of value : what end is proposed in doing so ?
Either to procure an enjoyment or else to reproduce another value .
The consumption of food or clothing is an enjoyment : it has no other result .
Reproductive consumption is neither so simple nor so easy .
In what does it consist ?
It consists in the industrious destruction of one value , so as to produce another in place of that which is destroyed , and which exceeds it in value sufficiently to pay for the industry employed in the operation .
Thus the agriculturist who sows a grain of corn destroys the value of it , but he does not destroy it in the same manner as he who eats it : he destroys it in such manner as that it shall be reproduced with profit : and even if he employs this grain or many grains in feeding fowls , he still destroys the value of this grain ; but as he increases the value of the fowls , he produces a value which usually replaces , with profit , the value which was consumed .
This is called reproductive consumption .
Everything that a man consumes for his own use is then an unproductive consumption ?
No , not all .
When eatables , drinkables , or wearing apparel , are consumed by men who are at the same time employed in producing a value equal , or superior , to what they consume , it becomes a reproductive consumption .
It is so much the more reproductive as the value of the products which these men have created during the consumption exceeds the value of those they have consumed .
Give me examples of reproductive consumption drawn from manufacturing industry ?
Besides the maintenance of his workmen and agents , a manufacturer consumes the materials which he transforms .
He consumes , also , although more slowly , the utensils he employs .
Thus a soap maker consumes , reproductively , oil , soda , wood , or coal , cauldrons , etc. and even the place and workshops in which he exercises his industry .
Give me examples of reproductive consumption in commercial industry ?
A merchant consumes the value of the maintenance of his workmen , that is , of his carriers , lightermen , sailors , porters , and agents of every sort : he consumes also his instruments , which are carts , horses , ships , warehouses ; and we may even consider as part of his consumption , the advances which he makes for the purchase of his merchandise .
All these advances are restored to him by the value of the products which go out of his hands : that is , the merchandise in a state to be sold .
All these entrepreneurs of industry reproduce with loss , or without either loss or gain , or with profit , according as they reproduce values , which are either inferior , equal , or superior to the values which they have consumed .
What is the effect of these facts , as it respects capital ?
That which is called productive capital , or , simply , capital , consists of all those values , or , if you will , all those advances employed reproductively , and replaced in proportion as they are destroyed .
It is easy to see that this term capital has no relation to the nature or form of the values of which capital is composed ( their nature and form vary perpetually ) ; but refers to the use , to the reproductive consumption of these values : thus a bushel of corn forms no part of my capital if I employ it to make cakes to treat my friends , but it does form part of my capital if I use it in maintaining workmen who are employed on the production of that which will repay me its value .
In the same manner a sum of money is no longer a part of my capital if I exchange it for products which I consume : but it does form part of my capital if I exchange it for a value which is to remain and augment in my hands .
How is capital amassed ?
Capital is augmented by all that is withdrawn from unproductive consumption , and added to a consumption which is reproductive .
Capitals that are amassed are then consumed ?
Without doubt .
Can capitals be amassed without being consumed ?
Yes , capitals , that is , values may be amassed under one form as well as another , in gold , silver , or merchandise , and no part of it used for production .
These are idle capitals , which may become productive hereafter , but which in the mean time do not yield any of those profits which we shall consider presently .
Capital thus accumulated may be transferred from one to another by exchange or by succession , and may be lent in one form as well as in another , either in the form of merchandise or of money : but in whatever form it is transferred or lent , it consists in the value of the things transferred or lent , and not in the things themselves .
Thus when Paul , a clothier , sells clothes on credit to Silvan , a woolen draper , he really lends to Silvan the value for which he gives him credit ; although this value is not lent in money , but in merchandise , and although it is to be returned not in merchandise but in money .
Is land a capital ?
Land is made use of in the way of capital .
It is an instrument for which no other can be substituted , and by means of which we make materials for our use , and consequently give them a value .
It may be transmitted or lent ( by way of letting ) as capital may : but it differs from capital as it is not a human production , but is furnished to us by nature , and is incapable of increase by accumulation like capital .
I comprehend that a capital , which is a mass of values accumulated by the care which has been taken to snatch them successively from unproductive , and to devote them to reproductive consumption , belongs to him who has taken the pains and imposed on himself the privations of which it is the fruit : but why should land , which is given gratuitously by nature , be the property of any one ?
It is not the object of political economy to inquire what may have been the origin of the right to property .
It shows only that land , and consequently its products , is susceptible of appropriation , that is to say , of becoming the exclusive property of such or such ; and that this appropriation is highly favorable to production : for if land and the products to be derived from it , did not belong exclusively to some one , no one would take the pains , nor make the advances necessary , to obtain these products ; much less to cultivate and enrich the soil .
For the same reason it is useful that capital and its products should be an exclusive property ; it is the only means of inducing its accumulation and its productive employment .
You have said that land differs from capital , inasmuch as it is not like the latter , capable of extension ; but the clearing , the buildings and the enclosures by increasing the products , are equivalent to an actual extension .
The improvements which are values accumulated by industry on land are a capital , and the profits which result from the whole are the united profits of capital and land .
But how can we transfer or lend capital of this kind ?
It can only be done by transferring or lending at the same time the land itself .
It is for this reason that capital so employed is called an appropriated capital .
There is in the same manner much capital locked up in many manufactories , in all the utensils and in the buildings which are generally much more valuable than the land on which they stand .
Thus when we have exchanged a moveable capital for a mill , a forge or a house to live in , we can not put ourselves again into the possession of that portion of our capital , without selling at the same time the land as well as the buildings upon it .
The other capital is called circulating capital .
There is no other difference between them than that the materials of which these respective capitals are composed , are more conveniently and more easily exchanged , and in smaller portions in the one case than in the other .
VII .
On the Manner in which the Value of Products is Established , and of the Charges of Production
We have seen how utility is given to things : we have seen that utility gives them value ; how is that value fixed , the amount of which constitutes riches ?
The utility which the things have acquired , causes them to be sought after , to be wanted ; a price is offered for them ; and when this price is sufficient to defray the expenses which their production would cost , they will be produced .
Of what are the expenses of production composed ?
Of whatever must be paid to obtain the cooperation of the agents of production .
What are the agents of production ?
They are the means indispensably necessary for the creation of a product : viz .
human industry ; the capital or value which serves for that purpose ; the land and other natural agents which contribute to it .
To whom do you give the name of producers ?
To all those who possess any of the agents of production .
A man who exercises an industry , and the possessor of capital or of land are producers .
Why do you call the possessors of capital or of land , producers , even when they do not labor themselves ?
Because the capital and the land , concurring in the formation of products , those who furnish these means of production contribute to it effectually themselves .
What do you say of him who employs his own capital or cultivates his own land ?
That he contributes doubly : first , by his industry ; afterwards as a capitalist or landholder : but although these functions are often filled by one person , it is convenient to separate them when they are to be studied , in order to distinguish properly what belongs to each species of productive service .
What is meant by the term productive service ?
It is the service rendered by each of the agents of production : the service rendered by industry ; the service rendered by capital , and the service rendered by natural agents .
I see what is the cause of the demand and of the payment for productive services : what is it that limits this demand ?
The property of the consumers , or of those who desire to use the product .
There would be no bounds to the demand for any useful thing if it was not to be paid for .
There is no other effective demand than that which is accompanied by the offer of a price : and it is this price which in paying for the product pays at the same time for the services which were necessary to its production .
What happens when the price of the product is not sufficient to pay the charges of production ?
Then the producers will not exchange their productive services for the price of the product ; and the production does not take place .
What happens when the price of the product is more than enough to pay the charges of production ?
The producers of this kind of product become more numerous , and their competition will cause the price of the product to fall .
Can one let out or lend productive services ?
Yes , when a man lets out his industry , the price which is paid for it is called wages .
When he lets out his capital it is called interest .
When he lets out his land , the tenant is called a farmer , and the price is called rent .
What do you understand by letting out industry ?
It is to give for hire time , talent , and labor ; to cooperate in the creation of a product of industry .
Who is it that hires the labor of the one , the capital or the land of the others ?
It is an entrepreneur of industry who unites all these means of production , and who finds in the value of the products which result from them , the reestablishment of the entire capital he employs , and the value of the wages , the interest and the rent which he pays , as well as the profits belonging to himself .
What happens when the value of the products he has created is not sufficient to pay for all that ?
He loses , if he has anything to lose : or if he has nothing , those lose who have given him their confidence .
VIII .
On the Profits of Industry , Capital , and Land ; That Is , Income
What is the source of the profits of industry , capital , and land ?
It is in the price of the products created by their cooperation .
The consumer in buying a product , pays all the charges of its production , that is , the services of the producers ( the industrious , the capitalists , and the landholders ) , who have contributed to its production .
How can these profits , paid by a single consumer , be distributed among the different producers ?
By the advances which the producers make of them to one another .
Explain that by an example .
Let us examine how the value of a cloth coat is distributed among the producers of the stuff of which it is made .
We see that a farmer who has reared a sheep , has paid a rent to the landholder who let to him the land on which the sheep was fed .
That is a profit received for the productive service of the land .
If the farmer has borrowed the capital necessary for the cultivation of his farm , the interest which he pays for it is another profit , received by a capitalist , for the productive service of his capital .
When the farmer has sold his wool , the price which he receives for it reimburses to him the rent and interest he has paid , and also the profits of his industry .
The clothier , in his turn , by means of his capital , advances this value which is already distributed : if his capital is a borrowed one , and he pays interest for it , he pays also in advance the profits of the capitalist who lent it to him ; and he is reimbursed the whole , together with his profits , by the woolen draper , who is at last reimbursed for his advances and his profits by the sale which he makes to the consumer .
Thus at the time the sale of the cloth was accomplished , the value had already been distributed among its different producers .
In thus tracing the progress of any product whatever , we shall find that its value is scattered among a crowd of producers , many of whom perhaps are ignorant of the existence of the product : so that a man that wears the coat is perhaps , without suspecting it , one of the capitalists , and consequently one of the producers , who have contributed to its formation .
Is not society then divided into producers and consumers ?
Everybody consumes , and almost everybody produces .
For , not to be a producer , it is necessary neither to exercise any industry , nor any talent , nor to possess either the smallest portion of land or of productive capital .
What do the profits , distributed among society , become ?
They compose the income of each individual ; and the incomes of all the individuals which form a nation , compose the total income of that nation .
What is called annual income ?
It is the sum of all the portions of income received in the course of a year .
The annual income of a whole nation , is the sum of all the portions of income received , in the course of a year , by all the individuals of which that nation is composed .
Are incomes paid at fixed periods ?
Some of them are so ; some not .
A landholder who lets his land , a capitalist who lends his capital , and who thus gives up to another the profits which may result from these agents of production , generally stipulate the condition of receiving the rent or interest , which forms their income , at fixed periods .
The workman who lets out his industrious talent receives the wages which form his income by portions , every week or every fortnight .
But the grocer , who sells sugar and coffee , receives on each ounce that he sells , a small portion of his profit , and all these united profits form his income .
Are incomes , or portions of income , always paid in money ?
The manner in which they are paid has nothing to do with the subject .
The corn , vegetables , milk , and butter , which a farmer consumes in his own family , form part of his income .
If he pays part of his rent in provisions , these provisions form part of the income of the landlord .
The essential thing is the value paid , whether this value is paid in provisions , or whether he that owes it , exchanges these provisions for money , in order to pay the value in money , is of no importance .
It is the value acquired , under whatever form , for a productive service , that constitutes income .
As the incomes of individuals are so much the more considerable as their profits are greater , and as their profits are greater when their productive services are better paid , it appears to me that the dearer these productive services are , the greater the total income of that nation must be .
Yes : but when the productive services are dearer so are the products ; and when the price of the products augments in the same proportion as the incomes , the augmentation of the income is only nominal .
When the charges of production have doubled , with an income nominally double , we can only purchase the same quantity of products .
That alone really increases the ease of individuals and of nations which lowers the value of products without decreasing incomes .
In what circumstances is this advantage experienced ?
It is when , by a better employment of the means of production , the products are multiplied without increasing the charges of production .
Then the products fall and incomes remain the same .
This is what takes place when a new and ingenious machine has been brought into use , such as the stocking frame and the cotton spinning machines : when a new canal has been cut , which , without increasing the charge , permits the transport of a hundred times more merchandise , etc .
IX .
On Wages , Interest , and Rent
What do you observe on the wages of workmen , interest of capital , and rent of land ?
That he who lets out his industry , his capital , or his land , renounces the profits he might have drawn from their productive services ; he renounces them in favor of an entrepreneur of industry , who hires them , and who draws , from these means of production , a profit which is either superior or equal , or inferior , to what he pays for them .
What causes raise the rate of wages ?
The abundance of capital and land compared with the number of workmen : for there must be land , and , above all , capital , in order to employ workmen .
Why is it that wages scarcely ever exceed what is necessary to maintain a workman and his family , according to the custom of the place ?
Because wages , by rising higher , encourage an increase of workmen ; this occasions such services to be more offered in proportion to the demand for them .
Works , which require rare and distinguished talents , are exceptions to this rule , because such talents cannot always be increased according to the demand for them .
What causes influence the rate of interest ?
The interest of capital lent , although expressed by one price only , a certain percentage on the capital lent , ought really to be distinguished into two parts .
Explain that by an example .
If you lend a sum of money , and you agree with the borrower for an interest of six percent .
per annum , there is in this rate , four percent ( more or less ) , to pay for the productive service of the capital , and two percent ( more or less ) to cover the risk that you run of never getting your capital back .
On what do you found this presumption ?
On this , that if you were enabled to lend the same capital with perfect security , on a very safe mortgage , you would lend it at four percent more or less .
The surplus is then a species of premium of insurance which is paid to you to indemnify you for the risk that you run .
Setting aside the premium of insurance , which varies according to the greater or less solidity of the parties , what are the causes which vary the rate of interest , properly so called ?
The rate of interest rises when those who borrow have numerous , ready , and lucrative employments for capital , because then many entrepreneurs of industry are desirous of participating in the profits which these employments of capital offer ; and capitalists are also more likely to use them themselves , which augments the demand for capital , and diminishes the amount which is offered for employment .
The rate of interest increases also when , from whatever cause , the mass of disposable capital , that is , of capitals requiring to be employed , has been diminished .
Contrary circumstances lower the rate of interest ; and one of these circumstances may so balance the other , that the rate of interest will remain at the same point , because the one tends to heighten , precisely as much as the other to lower , the rate .
When you say that the mass of disposable capital increases or diminishes , do you mean by that the quantity of money ?
By no means : I mean values destined by their possessors to reproductive consumption , and which are not so engaged that they cannot be withdrawn in order to use them differently .
Explain that by an example ?
Suppose that you have lent funds to a merchant on condition of his paying them back to you on giving him three months notice ; or , which comes to the same thing , that you are in the habit of discounting bills of exchange , can you not easily employ these funds in a different way if you find any one more convenient to you ?
Without doubt .
Then these funds are a disposable capital .
They are so too , if they are in the form of a merchandise easily sold , since you can exchange them readily for any other value .
They are still more disposable if they are in specie ; but you must understand that the sum of all these disposable capitals is a very different thing from the sum of coined money , and that it may be much more considerable .
I understand so .
Well !
It is the sum of these capitals which influences the rate of interest , and not the sums of money under which form these values temporarily present themselves when they are about to pass from one hand to another .
A disposable capital may be in the form of a certain sort of merchandise , a sack of guineas for instance : but if the quantity of this merchandise which is in circulation , has no influence on the rate of interest , the abundance or the scarcity of the gold has no influence on it either .
It is not then really the hire of money that one pays when one pays an interest ?
By no means .
Why is it called the interest of money ?
From very inaccurate ideas which are formed of the nature and use of capital .
What is legal interest ?
It is the rate fixed by the law in cases where it has not been fixed by the parties : as when the holder of a capital has enjoyed it in the place of an absentee , or a minor to whom he is bound to account .
Cannot public authority fix a limit to the interest which individuals may agree upon ?
It cannot , without violating the freedom of transactions .
What causes influence the rent of land ?
The demand for the hire of farms compared with the number to be let .
It may be observed on this subject , that the demand commonly exceeds the number to be let , because in all countries the number of these is necessarily limited ; while that of farmers and of capitals , which may be applied to this industry , are not necessarily so : so that in those places , where there are not stronger motives to a contrary effect , rent is rather above than below the real profit of land .
What have you more to say on this subject ?
That rent tends nevertheless to get down to the profit of land ; for when it exceeds it , the farmer is obliged to pay the excess , either out of the profits of his industry , or the interest of his capital ; and is no longer completely indemnified for the employment of those means of production .
X. On Incomes Founded on Immaterial Products
What is meant by immaterial products ?
They express a utility produced , but which is not attached to any material .
Explain that by an example .
When a physician visits a sick person and prescribes a remedy or a regimen which cures him , he renders himself useful to him .
The physician receives a sum of money in exchange for this utility : but here the utility is not attached to any merchandise where it may be preserved for a time , and exchanged again .
It is a product truly immaterial , in exchange for which the physician receives a fee which constitutes his income .
The industry of the physician is analogous to that of every entrepreneur of an industry .
He applies to the wants of men the medical knowledge which he has collected .
What other professions found their incomes on immaterial products ?
There are a great number of them .
They include the most elevated as well as the most abject situations in society .
The public functionaries , from the chiefs of the government down to the lowest officer , the judges and the priests , receive in exchange for their usefulness to the public , fees paid at the expense of the public .
What causes influence the amount of these fees ?
As these fees are never the result of a free agreement , but depend on political circumstances , they are seldom proportioned with exactness to the utility produced .
Give me some other examples of industry productive of immaterial products .
An advocate , an actor , a musician , a soldier , a domestic , render services of which the value may be measured by the price which they receive .
What do you observe respecting immaterial products ?
That they are necessarily consumed at the same instant they are produced .
Their value , consequently , cannot be reserved for consumption at any other time , or to be employed as capital , because they are not attached to any material by means of which they can be preserved .
What consequence do you draw from that ?
That in multiplying the services rendered by these different classes , the consumption of them is multiplied : that it hinders these kind of works from contributing to the increase of the mass of wealth .
It follows from this , that in multiplying , for example , placemen , lawyers , soldiers , etc. the wealth of a country is not increased , whatever may otherwise be the utility of these different professions .
The services they render exist no longer than the moment they are performed .
They live then on the incomes of other producers ?
They live no more on the incomes of other producers than a wine merchant lives on the income of a woolen draper , who buys wine which he pays for with part of his income , and afterwards consumes .
An actor is a dealer in amusement ; a spectator buys his commodity , pays for it out of his income , and consumes it the instant it is delivered to him .
The products furnished by the actor and by the wine merchant , are equally lost ; but when the price which has been given to them for it has been freely paid , it is an exchange like all others , followed by a consumption of the same nature as all unproductive consumptions .
Are immaterial products the fruit of industry alone ?
Yes , when nothing has been advanced to acquire the talent of which they are the fruit : but when this talent has required long and expensive studies they are the result of an appropriated capital , that is to say , of advances which have been made of industry .
One part of the fees then serves to pay the life interest in this capital , and another to pay for the industry exercised .
When the fees , or gratuities , are not sufficient to pay for the service of these two agents of production , their product becomes more scarce , and its price increases until the moment when the quantity of that product is rendered equal to the demand .
Are there any immaterial products which are the result of capital alone ?
Yes , if moveable effects ( household furniture ) are considered as capital , and if they are kept up to their original value .
When their value is not kept up , besides the use of the capital , a part of the capital itself is consumed .
The plate which is used in a family forms part of the capital and riches of that family .
It is not unproductive since it renders a daily service , but it does not produce any value which can afterwards be exchanged for any other thing .
This service is an immaterial product consumed at the moment .
The family consumes the interest of this part of its capital .
Are there any immaterial products which result from land ?
Yes : the enjoyment received from a pleasure garden , is a product of the land of this garden and the capital devoted to its arrangement .
It has no other exchangeable product .
XI .
On Consumption in General
We have already seen what consumption is : finish the development of its effects .
It must be remembered that to consume is not to destroy the matter of a product : we can no more destroy the matter than we can create it .
To consume is to destroy its value by destroying its utility ; by destroying the quality which had been given to it , of being useful to , or of satisfying the wants of man .
Then the quality for which it had been demanded was destroyed .
The demand having ceased , the value , which exists always in proportion to the demand , ceases also .
The thing thus consumed , that is , whose value is destroyed , though the material is not , no longer forms any portion of wealth .
A product may be consumed rapidly , as food , or slowly , as a house ; it may be consumed in part , as a coat , which , having been worn for some months , still retains a certain value .
In whatever manner the consumption takes place , the effect is the same : it is a destruction of value ; and as value makes riches , consumption is a destruction of wealth .
What is the object of consumption ?
To procure to the consumer either an enjoyment or a new value , in general superior to the value consumed , otherwise the consumer would not obtain any profit .
In the first case it is an unproductive , and in the second a reproductive consumption .
What would that consumption be which had for its object neither to procure an enjoyment , nor to create a new product ?
That would be a sacrifice without compensation ; a folly .
What must be thought then of a system , the tendency of which is , to consume for the sole purpose of favoring production ?
That which must be thought of a system which should propose to burn down a city , for the purpose of benefiting the builders , by employing them to restore it .
Develop what relates to reproductive consumption .
Everything which has been said on production , serves for that purpose .
What have you to say on the subject of unproductive consumption ?
Unproductive consumption , which we shall hereafter , for shortness , call simply consumption , divides itself into two kinds , private and public .
What do you understand by private consumption ?
That which has for its object to satisfy the wants of individual and of families .
What do you mean by public consumption ?
That which has for its object to supply the wants of men whose association forms a community , a province , or a nation .
Are these two sorts of consumption of the same nature ?
They are entirely of the same nature , and their effects are the same .
One set of persons cause the consumption in one case , and other persons in the other ; that is all the difference .
What is meant by these words , annual consumption of a nation ?
It is the sum of the values consumed by a nation in a year , whether for the wants of individuals or of the public .
Do these words comprehend reproductive consumption as well as the others ?
Yes ; for we may say that France consumes annually so many quintals of soda or of indigo , although the indigo and the soda can only be consumed reproductively , as they cannot satisfy directly any want ; and as they can be employed only in the arts , they serve necessarily for reproduction .
Do you comprehend in the consumption of a nation , the merchandise she exports to other countries ?
Yes ; and I comprehend in its products whatever it receives in return ; in the same manner that I comprehend in its consumption the value of the wool it uses for the manufacture of cloth , and in its productions the value of the cloth which results from it .
Does a nation consume all that it produces ?
Yes , with very few exceptions ; for it is our interest not to create products unless they are demanded , and they are never demanded but to be consumed .
If a nation consumes the total of the values which it produces , how can it accumulate values , form capital , and maintain it ?
The values , which serve the purposes of capital , may be consumed perpetually , yet are never lost , for in the same proportion as they are consumed they are reproduced under new forms by the action of industry .
This reproduction , once accomplished , if the value reproduced is found superior to the value consumed , there has been an augmentation of capital .
In the contrary case , a diminution of capital .
If the reproduction has simply equaled the consumption , the capital has been merely kept up .
Show me the application of these truths by examples .
Take , for instance , a farmer , or a manufacturer , or even a merchant .
Suppose that he employs in his enterprise a capital of twenty thousand pounds , that is to say , suppose that all the values that he has in his enterprise on the first day of a year , are equal in value to a sum of twenty thousand pounds .
In the course of his operations these values change their forms perpetually ; and although his capital does not exceed twenty thousand pounds , yet we may suppose , that if all the values which he has consumed in the course of the year were added together , they would amount to sixty thousand pounds , because a value destroyed may have been reproduced , destroyed again a second and a third time before the year revolves .
We may suppose also , that if all the values produced in the same year were added together they might amount to a sum of sixty - four thousand pounds .
If then this entrepreneur of industry has had consumption for sixty thousand pounds , and productions for sixty - four thousand pounds , he ought to have at the end of the year values amounting to four thousand pounds more than he had at the beginning .
That appears clear to me .
Let us go on .
If he has expended unproductively in the same year , to satisfy the wants of his family four thousand pounds , he will have consumed his profits ; and if he takes his inventory he will find himself , at the end of the year , with a capital of twenty thousand pounds only , as he had at the beginning of the year .
But if , instead of having expended unproductively for the support of his family four thousand pounds , he had only expended two thousand , unless he has hid two thousand pounds , he will find that this value of two thousand pounds , which has not been expended unproductively , will have been laid out productively , and that it will appear in his inventory in augmentation of capital under some form or other , either under that of provisions , of goods in process of manufacture , or even of advances capable of being recovered .
I conceive that .
You perceive then , that although the value of the capital has not been more than twenty thousand pounds , the total value of the products for the year may have been much more considerable ?
Yes .
That this form of products , whatever it may be , may have been entirely consumed , and that , nevertheless , the capital of this individual may have been augmented .
Yes .
Well , then , multiply in your mind what has happened to a single individual , and suppose that the same thing has happened to all the individuals of the same nation : or at least suppose that the consequences that have happened to some , balanced by those which have happened to others , have produced a general result analogous to the preceding example , and you will find , by a second example , that a nation which had at the commencement of the year a capital of a hundred millions , may have consumed in a year three hundred millions of values , producing three hundred and twenty millions of values , of which she has consumed reproductively three hundred millions , and unproductively twenty millions ; or rather reproductively three hundred and ten millions , and unproductively ten millions .
I grant it .
In this last supposition this little nation , which will have consumed all its productions , will , nevertheless , be enriched during the year ten millions of values , which will be found distributed under different forms among those individuals who have conducted their affairs with the greatest intelligence and economy .
XII .
On Private Consumption
What difference is there between the words Expense and Consumption ?
Expense is the purchase of a thing to be consumed , and as , in general , one only buys what one intends to consume , the words expense and consumption are often used for one another .
It is , however , proper to remark , that when one buys a product , we exchange the value we are willing to give up for one of which we are in want : the value of a crown , for instance , for the value of a handkerchief .
We are still as rich when we have made the purchase as we were before , only we possess in the form of a handkerchief what we before had in the form of a crown .
We do not begin to lose this value until we begin to use the handkerchief , and it is only when the consumption is finished that we are poorer by a crown .
It is not then in buying , but in consuming , that we dissipate our property .
That is the reason why , in the middle ranks of life , the character and economical talents of the woman , who directs the greater part of the consumption of the family , assists materially to preserve fortunes .
What do you understand by economical talents ?
It is the talent of deciding judiciously what consumption may be permitted , and what must be prohibited , in that state of fortune in which we are placed , and according to the income we have .
What do you understand by avarice ?
We are avaricious when we deprive ourselves , or those dependent upon us , of those consumptions which we might permit according to our incomes .
Is it avaricious not to expend the whole of one 's income ?
No ; for it is only by the savings which are made from unproductive consumption , that we can hope to enjoy repose in our old days , and to procure an establishment for our families .
Do we do any wrong to society by thus amassing a productive capital , for the sake of enjoying ourselves , or suffering those belonging to us to enjoy , the profits it will produce ?
On the contrary , capitals , accumulated by individuals , add so much to the total capital of society ; and as a capital placed , that is , employed reproductively , is indispensably necessary to give activity to industry , every person who spares from his revenue to add to his capital , procures , to a certain number of persons who have nothing but their industry , the means of deriving a revenue from their talents .
Are not some consumptions better managed than others ?
Yes : they are those which procure greater satisfaction , in proportion to the sacrifice of the values which they occasion .
Such are the consumptions which satisfy the real , rather than fictitious , wants .
Wholesome food , decent clothing , convenient lodgings , are consumptions more fitting and better regulated than luxurious food , foppish clothing , and stately habitations .
More true satisfaction results from the first than the last .
What do you consider besides as well regulated consumptions ?
The consumption of products of the best quality of every sort , although they may cost more .
For what reason do you consider them as well regulated consumptions ?
Because the workmanship employed on a bad article will be more quickly consumed than that on a good one .
When a pair of shoes is made with bad leather , the work of the shoemaker , which is used up in the same time as the shoes , does not cost less , and is consumed in fifteen days instead of lasting two or three months , which it would have done if the leather had been good .
The carriage of bad merchandise costs as much as that of good , which is more advantageous .
Poor nations have , consequently , beside the disadvantage of consuming less perfect productions , that of paying dearer for them in proportion .
What consumptions do you consider as the worst regulated ?
Those which procure more chagrin and mischief than satisfaction : such as the excess of intemperance , and expenses which excite contempt , or are followed by punishment .
XIII .
On Public Consumption
What do you call public consumptions ?
Those which are made for the service of men , assembled in communities , provinces , or nations .
It is the purchase of services and products , consumed for public utility , which constitute the public expenses .
What are the principal objects of public expenses ?
The payment of the administrators of the government , the judges , soldiers , and professors in the public institutions ; the providing for the army and navy , and maintaining the public establishments , edifices , roads , canals , ports , hospitals , etc .
What do you observe generally with respect to public expenses ?
That the public is never so cheaply served as individuals .
What are the reasons ?
There are three .
First , that political circumstances fix the number and salaries of the public functionaries , and that their services are consequently not open to a free competition .
The second , that those who direct the public expenses , devoting to them money which is not their own , are less sparing of it than individuals would be .
The third , that works executed for the public , are easily superintended , and are never watched by personal interest .
I am inclined to believe that public consumptions , by returning to society the money which has been drawn from it , do not impoverish it .
They do impoverish it the same as private consumptions , by the whole amount of the values consumed .
How do you explain this ?
The money is wrested from the people without equivalent .
A value is taken away from the community , without its receiving any other value in return .
But when this money is returned to the community , it is not gratuitously ; it is in virtue of a purchase in which the seller delivers to government , or its agents , things which have a value .
The community has twice delivered the same value .
It has delivered the contribution , and also the merchandise , which the government has bought with the amount of that contribution .
Of these two values the one is returned by the purchase which the government has made ; the other is never returned at all : it is consumed , that is to say , it is destroyed .
Illustrate this by an example .
We will suppose that a community pays in money a hundred thousand pounds ; there is a value equal to one hundred thousand pounds drawn from the community .
The agents of the government , with this sum , purchase clothes for the army ; this is another value equal to one hundred thousand pounds drawn from the community .
The government , in paying the clothier , restores the one hundred thousand pounds it had raised by contribution : but the value of the one hundred thousand pounds in clothes is not restored , and will be consumed and lost .
It is the same case with that of a man who draws from the community his revenue in money , and returns it back by means of his expenditure ; but who does not return the provisions he has purchased with his revenue , and which he has consumed .
But when a government constructs buildings , and with the amount of the contributions pays the workmen , does it not then restore to society the values which it has drawn from it ?
Not an atom more .
It draws from society , in this last case , one value in contribution , and then another value equal to it in services which it consumes .
The purchase of the services is not a restitution , but an exchange .
Is not this a mere distinction of words , and is not the purchase of services equivalent to a restitution ?
Not in the least .
When the government employs workmen , it receives from them in exchange for their wages a real value , which is their labor ; a value founded on the products which are to result from this labor ; a value , which being consumed by the government , cannot be consumed in any other design , nor with any other result .
The workmen thus employed would have perhaps been without work ?
Why ?
The government by this operation has not multiplied the values appropriated to the payment of workmen .
If it distributes them on the one hand , it takes away from the contributor on the other , the power of distributing them , either directly , by employing the workmen himself , or indirectly , by means of his consumptions .
When a government consumes , it stands then in the same situation with any other consumer ?
Almost always ; the exceptions to this rule are too rare to be worth noticing .
What consequences do you draw from it ?
That the consumptions , or , if you will , the expenses of government , are always a sacrifice made by society , which is never indemnified for it , otherwise than by the product which results from it .
What do you mean by a product resulting from public expenditure ?
When the government constructs a bridge , the service which the public derives from it , repays , and often with very great advantage , the sacrifice of values which the bridge has cost .
But no benefit results from the mere expenditure of the money , nor the employment of the workmen employed on its construction ; for , if this money had remained in the hands of the contributors , it would either directly or indirectly have put in activity an equal quantity of industry .
When a part of the contributions is employed in the construction of monuments or buildings , which have no public utility , there is then on the part of society a sacrifice without compensation ?
Precisely : it is for that reason that a good government makes no expenditure which has not a useful result .
The economy of nations is exactly the same with that of individuals .
XIV .
On Public Property and Taxes
From whence are the values derived which serve for the public consumptions ?
They are derived either from the revenues of property belonging to the public , or from taxes .
What constitutes the revenues of public property ?
These properties are either , capital or freehold property , but most generally freehold property , land , houses , etc. which the government let , and the revenue of which it consumes for the advantage of the public .
When it consists of forests , it sells the annual felling ; when capital it lends it at interest , but this last case is very rare .
Who is it that pays the taxes ?
The individuals who in this respect we call contributors .
Where do the contributors get the values with which they pay the taxes ?
They take these values from the products which belong to them , or which comes to the same thing , from the money which they procure by the exchange of these products .
Are these products the fruit of the annual productions ?
They are sometimes the products of the year , which form part of the income of individuals , and sometimes former products , which they employ as productive capitals .
In what case do the contributors take from their capitals to pay the taxes ?
When their incomes are not sufficient .
And in this case the taxes dry up one of the sources of revenue , and one of the means of the industry of society .
Give me an example in which the taxes are discharged with a portion of capital .
If a man whose income is absorbed by the ordinary contributions , together with the maintenance of his family , comes to an inheritance , and as an heir he is bound to pay impost , it must be taken out of his inheritance ; the capital in the hands of the heir is therefore no longer so considerable as it was in the hands of the deceased .
Similar observations may be made on the expenses of proceedings at law , bonds , securities , etc .
In all these cases the tax paid by the contributor is withdrawn from the mass of capital usefully employed , and is so much capital devoted to consumption , and actually disappears .
This happens also in cases where the profits are small and the impost considerable ; many contributors cannot in that case discharge the taxes without breaking in upon their capitals .
The major part of the taxes are however taken from incomes ?
Yes : for if the taxes dry up too completely the sources of production , they would diminish more and more every day the products with which alone they could be paid .
If there are some of them which break into the capital of individuals , how happens it that the means of production are not destroyed in the long run ?
Because at the same time that some individuals break into their capitals , those of others are increased by saving .
Do not the taxes serve , on the other hand , to multiply products by compelling the contributors to produce , in order to be able to pay them ?
The hope of enjoying the products one has created is a much stronger incitement to production than the idea of satisfying the tax gatherer .
But if the impost should excite the desire of producing more it does not afford the means .
In order to extend production it is necessary to increase capital , which is the more impossible , as the necessity of paying the tax prevents the saving , which alone creates capital .
In short , if the necessity of paying the taxes should excite efforts which augment production , there will not result from it any increase of the general riches , since what is raised by the impost is consumed , and does not serve to increase any saving .
Thus it may be seen that great taxes are destructive of public prosperity instead of being favorable to it .
Which are the principal kinds of taxes levied for this purpose ?
Sometimes they are exacted from the contributors at so much per head , as in the capitation tax .
Sometimes as in the land tax , they take a part of the revenue arising from the lands ; which are valued , either after the actual rent or after the extent and fertility of the soil .
Sometimes the rent of a house , the number of its doors and windows , and of the servants and horses kept by the contributor , serve as a basis for the amount of his contribution .
Sometimes , his profits are valued according to the industry he carries on : from hence the impost on licenses ( patents ) .
All these contributions bear the name of direct taxes , because they are demanded , directly , of the contributor in person .
Are not all taxes demanded directly from the contributor ?
They are sometimes demanded , not from the payer , but are included in the price of the merchandise on which the impost is laid , and without the receiver knowing even the name of the contributor .
For this reason they are called indirect taxes .
When and in what manner are taxes levied on merchandise ?
They are sometimes levied at the instant in which they are produced , like the salt in France , or the gold and silver mines in Mexico .
A portion of the value of these merchandise is levied at the moment of their extraction .
Sometimes a duty is levied at the moment of their transportation from one place to another , as in the instance of import duties ; and in the " Octroi , " which is paid in France at the entrance of towns : sometimes at the moment of consumption , as for stamps and admissions to the theaters .
Does the amount of the impost remain at the expense of those who pay it ?
No : they endeavor to reimburse themselves at least in part from those who purchase the products in the creation of which the contributors have assisted .
Do the contributors always succeed in thus shifting the burden from themselves ?
They seldom succeed completely , because they cannot do so without raising the price of their products ; and a rise of price always diminishes the consumption of a product by putting it out of the reach of some of its consumers .
The demand for this sort of product then diminishes , and its price falls .
The price not then affording so liberal a remuneration for the productive services devoted to this object , the quantity of it is lessened .
Thus when an import duty is laid on cotton , the manufacturers of cottons and the tradesmen who sell them cannot raise the price so high as to recover back the amount of the taxes ; for that purpose it would be necessary that the same quantity of cotton goods should be demanded and sold , and that the society should devote to the purchase of this particular article more values than it had heretofore devoted to it , which is not possible .
The cotton goods become dearer ; their producers gain less , and this kind of production declines .
What consequence do you draw from that ?
That the impost is paid partly by the producers , whose profits , i. e. whose incomes it lessens ; and partly by those consumers who continue to purchase notwithstanding the dearness , since they pay more for a product , which in point of fact is not more valuable .
What other consequence do you draw from it ?
That the impost , in making the products dearer , does not augment even nominally the total value of productions ; for the products diminish in quantity more than they augment in price .
Does this effect take place with respect to any other merchandise than that on which the impost is levied ?
It takes place on all the merchandise which the contributor sells .
Brewers and bakers sell their products dearer when a tax is laid on the wood or coals which they burn .
A tax on meat and other eatables at the gates of a city renders all its manufactured products dearer .
Can all producers make the consumers bear a portion of the imposts which they are compelled to pay ?
There are producers who cannot .
An impost laid on an article of luxury bears only on those who consume it .
If a tax is laid on lace , the wine merchant whose wife wears lace , cannot sell his wine dearer on that account , for he could not maintain a competition with his neighbor whose wife does not wear lace .
A landholder cannot in general make his consumers bear any portion of the tax he is compelled to pay .
In order not to deceive ourselves as to the effect of taxes , how ought we to consider them ?
As a cause of the destruction of part of the products of society .
This destruction takes place at the expense of those who are unable to evade or shift it from themselves .
The producers and consumers pay the value of the products thus destroyed ; the first , in not selling their products at a price sufficient to cover the taxes ; the second , in paying more for them than they are worth , but in proportions which vary with every article and every class of individuals .
We may also consider the impost as an augmentation of the charges of production .
It is an expense sustained by the producers and consumers ; but which while it renders the products dearer , does not augment the incomes of the producers , as its amount is not divided among them .
Their expenses augment as consumers without their incomes increasing as producers : they are not so rich .
What is to be understood by a subject of taxation ?
By those words , is often meant , the merchandise which serves as a basis for the tax .
Brandy , in this sense , is a " subject of taxation , " by means of the duties which are levied on this liquor .
But the expression is not correct .
Brandy is only a basis for the demand of a value ; a merchandise which the government uses as a means of raising money .
The true subject of taxation is , in this case , the income of the individuals who manufacture and consume the brandy .
Thus the subject of taxation increases , when these incomes , whatever be their source , are augmented .
What do you conclude from that ?
That everything which tends to increase the riches of a nation extends and multiplies the subject of taxation .
It is from this cause , that as a country prospers the amount of the taxes increases , without increasing the rate of them ; and diminishes when it declines .
Are we justified in considering the amount of the taxes as part of the income of a nation ?
Never , for they are values not created but transferred .
They have formed a part of the incomes of individuals which they have not consumed .
Have not the government other sources of revenue ?
Sometimes the government retains the exclusive exercise of a certain industry , and causes it to be paid for beyond its value , as the carriage of letters .
In this case the tax does not amount to the whole of the charge for postage , but only to that part which exceeds what it would cost if this service was left open to free competition .
The profits which government sometimes makes on lotteries is of the same kind , but is much less justifiable on many accounts .
XV .
On Public Loans
With what view do governments borrow money ?
To provide for extraordinary expenses which the ordinary revenues are not sufficient to discharge .
How do they pay the interest of the loans they borrow ?
They pay it either by laying on a new tax , or by economizing , from the ordinary expenses , a sum sufficient to pay the annual interest .
Loans , then , are a means of consuming a principal of which the interest is paid by a portion of the taxes ?
Yes .
Who are the lenders ?
Individuals who have capitals at their disposal .
Since government represents the society , and society is composed of individuals , it is then the society which lends to itself ?
Yes : it is a part of the individuals who lend to the whole of the individuals ; that is to say , to the society or to its government .
What effect is produced by public loans on the public riches ?
Do they augment or diminish them ?
The loan in itself neither increases nor diminishes them : it is a value which passes from the hands of individuals to the hands of the government , a simple transfer .
But as the principal of the loan , or , if you will , the capital lent , is generally consumed in consequence of this transfer , public loans produce an unproductive consumption , a destruction of capital .
Would not a capital thus lent have been equally consumed if it had remained in the hands of individuals ?
No : the individuals who lent the capital , wished to lay it out , not to consume it .
If it had not been lent to government it would have been lent to those who would have made use of it , or they would have employed it themselves ; thus the capital would have been consumed reproductively instead of unproductively .
Is the total income of a nation increased or diminished by public loans ?
It is diminished , because all the capital which is consumed carries with it the income which it would otherwise have gained .
But in this case , the individual who lends does not lose any income , since the government pays him interest for his capital ; and if he does not lose , who does ?
Those who lose are the contributors who pay the increased taxes , with which the public creditor is paid his interest .
But if the creditor receives on the one hand an income which the contributor pays on the other , it appears to me that there is no portion of income lost , and that the state has profited by the principal of the loan which it has consumed .
You are in an error ; and to convince you of it we will examine how this operation is effected .
An individual lends to the state a thousand pounds .
Consequently he draws this value from an employment in which it was already , or in which it would have been engaged .
Supposing that this employment would have afforded five percent there is an income of fifty pounds taken from the society .
It is nevertheless paid to the creditor ; but how is it paid ?
At the expense of a contributor ; of a landed proprietor , who would have used for his own purposes these fifty pounds which the government takes from him to pay the creditor .
Instead of two incomes which there were in society , that of the thousand pounds lent to government ( which either had been , or might have been placed elsewhere ) and the income of the funds , which had produced to the landholder the fifty pounds of contribution , which he has been compelled to pay to satisfy the creditor .
In lieu of these two incomes , there remains but one , namely , the last , which is transferred from the contributor to the creditor .
Why is there only one income of fifty pounds where there had been formerly two ?
Because there had been , beside the funds of the contributor , another fund of one thousand pounds , producing fifty pounds , which has been lent and consumed , and which , consequently , produces nothing .
What are the principal forms under which a government pays the interest of its loans ?
Sometimes it pays a perpetual interest on the capital lent , which it does not bind itself to repay : the lenders have in this case no other means of recovering their capital than to sell their debt to other individuals who desire to place themselves in the situation of the former .
Sometimes it borrows , by way of annuity , and pays the lender a life interest .
Sometimes it borrows on condition of repayment , and it stipulates a pure and simple repayment , in a certain number of years , by installments ; or a reimbursement of the principal sum at periods which are sometimes determined by lot .
Sometimes it negotiates bills on its agents , the receivers of contributions .
The loss which it suffers by discount represents the interest on the advances it receives .
Sometimes it sells public offices , and thus pays interest for the money furnished .
The incumbent can never get back his principal without selling his office .
The price of offices is often paid under the name of security .
All these modes of borrowing have the effect of withdrawing from productive employment capitals which are consumed in the public service .
Have not the government the means of paying their debts , even those of which it has promised to pay the interest perpetually ?
Yes ; by means of what is called a sinking fund .
What is a sinking fund ?
When a tax is laid upon the people to pay the interest of a loan , it is laid a little heavier than is necessary to pay this interest ; this excess is confided to what are called commissioners for the management of the sinking fund , and who employ it every year to buy up at the market price a part of the interest or annuities paid by the state .
As the same interest always continues to be paid , the sinking fund devotes in the year following , to the purchase of these interests , not only the portion of the tax which is devoted to this use in the first instance , but also the interest which it has already bought up .
This manner of extinguishing the public debt by its progressively increasing action , would extinguish it with sufficient rapidity if these sinking funds were never diverted from this object , and if the debts were not kept up by a perpetual addition of new loans , which bring annually into the market more interest than the sinking fund buys up .

On Property , and the Nature of Riches
Can riches exist where there is no property ?
No : for riches being composed of the value of the things which we possess , there can be no riches where no things are possessed ; that is , no property .
Into how many classes can things possessed be arranged ?
Into two grand classes : that which constitutes stock , and that which constitutes income .
What do you observe relative to the riches which constitute income ?
That having been created without affecting our stock , they may be consumed without encroaching upon it ; and that if we do not consume them unproductively . , they will increase our stock .
Do you not subdivide that which constitutes our stock ?
Yes : our stock may consist ,
of land and other natural agents of which we are acknowledged proprietors ; of capital , or values produced , which we devote to reproduction : of faculties , or talents , natural and acquired , which we employ for the same purpose .
What do you observe relatively to the riches which constitute our stock ?
That we can alienate the property of the first two kinds of stock ( our lands and our capitals ) but not that of the third kind ( our industrious talents ) .
That we can let out to use all the three kinds .
That the last is a life property , which perishes with us .
What have you further to observe respecting them ?
That not being applicable to the satisfying of our wants , or of procuring enjoyments , because they are appropriated to reproduction , they are of no value , except for the faculty which they have of contributing to the production of some other consumable values .
The demand which there exists for consumable values , that is , for products , establishes a demand for the stock which is capable of producing , that is , for land , capital , and industrious talents ; this demand establishes their value , and this value makes a part of the riches of those to whom they belong .
Why have not a great number of natural agents necessary to production , as the heat of the sun , the air of the atmosphere ; why have not these a value ?
Because there is no demand for their productive faculties ; and there is no demand for them , because when these faculties are present they exceed all wants , and are accessible to all mankind : and when they are not present , no person can provide them , because no one can appropriate them .
What results from this fact in relation to the value of products ?
That when nature lends , gratuitously , her powers to the creation of products , the charges are less than when we must pay for assistance , and that we obtain consequently , products at a cheaper rate .
It is for that reason that the grapes of the south do not cost so much as those of the north , which are raised in hot houses .
You have said that riches are proportioned to the value of the things we possess , that is , that they are so much the greater as the values we possess are greater ; have you anything to add to this subject ?
Riches are proportioned to the values we possess , or rather are only those values themselves : but these values are great or small in comparison with the price of the things which may be obtained for them .
In other words , if with a certain sum in land , in capital , and in income , I can obtain the things I am in want of at half the price I have hitherto obtained them , by that alone , my riches are doubled .
Thus a nation which does not possess in nominal value more than one half what another nation possesses , will nevertheless be as rich , if she can procure all the products of which she is in want at half the price the other nation is obliged to pay .
The very height of riches , however few values one might possess , would be to be able to procure for nothing all the objects we wished to consume .
We should be at the lowest ebb of poverty , however immense might be the values we possessed , if the value of the things we wanted to consume exceeded the price which we were able to pay for them .
In what does the dearness and cheapness of things consist ?
We will examine that in the next chapter .
XVII .
On the Real and Nominal Price
Give me some just ideas on the price of things ?
If you wish to form just ideas on this subject you must never confound the nominal price with the real price of things .
What do you call the nominal price of things ?
The price we pay for a thing in money or in coin .
What do you call its real price ?
The value we have given to obtain the money with which we purchase this thing .
Give me an example .
A potter is in want of a loaf of bread , which sells for a shilling : he is obliged , in order to obtain it , to sell a vase which is worth a shilling .
If the price of the loaf should rise to two shillings ; and if the potter is obliged to sell two vases in order to obtain these two shillings , which he must pay for the loaf , the dearness of the bread is real .
If the potter can obtain these two shillings by the sale of a single vase , the dearness of the bread is only nominal .
He has in both cases exchanged only one vase against one loaf , whatever may have been the denomination of the intermediate value .
It is the value of the money which is depreciated , that of the bread has remained the same .
Is it not a real dearness to a man whose income arises from lands which are let , or from a capital lent at interest , when the loaf has risen from one to two shillings ?
No : that which is real is the depreciation which has taken place in the value of the merchandise in which his income is stipulated to be paid : that is , in the fall of the money .
He who pays the income , by acquiring at less expense this merchandise , gains in this case what the other loses .
You have said that if , when I am obliged to give two shillings to buy a loaf , I am able to obtain these two shillings , on the same terms that I before obtained one , the loaf has not become dearer ; but if to obtain two shillings , that is , the price of one loaf , I am obliged to give two vases instead of one , then the bread will have really become dearer ?
No ; not if the vases as well as the money have fallen to half their value .
How can I tell whether they have fallen to half their value or not ?
They have fallen if they can be obtained for half the expenses of production : that is , if means have been found to create , at the same charge of production ( which consists as we know of the workmanship , interest of capital and profit ) two vases instead of one .
It is then the lowering the charges of production which causes the real fall in the price of products ?
Just so .
Then whatever may be the value with which a product is purchased , this product , which has fallen one half , is obtained for one half less expense of production .
Explain that by an example .
If , by means of a knitting frame , I can make a pair of stockings for three shillings , instead of expending six shillings on them , he who grows wheat can obtain a pair of stockings for one half the quantity of wheat which he had before been accustomed to give for them .
That is , if he was before obliged to sell thirty - six pounds of wheat in order to obtain a pair of stockings , he would now sell but eighteen .
But the eighteen pounds have required on his part only one half the expenses of production which the thirty - six pounds would have required .
It is the same whatever is the production with which we are occupied .
It may be said , that when an article really falls in price , not only those who produce it , but everybody else , obtains it at the price of the reduced charge of production .
You have said besides that the riches of society is composed of the sum total of the values which it possesses : it appears to me to follow , that the fall of a product , stockings for example , by diminishing the sum of the values belonging to society , diminishes the mass of its riches .
The sum of the riches of society does not fall on that account .
Two pairs of stockings are produced instead of one ; and two pairs at three shillings are worth as much as one pair at six shillings .
The income of society remains the same , for the maker gains as much on two pairs at three shillings , as he did on one pair at six shillings .
But , when the income remains the same , and the products fall , the society is really enriched .
If the same fall takes place on all products at once , which is not absolutely impossible , society by obtaining all the objects of its consumption at half price , without having lost any part of its income , would really be twice as rich as before , and could buy twice as many things .
This does not generally happen , but it has happened to a great number of products , which have fallen from the price they were formerly at , some a tenth , some a fourth , a half , three - fourths , as silver , and even in a greater proportion as silks , and probably many other articles .
To what cause is that to be attributed ?
To many causes : but principally to the progress of intelligence and industry .
It is to their progress that we owe , both the discovery of countries in which there is a greater abundance of products , and also a means of transporting them less hazardous and more economical .
To that progress also we are indebted for processes more simple and more expeditious , the use of machinery , and in general a better adaptation of the productive faculties of nature .
Are there any products which have really become dearer ?
There are some , but very few , and only those the demand for which has increased in consequence of the progress of civilization , without the means of production having increased in the same proportion .
Such as butchers ' meat and poultry , and almost all the useful animals which are raised at less expense in less civilized countries .
Are there not variations in value which are not the consequence of the charges of production ?
The errors , the fears or the passions of men , or unforeseen events , cause disorder and confusion in values which are merely relative : that is , when any merchandise rises or falls with respect to others , in consequence of circumstances foreign to its production .
Late frosts increase the price of the last year 's wines , whatever may have been the charges of their production .
Does such a dearness increase the national wealth ?
No : for in exchanging another product for one which has become dearer , one must give more to receive less : he who buys , loses on his merchandise , precisely as much as the seller gains on his goods .
When the wine doubles its price , he , who , to purchase a piece of wine is obliged to sell six bushels of wheat instead of three , which should have purchased a piece of wine is poorer by all that the wine merchant is richer .
Thus these kinds of variation , which sometimes overturn private fortunes , do not affect the general riches .
XVIII .
On Money
If money is nothing but merchandise , why is coined silver of greater value than the same weight of silver uncoined ?
For the same reasons that a silver tea - pot is worth more than the same weight of silver in an ingot .
The fashion that the moneyer gives to the silver is then of the same kind as that given by the silversmith ?
Precisely of the same kind .
What utility does the fashion of the moneyer give to the silver ?
The impression on the money announces the weight and quality of the coin ; that is , the quantity of fine metal and of alloy therein ; consequently , it saves those who receive it the expense of weighing and assaying it .
Why do government reserve to themselves the exclusive right of coining money ?
In order to prevent the abuses which individuals might create in this manufacture , by not making it of the same fineness and weight which the impression indicates ; and sometimes they reserve that right , in order to obtain the profit of it , which makes part of its revenue .
Cannot the government , by virtue of this exclusive privilege of coining money , raise the value of money much beyond the expenses of manufacturing this merchandise ?
It can do so , by reducing greatly the quantity of pieces coined , or the amount of the money .
What would happen then ?
The money - merchandise becoming more scarce in proportion to the quantity of other merchandise in circulation , that is , which we are disposed to sell or to buy ; this money - merchandise would be more in demand relatively to all other merchandise .
We should give less money in exchange for more of other goods ; in other words , goods would fall in price .
Should we not feel in commerce some inconvenience arising from the scarcity of money ?
If that effect took place , the inconvenience would not be lasting , because the total real value of the money would not be diminished by it .
There would be fewer pieces , but each of the pieces would be worth more ; or , in other words , other goods would nominally fall in price , and their sum total would still bear exactly the same proportion with the sum total of the money .
What inconvenience would be felt in this case ?
The ingots and utensils of gold and silver , being a different kind of merchandise from money , although made of the same material , would fall in price like all other merchandise : this would make a great disproportion between these metals in money and in ingots .
There would be a considerable gain in converting them into money , which is an inducement to counterfeit and fabricate false money .
You have just shown in what case money - merchandise rises in value with respect to other merchandise ; in what case does it fall with respect to such merchandise ?
When the quantity of the money is augmented relatively to all other merchandise , then more money is offered for less merchandise : the money would fall ; in other words , the other merchandise would become nominally dearer .
You say nominally ; but is it not really , when it is not the name of the money which is changed , and we actually give a greater weight of metal ?
The value of the metal is , in this case , really less ; but the value of the other merchandise , not having really changed , the variation of their price is only nominal .
With the same quantity of corn , we purchase the same quantity of stuff .
A bushel of corn , instead of being worth six shillings , is worth twelve ; but a yard of cotton , instead of costing two shillings , costs four : thus , to buy three yards of stuff , we are still obliged to sell a bushel of corn as before ; and a bushel of corn , though worth double the quantity of money , is still only equal to the value of the same quantity of stuff .
This is what happened when the discovery of the mines of South America threw into circulation an immense quantity of gold and silver , in comparison to what there had been before .
To obtain the same quantity of corn , we must now give nearly three times as much silver as before the discovery of these mines .
America has then thrown into circulation three times as much silver as there was before ?
She has circulated much more ; but commerce , population , and riches , having greatly augmented since this discovery , the necessity for gold and silver , as well for the purposes of money as for furniture and ornaments , has greatly augmented also ; and has prevented the precious metals from suffering a depreciation in proportion to their abundance .
They have been produced in ten times the quantity , but have been three times more in demand .
What happens when , under the same denomination of money , a guinea , for example , the government gives less metal than it gave before .
The value of the money , which had fallen really with respect to other merchandise , then falls nominally .
Explain that by an example .
When the piece , called six livres tournois , does not contain more silver than that which was before called three livres tournois , we do not obtain for six livres more merchandise than we before obtained for three livres ; that is , the same quantity of merchandise costs the same weight of silver .
The value of the ingot of silver has scarcely varied from the year 1636 to the present time : with an ounce of silver we can buy the same quantity of those goods , whose value appears to have undergone the least variation .
The setier of corn sold commonly for twelve livres tournois , and the same setier sold in 1789 for twenty - four livres ; but twenty - four livres in 1789 did not contain a greater weight of silver , than in 1636 there was in twelve livres .
What effect does this produce on the interests of individuals ?
With respect to debts contracted previously by the government , if it pays them in money which is really worth less , it becomes bankrupt by all that there is less in the value of the new , than there had been in the old money .
And when it authorizes individuals to discharge their former debts in the new money , it authorizes them to commit a similar bankruptcy to its own .
With regard to the bargains made by individuals after the change in the money , this change produces no inconvenience ; the bargains are made according to the real value of the new money .
Does a nation , whose money is carried into other countries , lose in consequence of this operation ?
No , for the individuals who send it , take care to obtain at least an equal value in return .
Does the nation gain by such an exportation ?
Yes , when she takes care not to coin money gratuitously , and never to manufacture this kind of merchandise , unless she is sufficiently indemnified for the employment of her capital and the wages of her industry .
What relation is there between the value of gold and silver ?
Their relative values vary continually , and in different places , like the relative values of any other merchandise whatever .
The value of the gold is raised in regard to that of silver , if gold is more demanded or less offered ; hence the agio one is obliged sometimes to pay for the purchase of gold coin with silver money .
Does the same variation exist between copper and silver monies ?
Not commonly ; because we do not receive copper money pure , nor that of copper mixed with silver , which is called billon , at the rate of its intrinsic value , but in consequence of the facility which it affords for obtaining a piece of silver .
If a hundred sous , which are paid me in copper , are intrinsically worth no more than four francs , what does it signify to me : I receive them for five francs , because I am sure to get for them , whenever I please , a piece of five francs .
But when copper money becomes too abundant , and one can no longer obtain for it at pleasure the quantity of silver that it represents , its value is altered , and it can be no longer disposed of without loss .
Repeat to me summarily the essential principles which relate to money .
The numerous exchanges , and other transactions which cannot be dispen
Computer honchos work on a section of Harvard 's Mark I in 1944 .
The whole apparatus measured 55 feet long .
Courtesy Computer History Museum __1944 : __Harvard and IBM dedicate the Mark I computer .
Also known as the IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator , or ASCC , the pioneering computer was notable for producing reliable results and its ability to run 24/7 .
Harvard electrical engineer Howard Aiken first dreamt up a large - scale calculator in 1937 .
He knew he needed a corporate partner and first courted Monroe Calculator Company , which turned him down .
Aiken went back to the drawing board and came up with a proposal that convinced IBM , whose big product at the time was a punch - card processor .
A big plus in the proposal was that it used so many existing IBM components in a new way .
Clair Lake , Frank Hamilton and Benjamin Durfee finished the Harvard computer at Endicott , New York , in January 1943 .
They demonstrated it to the Harvard faculty members in December , and then took it apart , packed it up and shipped it off to Cambridge , where it was rebuilt in the basement of the physics lab .
The Mark I was a monster : 55 feet long and 8 feet high .
It weighed five tons and contained 760,000 components , including 3,000 rotating counter wheels and 1,400 rotary - dial switches , along with an assortment of shafts , clutches and electromagnetic relays , all linked together with 500 miles of wire .
Its clickety - clack sounded like a " roomful of ladies knitting . "
You fed instructions in on paper tape , and loaded the data on punch cards .
It could only perform operations in the precise linear order it received instructions .
The tape could not run backward .
The Mark I could handle 23 - decimal - place numbers and perform addition , subtraction , multiplication and division .
It was also programmed with subroutines for logarithms and trigonometry .
It was slow , taking three to five seconds to do a multiplication .
It gave you results through two outputs : teletypewriter and punch card .
Mathematician Grace Hopper of the U.S. Naval Reserve joined Aiken 's team at Harvard and was instrumental in keeping the Mark I running .
She repaired it one day by removing a moth that had fouled the Mark I 's electromechanical innards , becoming the first person to literally debug a computer .
( The term itself was already in use for other mechanical devices , and Hopper noted the irony . )
1
When the time neared to dedicate the Mark I , in August 1944 , the Harvard News Office put out a press release giving all the credit for the machine to Aiken .
IBM chief Thomas J. Watson was himself so put out that his firm's work was not being acknowledged that he threatened to return to New York , boycotting the dedication and luncheon festivities .
Cooler heads prevailed , and Watson stayed for the hoopla , but Aiken and Watson never got over their turf tiff .
Years later , when Thomas J. Watson Jr. made a peace offering of a consultant gig at IBM , Aiken refused to sign a nondisclosure agreement .
Hopper and Aiken ( also USNR ) used the Mark I to help the Navy produce tables for aiming artillery shells and bombs in the closing year of World War II .
The electromagnetic machine remained in use until 1959 , by which time it was left in the dust by true electronic computers using first vacuum tubes , then transistors , then chips .
And for all of the Mark I 's advances , German engineer Konrad Zuse 's Z3 model from 1941 may have preceded it as the world 's first fully functional , programmable computer .
Aiken went on to build the Mark II in 1947 , the same year he founded the Harvard Computation Laboratory and predicted , " Only six electronic digital computers would be required to satisfy the computing needs of the entire United States . "

Darpa , the Pentagon 's far - out research arm , typically works on morphing airplanes , thinking robots , and " kill - proof " soldiers .
Now , the agency wants to help build a better fire extinguisher – by using electromagnetic fields or sonic waves , naturally .
Darpa announced today its new research program into " Instant Fire Suppression . "
" Fire , especially in enclosed military environments such as ship holds , aircraft cockpits , and ground vehicles , continues to be a major cause of material destruction and loss of warfighter life , " the agency notes .
And " despite extensive research in this area , there have been no new methods for extinguishing and / or manipulating fire in almost 50 years . "
Typically , we 've relied on chemicals like halons , to choke out flames .
But halons are on the way out , because " their depletion of the Earth 's ozone layer . "
And all of the " halon replacements are inferior in performance and are typically toxic and / or ozone - depleting . "
So Darpa is proposing " a radically new approach to both fire manipulation and suppression " – one centered around the realization that flames are , in many ways , electrical .
*[ F] lames are a cold plasma consisting of mobile electrons and slower positive ions .
This discovery ... has its origins in the classic work of Volta in the early 1800s on the “ electrical nature ” of flames .
Since typical flames cannot exist without a stable plasma , this provides an effective point of attack : control the plasma to control the fire .
Control includes both fire extinguishment and spatiotemporal manipulation ; the bending of flames by electric fields was first demonstrated in the 1870s .
Spatiotemporal manipulation of flames could permit the creation of “ escape corridors ” in flame - filled environments , and achieve the spatial localization / confinement required to prevent spreading of fire to other combustible materials .
*
Which is why Darpa believes that " the methods of plasma physics and chemistry can be applied to create revolutionary new capabilities for fire suppression .
Possible candidates : Everything from " electromagnetic fields " to
" acoustic ion injection [s ] " to " static electricity " to " chemical suppressants " to some combination of 'em all .
But do n't expect sonic fire extinguishers any time soon .
This project is going to require " breakthroughs " in how scientists understand and quantify " cold plasma composition , chemistry and dynamics in a hot flame environment . "
And , of course , there 's the not - insignificant matter of actually building the thing .
So if you 've got " expertise in flame chemistry and physics , plasma chemistry and physics , chemical kinetics , electromagnetics , theoretical modeling and engineering , " get cookin ' .

Six workers killed in construction of Las Vegas “ CityCemetery ”
By Roger Herman
14 June 2008
On May 31 , 39 - year old Dustin Tartar of Henderson , Nevada , became the sixth construction worker to die on the job at MGM Mirage ’s CityCenter project and the eleventh to die in Las Vegas in the last 18 months .
Deaths at the MGM project have become so frequent that some workers have begun referring to the complex as “ CityCemetery . ”
Tartar was a crane oiler who was crushed and killed while working on a moving crane when he was caught between the counterweight system and the crane ’s track .
He died only a month after the last incident at the site involving Mark Wescoat , 47 , of Las Vegas .
Wescoat was an electrician who fell to his death on April 26 .
Others killed at the site include : Harold Billingsley , 46 , of Las Vegas , an ironworker who died last October after hitting his head on a beam , losing his balance and falling 55 feet ; Harvey Englander , 65 , of Las Vegas who died last August when his body was struck and severed by an elevator counterweight system ; and Bobby Lee Tohannie , 40 , of Kayenta , Arizona , and Angel J. Hernandez , 24 , of Las Vegas , both of whom were crushed to death in February 2007 , when two 3,000 - pound steel walls fell on them .
The rush to get the MGM CityCenter completed before New Years Eve in 2009 — one of the busiest gambling days of the year — is a major factor in the spate of deaths .
An April 1 article in the Las Vegas Sun , which concentrated on the recent deaths in the construction industry of Las Vegas , noted , “ Workers say they feel unsafe on rushed and crowded construction sites . ”
The Sun also pointed out that the number of deaths in the last 16 months far exceeds those of the building boom of the 1990s , and that national safety experts have become alarmed because “ contractors are taking too many shortcuts and Nevada agencies are lax in oversight . ”
The article was part of an investigative series of the construction industry in Las Vegas and came to the conclusion that there is a pattern of dangerous safety problems on city construction sites , including inadequate training , faulty equipment , job speed - ups , and worker fatigue from excessive overtime .
The CityCenter is the most expensive privately funded construction project in US history .
Two years ago the estimated cost of completing the project was $ 4 billion .
By last summer the price tag had reached $ 7 billion , and today it stands at $ 9.2 billion .
Last year Dubai World , the investment arm of the Persian Gulf state of Dubai , spent almost $ 5 billion to buy a half stake in CityCenter and to acquire 9.4 percent of MGM Mirage .
At different stages of the process there will be anywhere between 4,000 and 8,000 construction workers on site .
Once completed , it will consist of an assortment of high - rise condos , hotels , shopping centers , theatres , and a casino .
One article praising the project site stated , “ If you have to even consider how much living in these MGM CityCenter condos will cost you , you probably cannot afford one .
Few will be able to afford the penthouse suites , or even the larger properties — the hotel is to be one of the most exclusive locations in the world .
The smallest living space will be priced upwards of $ 600,000 , so if you have that laying around , you too could be part of one of the fastest growing cities in America . ”
The CityCenter and its counterpart the Cosmopolitan still only account for a third of the $ 32 billion construction boom on the Las Vegas strip .
All of this squandering of wealth and workers ’ lives goes on while the US is in the midst of the greatest housing crisis since the Great Depression , with Las Vegas leading the nation in home foreclosures .
Even the casinos are feeling the bite of the recession as it sets in .
Many Las Vegas casinos have announced layoffs in the past few months .
According to the Las Vegas Review - Journal , the Nevada Building and Construction Trades Council ( NBCTC ) — which is an affiliation of 17 construction unions working at the CityCenter and the adjacent projects — had been holding talks with MGM Mirage and the general contractor Perini Building Co. in an attempt to resolve the safety issues at the site .
The NBCTC has been under pressure to do something about the safety problems at the site , but its demands are no more than window dressing that will do nothing to address the underlying problems .
John Smirk , secretary - treasurer of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 15 , said that many workers were so concerned about safety at the CityCenter and Cosmopolitan that they did not want to be dispatched to the site .
In response to the latest death on the site , the NBCTC promised it would take strike action if the MGM Mirage and Perini did not address their safety concerns .
On June 2 the NBCTC called a one - day strike demanding that Perini submit to an immediate work site safety assessment by the Center for Construction Research and Training , institute and pay for on - site training administered by the center , and grant full job site access to union and safety officials .
Around 100 workers picketed the CityCenter and Cosmopolitan with chants of “ CityCemetery ” and “ No More Deaths . ”
Paul Jones , a 47 year - old electrician on the picket line , told the Review - Journal , “ A lot of people have died , too many , they need to tighten safety up . ”
Fred Medina , a member of the Plasterers and Cement Masons Local 797 , told the Las Vegas Sun , “ We ’re trying to make a statement that life is important .
When you make a complaint about safety to safety managers , they keep saying , ‘ We ’ll fix it .
We ’ll fix it . ’
But nothing ever happens .
They ’re pushing to get stuff done .
They ’re more interested in the money than keeping the job safe . ”
The strike , which affected both the CityCenter project and the Cosmopolitan — where there have been two additional deaths — was resolved the next day with workers leaving their pickets and returning to the Cosmopolitan site at 9 p.m. on Tuesday , and City Center at midnight .
The NBCTC said that Perini had agreed to their demands to allow for inspections , on - site training and full access to union officials .
How this had transformed the two sites into safe working environments for construction workers was not , however , clarified by union officials .
Speaking to the press on Tuesday , June 3 , NBCTC Secretary - Treasurer Steve Ross declared , “ We have come to an arrangement and an understanding .
I am happy to say our long - lasting relationship is going to continue . ”
He also said that the agreement was “ quite significant , not only for union construction workers but for construction workers in general . ”
Ross ’s reference to the “ long - lasting relationship ” between the companies and the union is revealing .
The union has in fact worked hand - in - glove with the construction and casino companies for years and has no interest in disrupting this relationship .
Another union official tacitly acknowledged that the agreement did not change the conditions at the workplace .
Tate McGinty , president of the local plumbers and pipefitters union , said that while the agreement would improve working conditions on the CityCenter job site , the change would be a slow process and danger would remain as workers hustle to meet a planned opening in late 2009 .
McGinty simply cautioned , “ They need to slow down a little bit . ”
On June 5 , Nevada Governor Jim Gibbons finally made his first statements addressing the deaths at the CityCenter project .
He announced that Nevada has requested federal assistance in reviewing the CityCenter ’s safety procedures which , according to the governor ’s office , will help “ ensure worker safety . ”
However , while the federal officials will be helping with inspections , they will not have the authority to issue citations for safety violations .
On June 10 , the WSWS spoke to workers about the conditions at the site .
Bill , a carpenter for 28 years , said the deaths were uncalled for and were “ the result of the fact that a lot of the guys were tired from working too many hours .
The guys here are pretty safe , but they are just tired .
Really tired . ”
Bill said that Perini tells them to take their time , and that they do n’t feel any pressure to work faster .
He also said that federal agents surveyed the site and some of the more dangerous equipment was removed .
Eddie Jones , a foreman on the site , said he has been working construction for 13 years and that he has been on the CityCenter site for three months .
When questioned about the recent deaths he said , “ It ’s scary .
You have to be extra careful when working on any site , but there are a lot of new people on the job who are n’t taking their time and rushing things . ”
Neil has worked as an electrician for 20 years and is living temporarily in Las Vegas just so he can work on the CityCenter project .
He said , “ I feel bad about the deaths , they come from people not having the proper safety training ...
I do n’t feel any pressure to work faster , but most likely there are those that feel that way , but that ’s because they do n’t know their job that well .
People need to be more aware of their surroundings , but they also need training , training , training again , and to be retrained . ”

Keith Olbermann presented Barack Obama with a few options on how to handle the pending FISA legislation in a Special Comment on Monday 's Countdown .
Senator Obama had once said he was against giving immunity to telecom companies who assisted the Bush administration in illegally spying on American citizens , but more recently has said he would , in fact , vote for the FISA legislation , immunity included .
As Keith points out , Obama has taken political hits from the right and the left and the right is going to attack him no matter how he votes , so he might as well do the right thing and demand telecom immunity be stripped from the bill .
You 've already taken the political hit from the Right , for saying you 'd seek to strip out , or rescind immunity .
You 've already taken the political hit from the Left , for saying you 'd vote for the FISA bill even with the immunity .
You 've paid the political price in advance .
Now buy yourself -- and those who have most ardently supported you -- something worth more than just class action suits against Verizon .
Explain that you are standing aside on civil immunity , not just for political expediency , but for a greater and more tangible good -- the holding to account , of the most - corrupt , the most dangerous , and the most anti-democracy presidential administration in our long history .
Of course , if you disagree with this interpretation -- if you think the FISA bill does n't have the giant loophole , or if you do n't think you , as president , would be ready to support criminal prosecution of ... well , criminals -- then your duty is clear .
Vote against the FISA bill , if it still carries that immunity .
Full transcripts below the fold :
Finally , as promised , a Special Comment on FISA and the Junior Senator from Illinois .
The Democratic leadership in the Senate , Republican knuckle - dragging in the same chamber , and the mediocre skills of whoever wrote the final version of the FISA bill , have combined to give Senator Barack Obama a second chance to make a first impression .
And he damned well better take it .
The Senate vote on this tortured and reckless piece of legislation has now been postponed until after the 4th of July break .
The Democrats , completing their FISA experience ( a collective impression of Homer Simpson falling off a cliff and hitting every bramble on the way down ) , did n't exactly plan this fortuitous delay .
Last week , the vote on their cave - in was imminent .
But , while arguing over a piece of housing legislation , about how many mortgage lenders can dance on the head of a pin , Republicans dithered so long about protecting their constituents -- the banks -- that the Senate calendar got backed up .
This , in turn , gave Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid some time to think .
There was one among his group , chosen to run for President , who had loudly assailed the idea of handing a get - out - of - jail - free card to corporations who had approached definitional fascism by breaking the law in concert with the Bush Administration .
But this Senator had suddenly realized , that to the large group of voters who operate with an information base that would make Cliffs Notes look like the encyclopedia , if , in the final vote , he stood against FISA , he would hand them a rock with which they could hit him over the head , a rock wrapped up in a piece of paper reading :
" Obama voted uh - uh ... thing terror stop . "
Thus , Senator Obama , was born your first second chance .
Senator Reid was kind enough to help you out by composing an amendment that would keep FISA -- which you rightly endorse -- but strips out the telecom immunity , which you rightly oppose .
It 's a protest -- a decidedly lame one -- but in our daily world of political transactions , voting for the amendment when it has no chance of passing and has been in essence constructed as pure Obama CYA -- that is a petty crime .
Whether it will do more to harm your premise of " new politics " than to your credibility as an immunity - opponent , is for you , Senator , to assess .
And live with .
It would be sweet to have a pure , politics - free president , but the last of those retired from office in 1797 .
And while we 've all quoted the farewell address of " The Father Of Our Nation " for 211 years now , nobody seems to want to remember that its point was to urge his children that : whatever you do , for God 's sake , do n't form political parties -- some day they will kill you .
Anyway , Senator , your problem here is n't the backlash about telecom immunity , and it is n't really about your political fluidity on the FISA bill .
Your problem is what happens even if this plays out according to plan next week :
1 ) You vote for the anti-immunity amendment .
2 ) The anti-immunity amendment fails .
3 ) You vote for the FISA legislation .
And 4 ) The FISA legislation passes .
Oh , and , 5 ) Senator :
The Republicans still run against you with the ' elections - for - dummies ' message : " Obama voted uh - uh ... thing terror - stop . "
Because , inside the obscenity that was Charlie Black 's comment about how a terrorist attack in this country would be good -- good for his boy McCain 's chances for election ... Inside the inhuman calculation that Benazhir Bhutto did not die in vain -- she helped McCain in the New Hampshire primary ... There is a sad and cynical reality .
The Republicans can scare some of the people all of the time , and they can scare all of the people some of the time .
This is all they are right now .
Nobody ever said it better than did Aaron Sorkin in his script for the movie " The American President " :
" Whatever your particular problem is , friend , I promise you , Bob Rumson ( and for Bob Rumson , read " John McCain " ) is not the least bit interested in solving it .
He is interested in two things and two things only : Making you afraid of it , and telling you who 's to blame for it . "
Republicans , with almost no exceptions , have no true credibility on counter - terrorism , no track record of prevention or amelioration , and their president can't even remember the name of the skyscraper he claims to have saved in Los Angeles .
And yet , somehow , the Republicans have managed to convince the public that it does n't matter that Mr. Bush had already completed 22 percent of his first term , when he , his administration , and his party , failed so catastrophically on 9/11 .
The President and party who were at fault , were magically transformed into the President and party who would never let it happen again .
An unjust ... repellant ... nefarious , trick .
But , politically , rather a neat trick .
Senator , the Republicans are going to paint you as soft on terror no matter how you vote on FISA .
Or how you vote on the Telecom Immunity Amendment .
Or on the next farm bill .
Last week it was Grover Norquist calling you " John Kerry with a tan . "
By November 1st , it 'll be Dick Cheney calling you " Osama Bin Laden with a tan . "
When you announced your support of this latest FISA bill ( with or without the telecom immunity ) , the Republicans actually raced to get out a press release accusing you of flip - flopping .
You shared the exact same position , on which they are running their entire campaign and they criticized you anyway !
So , Senator , from their point of view , they think they 've got you boxed in .
Vote for FISA and you 've contradicted yourself .
Vote against FISA and it 's " Obama voted uh - uh ... thing terror - stop . "
Vote for FISA and against immunity , and it 's political expediency , and Democrats soft on terror , and " Obama voted uh - uh ... thing terror - stop . "
This is a problem , Senator .
Because , flatly , of all the measures that can be taken to aid our damaged nation , and our de-valued Constitution , the first , if not the foremost , is not blocking telecom immunity , but making sure no Republican is in the White House past noon next January 20th .
Of all the remedial efforts against the Bush administration 's high crimes and misdemeanors , and of all the prophylactic steps against further inroads against the freedoms of the citizens of this nation and the rights of everyone else , the primary step must still come to us through the prism of politics .
Would that it were otherwise .
But it ai n't .
Frankly , Senator , this political tight - rope act you 've tried on FISA the last two weeks , which from the outside seems to have been intended to increase the chances of your election , probably has n't helped that chance in the slightest .
There is , fortunately , a possible -- a most unexpected -- solution .
Your second second chance .
Since the final version of the FISA bill was passed down from on high , John Dean has been reading it , and re-reading it , and cross - referencing it with other relevant law , and thinking .
Something bothered him about it .
Or , more correctly , something did n't bother him about it .
Turns out lawyers at the ACLU have been doing the same thing for the last ten days .
John compared notes with them , and will be devoting his column at " Find Law " this week , to this unlikely conclusion :
The Republicans who wrote most of this bill at Mr. Bush 's urging , managed to immunize the telecoms from civil suits .
But not from criminal prosecution .
Senator , here is John Dean 's summary of his findings , which he sent me this morning .
" It is clear not only from the language of the bill ( which must be read in the context of other , related statutes to be clearly understood ) , but also from the legislative history , that there is absolutely no criminal immunity for anyone in these FISA amendments . "
Moreover , Senator , it seems as if a lot of people have known this , for a long time .
During the January 24th , 2008 debate in the Senate , Senator Brownback noted , " The immunity provisions would not apply to the Government or Government officials .
Cases against the Government regarding the alleged programs would continue .
And the provisions would apply only to civil and not criminal cases . "
In fact , Senator , just last week , Attorney General Mukasey and Director of National Intelligence McConnell sent a letter , for the record , to House Speaker Pelosi emphasizing that the liability protection , quote , " does not immunize any criminal conduct . "
And if you ask , Senator , about the President responding to all this by belching out a series of pardons or a blanket pardon to those who broke the law on his behalf , Dean has you covered here , too ...
It ... " would require acceptance by them of the fact that they had broken the law , and thus be an admission of guilt .
" And a blanket pardon would be an admission by Bush that his war on terror has been a lawless undertaking , operating beyond the bounds of the Constitution and statutes that check the powers of the president and the executive branch .
" It would be an admission by Bush , too , of his own criminal culpability ( which is why Nixon refused to grant his aides a pardon . )
Senator -- sometimes it is better to be lucky , than good .
Keep your eye on the wording of the legislation to make sure the Republicans do n't realize its flaws .
Then vote for the amendment to strip telecom immunity out of the FISA bill .
Then after that fails , vote for the FISA bill , if that 's your final answer .
Then the minute the president has signed the FISA bill , you announce that you voted for it because it renews FISA and because it permits a bigger prize than just civil suits ; that it allows for criminal prosecution of past illegal eavesdropping .
Say , loudly , that your understanding of this bill is such , that if you are elected , your Attorney General will begin a full - scale criminal investigation of the telecom companies who collaborated with President Bush in eavesdropping on Americans .
And mention -- oh by the way -- that your Attorney General will subpoena such records , notes , e-mail , data , and testimony , from any and all Bush Administration officials , FBI or CIA personnel , or any members of the Executive Branch , who may have as much as breathed in the general direction of these nefarious acts of domestic spying at Mr. Bush 's behest .
Wait -- you say there 's a political hit waiting for you there too ?
Another " Obama voted uh - uh ... thing terror - stop . " ?
Actually , Senator , you 've already gone down this road , when you spoke to my colleague , Will Bunch , of the Philadelphia Daily News , on April 14th of this year .
He asked about the possibility of criminal investigations of the 43rd President and his henchmen .
" What I would want to do , " you told him , " is have my Justice Department and my Attorney General immediately review the information that 's already there and to find out , are there inquiries that need to be pursued .
I can't prejudge that , because we do n't have access to all the material right now . "
" You 're also right that I would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of Republicans as a partisan witch hunt , because I think we 've got too many problems we 've got to solve . "
" Now , if I found out that there were high officials who knowingly , consciously broke existing laws , engaged in cover-ups of those crimes with knowledge forefront , then I think a basic principle of our Constitution is : nobody above the law .
And I think that 's roughly how I would look at it . "
Make this clear , Senator .
You 've already taken the political hit from the Right , for saying you 'd seek to strip out , or rescind immunity .
You 've already taken the political hit from the Left , for saying you 'd vote for the FISA bill even with the immunity .
You 've paid the political price in advance .
Now buy yourself -- and those who have most ardently supported you -- something worth more than just class action suits against Verizon .
Explain that you are standing aside on civil immunity , not just for political expediency , but for a greater and more tangible good -- the holding to account , of the most - corrupt , the most dangerous , and the most anti-democracy presidential administration in our long history .
Of course , if you disagree with this interpretation -- if you think the FISA bill does n't have the giant loophole , or if you do n't think you , as president , would be ready to support criminal prosecution of ... well , criminals -- then your duty is clear .
Vote against the FISA bill , if it still carries that immunity .
The Republicans are going to call you the names any which way , Senator .
They 're going to cry regardless , Senator .
And as the old line goes : give them something to cry about .
Good night , and good luck .
President Bush had hoped to shape America ’s military presence in Iraq for years after his departure from the White House by negotiating a long - term status - of - forces agreement , but a number of sticking points indicate there will be a much shorter time frame .
U.S. negotiators have agreed to a kind of timetable for withdrawal , as demanded by the Iraqis , but are holding out over legal immunity for American forces .
The chief argument for staying in Iraq is that the country will fall apart if the U.S. withdraws , so it ’s instructive that Iraqis themselves seem to look forward to that day .
One U.S. official told The Washington Post that Iraqi politicians were adamant that some kind of withdrawal timetable be included .
Otherwise they would not be able to sell the agreement to the people .
Imagine that .
The first two Godfather movies have been restored and are returning to the big screen .
Cleaned - up 35 mm versions of the mafia epics - directed by Francis Ford Coppola and starring Marlon Brando Al Pacino and Robert De Niro - will be screened at September 's Gotham Film Forum in New York before hitting movie theatres across the U.S.
The work has been carried out by Robert A. Harris , under the direction of Coppola and original cinematographer Gordon Willis Harris - who also worked on a Lawrence of Arabia restoration - claims his job was made tougher because high demand for prints of the movies had left the original negative in poor condition .
He tells Daily Variety , " ( It was ) the worst I 've ever seen in a picture from the modern era .

The first two Godfathers are among the most successful and critically acclaimed movies ever made .

The Guardian view on plans for civil society : the right direction
More on : China
China ’s July trade data is now out .
Strong export growth ( 27 % y/y ) produced a much larger than expected trade surplus .
Exports from May through July 2008 are running about 23 % above exports from May through July 2007 .
That is pretty good in my book .
The troubles of China ’s textile sector simply may not be representative of China ’s broader economy .
Michael Pettis notes :
the woes of a small but powerful segment of the export industry – low - value - added processors in the south of China , who have been hit primarily by rising wages and a welcome shift in the southern economies towards higher - value - added goods and services – have created a false impression about dire conditions for China ’s exporters
Earlier I suggested that it would be hard to argue that Chinese exports were really slowing so long as monthly exports were running $ 20 b a month higher than in 2007 .
July 2008 exports were $ 29 b above July 2007 exports .
That suggests an acceleration in export growth , not a slowdown .
But I would n’t necessarily read too much into the July data -- there seems to be a lot of unusual seasonality in China ’s data this year .
Some August exports may have been pulled toward to help minimize congestion around the Olympics .
The sharp fall in German export orders and anecdotal evidence that American manufacturers are seeing a fall in European demand do suggest a broader slump in trade is in the cards , and it is hard to believe that China wo n’t be touched .
If Danske Bank is right , real exports already have slowed significantly , with about 10 % of the nominal export growth now coming from higher prices .
But 15 % real export growth is still quite strong .
The US would be thrilled with that kind of growth .
But when I look back , I really do n’t see strong evidence that China ’s export boom has slowed in any meaningful way .
Consider a plot showing the rolling 12 m sum of exports and imports .
The overarching story of this decade continues to be that China has enjoyed one big sustained export boom .
A plot that shows the difference ( in billions of dollars ) between China ’s exports over the last 12 months over a comparable period a year ago ( i.e . I subtracted the sum of China ’s exports from August 2006 to July 2007 from the sum of China ’s exports from August 2008 to July 2007 ) suggests export growth has leveled off at a high level -- not that it is falling .
Imports are up in dollar terms -- as one would expect given the rise in commodity prices .
But exports have held up well .
The surprise is n’t that higher oil has pulled down China ’s trade surplus a bit .
The surprise is that China ’s trade surplus has n’t fallen by more in a period when US demand for Chinese goods stalled and oil prices soared .
This chart illustrates one other important point .
China ’s exports historically have n’t always trended straight up .
In the 1990s there were pronounced cycles -- and even periods when exports fell .
So far this decade has been nothing other than one large boom for China ’s export sector .
There has n’t been a real down cycle .
More of the dollar increase may be coming from higher dollar prices rather than expanding volumes , but export revenue are still growing at a decent clip .
18 months ago , there was a lot of talk about how the US had vanquished the economic cycle , and entered into a new period with far less macroeconomic volatility .
That was a bit too sanguine .
And my guess is that at some point , China truly will experience an export slump .
I doubt China has vanquished the economic cycle .
Rising exports imply more not less exposure to the global economy .
And , as David Dollar notes , Chinese exports cannot grow more rapidly than world trade for all that much longer .
But if monthly exports are still up nearly $ 30 b ( 27 % ) over the preceding year , well , it hard to argue that the slump has started .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Cellphone calls on airplanes in flight are not only unsafe , they are obnoxious and they should be permanently banned , according to some members of the U.S. Congress .
Members of the House of Representatives , most of whom board airplanes almost every week , traded horror stories Thursday about their worst experiences with annoying fellow passengers who talk loudly on cellphones before takeoff and after landing .
One lawmaker said his wife sat next to a woman who loudly discussed her sex life on the phone .
Another House member topped that with the passenger sitting him behind on one flight who got a " dear John " phone call from either his wife or sweetheart just before takeoff .
The begging and pleading was just terrible to listen to , he said .
Finally , with the plane ready to take off , a flight attendant had to threaten to have U.S. Marshals drag the man off the plane before he finally put his phone away .
A third House member raised the specter of national security , saying she had witnessed one man use his cellphone camera to take pictures of sensitive parts of the airplane .
With that , the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved by voice vote a bill that would make the current Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Communication Commission ban on cellphone use during flight permanent .
The committee 's action comes as the European Union is moving to allow airline passengers to talk on their cellphones during flight .
Some U.S. airlines are experimenting with in - flight Internet access .
And some lawmakers worry that domestic airlines might try to get the cellphone ban lifted so they can charge passengers extra to sit in no -phone sections .
" I do believe this is important that we do n't make what is already a crowded and difficult environment for the traveling public and flight attendants " worse by allowing cellphone use in - flight , said Rep.
Peter DeFazio , a Democrat and sponsor of the Halting Airplane Noise to Give Us Peace ( HANG UP ) Act .
But Rep. John Mica , a Republican , said there are a lot of annoying things on airplanes , including children with dirty diapers and noisy MP3 players , but that does not mean they should be banned .
" You are trying to legislate courtesy , folks , and that just does n't work , " Mica said .

When astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin first scraped their boots in the moon 's powdery gray dust nearly 40 years ago , they both remarked about how arid Earth 's closest neighbor seemed .
" It 's like much of the high desert of the United States , " Armstrong radioed back to Mission Control .
" Magnificent desolation , " Aldrin agreed .
Analysis of the 832 pounds of lunar soil and rocks the Apollo crews lugged home reinforced Armstrong 's and Aldrin 's first impressions , helping convince scientists that the moon was bone - dry through and through .
The fiery Earth - versus - planetoid collision 4.5 billion years ago whose debris formed the moon seemingly obliterated water 's chemical building blocks there .
But new research by a team including Case Western Reserve University geochemist James Van Orman suggests the waterless moon concept may be all wet .

The New York Times began removing dozens of the distinctive horizontal ceramic rods that sheathe its year - old building in Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday afternoon , hours after a man climbed up the side of the skyscraper .
It was the third time such a stunt had occurred in the last five weeks .
The alteration of the facade of the 52 - story tower , which was designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano and opened last year , represented a reversal for The Times , which had insisted that it would not remove the rods after two men scaled the building on June 5 , using the veil of rods as a ladder .
Even as workers stood on a canopy along the West 41st Street side of the building on Wednesday , unclipping rods from their frames and piling them onto a hand truck , a Times spokeswoman , Catherine J. Mathis , declined to provide details about their efforts , saying , “ We are not going to discuss the steps we have taken or may take to prevent a recurrence . ” .
Michael Golden , the vice chairman of The New York Times Company , said he was determined to find a solution that would not compromise the architecture .
“ We ’re going to sort this out within the design sensibility of the building , ” he said .
( Brief because ( a ) I really do n’t know that much history , and ( b ) there ’s really only one idea here with a few examples , and once you get the point , we ’re done and can move to the outro . )
Zed and Reg at Rubyfringe exchanging dangerous ideas , photo by Libin Pan
Astronomy and Celestial Mechanics were dangerous ideas because they undermined the most powerful organization of their day , The Church .
That ’s why people have been banned , tortured , and burned at the stake for talking about these ideas .
Crossbows were a dangerous idea because they allowed an untrained peasant to kill a knight .
Longbows were not a dangerous idea , because only trained archers can kill a knight with a longbow , and the nobility were the only people who could compel peasants to practise yeomanry .
Cryptography is not a dangerous idea , because we really do n’t know if any of our algorithms and protocols are resistant to the NSA .
This was hi-lighted when researchers “ discovered ” differential cryptanalysis .
When they looked at the DES algorithm IBM has been promoting since the 1976 , they found that it had been specifically tuned to resist differential cryptanalysis .
IBM ‘ fessed up : the US government had told them to tune things that way without explaining why , leading us to conclude they had known about this attack for decades before it became public knowledge .
Today , we have no idea whether what we think is strong is actually strong or whether it has vulnerabilities and back doors governments can exploit .
Miles Davis was a walking , talking , trumpet - playing dangerous idea .
Not because he reinvented Jazz five different times ( Dear Steve : Apple II , Macintosh , iPod / iPhone , Pixar .
One more for the tie , two for the record . )
Miles was an egocentric , venal man who worked the system , not undermined the system .
But he was still dangerous because he got white people directly interested in black music .
There was no Elvis or Vanilla Ice or anyone else between his music and the mainstream audience .
For a government intent on keeping America ’s two dominant cultures divided through fear , anything uniting them was a threat .
People say Miles ’ legacy is his music .
To me , Miles ’ lasting legacy is people like me , people with one parent from each culture who grew up dancing to the same music together .
People who , incidentally , do not vote for governments that take a divide and conquer approach to culture .
And on to tech .
Microcomputers were not a dangerous idea .
But personal computers were dangerous .
It took decades for IT departments to regain control over people bringing their own computers to work .
They can thank Microsoft for helping them get back into the driver ’s seat .
( This , incidentally , is why I really dislike Microsoft ’s policies : it has nothing to do with their lack of taste , it has to do with their mission to make the computer on my desk belong to my IT department or the record label or the movie studio or — I suspect — the government . )
Web applications are dangerous .
Never mind the fact that they make desktop applications obsolete .
The people who built desktop applications just go and get jobs writing web applications .
Same people , different shit .
But as Giles Bowkett pointed out , web applications just might make venture capital obsolete !
When you do n’t need hundreds of programmers and distribution channels and all the other friction - managing elements of a company that ships old - school software , you need a lot less money to start a business .
And on to media .
You know that the web is busy putting newspapers out of business .
My wife and I watched YouTube last Saturday Night .
I ’m not talking about the advertising business : I think we would have been happy to watch ads to watch our Mitch Hedberg and Billy Connoly comedy clips .
But the web lets us choose what we want to watch , when we want to watch it .
The network ca n’t put their up - and - coming show on right after their hit to give it a boost .
The new show has to compete on its own merits .
That puts users in control , and that ’s dangerous .
Joel Spolsky said a similar thing about pricing all music at 99 cents a track : it means the labels can’t kill an artist by sticking their CD in the $ 3.99 crapola bin .
Users choose what they want to listen to .
That ’s dangerous , again because users are in control .
Okay , that ’s enough .
Dangerous ideas are the ones that subvert the existing hierarchy of control , not just the ones that shuffle people around in the same old chairs .
Apple Macintosh with a GUI replacing a PC with a command line ?
Not dangerous .
Apple Macintosh with a Laserwriter and Aldus Pagemaker allowing someone to launch a magazine in their basement that competes with a company employing dozens of layout artists ?
That ’s dangerous , and that ’s interesting .
Dangerous equals subversive equals interesting .
Deep breath .
Okay , the next thing is not particularly dangerous for the world at large , but it is for me .
I am retiring from blogging and retiring from hacking on Ruby .
Maybe I ’ll un -retire one day .
I do n’t know , the future is not set .
Miles Davis was n’t afraid to move on when the time was right , even if what he was doing seemed to make people happy .
Respecting his legacy means seeking what he sought .
Remember how I said that microcomputers were not dangerous , but personal computers were ?
Right now , I would say this : Ruby is not dangerous , but Rails is dangerous and Merb is dangerous and Sinatra is dangerous .
Rewriting for Ruby is interesting .
I believe it is useful .
But is it dangerous ?
No .
Likewise , I can say with a clear conscience that while writing is gratifying , and trying to write out and explain ideas has helped me understand things , the writing I ’ve been doing is not dangerous .
It does n’t subvert .
So while hacking away on Ruby the language and blogging about software development is gratifying and useful , they are not dangerous activities .
They are microcomputers , but they are not personal computers .
I am going on vacation from August 2nd through 10th .
During that time I plan to do absolutely no thinking about computers .
For what it ’s worth , I will be engaging in activities with faux danger : wreck diving and sport climbing .
( p.s. these are not solitary pursuits : if you want to try some of the world ’s greatest wreck diving and sport climbing , get in touch ) .
When I return , I will give things some serious thought and hopefully , discover a way I can help make our world a more dangerous place .
Thank you ever so much for your support and interest and feedback .
Especial thanks to my fellow bloggers like Joel , Joey , Giles , Damien , Obie and so many others who exchanged ideas with me and kept the debate alive .
And Reddit ?
And Hacker News ?
You rock , you are the future .
I ca n’t wait to see how your communities and technologies evolve .
Warmest regards , Reginald Braithwaite

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a resolution apologizing to African - Americans for slavery and the era of Jim Crow .
The House on Tuesday evening passed a resolution apologizing for slavery and Jim Crow laws .
The nonbinding resolution , which passed on a voice vote , was introduced by Rep. Steve Cohen , a white lawmaker who represents a majority black district in Memphis , Tennessee .
While many states have apologized for slavery , it is the first time a branch of the federal government has done so , an aide to Cohen said .
In passing the resolution , the House also acknowledged the " injustice , cruelty , brutality and inhumanity of slavery and Jim Crow . "
" Jim Crow , " or Jim Crow laws , were state and local laws enacted mostly in the Southern and border states of the United States between the 1870s and 1965 , when African - Americans were denied the right to vote and other civil liberties and were legally segregated from whites .
The name " Jim Crow " came from a character played by T.D. " Daddy " Rice who portrayed a slave while in blackface during the mid-1800s .
The resolution states that " the vestiges of Jim Crow continue to this day . "
" African - Americans continue to suffer from the consequences of slavery and Jim Crow -- long after both systems were formally abolished -- through enormous damage and loss , both tangible and intangible , including the loss of human dignity and liberty , the frustration of careers and professional lives , and the long - term loss of income and opportunity , " the resolution states .
The House also committed itself to stopping " the occurrence of human rights violations in the future . "
The resolution does not address the controversial issue of reparations .
Some members of the African - American community have called on lawmakers to give cash payments or other financial benefits to descendents of slaves as compensation for the suffering caused by slavery .
It is not the first time lawmakers have apologized to an ethnic group for injustices .
In April , the Senate passed a resolution sponsored by Sen. Sam Brownback , R - Kansas , that apologized to Native Americans for " the many instances of violence , maltreatment and neglect . "
In 1993 the Senate also passed a resolution apologizing for the " illegal overthrow " of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893 .
In 1988 , Congress passed and President Reagan signed an act apologizing to the 120,000 Japanese - Americans who were held in detention camps during World War II .
The 60,000 detainees who were alive at the time each received $ 20,000 from the government .
CNN 's Deirdre Walsh and Scott Anderson contributed to this report .

Obama backs long - term US military presence in Iraq
By Patrick Martin
29 July 2008
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama reiterated his support for an open - ended US military presence in Iraq over the weekend , further narrowing his professed differences with the Bush administration and Republican presidential candidate John McCain .
In an interview with Newsweek correspondent Richard Wolffe , published on the magazine ’s web site Saturday , Obama emphasized that his policy in Iraq was one of “ phased withdrawal , ” in which US troops could remain in large numbers in Iraq for many years .
“ They ’re going to need our help for some time , ” he said .
“ We ’re going to have to provide them with logistical support , intelligence support , ” Obama continued .
“ We ’re going to have to have a very capable counterterrorism strike force .
We ’re going to have to continue to train their Army and police to make them more effective . ”
Asked about how large a force would be required to carry out these missions , Obama replied , “ I do think that ’s entirely conditions - based .
It ’s hard to anticipate where we may be six months from now , or a year from now , or a year and a half from now . ”
The McCain campaign immediately highlighted Obama ’s reference to troop withdrawal decisions being “ conditions - based , ” declaring that he was conceding the correctness of the policy pursued by the Bush administration and advocated by McCain , rejecting any “ artificial ” deadline for the removal of American troops .
“ Barack Obama is ultimately articulating a position of sustained troop levels in Iraq based on the conditions on the ground and the security of the country , ” said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds .
“ That is the very same position that John McCain has long held . ”
Obama ’s sharp swing to the right on foreign policy has been noted in another quarter : Israel , where politicians from right - wing Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and his Labor Party rival Ehud Barak all applauded the Democratic candidate ’s stance on Iran .
Writing in Israel ’s largest - circulation newspaper , Yediot Aharanot , columnist Itamar Eichner declared , “ For every fear , query or question , Obama immediately produced a suitable Zionist answer . ”
Walter Russell Mead , a conservative foreign policy analyst , commented on the broader foreign policy convergence of Obama , Bush and McCain in an op - ed column published in the Los Angeles Times Sunday .
He wrote , “ Obama ’s pilgrimage abroad points to a larger truth :
In the midst of a bitter political year , a loose bipartisan consensus on the Mideast may be emerging . ”
The four main policy issues on which the two candidates and the Bush administration have substantial agreement , he wrote , include : greater US military involvement in Afghanistan and Central Asia ; using whatever force is necessary to prevent the collapse of the current Iraqi regime ; siding with Israel against the Palestinians ; and pressure on Iran , using diplomacy , sanctions and force if ultimately required to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons .
Practically gloating over the rebuff being delivered to the widespread popular opposition to the war in Iraq , Mead added , “ And , irony of ironies , the consensus , seemingly embraced by Obama , seems closer to Bush ’s views than to those of the antiwar activists who propelled the Illinois senator to the nomination . ”
The right - wing columnist was underlining the most important feature of the 2008 presidential election campaign : once again , as in the previous three elections , the Democratic Party is serving as the political graveyard for opposition to American militarism .
Hundreds of thousands of people , many of them youth and students , backed the Obama campaign hoping that his election would lead to an end to the war in Iraq .
Obama appealed to antiwar sentiment in his primary campaign against Hillary Clinton , declaring that the war was one “ that should never have been authorized and never been waged . ”
But as he seeks to pass the final hurdle in the presidential contest — assuring the most powerful sections of the US ruling elite that he will defend their strategic and economic interests , in the Middle East and throughout the world — Obama has abandoned his antiwar rhetoric and speaks openly as the prospective commander - in - chief of American imperialism .
The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee sounded this theme in an interview on “ Meet the Press , ” broadcast Sunday morning .
He responded to a question by NBC’s Tom Brokaw , about why he would not admit that the Bush “ surge ” had been a success , with the following declaration .
SEN . OBAMA : “... to try to single out one factor in a very messy situation is just not accurate , and it does n’t , it does n’t take into account the larger strategic issues that have been at stake throughout this process .
Look , we ’ve got a finite amount of resources .
We ’ve got a finite number of troops .
Our military is stretched extraordinarily because of trying to fight two wars at the same time .
And so my job as the next commander in chief is going to be to make a decision what is the right war to fight , and , and how do we fight it ?
And I think that we should have been focused on Afghanistan from the start .
We should have finished that job . ”
Note the sentence : “ My job as the next commander in chief is going to be to make a decision what is the right war to fight . ”
The American people thus will be given the choice on November 4 of voting for War # 1 or War # 2 , Iraq or Afghanistan .
In fact , they will be saddled with both wars , with only slight differences between the Democrats and Republicans over which war should receive the largest proportion of US military resources .
Those who oppose American militarism , who want to bring an end to the oppression and violence wrought by imperialist aggression throughout the Middle East and Central Asia , have been disenfranchised by the two big business parties .
In the “ Meet the Press ” interview , Brokaw touched on the material interests at stake in the Middle East , asking Obama whether , in the case of troops that were withdrawn from Iraq , “ those that do n’t go to Afghanistan , will they stay in the region and protect Saudi oil fields ? ”
Obama replied that there would be a residual troop deployment in the Persian Gulf , of undetermined size and location .
There has been increasingly open discussion in the American press about the oil interests at the center of the US intervention in Iraq — perhaps whetted by the prospect that US oil companies may be close to actually cashing in on the dominant US role in the conquered country .
The Washington Post , for instance , published two editorials in the recent period declaring that Iraq ’s oil reserves were a vital US interest .
On July 16 , the newspaper attacked Obama ’s speech on Iraq delivered the day before , which reaffirmed his support for a 16 - month timetable to remove US combat troops .
Criticizing his claim that Iraq was a distraction from larger strategic interests , the Post wrote : “ That ’s an irrational and ahistorical way to view a country at the strategic center of the Middle East , with some of the world ’s largest oil reserves .
Whether or not the war was a mistake , Iraq ’s future is a vital U.S. security interest .
If he is elected president , Mr. Obama sooner or later will have to tailor his Iraq strategy to that reality . ”
A second editorial on July 23 praised Obama for taking a more flexible position on Iraq , but criticized his claim that Afghanistan should be the real “ central front ” for US military operations .
It concluded with the following remarkably blunt assertion : “ While the United States has an interest in preventing the resurgence of the Afghan Taliban , the country ’s strategic importance pales beside that of Iraq , which lies at the geopolitical center of the Middle East and contains some of the world ’s largest oil reserves . ”
Here is the undisguised voice of American imperialism .
Let ’s cut out all the twaddle about fighting terrorism and avenging the 9/11 attacks , the Post is saying .
That ’s good to bamboozle the American people , but no president can take that seriously .
The real issue is securing control of a country “ which lies at the geopolitical center of the Middle East and contains some of the world ’s largest oil reserves . ”
Those who sincerely want to carry out a struggle against imperialist war must recognize that it is impossible to separate the military atrocities perpetrated by the Pentagon from the socio-economic interests of the ruling class that send the US military into battle .
The struggle against imperialist war requires a political struggle against the profit system as a whole .
This means mobilizing the working class as an independent political force , on the basis of an internationalist and socialist program .
Saudi Arabia today rebuffed George Bush 's appeal to increase production and help cut record oil prices , the White House said .
It was the second time this year that the pleas of the US president , who is visiting King Abdullah , have fallen on deaf ears .
Bush 's latest request came as the price of crude oil hit a new high of more than $ 127 ( £ 65 ) a barrel .
" What they 're saying to us is ... Saudi Arabia does not have customers that are making requests for oil that they are not able to satisfy , " the US national security adviser , Stephen Hadley , told reporters .
However , the oil minister , Ali Naimi , said later that Saudi Arabia had raised production by 300,000 barrels per day on May 10 in response to requests from its customers .
He said the increase would push the kingdom's output to 9.45 m barrels a day by June .
High petrol prices are a potential issue in November 's US presidential election .
When Bush made his first appeal in January the Saudi oil minister said that oil production was at normal levels and the kingdom would raise production only when the market justified it .
Bush has conceded that raising output is difficult because the demand for oil — particularly from China and India — is stretching supplies .
The price of crude oil has consistently traded at new highs this year since hitting $ 100 a barrel at the beginning of January .
UBS yesterday became the latest bank to predict the price of crude oil could hit $ 200 , with its analysts saying that the figure could be reached by 2015 .
The US Congress yesterday voted to halt daily shipments of 70,000 barrels of oil to the US 's emergency reserve in a bid to push down prices .
Bush had argued that halting the shipments would have little or no impact on petrol or crude oil prices .
The US Energy Department said later it had cancelled shipments into the reserve , beginning in July .
But the White House has indicated that he will sign the reserve measure .
Senate Democrats have introduced a resolution that would block $ 1.4bn in arms sales to Saudi Arabia — the world 's biggest oil supplier — unless it agrees to increase its production by 1 m barrels a day .
The Democrats said they proposed the measure to coincide with Bush 's visit to send a message to Saudi Arabia that it should produce more oil to reduce the cost of petrol for Americans .
While demand has surged because of booming economies in developing countries , political tensions in Nigeria , Venezuela and Iran have threatened supplies .
Before Bush arrived in Saudi Arabia , the US said it had agreed to cooperate to protect Saudi Arabia 's oil and to help it develop peaceful nuclear energy .
Saudi Arabia accounts for more than a tenth of global oil output and severe damage to its infrastructure would have far - reaching effects .
Al - Qaida has threatened more strikes on Saudi oil facilities after a failed attack on the world 's largest oil processing plant at Abqaiq in February 2006 .
" The United States and Saudi Arabia have agreed to cooperate in safeguarding the kingdom 's energy resources by protecting key infrastructure , enhancing Saudi border security , and meeting Saudi Arabia 's expanding energy needs in an environmentally responsible manner , " a White House statement said .
The two countries will also sign a memorandum of understanding to cooperate on a peaceful nuclear programme
Where it can work
This design can extract water from water - logged soil , or from salt water , but does not need a body of water such as a stream or lake .
Advantages · Produces pure , distilled water from ground water , even if the source is contaminated with inorganic materials such as salt · Pumps water to the surface ( through capillary action ) and distils it at the same time · Can be made locally with recycled or inexpensive materials ·
Can be made in any size and shape ·
Has a low environmental impact ·
Has no moving parts
Current limitations ·
The still / pump needs strong sun and temperatures above freezing ·
The still / pump operates slowly : at the rate of insolation in equatorial countries , and at 50 % efficiency , the pump should provide 2 - 3 litres of distilled water per m2 per day ·
The evaporating section will need to be cleaned or replaced as mineral salts are deposited there by the evaporating water
Safety precautions ·
Since the wicking material contains water with impurities and possibly pathogens , the construction method must ensure that the wick material , or contaminants that may fall from the material , cannot come into contact with the condensed fresh water ·
This design will not purify water that is contaminated with volatile organic compounds , which can evaporate and condense in the fresh water ·
The materials that come into contact with the fresh water must be non-toxic
What makes the pump work well
The evaporating section ( the “ leaf ” ) should be as large as possible in proportion to the condensing section .
This helps by : · giving the largest possible area for evaporation · causing the highest possible temperature difference between the housing and the surrounding air ; the greater this temperature difference , the faster the water will condense on the inside of the housing
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Federal Reserve unanimously approved new mortgage lending rules Monday in a crackdown on shady practices - particularly those involving subprime loans made to borrowers with weak credit .
The agency made several substantial revisions to the proposed regulations it unveiled in December .
Many of the changes acknowledged consumer advocates ' concerns that the rules still contained too many loopholes that would allow shady lending practices to continue .
But the Fed also made some concessions to industry executives , who feared increasing oversight would lead to less lending .
The new rules will apply to all mortgage lenders , not just those supervised and examined by the Fed .
All but one requirement will take effect Oct. 1 , 2009 .
However , board members said they will continue to work on further oversight of the mortgage industry .
" The proposed final rules are intended to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive acts and practices in mortgage lending , while keeping credit available to qualified borrowers and supporting sustainable homeownership , " said Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke .
" Besides offering broader protection for consumers , a uniform set of rules will level the playing field for lenders and increase competition in the mortgage market , to the ultimate benefit of borrowers . "
The proposals wo n't help the millions of homeowners who 've already fallen behind in their mortgages , but the Fed is aiming to prevent another such crisis by tightening lending standards , particularly for subprime mortgages .
Many critics have charged that under former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan , there were few restraints during the real estate boom .
They say the agency should have flexed its muscles several years ago , clamping down on unscrupulous lenders and protecting borrowers .
Consumer advocates said they were pleased with the changes , but stressed that the Fed 's action is just one in a series of steps needed to better protect borrowers from shady lenders .
Industry executives , meanwhile , applauded the Fed for attempting to protect consumers while keeping in mind the need for low - cost mortgage loans .
The rules
The new rules governing " higher - priced , " or subprime , loans will :
Prohibit creditors from extending credit without regard to a consumer 's ability to repay the loan from income and assets other than the home 's value .
The lender complies , in part , by assessing repayment ability based on the highest scheduled payment in the first seven years of the loan .
Require creditors to verify income and assets they rely upon to determine repayment ability
Ban any prepayment penalty if the payment can change in the initial four years .
For other higher - priced loans , a prepayment penalty period cannot last for more than two years .
Require creditors to establish escrow account for property taxes and homeowner 's insurance .
This rule will be phased in during 2010 .
The Fed changed the definition of higher - priced loans to first mortgages with rates at least 1.5 percentage points above the average mortgage rate published by Freddie Mac .
Also , second mortgages with rates at least 3.5 percentage points above the Freddie Mac rate will fall into this category .
With this change , the Fed is hoping to address industry complaints that the previous definition would capture non-subprime loans as well .
Additional rules will apply to all mortgages , regardless of rate .
Creditors and mortgage brokers cannot coerce a real estate appraiser to misstate a home 's value .
Companies that service mortgage loans are prohibited from engaging in certain practices , such as pyramiding late fees .
Also , they must credit consumers ' loan payments as of the date of receipt and provide a payoff statement within a reasonable time of request .
Creditors must provide a good faith estimate of the loan costs , including a schedule of payments , within three days after a consumer applies for any mortgage loan , including home improvement loans or refinancings .
Currently , these estimates are only required for home - purchase loans .
Consumers cannot be charged any fee until after they receive the early disclosures , except a reasonable fee for obtaining the consumer 's credit history .
In advertisements , companies must include additional information about rates , monthly payments and loan features .
The rule also bans seven deceptive practices , such as saying a rate is fixed when it can change .
In a nod to the brokerage industry , the Fed withdrew a proposal requiring additional disclosure of the " yield - spread premium , " which allows banks to pay brokers for steering homeowners into higher - priced loans .
After testing consumers , the agency found that the rule would likely not be effective .
But the Fed said it would continue reviewing the issue .
Advocates for consumers and industry generally pleased
Both consumer advocates and industry executives put a full - court press on the Fed in recent months , trying to get the agency to revise its proposed rules .
More than 4,500 comments were filed since the agency announced its plan in late December .
After reviewing the final rules , advocates said they felt the changes did provide additional protections for the consumers .
In particular , it 's important that the Fed eliminated the requirement that borrowers prove lenders engaged in a " pattern or practice " of originating unaffordable loans since that 's very hard to do , said Brenda Muniz , legislative director of Acorn , a housing advocacy group .
Still , the Fed could have done better by completely banning prepayment penalties , as several states have done , said Deborah Goldstein , executive vice president of the Center for Responsible Lending , a consumer rights organization .
She noted that people in subprime fixed - rate loans are still subject to hefty fees if they try to refinance their loans within two years .
Also , some advocates wondered why the rules wo n't take effect for 15 months , and why subprime borrowers can opt out of escrowing their property taxes and homeowner 's insurance after the first year .
" It 's the first step toward better protecting consumers in the mortgage market , but not the last step , " said Jim Carr , chief operating officer of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition , an advocacy group .
Industry executives , meanwhile , endorsed the changes overall , but said there still may be some areas of concern in the 419 - page document .
For instance , the Mortgage Bankers Association said it plans to ask its members about the elimination of the " pattern or practice " rule .
Still , the new rules will help consumers , without placing such a burden on lenders that they will have to curtail credit , industry insiders said .
" This is just the right amount of regulation , " said Marc Savitt , president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers .

COSTA MESA , California ( Reuters ) - Only World War III would prompt Republican presidential candidate John McCain to bring back the military draft , McCain said on Tuesday .
Many Americans are fearful the U.S. government will be forced to reinstitute the draft given the prolonged Iraq and Afghanistan wars .
Asked about that possibility by a potential voter in Florida during a telephone “ town hall meeting , ” McCain said : “ I do n’t know what would make a draft happen unless we were in an all - out World War III . ”
The United States ended its last military draft in 1973 in the waning years of the Vietnam war , moving to an all - volunteer military force .
McCain , a Vietnam veteran , said the draft during that conflict weighed most heavily on lower - income Americans , and that this should not be repeated .
“ I do not believe the draft is even practicable or desirable , ” McCain said .
( Reporting by Steve Holland , editing by Todd Eastham )
I finished my first lisp macro , and I want to tell the world .
I ’ll talk about what a lisp macro is , and what makes it unique in the world of programming , how it ’s a technique only possible in lisp .
I ’ll then take you through an example .
So firstly , what ’s a lisp macro , and why would you want to write one ?
So , you may have seen lisp programs before , and you ’ll recognise them instantly — Larry Wall , the inventor of [ Perl ] [ ] , said they had all the aesthetic appeal of a bowl of porridge mixed with toenail clippings ;
( defun accumulate ( combiner lst initial )
( let ( ( accum initial ) )
( dolist ( i lst )
( setf accum ( funcall combiner accum i ) ) )
accum ) )
He has a point .
They are butt - ugly .
But hell , the best he came up with is [ Perl ] [ ] , so he can `$ _@ ++` right off .
( I ’m pretty sure that ’s valid Perl , too 😉 )
It ’s ugly , in an aesthetic way , but it ’s amazingly practical .
It ’s got an engineering beauty to it .
If you look at that snippet above , you ’ll notice that the whole program is made out of exactly three types of symbols ;
* open parenthesis : `(`
* close parenthesis : ` ) `
* symbols , like `defun` , `accum` and `setf`
All simple lisp programs are like this .
Just brackets to group stuff together , and stuff that needs grouping .
Compare that with C# , where you might find ;
* parenthesis for ;
* function calls ; `print ( “ hello ” ) `
* special forms ; `using ( OdbcConnection con = … ) `
* semi-colon to end statements ; `int x = 1 ;
`
* curly brackets for ;
* code blocks ; `{ /* code block */ }`
* array initialisers ; `string [ ] words = { “ hello ” , “ world ” };`
* square brackets for array indexing ; ` x [ 3 ] = 4 ` ;
and the list goes on .
I gave up because there are too many to list .
So lisp has this seriously small syntactic footprint .
You can have a thing , or a group of things in brackets .
It ’s simple .
It ’s * so * simple that you can start doing crazy stuff in lisp that you just ca n’t do otherwise .
That crazy stuff goes by the name of macros .
I can write a program that takes a chunk of lisp ( remember , just a thing or a list of things ) , cuts it up , and reassembles it .
That creates new lisp code .
So imagine you do a lot of work on three - dimensional arrays .
You find yourself , over and over , writing nested loops that say ;
for x in range ( 100 ) :
for y in range ( 100 ) :
for z in range ( 100 ) :
# do something to matrix[x , y , z ]
And frankly , you ’re bored of typing it over and over .
What you really want to do is something like ;
for {x 100 , y 100 , z 100} :
# do something to matrix[x , y , z ]
You want a brand new bit of syntax for multiple - value looping .
Can you add it to python ?
Nope. C? Nope. Java ?
Nope .
But now look at the lisp version ;
I could , theoretically , write this
( domanytimes ( x 100 y 100 z 100 )
body )
and , because it ’s just a list of stuff , I can chop and change that into this new bit of lisp ;
( dotimes ( x 100 )
( dotimes ( y 100 )
( dotimes ( z 100 )
body ) ) )
I ’ll show you how in a second , but notice what ’s possible — I can write my own looping construct ( `domanytimes` ) and lisp will rewrite it into many simpler looping construct ( the built - in `dotimes` ) .
Is that particularly special ?
Well , yeah .
I ’ve written new syntax .
I ’ve defined a new way of looping that is no different from the standard loops .
I ’ve basically added something new to the language .
Lisp is now better at dealing with multi-dimensional loops .
Try adding a new loop to ruby , or javascript .
Make python understand
for x in range ( 100 ) , y in range ( 100 ) , z in range ( 100 ) :
# body here
and you ’ll find you can’t .
So I ’ve made my version of lisp a bit better at handling loops .
If I were writing database code , I could make lisp better at writing SQL statements or data access layers .
C# recently got built - in DAL logic with [ LINQ ] [ ] , and it ’s great , but only the C# team can write it .
Whereas a lisper could write this sort of code ;
( sql- select ( ID NAME ) from PROJECT where ( DUEDATE > TODAY ) )
and it ’s do basically the same thing as [ LINQ ] [ ] .
So that ’s the why ’s and wherefores .
Here ’s the how of the `domanytimes` macro .
`domanytimes` takes two parts ; the loop variables `(x 100 y 100 z 100 ) ` and whatever body you want to execute .
We ’re going to write a program that skims two elements from the front of the loop variables ( say , `x` and ` 100` ) and uses them to write a built - in `dotimes` loop ; so a program which converts
( domanytimes ( x 100 y 100 ) body )
into
( dotimes ( x 100 )
( domanytimes ( y 100 ) body ) )
and then again to give you
( dotimes ( x 100 )
( dotimes ( y 100 )
body ) )
Here ’s the `domanytimes` macro , in all it ’s eye - bleeding horror ;
( defmacro domanytimes ( loop - list &body body )
“ allows you to write ( domanytimes ( x 10 y 10 ) …)
instead of ( dotimes ( x 10 ) ( dotimes ( y 10 ) ) body ) ) ”
( if ( eq ( length loop - list ) 0 )
; ; we have our form to execute
`( progn , @body )
; ; we have more loops to arrange
( let ( ( fst ( car loop - list ) )
( snd ( cadr loop - list ) )
( rst ( cddr loop - list ) ) )
`( dotimes ( , fst , snd )
( domanytimes , rst , @body ) ) ) ) )
There .
Was n’t that fun ? 😉
It looks nasty , I know .
All lisp looks nasty .
But it ’s actually created something new in the language .
As far as I understand it , lisp has survived for fifty years basically because the macro system lets you write macros which can add any new kind of syntax you like .
You can write knock up a set of macros to [ implement OO ] [ clos ] , and suddenly lisp is OO .
You can know up macros for manipulating lazy lists , and suddenly lisp has a [ lazy evaluation ] [ lazy ] .
You can knock up data access layer macros , and it ’s got a version of [ LINQ ] [ linq ] .
There seems to be nothing you ca n’t hack lisp into being .
And if you want to know how the hell that works , I ’d recommend [ Practical Common Lisp ] [ pcl ] , which is online and free .

There 's a huge security problem in the latest iPhone 2.0.2 : if you have your JesusPhone password protected , using a very simple trick gives anyone full access to your cellphone private information in Mail , SMS , Contacts , and even Safari .
Advertisement
The two - step trick is even simpler to the one used in the past to gain access to the phone to install unlocking cards or jailbreak .
Fortunately , there 's a way to avoid this obvious security breach until Apple fixes it .
Advertisement
First , password protect your phone and lock it .
Then slide to unlock and do this :
1. Tap emergency call .
2. Double tap the home button .
Done .
You are now in your favorites .
This seems like a feature , because you may want to have emergency number in your favorites for quick dial .
The security problem here is double .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
The first : anyone picking up your phone can make a call to anyone in your favorites .
On top of that , this also opens access to your full Address Book , the dial keypad , and your voice mail .
If that was n't bad enough , the second one is even worse : if you tap on the blue arrows next to the names , it will give you full access to the private information in a favorite entry .
Advertisement
And it goes downhill from there :
• If you click in a mail address , it will give you full access to the Mail application .
All your mail will be exposed .
Advertisement
• If there 's a URL in your contact ( or in a mail message ) you can click on it and have full access to Safari .
• If you click on send text message in a contact , it will give you full access to all your SMS .
Hopefully , this major security break that fully exposes your most private information will be solved as soon as possible .
Advertisement
Until then , you can avoid any potential breach doing the following :
1 . In the iPhone home , go to Settings .
2. Click on General .
3. Click on Home Button .
4. Click on either " Home " or " iPod " .
This way , the double - click on the home button will take the user back to the unlock screen ( if you use " Home " ) or the iPod screen .
I recommend using Home .
Advertisement
You will lose the ability to quickly access your favorites for a quick call - which is one of my favorite features - but that 's better than having all your private mails , contacts , and SMS database compromised .
UPDATE : Evidently Apple has a fix coming in their next firmware update , but we 've got no word on when that release is planned .

Marine Sgt. Ryan Weemer ( pictured ) was ordered today to a court martial for allegedly killing Iraqi prisoners during a battle in Fallouja in late 2004 .
Lt. Gen. Samuel Helland , commanding general of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force , made his decision based on evidence uncovered by Naval Criminal Investigative Service agents and during a preliminary hearing .
Weemer , 25 , is charged with unpremeditated murder and dereliction duty .
He allegedly killed prisoners rather than process them according to the laws of war .
During his preliminary hearing , prosecutors played a tape recording in which a co-defendant , Sgt. Jermaine Nelson , confessed that he , Weemer and Sgt. Jose Nazario killed the prisoners .
Nazario , no longer in the Marine Corps , faces charges in federal court in Riverside .

The concept of ‘ the simple life ’ means different things to different people .
In my mind , simple living equates to capitalizing on the fundamentals that truly make you happy and purging the needless remainders .
It ’s the notion of creating tranquility in your life by eliminating various roadblocks of clutter so you can concentrate your time and attention on the people and effects that matter most .
Alas , the actual process of ‘ simplifying ’ is not easy .
It ’s an ongoing voyage of self - control , a voyage where only your most valued possessions are brought along .
If you ’re interested in simplifying your life , each of these 30 articles is an absolute must - read .
They ’re short , yet packed to the brim with priceless advice .

The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary

The Iraqi armed services are likely to target widely - hated American security contractors when they lose their immunity to Iraqi law under a new agreement between the US and the Iraq .
The main American concession , during prolonged and rancorous negotiations over a Status of Forces Agreement ( Sofa ) that would determine the future military relationship between the US and Iraq , has been to agree to lift the immunity hitherto enjoyed by the 154,000 contractors , of whom 35,000 are private security men .
" The Iraqi forces will follow them with vigour because they are not popular in Iraq , " said Ahmed Chalabi , the veteran Iraqi politician , in an interview with The Independent .
" People have n't forgotten about the Iraqis who were killed by private security men in Nisour Square . "
Security personnel from Blackwater USA are accused of killing 17 Iraqi civilians , including a mother and child , when they opened fire in the square in west Baghdad on 16 September last year .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The ending of immunity will have serious consequences for the 142,000 US troops in Iraq , who are highly reliant on contractors .
Mr Chalabi says it is likely that the Iraqi security forces and judiciary will go out of their way to arrest foreign security men who break Iraqi law , which they have so far flouted .
He also said that the loss of immunity of American contractors would make US intelligence operations more difficult because private companies have been used to maintain links with opponents of the Iranian regime based in Iraq , notably the Mojahedin-e Khalq .
This enables the US government to deny that it has contacts with such groups .
Mr Chalabi , who recently returned from Iran where he had talks with Iranian leaders , said : " The Iranians are implacably opposed to the deal .
It consecrates America 's massive presence here and threatens their security .
They say this will be a ' non-security agreement ' and ' not a security agreement ' and they are happy for everybody to know it . "
Iranian hostility would be serious for Iraq since Iran played a central role in mediating an end to fighting between the Mehdi Army Shia militia and the government earlier this year .
In an unexpected but important development , the negotiation of a US - Iraqi agreement , to replace the current UN mandate for US forces that is due to run out at the end of the year , is leading to a resurgence of Iraqi nationalism previously masked by Shia - Sunni sectarian conflict .
The Iraqi Prime Minister , Nouri al - Maliki , embarrassed the White House by saying on Monday that Iraq wants some kind of timetable for a withdrawal of American forces included in the present agreement .
The national security adviser Mowaffak al - Rubaie followed this up by saying : " We would not accept any memorandum of understanding with [ the US ] side that has no obvious and specific dates for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq . "
American officials have tried to present these demands as conditional on the effectiveness of the Iraqi security forces , which now number over half a million men .
An Iraqi official supporting a US - Iraq agreement said : " It will be easier to sell it to Iraqis if it is presented as a way of getting the Americans to withdraw .
We still need them .
We could not cope if , hypothetically , there was an uprising in Basra , an army mutiny in Anbar or the Kurds unilaterally annexed Kirkuk . "
But important Iraqi leaders have sought to outbid each other in criticising American rights under Sofa , while Iraqi supporters of the agreement have been largely mute .
This suggests that the position of the Republican presidential candidate John McCain , that the US occupation should continue for many years , will soon no longer be tenable .
" We should negotiate with the next administration , " said Dr Mahmoud Othman , the veteran Kurdish politician and MP .
" A letter of understanding will be sufficient for now .
If the agreement does not bind the next administration , why sign it ?
People will think it is being done to help the Republican party . "
Defenders of Sofa , such as the Foreign Minister , Hoshyar Zebari , say the agreement will limit and define American rights in Iraq .
The alternative is the UN mandate , under which US forces can do what they want .
The negotiations have provoked a nationalist backlash among Arab Iraqis because they highlight the extent to which America will control their country in future .

Zero was a concept record about a dystopian future in which George W. Bush declares himself dictator for life , drugs the American water supply , and wages war on subversives ( industrial musicians are too subversives ! ) .
Its accompanying viral - marketing campaign was spooky , complex , and reasonably well thought out ( read more here ) , though who knows if it can actually sustain its own TV show .
Quentin Tarantino partner Lawrence Bender is producing , so maybe this thing really does have some potential .
Here ’s hoping HBO passes so AMC can pick it up and turn it into the next Greatest Show of All Time .

Have you ever thought rush hour on the 405 Freeway might be more bearable if you could check your e-mail , shop for a book on Amazon , place some bids on EBay and maybe even , if nobody is looking , download a little porn ?
Then perhaps you should be driving a Chrysler .
The nation ’s third - largest automaker is set to announce Thursday that it ’s making wireless Internet an option on all its 2009 models .
The mobile hotspot , called UConnect Web , would be the first such technology from any automaker .
Struggling Chrysler is hoping that providing motorists access to the information superhighway will set it apart from competitors and help reverse a dismal year ; through May , sales are down 19.3 % compared with 2007 , the worst drop - off in the industry .
FOR THE RECORD :
An article in Wednesday ’s Section A about Chrysler offering wireless Internet connections in new cars said users of a device by Autonet Mobile get download speeds of 600 to 800 megabits per second .
In fact , the speeds are 600 to 800 kilobits per second , which is about 1,000 times slower .
“ It ’s a notion of always wanting to be connected wherever you are , ” said Scott Slagle , Chrysler ’s senior manager of global marketing strategy , who has been testing the technology since last week , allowing his daughters to surf the Web from the back seat .
“ There ’s a demand for that . ”
Coincidentally , Wi-Fi on wheels is being unveiled just days before new hands - free legislation goes into effect July 1 in California and Washington state .
Those laws , designed to reduce accidents caused by driver distraction , prohibit talking on a cellular phone without a headset or other hands - free device .
Perhaps not surprisingly , safety advocates were less than overwhelmed by Chrysler ’s innovation .
“ Surfing the Web is something people really do n’t have any business doing while they drive , ” said Jonathan Adkins , spokesman for the Governors Highway Safety Assn .
“ It ’s definitely a distraction . ”
His and other safety groups say the only way to drive safely is without using any electronic devices , headset or no .
Chrysler says that when the car is in motion , the service is intended to be used only by passengers .
The privately held company acknowledges , however , that there is no way to prevent a driver from steering with one hand and Web surfing with the other .
“ We ’re relying on the responsibility of the consumer to follow appropriate legislation , ” said Keefe Leung , Chrysler ’s engineer for the product .
In that case , Californians tempted to Google and drive can breathe a big sigh of relief :
The new laws do n’t proscribe use of computers or the Web , except for drivers under 18 years old .
There is a different law on the books preventing the use of television screens or video screens farther forward than the rear of the front seats , but it ’s unclear whether that measure applies to computers browsing the Internet .
State Sen. Joe Simitian ( D - Palo Alto ) , who authored the California laws , is trying to clarify that situation .
He ’s introduced legislation prohibiting drivers from using any “ mobile service device ” ( including computers ) or text - messaging while driving .
“ It ’s great to see technology advance , ” Simitian said .
“ But this raises a lot of concerns . ”
In Chrysler ’s defense , it ’s not the first company to offer Internet access in cars .
Avis Rent A Car introduced Avis Connect in January 2007 .
Like UConnect Web , Avis Connect ( which costs $ 10.95 a day ) operates on the 3G network using a cellular - based signal .
The device used by Avis is also available through its manufacturer , Autonet Mobile , for $ 595 plus a $ 39 monthly subscription rate .
Users get download speeds of 600 megabits to 800 megabits per second .
Avis spokesman John Barrows said the device , which is portable , is fairly popular but not in as much demand as GPS units .
“ We emphasize that this is not for use by the driver while operating the vehicle , ” Barrows said .
Chrysler will formally roll out the technology Thursday at an event in Detroit spotlighting its 2009 lineup , which will appear in showrooms in September .
The automaker did not disclose pricing , but said there would probably be a base charge for the option , plus a monthly or annual fee .
UConnect Web is an extension of the company ’s UConnect system , which provides Bluetooth connectivity for cellphones and MP3 player integration with the car stereo .
Rival Ford provides similar services , but without Web access , in its popular Sync system .
With the added Internet connectivity , drivers and passengers will be able to get such devices as laptop computers and Nintendo Wii consoles online .
As to what users can download while in the car , Chrysler ’s Leung said anything was fair game .
“ There are no limitations in content , ” he said .

Among the wrong kind of white people , there are few more hated than the wigger or whitethug .
Though it is very acceptable and common for the right kind of white people to dress and act as though they were Japanese , Chinese , or European , it is completely unacceptable for them to act like rappers .
This distaste caused a dilemma for white people who had to show both that they loved hip hop but also that they were aware they were white .
The brilliant solution they came up with was to appropriate hip hop words and mannerisms and filter them through a white appropriateness system .
For example , white people find it particularly hilarious to take slang and enunciate every word perfectly .
“ Homey , that bernaise sauce you made is wack .
Do you know what I am saying ?
For Real . ”
“ Well , I used a different type of butter .
I switched the style up , so let the haters hate and I ’ll watch the deliciousness pile up . ”
Since the above exchange involves people who are very aware of their whiteness it is hilarious , but if it were to be said by wiggers , it would be tragic .
The difference is subtle but essential .
This is also an excellent way to make white people like you .
If you can recite rap lyrics with perfect enunciation , they will always find it funny .
As a rule of thumb , the more popular the rapper , the funnier it gets .
Best options : 50 Cent , Tupac , Biggie Smalls , or Jay Z. Note : avoid Kanye
West as the irony of reciting his lyrics with perfect English is not as great .
In terms of physical actions , there are few things white people enjoy more than throwing up fake gang signs in photos .
Again , the same rules apply : if it is done by wiggers it is tragic , if it ’s done by the right kind of white people , it ’s hilarious .
It ’s not a good idea to mention how these signs have often resulted in awful , senseless deaths – that will ruin the joke .
In both cases , the actions are done in hopes that a white person will be recognized as “ one of the good ones , ” who love hip hop , but do n’t try to appropriate it in any non-hilarious ways .
In both cases , your best response is to say “ did you go to the last Dead Prez / Roots / Mos Def / Twaleb Kwali / Michael Franti concert ?
It was incredible .
I smoked weed and kept this one finger up for almost an hour ! ”
Though this information has very little use in and of itself , it could be the final piece in the puzzle of cementing your white friendship .
At the very least , it is a guaranteed way to help your progress .

On a ragged outcrop just a short walk from a Grand Canyon overlook where millions of visitors annually come to gawk at one of the world ’s most stunning vistas sits the old Orphan uranium mine .
Soil radiation levels around it are 450 times higher than normal .
It ’s encircled by a protective fence .
A sign warns : “ Remain behind fence – environmental evaluation in progress . ”
In the canyon hundreds of feet below , another sign by gurgling Horn Creek instructs thirsty hikers not to drink its radioactive water .
Even so , Horn Creek eventually splashes its way to the canyon bottom and into the Colorado River , a vital water source for 25 million people from Las Vegas to Los Angeles to San Diego .
In that mighty river , the Orphan ’s radioactive dribble is diluted to insignificance .
But what if a dozen or even scores of new uranium mines were leaching uranium radioisotopes into this critical water source ?
That is what Arizona ’s governor , water authorities in two states , scientists , environmentalists , and Congress are all worried about .
Should they be ?
Everybody from mining - industry officials to environmentalists agrees that the Orphan mine is a poster child for the bad old days of uranium mining going back to the 1950s .
Today ’s regulations and newer mining techniques make such pollution far less likely , industry officials say , though environmentalists vehemently disagree .
The question remains :
Is Orphan only a vision of the past – or is it a vision of the future , too ?
The US Southwest may be about to find out .
Driven by soaring uranium prices and fresh interest in nuclear power , mining companies have staked more than 10,600 exploratory mineral claims – most of them smaller than five acres – spread across 1 million acres of federal land adjacent to the Colorado River and Grand Canyon National Park , a federal official told Congress in June .
Most are uranium claims , though some may be for other metals , observers say .
Such numbers and testimony about pollution have begun to move Congress .
Following congressional hearings , the House Natural Resources Committee in late June declared an emergency withdrawal of 1 million acres from any mining claims .
The federal land in question is on the north and south rims of the Grand Canyon , just outside the national park , through which the Colorado River flows .
While a federal lawsuit and injunction have temporarily stalled uranium development in the national forest on the south rim , Congress ’s action is being resisted by the Bush administration on the north rim .
There , lands controlled by the Bureau of Land Management are unaffected by the lawsuit to the south and exploration claims are still being processed routinely .
One such claim , by Quaterra Alaska Inc. , the US subsidiary of Vancouver - based Quaterra Resources , Inc. , was approved for exploratory drilling on June 27 – just two days after the House ’s Natural Resources Committee vote that should have stopped such action .
A Department of Interior spokesman says the BLM is still processing claims because the agency does n’t consider the Congressional vote valid .
In a July letter it argued that the committee did n’t have a quorum , a point disputed by the committee ’s chairman and the House parliamentarian .
Mining regulations are tougher now
“ They are charging forward , ” says Taylor McKinnon , public lands director for the Center for Biological Diversity , an environmental group based in Tucson , Ariz .
Last month , the US Department of Energy approved 42 square miles for an expanded uranium mining program in the watershed of the Dolores River , a tributary of the Colorado .
But the question of what impact dozens of new uranium mines across the entire Colorado River watershed might have – an environmental disaster or an energy bonanza with few ill effects – remains hotly debated .
“ Old mines like the Orphan were mined in the 1950s under no federal regulations whatsoever , ” says Eugene Spiering , vice president of exploration for Quaterra .
“ Most mines today are above the water table , which makes chances of leakage practically nil .
What we have now is a well - regulated industry . ”
Still , there has been no regionwide environmental assessment of the likely impact of a new uranium mining boom on the Colorado River , close observers say .
Nor is such an evaluation apparently of much interest to federal land managers , if comments on the subject by a Department of Interior spokesman are any guide .
“ We already have the Clean Water Act , the National Environmental Policy Act , and others that require comprehensive analyses before any mining is done , so there wo n’t be impacts to the environment , ” says Chris Paolino , a spokesman for the Department of Interior .
“ At this time we ’re still evaluating plans on an individual basis , but [ a regional study is ] not something I can rule out . ”
“ We hear from the industry and federal government that today ‘ we can do it safely , ’ ” says Roger Clark , air and energy director for the Grand Canyon Trust , an environmental watchdog group .
“ But the burden of proof is on the proponents .
Somebody needs to ask , ‘ What is the cumulative threat to drinking water in the Colorado River – not just from radioactivity , but from arsenic and mercury from these mines ? ’ ”
Some are asking for exactly such a study .
With cities like Phoenix relying on clean Colorado River water , Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano ( D ) is calling for an “ overall environmental im­­pact analysis , ” citing the uranium boom ’s “ potential to seriously harm ” the water quality of Grand Canyon National Park and the Lower Colorado River .
Uranium company officials say fears about radioactive contamination are overblown .
New mining methods , far tougher environmental standards , and desert - dry conditions for most mines mean minimal risk to the Colorado River and the region ’s precious groundwater resources , they say .
“ Yes , there were issues in the past , ” says Ron Hochstein , president of Denison Mines , a Toronto - based company with at least nine mines under development in the area targeted by Congress .
“ But that ’s not the way we do things today .
We understand and know a lot more about uranium , radium , and radon and the impacts of those .
So to say some things that happened in the 1950s and 1960s will happen again today is not a good comparison . ”
Proven deposits are likely to be mined
Whether or not the thousands of unproven claims are ever developed , a fair number of uranium mining sites seem almost certain to reemerge .
“ Congress ’s action only applies to unproven claims , ” Mr. Clark points out , leaning against a fence at the Canyon Mine site .
Denison ’s group of established mine sites – including the Canyon Mine in the Kaibab National Forest a few miles south of the park – are among those likely to reemerge .
The Canyon Mine was mothballed in the 1980s – before it had even opened – because of sinking uranium prices .
It is a proven site : Uranium is there .
Denison must still apply for new state environmental permits in order to proceed , but expects its mines to begin opening around 2010 .
Despite Horn Creek pollution , the good news is that recent studies have shown that most springs and creeks in the Grand Canyon still have good water quality : Uranium and other trace metals appear in low concentrations , according to congressional testimony .
The bad news , experts say , is that digging into the cylindrical vertical rock formations in which uranium is found – they ’re called “ breccia pipes ” – can “ mobilize ” the uranium , causing it to oxidize when water from periodic downpours seeps down through the rock strata .
Indeed , the negative impact of water on uranium mines should not be minimized even in the desert , says Chris Shuey , a scientist who directs the Uranium Impact Assessment Program , a nonprofit research and information center .
His research in the Churchrock area of the Navajo Nation near Gallup , N.M. – where uranium was mined and processed between 1952 and 1983 – showed statistically significant effects on human health from the elevated levels of radioactivity in the region .
While much uranium in the region does occur in formations above the water table , the bottom of the breccia pipes are located in the upper portion of the Redwall Limestone , a principal aquifer supplying springs in the Grand Canyon and wells for much of the region , Dr. Shuey told Congress in March .
“ When you take uranium and the other trace elements out of their resting places in nature and expose them to the environment , ” Shuey says by phone , “ you expose them in higher concentrations to the environment and intensify their effects .
People do n’t appreciate the cumulative impact of mining in a consolidated area .
There ’s a very real threat . ”
A flash flood swept through Havasu Creek last week .
That same watershed includes the Canyon Mine and numerous uranium claims .
Abe Springer , a hydrologist and researcher at Northern Arizona University at Flagstaff , has made a career studying the movement of groundwater through the Redwall and other aquifers into seeps and springs that supply not only hikers , but also most of the region ’s animal life with the water they need to survive .
“ Once these elements became mobile through mining activities , ” Dr. Springer told Congress in his March testimony , “ they would continue to be mobile through the aquifer and eventually discharge in springs impacting the human uses of water of these springs . ”
Even so , some industry figures dispute any connection between the Orphan uranium mine and higher radiation in Horn Creek .
A “ fact sheet ” e-mailed by Quaterra ’s Mr. Spiering says , regarding water pollution , that “ statements that the historic operations at the Orphan Mine have been polluting Horn Creek are false . ”
It cites a 2004 US Geological Survey study showing dissolved uranium in a range from 8.6 to 29 parts per billion and “ within the EPA levels of safe drinking water . ”
Closer look at USGS study
But a closer examination of the 2004 results finds that some uranium concentrations are at the upper end of the safe range for Horn Creek .
The same study ’s results for nearby Salt Creek ( at 29 to 31 p.p.b. ) “ approached or exceeded the US Environmental Protection Agency ’s drinking water standard ” of 30 p.p.b. , according to Shuey ’s testimony to Congress .
The two creeks – Salt and Horn – also had by far the highest levels of the 20 springs and seeps tested in that study , Shuey testified .
That USGS study also did not seek to assign causes of the higher radiation levels , he noted .
But the potential impact of tainted groundwater on native Americans , hikers , and local wildlife – as well as major cities downstream – are all reasons Rep. Rául Grijalva ( D ) of Arizona has sponsored legislation to permanently withdraw federal land around Grand Canyon National Park from uranium mining .
“ I hope we ’ve matured enough not to forget history , ” Representative Grijalva says in a phone interview .
“ Protection of water quality in the Colorado River is vital to the long - term health and safety of humans and other species .
We ca n’t afford to simply issue permits and decades from now simply dismiss the consequences as unintended .
“ We should know better than that . ”
Amazon has decided to relocate its customer service centre to Cork in a bid to take advantage of stronger language skills in Ireland .
The workforce in perennial joke - butt Slough does n't have the necessary polyglotism required to deal with calls from all over Europe , it says .
Headquarters will stay in Slough , but 90 call centre and support staff face relocation .
Combined with expansion , the move will create up to 450 jobs on Cork 's Airport industrial estate .
European customer services chief Jim Adkins offered the FT a banal explanation for getting the movers in : " As our business has grown , and as we have expanded the categories of products we offer , we need to expand our customer service support as well . "
A dearth of French and German speakers is behind the shift to Cork .
A 2005 European Commission poll revealed the UK lags behind its near neighbour in language skills , with just 30 per cent of the population able to converse in a second tongue , to the Irish 's 41 per cent .
The news can only make things worse for Slough - long regarded as Britain 's most depressing place to live and visit .
The BBC recently took pity on the wretched setting for The Office by sending a team of " happiness experts " to cheer the place up in its series " Making Slough Happy " .
For the uninitiated , John Betjemen 's poem " Slough " sums up the ambient despair rather eloquently . ®
